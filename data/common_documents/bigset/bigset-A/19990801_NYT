ARIZONA ASPENS DISAPPEARING FROM MAJESTIC LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ They call them the ``mothers of the
forest,'' &UR; the tall, distinctively white-barked trees with round
leaves like little sails that tremble in the slightest breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Groves of quaking aspens attract thousands of tourists to the
San Francisco Peaks area in the late summer and early fall as their
leaves turn from green to iridescent gold before fluttering to the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful sight, acknowledges Jim Rolf, an aspen expert and
ranger for the Coconino National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   But, he warns, ``enjoy them while you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspens are disappearing at an alarming rate from the forests of
Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A Forest Service study earlier this decade said the number of
acres of aspens in the two states had declined to 263,000 in 1986
from 486,000 in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Another study about the shrinking numbers of aspens is due out
next year, said Marlin Johnson, assistant regional director for
forestry in Albuquerque. Initial estimates indicate that the number
of acres has fallen to 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The glorious aspen is being attacked on many fronts, Johnson and
Rolf say.
</P>
<P>
   Thick, expansive stands of conifers, particularly ponderosa
pines, are crowding aspens into ever-smaller groves, the young
pines using the shade of the aspens as a growth supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The once-destructive wildfires in the Southwest, which opened
large blocks of land and aided aspen regeneration by heating the
soil, are regularly put out after burning fewer and fewer acres.
</P>
<P>
   Even the idea of thinning the numerous thickets in the pine
forests to spur more aspen growth hasn't materialized. Many of the
prime aspen groves are in areas where the federally protected
Mexican spotted owl needs the thick conifer canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Those aspen saplings that do break through the forest floor are
being nibbled to the ground by large herds of elk and deer, which,
Rolf said, consider the aspen areas as ``a daily trip to the salad
bar.''
</P>
<P>
   And, even though winds can blow aspen seeds as far as a
half-mile away, they seldom take root in the Southwestern forests
because of the need for open space and constant moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf has a daily reminder of the problems around Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   High on the wall of his office at the Peaks Ranger Station north
of Flagstaff is a grainy, 1910 photo of Hart Prairie, the most
popular area near the peaks for those wanting to see the fall
change of colors.
</P>
<P>
   In that photo, two large groves of aspens are divided by a
meadow with high grass.
</P>
<P>
   Below that is a photo of the same site 75 years later. It's now
a pure thicket of ponderosa pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty percent of our acreage once dominated by aspen is now
dominated by pine and Doug(las) fir,'' Rolf said. ``If this trend
is allowed to continue for the next 50 to 75 years, the remaining
aspens are going to be too old to regenerate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coconino Forest has been doing what it can, with limited
resources, to try to retain its most prized aspen groves.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have constructed 20 miles of fence, 7 feet high and at
$6,000 per mile, around more than 400 acres of aspen in the
Flagstaff area, designed to keep big game away. &UR; In the
Apache-Sitgreaves forests of eastern Arizona, only about 100 acres
of aspens are fenced.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf said that Coconino Forest rangers also have coated metal
strips with peanut butter, hooked up to electric fences, in an
attempt to shock elk and keep them from coming to the areas.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this limited aspen restoration effort has
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf takes particular pride in a 24-acre plot near U.S. 180
northwest of Flagstaff called the Malpai enhancement area.
</P>
<P>
   After being fenced in 1994, Rolf said, all the pines were cut in
the area and a controlled burn was conducted to make the soil ripe
for aspen restoration. In the first year after that, 2,000 aspen
saplings sprouted and grew up to 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's a virtual jungle of 10-foot aspens and tall grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf contrasts that with the heavily grazed aspen saplings on
the other side of the fence, which are seldom more than an inch
tall. Eventually, however, the fences will have to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part is that more than half of the protected aspen
areas in the Southwest are in that one district near Flagstaff,''
said Johnson, the assistant regional forester. ``The cost of the
fencing and labor is prohibitive. Meanwhile, we have a crisis
because more than three-quarters of our groves are 75 to 80 years
old and nearing the end of their life cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolf and Johnson said it takes an aspen about seven years to
grow large enough to fend off big game.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Britt, regional manager for the state Game and Fish
Department in Flagstaff, said about 3,000 elk roam in the area of
the peaks, down 25 percent from their apex in the early 1990s. But
Britt said more hunting permits are being offered, in part because
of concerns about the aspens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been hardly any aspen regeneration for 50 years now,''
Britt said. ``In addition to the elk, the groves attract everything
that eats vegetative materials. They gather there like humans do on
a sidewalk if you scattered hundred-dollar bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline of aspens is much more than just an aesthetic
concern, said Cathy Dahms, who asseses the biological health of the
Southwest's forests for the U.S. Forest Service in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 200 wildlife species use aspens, ranging from the bark
being nutrition for rabbits in the winter to the decaying cavities
being great nesting areas for birds,'' Dahms said. ``We have a very
serious problem on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There has been one major aspen success story in the state,
however. The 11,000-foot Escudilla Mountain, north of the community
of Alpine, is covered with the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had some good luck there,'' said Doug Beal, a Forest
Service tree specialist in Springerville. ``We had a fire which
cleared the mountain in the early 1950s, and the big-game
populations were small then.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bonnie Holmes, a Flagstaff author who recently wrote a book
about aspens, blames the decline of the tree entirely on humans.
After all, she said, bureaucrats make decisions to suppress forest
fires and regulate game numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed all the rules that allowed aspens to thrive,''
Holmes said. ``They are the mothers of the forest but are also so
delicate at the same time. And now, they are suffering mightily in
the woods.'' &QL;

NBA GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Welcome to the NBA's Day of Reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   A day when lies will be exposed, facts will see the light of day
and a hundred juicy rumors will be stripped from the radio
talk-show circuit, tossed onto the compost heap and left to
fertilize the next harvest of idle gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Idle is the key word here. For the last month, NBA general
managers have had their signing fingers shackled. They were free to
chat, offer, counter-offer and arm-twist with other GMs and
players' agents. But signed agreements were verboten.
</P>
<P>
   So Penny Hardaway supposedly became a Laker, a Raptor and Sun
for various stretches of July. Glen Rice moved to Miami and
Portland and Houston. Charles Barkley outwardly fantasized about
L.A., Salt Lake City and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Blather. Most of it, anyway. But that's what happens in the
absence of official business.
</P>
<P>
   That changed just after midnight Saturday, when signing season
officially began. The transaction wire should be humming from here
on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been slow _ that's been the frustrating part,'' said
Billy Diamond, who has been fielding inquiries for free-agent
forward Charles Oakley from 10 teams, the Lakers included.
</P>
<P>
   Slow, frustrating and unusual were the last 31 days, a month
generally reserved for signings. But the lockout that ended in
January threw off the league's finely tuned machinations, causing
the league to place a one-month moratorium on business.
</P>
<P>
   The extra time was needed to let the lawyers complete paperwork
and allow accountants to determine the salary cap figure for next
season, expected to be about $34million per team.
</P>
<P>
   Now those millions will start to flow to the 165 free agents
seeking employment.
</P>
<P>
   A few deals have already been consummated, and much of the
intrigue will die as most marquee players opt to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone is expected to re-sign with the Utah Jazz for four
years and $67 million, and John Stockton, Jeff Hornacek and
probably Shandon Anderson will follow. Barkley, eligible for $14
million with Houston and much less anywhere else, is a near lock to
re-sign with the Rockets. Eric Snow and George Lynch will stay in
Philadelphia. Rick Fox will sign for five or six years to finish
his career with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But as for the (begin ital)really(end ital) free-agent big fish
_ Hardaway (Orlando), Mitch Richmond (Washington), Vin Baker
(Seattle) and Oakley (Toronto) _ the game is just beginning. Any or
all could re-sign with their current teams, where they can earn
bigger paychecks, or agree to sign-and-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, 98 percent of the rumored trades will turn out
false. Only one is reported to be final _ Atlanta's swapping of
Steve Smith and Ed Gray to Portland for Isaiah Rider and Jim
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is out there, and it's almost here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a lot of teams to announce trades and signings the
first week in August,'' said Diamond. ``Then I think there's going
to be a lull, then a second wave in mid-to-late August.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley probably won't be in that first wave, though sources say
he will be coming to L.A. soon to meet with Lakers brass.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak expects a flurry of
activity today, but no announcements from his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more transactions than you normally have
on July 1, because people have had an extra month to think about
it,'' he said. ``I don't think you'll see a lot of people dragging
things out until the end of August or September.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the deals that probably won't be made are the many
speculated trades involving the Lakers and Rice. The ace shooter,
acquired last season from Charlotte, was unhappy with his role on
the court and angered off the court by the Lakers' decision to
exercise his $7.1 million option rather than give him a new deal
starting at $12 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers haven't been overwhelmed by potential deals
involving the troubled Hardaway or the expensive, creaky Scottie
Pippen. So they have met at length with Rice and tried to smooth
over his feelings in the hopes that he can be a productive co-star
with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in coach Phil Jackson's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   After overspending to get Rice _ trading Eddie Jones and Elden
Campbell _ the Lakers are loath to give up on him so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unlikely that we'll make a major trade,'' Kupchak
said, ``just because we like our team and in general it's tough to
make a trade (because of salary-cap constraints).''
</P>
<P>
   Of Rice, Kupchak said: ``We fully expect him to be back with us
next year. My best guess is he'd be very happy and motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can't necessarily be said for other disgruntled
multimillionaires, and that has led to the speculation surrounding
players such as Hardaway, Baker and Boston's Antoine Walker.
Reports say they're all strong candidates to change addresses
within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, maybe they won't.

DOING NOTHING WAS RIGHT THING FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a hellacious season in which the Dodgers have
accomplished nothing, it finally benefited them.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't trade pitchers Ismael Valdes or Chan Ho Park or
Darren Dreifort or first baseman Eric Karros or anyone else. They
didn't jump at crazy offers and remained with their plan. They'll
take care of any housecleaning once September ends, when it should
be done.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they could've unloaded the salaries of lefty Carlos Perez
or second baseman Eric Young, both of which will be focal points of
the offseason, the Dodgers were right to hold still.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed power hitter they covet wasn't available, so
neither were their players. The prospects who would add depth at
the minor-league level weren't offered, so the Dodgers said no
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can save this season, so why destroy the next few for
the sake of change? Why give up young pitching talent for younger
pitching that isn't as talented?
</P>
<P>
   The word throughout baseball was that general manager Kevin
Malone was asking a lot for one of his three young pitchers, and no
one was willing to give back the type or number of top prospects
the Dodgers craved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going after pitching, including us, so why give it
up, unless you get some back?'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone could have moved Karros. Baltimore and Atlanta showed
interest. But when Malone tried to tack Young's $9 million over the
next two years or Perez's $12.5 million over the next two years to
it, teams backed off.
</P>
<P>
   If Young comes back from his disabled-list stint healthy and
Perez can return from Triple-A Albuquerque and be, at the least,
serviceable, it will increase their trade values during the
offseason. (Their trade values can't get lower). Or, after the
season, teams may be more willing to absorb an add-on player in
larger deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we didn't think we needed an overhaul,'' Malone
said. ``If we did, we would have started that now. It's just a
modification. Some changes need to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas are already in the minds of Johnson and Malone and Dodgers
president and CEO Bob Graziano. Those ideas will become entrenched
by what transpires in the next 58 games.
</P>
<P>
   To baseball, the next two months are meaningless at Chavez
Ravine. To the Dodgers' health the next few seasons, the next two
months are critical. Dodgers brass can evaluate how players perform
when nothing is at stake but pride, see who's giving the honest
effort and who's doggin' it.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd booed Saturday when center fielder Devon White opted
not to dive for a fly ball. Management listens to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a time to evaluate character, integrity, desire
and commitment,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   The next two months will be painful for the eyes, and the soul
won't feel too good either. The payoff should come in the
offseason, when the Dodgers reevaluate their talent, and the heart
their players possess.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could have made a rash decision and traded one of
their core players. They didn't because the market didn't bear what
the Dodgers sought.
</P>
<P>
   Much like any other day during the past four months, nothing
happened at Dodger Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's really the best thing.

IT'S NOT GOLF, SO IT MUST BE ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You don't go to Raging Waters just because the
Russian River is a mite far to drive. Similarly, you don't tune
into the ABC's prime-time ``Sports Night'' _ assuming you watch it
at all _ to get caught up on the day's scores.
</P>
<P>
   The show exists to entertain. Occasionally, it even succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   This being summer, a slow time for sports and sitcoms, the
network that cast actors Peter Krause and Josh Charles as co-stars
and foils once more went rummaging through society's toybox,
searching for inspired programming.
</P>
<P>
   What they dug up were two more fresh faces to play off athletics
and each other for laughs, for tension and, above all else, for
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Premiering on Monday is ``Golf Night,'' er, ``Showdown at
Sherwood,'' a match-play event featuring Tiger Woods and David
Duval, who are either the two best golfers on the planet or the
'90s version of ``The Odd Couple,'' take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether Oscar Madison will show up at Sherwood
Country Club in Thousand Oaks with a manual typewriter in one hand
and a cigar in the other. There's definitely a place, if not a
credential, for Jack Klugman's '70s sportswriter alter-ego at the
event, which ABC will air live to a prime-time East Coast audience.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever confused Klugman's character with the real thing.
Just as no one's confusing Monday's confrontation with real
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the UCLA football team's game this past December at Miami
or Pete Sampras' tennis semifinal Saturday at the ATP Tour stop at
UCLA, there is no No.1 ranking riding on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The results will have no bearing on either player's world
rankings, just their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Though Duval and Woods are not really Friends, the winner will
pocket more than Monica or Chandler for one night's taping _ a cool
$1.1 million, with $200,000 earmarked for charity.
</P>
<P>
   The loser won't go home empty-handed or, heaven forbid, in hock.
Far from it; he will pocket a $400,000 consolation prize, less his
$200,000 contribution to charity, which would be as good as a
winning lottery ticket to most of us.
</P>
<P>
   If the match were all about the golf, Duval and Woods wouldn't
be teeing off at 4:30. With sports and television in bed together,
cozier than Rob and Laura Petrie were ever allowed to get, it
hardly fazes you anymore to ask, ``Is that a.m. or p.m.?''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it's p.m. _ as in prime marketability or paper
money. The late starting time means premium advertising dollars. It
also puts the golfers in direct competition not only with each
other, but with daylight.
</P>
<P>
   A hazard to be sure, but organizers smoothed it over as they
might smooth sand in a bunker by installing temporary lights on the
17th and 18th holes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, night golf; tomorrow, dawn middleweight fights?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the golf, if it were just about entertainment then
surely Duval and Woods could have been persuaded to make themselves
available for 30 minutes last week to talk up their rivalry _ or
lack thereof, if that's how they really see it.
</P>
<P>
   A conference call was indeed arranged for reporters _ with ABC
announcers Mike Tirico and Curtis Strange. Tirico and Strange
earnestly went about selling the canned features that will go
hand-in-glove with the golf. Sure, they're meant to stave off
boredom between shots, but Tirico and Strange said they will also
pave the way for a deeper understanding of what makes Duval and
Woods tick.
</P>
<P>
   You know, besides the money.
</P>
<P>
   You hope it comes up somewhere in ABC's taped conversations with
the players why exactly both Woods and Duval are amenable to this
sort of exhibition but balk at the history-steeped Ryder Cup
matches.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be that representing your country for a $5,000
stipend on top of expenses is less palatable than representing
yourself for a guaranteed payoff of at least $200,000. Could it?
</P>
<P>
   Time was when you could get a bead on pro athletes by
approaching them for autographs or asking them a few questions
(This was before clubhouse badges went for $550, back in the days
when you didn't have to choose between seeing your favorite
athletes up close or paying your rent).
</P>
<P>
   Pro athletes used to be as close as your fingertips. Now,
increasingly, they never get closer than your television remote.
</P>
<P>
   Your favorite athletes appear as themselves on television shows,
Woods and Duval appear in prime time for lots and lots of dough and
the line between characters and competitors grows ever more
blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Everything looks so familiar, but it never has been less real. &QL;

GIANTS' TURNED CORNER BY DEALING WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seldom will one transaction figure in the complete restructuring
of a major league franchise. But that's exactly what happened to
the San Francisco Giants three years ago when they dealt one of
their cornerstone players away.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams, now considered the rock of the Diamondbacks
franchise, was the key player the Giants parted with in order to
remake themselves into their current perennial contending version.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the Nov. 13, 1996, deal that sent Williams to the
Cleveland Indians for second baseman Jeff Kent, shortstop Jose
Vizcaino and reliever Julian Tavarez has made all the sense in the
world to the Giants, who open a key three-game series at Bank One
Ballpark on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days, weeks and months following the
then-controversial trade, it was viewed as little more than a front
office losing its mind. The public backlash became so bad that
General Manager Brian Sabean called a press conference several days
after the deal with the sole intent of defending the move and
insisting he was no idiot, that the ballclub had a master plan.
</P>
<P>
   The headline in one of the San Francisco papers the next day
read: ``Sabean declares he's no idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were brutally savaged,'' Giants President Larry Baer said.
``We didn't expect it to be a popular move. But it was a necessary
requirement. There was no way we could develop and win at the same
time with Matt and Barry Bonds taking up so much salary. We had to
do it. The Williams trade was a defining moment for this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy for anybody because of the kind of person Matt
is. We all felt that ultimately it was something we had to do. I'm
not going to sit here and BS you; everybody cringed about it at the
time we made the deal. Ultimately, what prevailed is, `This is the
best thing for the organization.' Obviously, it's turned out
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, whose 1997 opening-day payroll was $33 million,
would have seen nearly half of that swallowed up by Williams ($7.05
million) and Bonds ($8.67 million), leaving virtually nothing for
the remaining 23 players.
</P>
<P>
   Sabean, a three-year member of the front office who had been
elevated to general manager two weeks before the Williams trade,
had floated the idea that either Bonds or Williams had to be traded
if the franchise was going to take serious steps forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying this in a cavalier way, but when you're faced
with reality, it's sobering,'' Sabean said. ``We had to pick one
guy. We opted to keep Barry for obvious reasons of what the club
could be with him. If we wanted to get the hell out of last place,
we had to do something. I remember I smoked a lot of cigarettes
that weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact of the deal was quickly realized as the
Giants had a phenomenal 1997 season, capturing the National League
West Division title on the next to last day of the season and
reaching the playoffs for the first time in eight years. In
Williams' case, he became Cleveland's everyday third baseman and
helped the Indians reach the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was win-win,'' Sabean said. ``We all got what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams deal brought the Giants stability in Kent, who has
emerged as one of the top-hitting middle infielders in the game,
and Vizcaino, whose one season with the Giants was above average,
and Tavarez, a dependable middle reliever.
</P>
<P>
   The three former Indians were under contract in 1997 for a
combined $6.03 million. Coupled with the $1 million the Indians
included in the trade, the Giants had an additional $2 million to
play with.
</P>
<P>
   Using that extra cash as a base, the front office then signed
free-agent center fielder Darryl Hamilton and traded for first
baseman J.T. Snow. In addition, Williams' departure opened up third
base for a young Bill Mueller, who has emerged into a solid
everyday player.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are so happy with these moves that on Friday they
gave Snow a $24 million, four-year contract extension and exercised
options on Bonds and Kent. Snow is now under contract through 2003,
Bonds through 2001 and Kent through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In short, in trading away one player, Williams, the Giants were
able to land six integral pieces _ three of which (Kent, Tavarez
and Snow) are still with the club _ and one, Hamilton, who was
traded for Ellis Burks, who is now a starting outfielder when
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, every club needs to shake things up a bit,'' San
Diego General Manager Kevin Towers said. ``Everything was built
around two guys for them. If one of those guys went down, they were
stuck. They freed up salary and were able to go out and spend some
money on some role players. They added depth to their bullpen and
have been off and running ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants reached the postseason in 1997 and tied with the
Chicago Cubs for the wild-card spot last season, losing a one-game
playoff. San Francisco entered its weekend series in Cincinnati
with a 234-193 record (.548) since pulling the trigger on the
Williams deal. In the two previous seasons, the Giants were 135-171
(.441).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one hell of a move and a bold move for a guy's first
move as a GM,'' said Giants Manager Dusty Baker, one of Williams'
closest friends. ``I'm glad for Matty. It's worked out fine for
everyone. There are certain things you don't want to face
sometimes, and I'm glad I wasn't the GM for this one. A trade is
supposed to help both clubs, and this one did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were faced with reality because they had just
finished in last place for the second consecutive year, only the
second time this storied franchise had gone through such a two-year
stretch in its 116-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The '96 season was especially disastrous for the Giants, who
were decimated by injuries near the All-Star break and lost 17 of
19 at one point in late June and early July. San Francisco used 49
players, just two short of the all-time franchise record. They
managed to avoid losing 100 games mostly because of a late spurt in
which they won eight of their final 12 games. Attendance plummeted
as the Giants averaged just 17,671 fans per home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally ran out of guys with big league experience and
guys who deserved to be there or should have been there,'' Sabean
said. ``There were guys we handed a major league uniform to who
were ill-equipped to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Giants had just won voter approval to build a
new privately financed stadium and needed to give fans a reason to
start buying ticket licenses for their new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at a huge crossroads as an organization,'' Baer said.
``With Candlestick Park, if you don't win you're going to suffer a
tremendous hit at the gate. It was (a move) to stay competitive
while we won. We would have gotten the ballpark built anyway, but
it would have been a much tougher go if all these ingredients had
not happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants already have sold 25,500 season tickets for next
year's inaugural season at Pacific Bell Park, nearly double their
highest season ticket base in 42 years in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were not fooling ourselves into thinking Matt was
going to lose productivity,'' Baer said. ``We knew we were trading
a guy with good years ahead of him. I also can't say we sat there
and thought it was going to work out this well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you ask anyone here, `Would we do the Matt deal again?'
Yes would be the answer.'' &QL;

FINANCES HAVE TURNED SCHOOL INTO ASU INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Welcome to Arizona State Inc., where
administrators believe treating your athletic department like a big
business is the only approach that make cents.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, ASU athletic department's operating budget has
jumped from $17 million to $26 million. A $2.9 million deficit is
now a $600,000 surplus. Eighteen capital projects, including new
softball and soccer stadiums and an overhauling of the
Intercollegiate Athletics Complex, are under way or will be soon.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force has been Athletic Director Kevin White, whose
corporate approach, while making some bristle, has pumped life into
a sedentary budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to continue to build our _ and I know saying this
makes people edgy _ core business,'' White said. ``If we don't do
that, at the end of the day we're not going to be able to be as
competitive as we like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' financial strides, which began taking shape with
White's arrival in June 1996, are significant considering ASU's
three major sports _ football, baseball and men's basketball _ all
failed to qualify for postseason play last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have a good year,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   White is driven by the goals he announced when he arrived: to
create and develop programs that finish annually in the NCAA's top
10 and the Pac-10's top three; to be clean and compliant; and to be
academically responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Of ASU's 21 sports, only five finished among the Pac-10's top
three teams in 1998-99. White believes by pumping more money into
his programs, providing coaches with better opportunities to win
and finding ways to keep them around, the Sun Devils' success will
change. Two of ASU's more successful women's programs _ golf and
gymnastics _ are led by coaches approaching their 20th seasons. &QL; 
Arena by any other name &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White has improved the athletic department's financial status by
reorganizing ASU's fund-raising arm, securing better broadcast
deals, embracing corporate partnership and permitting facility
naming in exchange for sizable contributions. The latter alone
already has brought in approximately $14 million, led by Wells
Fargo Bank's $5 million gift to rename the University Activity
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The approach has not been without a price. Some fans have
complained about the audio and video marketing onslaught that
occurs during football games at Sun Devil Stadium, an effort that
appears excessive compared to the rest of the Pac-10. Others find
the naming rights offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, I don't really think fans care that much,'' said
Rick Burton, director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at
Oregon. ``A lot bemoan the good old days, but then the good old
days were not that good. People would rather see a winning team,
and that helps them overcome their commercial sensitivities.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ASU's corporate approach is ahead of the game, it is by
no means the only university willing to trade naming rights for a
hefty gift. Ohio State, whose 1999-2000 budget of $64 million is
one of the biggest in the country, has renamed its basketball arena
the Jerome Schottenstein Center, thanks to a $12.5 million
contribution from a local businessman. Because of strong booster
support, the football team's Ohio Stadium is undergoing $150
million in renovations.
</P>
<P>
   One of college sports' first facilities to be named because of a
donation was Syracuse's Carrier Dome in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's budget ranks sixth in the Pac-10, according to a survey by
``The'' ``Arizona Republic,'' $13 million behind Stanford, a
private institution. &QL; 
An oversaturated market &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Arizona State announced a university-wide Capital
Campaign goal to raise $300 million (later increased to $400
million) by 2002. The athletic department quickly met its $20
million commitment and upped its goal to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   With approximately 110,000 alumni living in the Valley, White
sees numerous resources to tap. But he also is aware his university
is situated in an area that was recently named ``the most
oversaturated sports market in the country'' by one publication.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' challenges are different from those programs
that regularly see themselves in the Top 10. Schools such as
Tennessee and Nebraska sit in markets with little or no competition
from professional sports teams. For the most part, those schools
own the state's sports fans, who not only embrace dear old State U
but contribute to the program. Football sellouts are common.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils must compete for the marketing dollar against six
professional sports franchises, several of which are owned by one
of the best marketers in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jerry) Colangelo has raised the bar, and that's a challenge
for us,'' said Vic Cegles, ASU's lead associate athletic director
for external affairs. ``I think we have our own niche. Maybe we
can't attract the type of dollars they do, but we're getting
closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Said White:``When we look at what others are doing, I'm not sure
it really matters what happens in West Lafayette, Fayetteville,
Iowa City, Eugene, and maybe even Tucson. The tone of our market is
clearly being dictated by those professional franchises. We're
having to adjust to that.'' &QL; 
Signs of the times &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASU has taken a Colangelo-like ``bundle'' approach to marketing.
For X amount of dollars, get radio time, a sign in Sun Devil
Stadium and tickets to a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``By controlling all the inventory, it enables you to create the
value for it,'' Cegles said. ``By combining everything, you
increase the sponsorship value, and in some respects you can create
the value. I think this is the wave of the future, and we're on the
cutting edge of doing this. We'll be the model for a lot of schools
down the road in terms of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   More than $2.2 million of ASU's 1990-2000 budget comes from
sponsorship and signage, and the administration expects the numbers
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the stadium has been fairly bare,'' Cegles
said. ``Without overdoing it and over-commercializing, which we
don't want to do, we can add some signage we can sell. Not just in
the stadium proper, but the concourse, in the loge. Or the entrance
way into the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' latest broadcasting deal also has a corporate
feel. Last spring, ASU agreed on a five-year contract with Outdoor
Systems Sports Marketing for multimedia rights. OSSM, or The Sun
Devils Sports Network, will maintain ASU's radio and television
rights and sell its advertising, marketing and sponsorship
properties. Deals were negotiated with KGME-AM (550) and Fox Sports
Net Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ASU will net nearly $4.8 million from broadcasting this season,
nearly a million more than last year's $3.9 million. &QL; 
The man behind it all &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most observers think ASU has made significant inroads with
corporations and major-gift contributors because of White, who is
at ease mingling with the public, a task predecessor Charles Harris
never embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Although White has some concerns about his perception of
businessman first, athletic director second, he thinks that is
what's necessary to make ASU successful. During the past three
years, gift and corporate support has tripled. The Sun Devils have
received 11 donations of at least $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our supporters have been great, terrific,'' White said. ``But
we have 9,000 donors, and I'd like 20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, who have budgeted about $6 million from gifts,
donations and sponsors, aspire to be like Florida, which
anticipates raising $15 million in its annual fund this year.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question a successful football season would help
ASU's cause. A winning season means better TV/radio deals,
increased tickets sales and bowl revenue. Although the 1996 Rose
Bowl payout of $8.25 million was shared equally among Pac-10
conference members, it was still a nice chunk of change. The Sun
Devils made another $800,000 on Rose Bowl ticket surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   White jokingly referred to that period as the ``Jake Plummer
deficit-reduction program.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey by the NCAA revealed that football provided 66
percent of the revenue brought in by all Division I sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils also hope to benefit from a five-year, $7 million
deal with adidas that is expected to be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
   Where does ASU's money go? Much of it is targeted for facility
upgrades and additions. With state-of-the-art complexes popping up
around the country, the Sun Devils don't want to play catch-up.
Several decades ago, many of ASU's athletic facilities were
considered among the best, but that's no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to give our coaches the best opportunities
available,'' White said. ``And that's ultimately what we're trying
to do.'' &QL;

   FLAGSTAFF - Eric, have a minute?
</P>
<P>
   Some days, he wags his head.
</P>
<P>
   Other days, he says, ``No,'' or if he's in an expansive mood,
``Hell, no.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a sportscaster for a Valley TV station tried again
as Eric Swann walked by on his way to the dining hall at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, is ``today'' the day?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' Swann replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never''?``''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   If No. 98 is serious, this is a big story. The Cardinals
defensive tackle hasn't spoken publicly for months. Now he seems to
be suggesting he will maintain his silence throughout this season
and into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We assumed Swann would mature, end this little game and address
questions that Cardinals fans have been asking since the defensive
star had season-ending knee surgery in December.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, how's the knee?
</P>
<P>
   Are you still experiencing pain? If so, to what degree?
</P>
<P>
   Do you expect to be ready to start when the season opens Sept.
12?
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned or criticized your choosing to have surgery when
your teammates were battling for the playoffs. How difficult was
that controversial decision?
</P>
<P>
   What are your expectations?
</P>
<P>
   Swann isn't saying. The Silent Question Mark who failed his
pre-camp physical rides his exercise bike. He walks through drills.
We turn to the trainer and coaches for daily status reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric's knee is stable,'' Cardinals trainer John Omohundro
said. ``What we have to find out is whether it can accept the
pounding. Hopefully, (once Swann begins contact drills) there will
be no swelling and minimal pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGinnis, the defensive coordinator, keeps his fingers
crossed. He knows better than anyone Swann's value to the defense,
what a powerful and dominating player he can be. Swann anchors the
line. He draws double teams. Without him last year, Cardinals
opponents pounded the ball on the ground successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no doctor, but we're counting on Eric,'' McGinnis said.
``He realizes he missed something special last year.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to hear Swann say that. Or say anything that
would shed light on his physical condition and mental outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, however, has been only slightly more communicative than
those monks who eat broccoli and other gassy foods in the TV
commercial but faithfully maintain their vow of silence, thanks to
Beano.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals hope Swann will speak. The PR department has done
everything but prompt him, in the manner of a pet store owner
trying to get a balky parrot to talk.
</P>
<P>
   This being America, the land of the free and home of the brave,
Swann is under no obligation to say boo. Many widely known athletes
have fallen mute for periods of time during their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Thomas is the most celebrated of pro football's
non-talkers. On the advice of Jim Brown, his financial adviser and
confidant, Thomas vowed to speak to no one during the 1971 season.
The Cowboys halfback kept his word, too. He didn't end his silence
until after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Carlton, the former pitcher, didn't talk to the media for
a decade or more, although yours truly did manage to get an
exclusive with Lefty when he appeared at one of those trading card
shows and signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, ready for spring training?'' I asked after working my
way to the front of the line where Carlton sat, head bowed, eyes
downcast, scribbling his name for $5 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Carlton replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``NEXT!'' barked Lefty's agent, whose job was to keep the line
moving.
</P>
<P>
   The Silent Question Mark is hardly breaking new ground.``
Anybody'' in sports can refuse to talk. Before the start of the LA
Games, two American Olympians _ Joe Fargis and Conrad Holmfeld were
their names _ announced they would not speak to the media.
Absolutely no interviews, they said. No exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Fargis and Holmfeld weren't gymnasts. They didn't swim or run
track or play basketball. They were members of the U.S. equestrian
team, riders in the show-jumping competition. &QL;

HE DOES IT HIS WAY  
 TOBIN MOLDS WINNER, DOESN'T ROCK BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF - In the Cardinals media guide, the list of head
coaches occupies twice as much space as the list of postseason
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And playoff wins? Well, that was a one-liner. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen men _ guys named Buddy, Curly, Pop, Bud and Buddy again
_ tried for more than a half-century to coach the Cardinals to a
playoff win. None could crack the code to doing it within the
stringent _ some say unusual or even archaic _ framework
established by team owner Bill Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   Until Vince Tobin did it.
</P>
<P>
   It had become an annual rite for the Cardinals after
mid-November to play out another losing season and then wait to see
whether the latest coach would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were, beating the mighty NFC East champion Dallas
Cowboys, their greatest nemesis, on the road, in the playoffs, on
Jan. 2. Their 20-7 victory was the Cardinals' first playoff win
since they captured the NFL championship in 1947, when the team was
owned by Bidwill's father.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin's reward for taking his place in team history was a polite
thank you. He would have preferred a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Live with it and don't make a ruckus. That's the way the owner
likes it.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin is under contract for this season and next. If the
Cardinals come up lame in the wake of their 9-7 record and
excitement generated by going two games into the playoffs, the
remaining year easily could be bought out and Tobin could be sent
packing. That would be the Cardinal way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill, along with Cardinals fans, is waiting to see whether
Tobin is the man to lead them to a higher level and keep them
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around for a long time, around a lot of winning
football teams,'' Tobin said. ``You do things a certain way. And
you've got to believe that if you do them that way, eventually you
get over the top. That's where we are headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin would enjoy having more security, given where the team is
today compared with where it was when he signed in 1996. His 20-28
mark in three seasons doesn't reflect the job that has been done,
the progress made in nearly every facet of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along we were a better team the second year (4-12)
than the first (7-9), even though the record wasn't as good,''
Tobin said. ``Last season, we were 6-7 with three games left. We
won all three by kicking field goals as time expired. A lot of
people came together and we got over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team getting better. We're not where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many big names were interested in coming to work for Bill
Bidwill, a very nice man, a wonderful corporate citizen whose
charitable giving goes far beyond what the general public can
imagine, but a tough football owner to work for. He is set in his
ways, and his ways go back a ways.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, 55, a man not totally comfortable with the '90s himself,
believed he could make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin is not the sort who needs to gauge in which direction the
parade is moving in order to run out in front of it. That's good
because the owner isn't big on his coach being a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that as long as you get things going in
the direction you want them going, you don't necessarily have to be
the one thumping your chest saying, `I was the one who did it,' ''
Tobin said. `` `I, I, I,' that's all you hear from some guys. The
bottom line is a lot of people have to be working in the same
direction, doing the same thing. That's kind of what I believe,
kind of the way I coach. I give an awful lot of authority to my
assistant coaches. I let them coach. I'm very, very involved to
make sure things are going the way I think they should be going,
but beyond that, who gets the credit is kind of irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin let his accomplishments do the talking. In 1986, for
example, his Chicago Bears defense set a league record for fewest
points allowed. While successful as a defensive coordinator, he
never had been an NFL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of work for a first-timer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly when I got here, there was a vacuum here,'' Tobin
said. ``There was no general manager. There was no personnel
director. We kind of ruled by committee. It was a consensus thing.
The first thing you've got to do is have a vision and decide where
you're going. Then you've got to get going in that direction, and I
think that's the big thing that we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case three years ago. There was a lot of
infighting, a lot of bickering _ inside the locker room and outside
the locker room. That has changed, and Tobin's leadership is
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, Cardinals general manager, has worked with Tom
Landry in Dallas, Mike Shanahan in Denver and Marv Levy in Buffalo,
all successful coaches who have taken teams to the Super Bowl. No
one is ready to place Tobin's name alongside those, but Ferguson
said he sees some of the qualities in Tobin that made the others
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``His on-field demeanor, his sideline demeanor, how he handles
his staff and players, how he organizes his practices are very
similar,'' Ferguson said. ``He can hire quality people, can coach
quality players, coach underachievers, overachievers, veterans,
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince has grown as a head coach, but we've all grown over the
past three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had done nothing but lose horribly since moving to
Arizona in 1988. A decision was made to rebuild with young talent.
Tobin assembled a staff of strong teachers. Many have been longtime
friends and associates, either at the University of Missouri, where
Tobin played and was an assistant coach, or with the Bears, where
he was Mike Ditka's defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said the explanation is simple as to why Tobin could do
what so many before him could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood the situation,'' Ferguson said. ``You can't
underestimate that. It's like running for the Senate or for
President. You've got to understand the political situation
wherever you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince doesn't have an ego like a lot of people do. He doesn't
have to be the main guy out front. In this organization, in our
building, you're not going to be. There's only one guy that's in
charge of everything. We understand that. Vince's personality is
perfect for this team and its ownership. He's perfect because he
doesn't want to rock the boat. All he wants to do is win, and he's
willing to take it and do it the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to erase 51 years of largely negative postseason
history. The remaining question is how far a first-time head coach
can take the team. To a conference championship? To the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Greene, a Hall of Famer from his playing days with
Pittsburgh and Tobin's defensive line coach _ and among the few on
the staff who did not know Tobin before being hired _ has come to
believe that he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about going to the next level, he's done that
and he's doing that,'' Greene said. ``It's a work in progress. To
say he's growing as a head coach would be consistent with someone
who each and every year is striving to be a success. Time is going
to tell from here where he is going to be positioned. To me,
standing the test of time is the proof, and we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin is an excellent Xs and Os coach, a technician. He has
hired good assistants for the most part. He has the patience to
allow players to develop. He endears trust.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts _ front office personnel, his coaching staff,
the players _ Tobin is the same even-keeled man behind closed doors
that he is when the public sees him standing on the sideline clamly
clutching his clipboard to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his demeanor, Tobin isn't perceived as a great
motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my experience, you can do only so many pep talks,''
Greene said. ``Coach Tobin is not one to give you a
fire-and-brimstone, let's-go-get-'em-boys kind of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tobin's messages are consistent. Players can spot a buffoon,
a phony. There's no faster way to erode respect than to be 95
percent bluster and 5 percent substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a straight shooter, and as a player, you can see that,''
said quarterback Jake Plummer. ``You can trust what he's saying.
You know he's not just blowing smoke trying to say the right thing
just to get us pumped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good coach. I hope we can improve again this year and
keep him around.''
</P>
<P>
   That would define Tobin's first opportunity as an NFL head
coach. &QL;

JOHNSON CHILLS DODGERS' BATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It isn't often when Diamondbacks left-hander Randy
Johnson needs to be motivated, told what to do during a crucial
point in the game. His icy stare rarely allows anyone to get within
shouting distance.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers included one
of those rare times when a few extra words were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a two-run lead entering the bottom of the ninth
inning at Dodger Stadium, but he walked leadoff man Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller, who has been behind the plate during most of
Johnson's outings this season, called time and went to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I chewed him out,'' Miller said. ``He had lost his
concentration, so I told him to remove his cranium from . . . He
said, `` `Yeah, OK, OK.' He thanked me later for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson loaded and locked in. He proceeded to throw eight
straight strikes and went on to strike out Eric Karros, Devon White
and Adrian Beltre to wrap up Arizona's 4-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth straight victory for the Diamondbacks (59-46),
their eighth straight road win and 10th triumph in their past 11
games and allowed them to maintain a 2{-game lead in the National
League West over San Francisco, which beat Cincinnati, 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (11-8) pitched his ninth complete game of the season,
scattering six hits, walking just Sheffield and striking out 12. It
was the 16th time this season he has struck out 10 or more batters
and 118th time in his career. He also has a career strike out total
of 2,581, tying him with Cleveland Indians legend Bob Feller for
17th on the all-time list, and needs just two to tie Milwaukee
Braves left-hander Warren Spahn for No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 Johnson had thrown 138 and 143 pitches in his two
previous starts against the Mariners and the Dodgers. He got an
extra day of rest, ``but I still wasn't sure how effective I'd be.
I knew I was going to be limited in how many I threw today, 115,
maybe 120.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he had lost his focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damian came out and told me, ``Let's go,' '' Johnson said.
Miller laughed as he overheard Johnson's G-rated re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of the lineup was there, so I had to concentrate,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He got revenge against Karros, who hit a two-run homer off him
in the fourth inning. Three straight sliders. Three straight
swings. Three straight misses. Former Diamondback Devon White, who
hit a homer here off Johnson in the season opener on April 5, went
down on three more pitches. He threw two strikes to Adrian Beltre
before a ball was called, then finished him off with his 125th
pitch of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson now will have the luxury of another five days' rest
before pitching again. After today's finale of the three-game
series, the Diamondbacks go home for three, have an off day on
Thursday and travel to Philadelphia for Johnson's next turn on
Friday night against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy pitched a smart game. He was rarely in trouble,'' said
pitching coach Mark Connor. ``He made one mistake to Karros, and
then he had a 29-pitch inning in the eighth (including singles by
Jose Vizcaino and pinch-hitter Raul Mondesi), but pitched well.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he has seen Johnson with better stuff, ``but he
still got it done when he needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson averaged 96-97 mph with a top reading of 99 and a low
reading of 92. He got help with solid defense, particularly a
diving grab of a drive in right-center by Steve Finley to lead off
the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter had Matt Mantei up briefly in the eighth
inning, but Johnson told him he was fine and was allowed to remain
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt had thrown about 30 pitches on Friday night (33 to get
the save), but could have gone. It was a matter of Randy knowing
himself and us knowing him better now. We trust him,'' Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   In several of his recent starts, Johnson had not been able to
trust his offense, but it gave him enough support to survive this
time.
</P>
<P>
   He got a first-inning run when Tony Womack and Jay Bell singled
off right-hander Ismael Valdes (8-9) and Luis Gonzalez grounded
into a double play. Womack singled with one out in the third, and
Gonzalez hit a two-out, two-run homer to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pulled to within 3-2 on Karros' homer, and the
Diamondbacks picked up an important insurance run in the ninth when
Finley singled off left-hander Pedro Borbon to lead off the inning
and scored on a sacrifice fly by Womack.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, whose home run was his 16th of the season, said Valdes
was throwing him a lot of breaking pitches. ``He just hung one, and
I was able to stay with it,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great for us to be able to get Randy a couple of early
runs. When we (offense) had that bad stretch, Randy never
complained. He pitched a great game. Our whole pitching staff has
done a great job since the All-Star break.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ From El Paso to Hollywood,  &UR; Erubiel Durazo is
living a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, who began the season with Double-A El Paso, made his
third straight start at first base Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He got hits in his first three at-bats in his first start
against San Diego on Wednesday night, then followed with two hits
off Dodgers right-hander  &UR; Kevin Brown on Friday night and two
walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a dream to play in the major leagues,'' he
said. ``They have better fielders, better hitters, better players.
Everything is better.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for someone to get off to a better start,
especially against a pitcher such as Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really thinking about anything (pitching pattern) _
I'm just reacting,'' Durazo said. ``I want to continue to hit the
best I can, but the main thing is to win.'' &QL; 
Benes ready &QL; 
Five days after taking a line drive off his pitching arm,
right-hander  &UR; Andy Benes will start today's finale against the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Benes threw on the side Friday without problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a bit of a knot and it gets a little tight when I
completely extend the arm, but I don't think it will affect me,''
he said. &QL; 
Holmes progressing &QL; 
Right-handed reliever  &UR; Darren Holmes continues to work the
stiffness out of his lower back under the watch of the
organization's rehabilitation staff in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, in the middle of his second stint on the disabled list,
likely will pitch in a game for the Arizona Rookie League affiliate
on Tuesday or Wednesday and could rejoin the Diamondbacks by the
end of the week. &QL; 
More practice &QL; 
Because of the Hollywood Stars game that preceded Saturday's game,
batting practice was optional.
</P>
<P>
   The message board in the clubhouse read, ``Optional batting
practice (in indoor cage), 11:40 a.m. Anderson bunting practice, 10
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander  &UR; Brian Anderson put that up after short-circuiting
on a two bunt attempts on Friday night and catching a bit of grief
from teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted his share of the blame but said part of his problem
was that Brown was on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you throw it 96 (mph), just throw it
straight,'' Anderson said. ``That thing had a turbo drop on it. It
was, `tick, foul,' `tick, foul,' `miss.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can bunt that stuff, my hat's off to you.'' &QL; 
Stars out &QL; 
Many of the Diamondbacks mingled with some of the entertainment
stars before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Among the notables were action stars  &UR; Jean Claude Van Damme and
 &UR; Lou
 &UR; Ferrigno, comics  &UR; Norm MacDonald, Ray Romano and  &UR; Elayne Boosler,
director  &UR; Garry Marshall and  &UR; Kevin Eubanks, the musical director
for ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno''.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robert Wuhl, who plays the fictitious sports agent on the HBO
show ``Arli$$,'' also participated. No word on whether any
Diamondbacks or Dodgers tried to sign him as their agent. &QL; 
Fashion statement &QL; 
Most of the teams around the majors have worn or will wear a ``turn
the clock forward'' uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter isn't exactly thrilled by the idea, but
he will comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll be wearing my futuristic jacket,'' he said,
referring to his habit of wearing a jacket in the dugout. &QL;

ANGELS NOT IN HEAVEN  
 DISSENSION, POOR PLAY HAVE TEAM IN FREE FALL

<P>
   The suits at Disney, the ones who signed off on raising the
payroll for the Anaheim Angels to $52 million this season and
agreed on  &UR; Mo
 &UR; Vaughn's six-year, $80 million contract, appear headed toward a
corporate write-off.
</P>
<P>
   It's very doubtful  &UR; Mickey Mouse and  &UR; Donald Duck will be
receiving their usual Christmas bonuses this year.
</P>
<P>
   If  &UR; Captain Hook ran the Angels ship, he would be abandoning by
now, alligators or not. This is a franchise taking on more water
than it can handle, and no end is in sight for a club many believed
(including me) would win the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had lost 12 of 13 entering their weekend series
against Minnesota. The trip that ended Wednesday saw Anaheim go
1-7, and normally soft-spoken outfielder  &UR; Darin Erstad labeled his
teammates as soft while accusing many of not caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning would cure everything, but it's a very divided
clubhouse,'' Erstad said. ``It's a very cliquey team. There's not a
feeling that everyone is in the same corner. . . . We have a soft
team.''
</P>
<P>
   To further pour salt in the club's wounds, Vaughn has decided to
boycott the front office after what he perceived a slap in the face
from General Manager  &UR; Bill Bavasi, who had requested the opinion of
several leaders on the recent rift between Manager  &UR; Terry Collins
and the players and then declared it took him all of 15 minutes to
dismiss the players' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to get it done right here in Anaheim,'' Vaughn
said. ``I'm not going anywhere. ``This is how things were in
Boston. We went from 24 players/24 cabs to one unit. But it takes
time. I've done it before under more stressful situations, and I
can do it here. I don't think anything drastic needs to be done,
just a few things to restore order.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the free-falling Angels continue to implode from
within, with one member of the coaching staff wondering whether a
complete makeover is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of them aren't capable of being big league hitters,
I don't know,'' hitting coach  &UR; Rod Carew said after Monday's 7-0
loss at Tampa Bay. ``Maybe we need to clean house. . . . I live and
die with them on every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, shortstop  &UR; Gary DiSarcina, a teammate's teammate, may
have put it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unprofessionalism I've seen in the organization this year,
from players to the front office, I'm really disappointed with
that,'' DiSarcina said. ``It's not how I grew up with the game, to
have everyone's laundry aired. It makes you want to take a gut
check and say, `What's happened to the team? Do I want to be here?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been involved in as unprofessional a situation in
my career. My head's spinning. It's not the team I remember. I've
been confused and disappointed by it all. If we're all in this
together, it sure as heck doesn't look like it. I'm not going to
get involved in any mudslinging. Let's all look in the mirror
together.''
</P>
<P>
   That's usually the first place to look anyway. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; George Brett and  &UR; Robin Yount, both inducted into the Hall of Fame
last weekend, were praised for having played with the same
franchises for 21 and 20 years, respectively _ Brett with Kansas
City and Yount with Milwaukee. What is the major league record for
most years with the same club? &QL; 
Going Gonzo? &QL; 
There is absolutely no denying the talents of Texas outfielder
 &UR; Juan &UR; Gonzalez. But just when it might seem he is finally headed in
the same direction as his teammates, Gonzalez pulls a stunt like
the one last week, making even his most staunch defenders scratch
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez refused to play in Monday's Hall of Fame exhibition
game in Cooperstown because _ get this _ his 1993 pants were too
baggy. The Rangers had agreed to play in the game to honor their
first Hall of Famer,  &UR; Nolan Ryan, a former teammate of Gonzalez's.
They decided to honor Ryan by wearing their 1993 uniforms, the last
big league uniform Ryan ever wore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't help his image,'' Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates said. ``I
think the way his teammates look at him, Juan needs to do
everything he can to be a part of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of sorts, teammate  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro instead wore
Gonzalez's baggy pants. The next day, Gonzalez again stepped in a
bucket of goo when he failed to tell Oates he could not play
because of his sore wrist. He had told all his teammates he could
not play.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few rules Oates has is that all players must inform
him directly if they cannot play for whatever reason. The Rangers
were forced to change their lineup card only 15 minutes before the
first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan can make it difficult at times,'' Texas second baseman
 &UR; Mark
 &UR; McLemore said. ``At times, it becomes harder for some of us to keep
focused on what we're out there to do every day. Every day. Not
five out of of every seven or six out of every seven, but every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the two-time MVP is fully aware of what he brings to
the Rangers. His bat in the middle of their lineup is one of the
most potent in the game. The problem is that the Rangers are never
quite sure which Gonzalez will show up at the ballpark, the
superstar player or the temperamental one.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's seven-year, $45.45 million contract runs out after
the 2000 season. Over the winter, Gonzalez told a Puerto Rican
newspaper that he is worth more than the $105 million that  &UR; Kevin
Brown is paid. The question that soon will face the Rangers is
whether he is worth the headaches that come along with his talent? &QL; 
The return of Tricky Dick &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard how kids say the darndest things. Well,
sometimes parents, while holding their kids, also come up with some
doozies of their own.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Manager  &UR; Dusty Baker, among our all-time favorite
managers here at the ``Baseball Insider,'' was recently sitting
outside his Bay Area home, bonding with his toddler while looking
up at the moon. Suddenly,  &UR; Richard Nixon popped into his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, I couldn't understand why this guy ran for president
_ he kept coming in second,'' Baker said. ``As a kid, I thought,
`Why didn't this guy stop running for office?' But he ended up
winning, though he ended up being messed up. I'm not saying I agree
or disagree with with his politics _ well, I believe in completely
different politics _ but I believe in determination and
perseverance. If you keep running, you'll eventually come in first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how that came about. Must've been a full moon.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
 &UR; Brooks Robinson (Baltimore) and  &UR; Carl Yastrzemski (Boston) played
for their respective clubs 23 consecutive seasons for the major
league record. The National League record is 22 years, shared by
 &UR; Cap Anson (Chicago Cubs) and  &UR; Mel Ott (New York Giants).  &UR; Stan
Musial would have played 23 years for the St. Louis Cardinals if
not for taking 1945 off to serve in World War II. &QL; 
Includes information from other media sources. Pedro Gomez can be
reached at (602) 444-2364 or at pedro.gomez(at)pni.com via e-mail. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Now really, was there ever any doubt?: Yankees ace  &UR; David Cone, the
epitome of class throughout his major league career, could earn up
to $1 million by selling off autographed items and pictures from
his recent perfect game. Instead, he will give all the proceeds to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In San Francisco, they're hoping for a giant
 &UR; turnaround: Since being named MVP of the 1997 World Series, newly
acquired Giants starter  &UR; Livan Hernandez has won only 15 of the 59
games he has started.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Scipio Spinks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback II: Richie Phillips (OK, we're jumping the gun a bit,
but this guy is a flashback waiting to happen).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The resemblance was almost spooky: It was eerie the way that
photo of Diamondbacks minor league pitcher  &UR; John Patterson that ran
in Tuesday's ``Republic'' resembled a young  &UR; Jim Palmer in terms of
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; You want to talk about a bad week?: Cleveland's  &UR; Tom
 &UR; Candiotti threw 38 pitches in his final start (July 23), then threw
another 38 pitches in relief the next day, during the Indians' 21-1
loss to the Yankees. Two days later, he was designated for
assignment. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Pitcher  &UR; Rick Reed of the New York Mets once again filed a formal
petition to join the players association last week. Reed, who
pitched in replacement games during the strike in 1995, insists it
has nothing to do with the licensing money each player receives,
somewhere around $80,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has had four pitchers _  &UR; Joel Bennett,
 &UR; Steve Schrenk,  &UR; Anthony Shumaker and  &UR; Randy Wolf _ make their first
major league starts this season. In those four games, the pitchers
have combined for a 1.46 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Mark McGwire providing the loudest and largest obstacle,
the St. Louis Cardinals will not play the first regular season
games ever in Japan next year. The New York Mets remain interested
in the venture, which may have to be shelved for another year.
</P>
<P>
   To point out exactly how much Pittsburgh has been decimated by
injuries, consider the Pirates have had 17 players on the DL,
including 12 right now. All told, the players have missed a
combined 767 games entering today's game. ``We have a lot of guys
hurt, but all we can do is put our best foot forward and try not to
sprain it,'' first baseman  &UR; Kevin Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati reliever  &UR; Scott Sullivan, whose Rookie of the Year
campaign is losing steam after appearing in 48 of the club's first
99 games, recently had this to say: ``My arm is so heavy, I feel
like I can touch my ankles without bending over.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's  &UR; Felipe Alou, the 1994 NL Manager of the Year, passed
 &UR; Gene Mauch last week to take over the franchise lead for games
managed with 1,127. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
It now appears that Atlanta pitcher  &UR; Odalis Perez's injured elbow
is much worse than initially believed. A magnetic resonance imaging
test showed Perez has a partial ligament tear. A second opinion is
awaited, but it looks as if Perez may be headed toward &UR; ``Tommy
John'' surgery, which likely will keep him out until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers, pleasantly surprised by outfielder  &UR; Luis
Polonia's production, are talking about making a contract offer for
the 2000 season to the left-handed hitter. Polonia, mostly a
leadoff hitter, was batting .355 entering the weekend series since
being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's  &UR; Steve Avery, placed on the disabled list last
week, threw only one pitch faster than 81 mph in his final start.
More amazing, Avery was earning $50,000 for every start, which
easily could be the reason he never mentioned a sore shoulder. Reds
Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon and pitching coach  &UR; Don Gullett were unaware
of the incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado and Milwaukee were on the verge of a blockbuster deal
that would have sent  &UR; Marquis Grissom and  &UR; Scott Karl to the
Rockies for  &UR; Darryl Kile and  &UR; Darryl Hamilton. The deal fell
through, though, when the Brewers balked at paying Kile's $8
million salary in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With time running out, it's looking more likely that Los Angeles
will return to its spring home in Vero Beach next season. The
decision could come within the next week. The Dodgers still are
working on moving to Arizona for the 2001 spring, with the Texas
Rangers possibly coming along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego third base prospect  &UR; George Arias, upset that he no
longer is an everyday player, is apparently receptive to the
possibility of a trade. Detroit still covets Arias, the
Diamondbacks' third pick in the 1997 expansion draft. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. NY YankeesBack on top, but still no signs of swagger from this
workmanlike bunch.  &QL; 
2. HoustonCould superstar first baseman  &UR; Jeff Bagwell be the NL
MVP?  &QL; 
3. TexasSkipping over the Tribe, the Rangers set their sights on
the Yankees.  &QL; 
4. NY MetsBad news:  &UR; John Franco won't be back for at least three
weeks.  &QL; 
5. ClevelandThe usual post-All-Star Game swoon is in high gear.  &QL; 
6. AtlantaFor once, Braves were looking to add key parts for the
September run.  &QL; 
7. CincinnatiIf pitcher  &UR; Steve Parris is seriously hurt, so are the
Reds' chances.  &QL; 
8. BostonSweeping two at Toronto was a confidence boost for this
sagging bunch.  &QL; 
9. TorontoAdding 1B  &UR; David Segui is the type of move a contender
makes. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. MontrealPitcher Javier Vazquez has made himself look like a
keeper of late.  &QL; 
29. FloridaStarting pitching has been surprisingly bright in the
past three weeks.  &QL; 
28. DetroitUh, oh, owner  &UR; Mike Ilitch wants to get involved in the
daily operations.  &QL; 
27. Anaheim &UR; Mickey Mouse must be blushing over this failed project.
 &QL; 
26. Tampa BayLook out below; the anvil is firmly attached to the
feet now.  &QL; 
25. ColoradoIn 14 of the past 20 games, a starter has failed to
reach the seventh.  &QL; 
24. Los AngelesThe latest rift belongs to  &UR; Davey Johnson and
2B &UR; Eric Young.  &QL; 
23. MinnesotaThe kids are in need of another truckload of acne
medicine.  &QL; 
22. Kansas CityThe  &UR; George Brett celebration is now over. Time to
face reality. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Diamondbacks: The recent losing ways have all but been forgotten _
at least until the next bullpen failing. Even with  &UR; Travis
 &UR; Lee on the skids, the Diamondbacks have regained the form that help
catapult them into first place in the NL West through most of June.
Arizona is in the midst of a 12-game stretch against NL West
opponents, a stretch that began in a positive manner after a a
three-game sweep in San Diego. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Seattle Mariners: The club's record isn't the only aspect heading
toward the gutter. When the Mariners dealt  &UR; David Segui for a pair
of minor league pitchers, it was hailed as the equivalent of
raising the proverbial white flag. ``These deals give you the sense
we are looking for next year,''  &UR; Edgar Martinez said. Outfielders
 &UR; Ken
 &UR; Griffey Jr. and  &UR; Jay Buhner each had a closed-door meeting with
Manager
 &UR; Lou Piniella, supposedly to wonder what direction the club is
headed. Management tried to spin the move as bringing in the need
for relievers and that offense is not the problem. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Chicago White Sox General Manager  &UR; Ron Schueler when asked whether
he was interested in taking back enigmatic outfielder
 &UR; Albert &UR; Belle: ``No. No, I think obviously he had two great second
halves for us. I probably said it best this spring when I said that
I miss him about seven or eight minutes a day. That's four at-bats.
I liked that part of it. I think everything else was a
distraction.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
At 35, he's not a young kid anymore, but Tampa Bay pitcher &UR; Bobby
Witt, who practically pleaded for a chance to go to spring training
with the Devil Rays, has made the most of his newfound opportunity
and baseball life. Witt leads the American League with two
shutouts, a fact made more amazing considering he hadn't had one
since 1994. Witt has made 20 starts this season and has a 6-6
record, respectable considering he plays for one of the worst clubs
in baseball. His 117 innings lead all Devil Rays pitchers. &QL;

ARCAIN BRINGS SIZE, POINTS OFF BENCH  
 3 FILL SHOES OF POINT GUARD PERROT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It has taken three players to fill the point guard
void in Houston left by Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   Van Chancellor starts 5-foot-7 Sonja Henning but is not shy
about switching to 5-11 Janeth Arcain, normally a small forward who
brings more offense and size to the point, or 5-6 Jennifer
Rizzotti, who can be a spark plug off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in a 77-70 win over the Mercury, Arcain made the
difference with a season-high 13 points, three steals and three
assists in 30 minutes. On Thursday, Arcain's defensive pressure
helped Houston turn a 13-point deficit into a 71-65 win over
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was so good for myself because we come back to home
and we like to play here in Houston,'' said Arcain, a two-time
Brazilian Olympian and 1996 silver medalist. ``I play hard every
minute, and that's what I will do the rest of the season, play
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Arcain, who weighs 147 pounds, said being at point is less
physically demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I play the post, the game is so physical, and I
am not so strong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different when you come from the bench to help the team,
but she (Henning) is a great, great player, too, and she's helped
the team so much, too. I just try to do my job the best I can in
not my real position. To me, it's not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury point guard Michele Timms said Arcain, annually Most
Valuable Player and two-time leading scorer of the Brazilian pro
league, limits a team's ability to cheat off the point in helping
defend the Comets' Big Three of Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and
Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere else in the league, she'd be a starter, and anywhere
else I think she'd possibly have a shot at winning MVP,'' Timms
said. ``We know what sort of player Arcain is.''
</P>
<P>
   Henning, a third-year pro out of Stanford, went into the game
averaging 25.7 minutes, 3.9 points and 2.4 assists. She had one
basket and three steals in 10 minutes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Between college and her return to basketball when the American
Basketball League started in 1996, Henning graduated from Duke
University Law School and began a labor law career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that any of us can reach Coach Chancellor's mind
and know from day to day exactly what it is he wants or expects,''
Henning said. ``Obviously our Number 1 goal is for the team to do
well. So if Janeth is playing extremely well, I'm thrilled about
that, and I know Jen is as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all practice hard. We all compete against each other very
hard, knowing we're helping the team and helping each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, the point on Houston's 1997 and '98 WNBA championship
teams, is back in Mexico for treatment of lung cancer. She had
surgery to remove a brain tumor in February. She last attended a
Comets home game July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only be who I am,'' Henning said. ``Everyone on this
team knows and loves Kim and knows what a great player she is and
how she's contributed to the success of this team. By no means is
that ever forgotten, and by no means did I come in thinking that I
would somehow replace that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came in hoping I could contribute in whatever way to
the success of the team and just go from there.'' &QL;

<P>
   HOUSTON _ In what might be as close as it gets this season to a
playoff game, the Mercury was valiant, resilient and at times as
good as the two-time WNBA champion Houston Comets on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   None of which means much when a 77-70 loss leaves Phoenix
(10-12) winless in seven games at the Compaq Center and probably
grasping at its last straw when it comes to making the postseason.

   The Mercury is 3{ games behind Sacramento (14-9) for the third
and final playoff berth in the Western Conference. A loss in more
than one of its final 10 games, beginning Monday at Minnesota, and
any championship dreams almost certainly will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably was a playoff game to us because we can't afford
to drop any more,'' Mercury point guard Kristi Harrower said. ``But
I think every time we do play Houston, it's a playoff game. It's
always a great game between us, but the first half we gave them too
much of a lead. If we played like we did in the second half all
game, we could have come out with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Phoenix was in a 16-point halftime hole, 45-29, because
of a pair of vintage, defense-driven runs by the Comets: 11-2 to
erase a four-point deficit and 15-2 to dramatically extend a
three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both runs were started by a Janeth Arcain three-pointer but were
powered by steals. In the latter outbreak, Sheryl Swoopes converted
a theft into a break layup, a steal by Arcain produced a Tina
Thompson layup, and a Lisa Harrison pass picked off by Cynthia
Cooper became a Swoopes three-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to press every time,'' said Arcain, who had 13 points,
three steals and three assists in 30 minutes off the bench, mostly
at point guard. ``The coach tells me to press the point guard and
not to let Jennifer Gillom get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, the Mercury's leading scorer, was limited to 11 points
in what Houston Coach Van Chancellor said was the best pro defense
he has seen against his former University of Mississippi
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston (19-4), within three points at halftime of the
franchise low it managed in a 60-48 loss in Phoenix on July 19,
never could get completely comfortable as the Mercury battled like
it did here in the 1998 WNBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Still down by 16, 57-41, with 12:46 left and with Harrison in
the locker room trying to stop her nosebleed from a Thompson elbow,
Phoenix pieced together a 9-0 run to be back in contention at the
8:14 mark.
</P>
<P>
   It was even closer, 64-59, at 2:54, after which Comets center
Polina Tzekova threw up an ill-advised three-point try, returning
the ball to the Mercury. But the play called during a timeout at
2:27 never came off as the 5-foot-4 Harrower was charged with an
offensive foul against the 6-4 Tzekova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to protect myself because she was running
straight through me,'' said Harrower, who put her arms up to fend
off Tzekova. ``She does it all game, but I don't know, what can you
do when you're so small? It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston scored seven of the next eight points to clinch its
fifth straight. The Mercury failed in its try for a
franchise-record fifth in a row and dropped to 3-9 away from
America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not like the last road game, an uncompetitive 84-63
loss in Los Angeles on July 21. Phoenix held up its end of
entertaining a sellout of 16,285 with an effort that would have
beaten almost any other team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they're going to come back. They're just too good a
basketball team,'' Chancellor said. ``You see what happens to the
Comets, the expectations are so high that when another team comes
back, there naturally has to be something wrong with the Comets. It
can't be that the other team has played extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury shot better than Houston (48.3-44.8 percent) and led
in rebounding (29-27). Center Marlies Askamp had her fourth
double-double (14 points, 11 boards), but it couldn't overcome 19
turnovers and the Comets' 14 steals and 17 points on fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd have had the second half like the first half, then we
would have been really disappointed,'' Michele Timms said. ``We're
upset about losing, but we know you can't give a great team like
Houston such a great head start and expect to win. But we can use
this as momentum.'' &QL;

SAMPRAS, AGASSI MEET IN FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The matchup everyone obviously hoped for happens
today.
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Andre Agassi and No. 2 Pete Sampras took care of
their unseeded Australian opponents in the Mercedes-Benz Cup
semifinals at UCLA to set up the Hollywood dream-match final today.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, the defending champion, dispatched Andrew Ilie 6-4, 6-2.
Sampras, who won this event in 1991, regained the world's No. 1
ranking with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over qualifier James Sekulov.
</P>
<P>
   Even the competitors got their wishes. As Sampras received a
trophy for breaking Ivan Lendl's record of 270 weeks at No. 1, he
told the crowd he wanted Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be great for tennis if I can play Andre in the final,''
he said. ``He's the best player I've played in my career. I'm
certainly hoping Andre wins. No disrespect to Andrew Ilie, but it
will be good for tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi returned the favor later in the evening, saying,
``Playing Pete in any situation requires you to be the best. He's
been good for my career in many ways and a pain in the (rear) in
many ways. . . . You talk about a heavyweight bout, you'll see that
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   To make it happen, Agassi had to overcome Ilie, a go-for-broke
player who entertained the crowd with his hard cross-court forehand
shots to the corner and his loud grunting.
</P>
<P>
   He also surprised Agassi when he ran down a drop volley, jumped
up and hit the winner through his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew's an unusual player and can hit some of the most
creative shots,'' Agassi said. ``You're never convinced if you've
won the point.''
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi wore him down with his serve and ability to hit
cross-court shots of his own. He broke Ilie to go up 3-2 in the
first set, then closed the match in four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Ilie didn't help himself by double-faulting three times in one
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cut down my reaction time. I got rushed a little,'' Ilie
said. ``I haven't faced anyone of his caliber in the tournament
this week. I was taken aback by the timing. Part of it was
concentration, part of it was not being used to the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras played at an almost relaxed pace against Sekulov, a
qualifier who had never won an ATP event until this week. Sampras
got off to a quick start, sweeping the first set and giving him
time to play to the crowd. Sampras grew up in Palos Verdes, often
practices at UCLA and owns a house in the area. His sister Stella
coaches at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   On the stadium court, Sampras said all the right things about
how great it was to be No. 1 and to do it here. In the press
conference, he joked that he wanted a standing ovation and
expressed pride in the way he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing well against Wayne (Ferreira on Friday), I carried
that confidence over,'' he said. ``I got my game going, got off to
a great start. I think I might've overwhelmed him a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I felt like I could do no wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras didn't do much wrong despite never having seen Sekulov
play. In a match lasting just 54 minutes (the same as his
first-round victory over 17-year-old Phillip King), Sampras
successfully stayed on the baseline, hit winners to the corners and
charged the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``He volleyed unbelievable today,'' Sekulov, 22, said. ``If he
does that again, no one will beat him. He doesn't really have a
weakness. . . . If you don't hit a good shot back, then the point
is gone. You've got to hit it deep to his backhand, but he doesn't
let you do that too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi and Sampras have played each other very often, 24 times
to be exact, with Sampras holding a 14-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said he knows what it takes to win. ``Not playing him on
grass, for one thing,'' he said. ``It's the only time knowing when
you come to the park, you could play your best tennis and lose.''

SUNS MEET WITH HARDAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There's a Penny in the Suns' thoughts, but not
necessarily in their future.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of the free agent guard kicks off today as the NBA
lifts its monthlong moratorium on trades and free agent signings.
The Suns are one of several teams that 6-foot-7 Penny Hardaway is
interested in joining, but working out an acceptable sign-and-trade
deal with Orlando is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Colangelo, the team's general manager, confirmed that the
team met Friday with Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a meeting,'' he said. ``We exchanged a lot of
information and had a chance to sit down with Penny and his
representatives face to face. We'll know soon enough what Penny
decides to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no timetable on that decision. There are a lot of
details involved in what is a very complicated transaction in a
sign-and-trade. Not only does Penny have to decide where he wants
to play, but then there is the matter of making a deal with Orlando
to accomplish that. There is leverage in different corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said ``several people from our staff'' met with
Hardaway and his agents, but he indicated that a deal is not
imminent. Expect Clifford Robinson to return. He appears close to
signing a four-year deal with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a few things we can get done (today),'' he said.
``It's possible we'll be able to get something done with Cliff.
That would be a significant step if we can get that taken care
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Hardaway sweepstakes are the Toronto Raptors, who
are rumored to be offering Charles Oakley and Tracy McGrady. It may
be the best offer the Magic receives, but it may not be the one
most attractive to Hardaway, who has said he would like to play in
a warm weather city.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway met with Suns Coach Danny Ainge.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, which would rather receive something than nothing, will
have to listen if it opts not to agree to Hardaway's seven-year,
$85 million demand.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hardaway is one of 140 free agents, don't expect an
abundance of player movement. Other than Toronto, Chicago and the
Los Angeles Clippers, few teams have salary cap room and most are
restricted by the terms of the NBA's labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Others free agents include forward/center Vin Baker, shooting
guard Mitch Richmond and big men Lorenzen Wright and Jermaine
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The best bets for the Suns are a trade and to make good use of
their $2 million and $1 million salary cap exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we utilize those exceptions will be determined largely by
the progress of negotiations and what happens throughout the
league,'' Colangelo said. ``Everybody is waiting. We're looking for
the best basketball players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns took care of one piece of the puzzle Friday when
first-round draft pick Shawn Marion signed a four-year deal worth
just less than $5 million. But the team hopes to address other
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   After being swept by Portland in the first round of the
playoffs, Ainge said, ``We need to be tougher, that's the No. 1
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some interior defense and some interior offense. If
you watch the teams that are successful in the playoffs, they have
at least one guy they can go to who is going to make the defense
double team.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion helped address the team's need for athleticism, but the
Suns still hope to upgrade a group that never quite seemed to mesh
last season and struggled in games that went down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the team's wish list is a backup center.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns got an up-close look at several available players at
their recent free agent/rookie camp. &QL;

PAN AM GAMES IN PHOENIX AREA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ They are the Games without the names.
Neither Maurice Greene nor Michael Johnson was on the track last
week. Neither Gary Hall Jr. nor Misty Hyman will be in the pool
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the No-Name Games continue. There are more than 5,000
athletes from 42 nations at the Pan American Games, an
Olympic-style event that is nearly 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some drama, provided mostly by the U.S. and
Canadian baseball teams. And there has been some clock-and-dagger
controversy, thanks to the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   But other than an angry Fidel Castro in Havana, and the
community in Winnipeg, itself, these Pan Ams have not been detected
on the continental radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   South of Grand Forks, N.D., they might as well not be happening
at all. In an era when television is reality and vice-versa, the
13th Pan Ams are not being carried by any U.S. network. Headline
writers are beginning to call them the Panned Ams. As an
advertising vehicle, the spin is not exactly positive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are three U.S. bids for the 2007 Pan Ams. A group
from North Carolina wants them in the tri-city area of Raleigh,
Durham and Chapel Hill. A South Florida committee is bidding to
host them along the Atlantic seaboard strip between Fort Lauderdale
and Miami. San Antonio says it will stage them within the Alamo
City, itself.
</P>
<P>
   Question:
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the host city has been estimated at $100 million by
David Perez, an aide to Miami Mayor Alex Penelas. Winnipeg
newspapers say the city will wind up with a $38 million debt. A
contract with Canadian television and surprisingly brisk ticket
sales within Manitoba are offsetting much of the cost. But Winnipeg
had hoped for a U.S. television deal, perhaps with ESPN or ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of television coverage, and the absence of the biggest
stars are raising doubts about whether the Pan Ams are worth the
investment, both in money and time.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Ams have been mentioned in passing as a possibility for
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discussed it informally,'' said Mike Sculley,
executive director of the Maricopa County Sports Commission. ``We
think of it as possibly part of 10-, or 15-year plan. Is it
realistic? At this point, who know?''
</P>
<P>
   First, Sculley said, the commission will pursue the Goodwill
Games, a scaled down Olympic-style event that already comes with
television. The Goodwill Games are a made-for-TV event by Ted
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley said he met with Turner official in Atlanta about eight
months ago. The costs of bidding are minimal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think Turner places it it in region where he
wants for the best of his medium,'' Sculley said. ``It's not a
money-maker for him. There's some tax write-off, and it's a great
vehicle for his medium''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the gigantic Pan Ams, the Goodwill Games involve only 12
Olympic-core sports. In other words, leave the roller skates at
home. It also is not limited by geography. If the Goodwill
organizers wanted to ensure a swimming rematch between Hall and his
Russian rival, Alexander Popov, they could do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Ams are further hamstrung by key events that have been
scheduled by some of the various sports. The best in track will run
next month at the World Championships in Spain. The best swimmers
are going to the Pan-Pacific Games in Sydney. The boxers are
preparing for the World Championships in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games are flexible. Organizers can simply schedule
them at a time when the best athletes are available and the
audience will watch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody in the Valley has ruled out the Pan Ams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of them as potentially part of a logical
procession,'' Sculley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley, as well as the state, already has several Olympic
links that potentially could lead to the Pan Ams.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Olympic Committee held its Congress in
downtown Phoenix last October. The 1996 Olympic swim team competed
in a final tuneup at a Phoenix Swim Club before the Atlanta Games.
USA Baseball is headquartered in Tucson. The 1992 Olympic boxing
trials were in Tempe. Herman Frazier and Sandra Baldwin of the
Valley are USOC vice-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the facilities and the ability to host the Pan Ams,
right now,'' said Frazier, Arizona State University's associate
athletic director, who is the mission chief for the U.S. delegation
in Winnipeg and also a member of the committee that will review the
2007 bids.
</P>
<P>
   The dorms at ASU could serve as a Village. There's a first-class
track at the Tempe school, as well as a world-class pool, diving
well and arena for basketball, wrestling, boxing and volleyball. In
addition, there are Sun Devil Stadium, America West Arena, Veterans
Memorial Coliseum, Bank One Ballpark, Cactus League parks and the
Phoenix Swim Club.
</P>
<P>
   All were a key to a bid for an Olympic Sports Festival after the
1996 Atlanta Games. But the Festival encountered some of the same
problems currently facing the Pan Ams. It was a big event at a big
expense with young, mostly-unknown athletes. That's a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC pulled the plug in 1995 and returned a $25,000 bid fee
to the commission, which was then known as the Maricopa County
Sports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought we had the Festival,'' said George Weisz,
then the Authority's chairman and now an executive assistant to
Gov. Jane Hull. ``We learned a lot from that process. In addition
to the facilities, this community has the spirit to pull something
like that off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always exceeded what people coming into town for an
event expect.'
</P>
<P>
   Weisz argues that the community benefits in ways that aren't
reflected on a balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young girl who wants to be gymnast might work as a volunteer
and see what it really takes,'' Weisz said. ``That's the sort of
thing I'm talking about. The Pan Ams have a real record of
excellence. I think it's viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there are questions. Can you market it?''
</P>
<P>
   For the current Pan Ams, that's a tough question. For now, the
No-Name Games are also without an easy answer. &QL;

CARBAJAL COMES BACK FOR TKO IN 11TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ It was a war, a bloody war. A war in which
Michael Carbajal was getting pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the time it takes to throw and land a devastating punch
on the jaw of an unsuspecting opponent, Carbajal emerged from the
depths of boxing hell Saturday with a stunning 11th-round technical
knockout over World Boxing Organization junior flyweight champion
Jorge Arce.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal's surprising victory was manifested in El Torreo de
Tijuana, a downtown bullring.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no wonder.
</P>
<P>
   These were two bulls, two raging bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Except, for the longest time, it was Carbajal playing the role
of a defeated bull, his blood-soaked trunks looking like something
out of one of those ``Nightmare on Elm'' ``Street'' diatribes.
</P>
<P>
   Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal (49-4, 33 KOs), now 4-0 in his comeback from temporary
retirement, was trailing badly, 98-91, on all three judges' cards
entering the 11th of a scheduled 12-round fight.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of cautiously tip-toeing his way through the final
two rounds, which likely would have assured victory, the
inexperienced, 19-year-old Arce couldn't resist trading more
punches.
</P>
<P>
   And Arce paid dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was behind,'' said an exasperated Carbajal, who was
subjected to one more shot to the head in an impromptu post-fight
interview when an upset fan splashed him with a cup of beer. ``I
knew I couldn't win a decision. I figured I had to knock him out in
one of the last two rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal nearly knocked Arce senseless.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale blow, a piston-like lead right hand at 1:53, caught
Arce flush on the chin. Arce's knees buckled, but Carbajal didn't
budge.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal continued to land left and right combinations, and the
two warriors eventually wrestled each other to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal got up.
</P>
<P>
   Arce didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not right away.
</P>
<P>
   When Arce did reach his feet, referee Raul Caiz, a Douglas
native now living in West Convina, Calif., saw a look in the
fighter's eyes that he hadn't seen in the first 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Caiz saw stars.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 12,000 booed Caiz's decision and began to pelt
the ring and anyone in its path with everything from beer to limes
the size of softballs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a jubilant Carbajal danced in the center of the ring
and began hugging his cornermen as if he hadn't seen them in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   What a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Arce didn't much feel like spilling his guts
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   But a spent Carbajal, despite slicing cuts over both eyes, one
of which was badly swollen, didn't mind a chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Arce) is a strong fighter, really quick,'' Carbajal said.
``He was quicker than I thought he'd be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to land that right hand all night. But he was so young
and quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal did land it once, in the sixth round, that momentarily
floored Arce.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 31, Carbajal, a world champion for the fifth time,
admitted he isn't nearly as quick as before.
</P>
<P>
   But, boy, can ``Manitas de Piedra'' (Little Hands of Stone)
deliver a punch to the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost a little bit of speed,'' said Carbajal, who, with
the win, signed a two-fight option with Top Rank. ``But I was still
strong enough to catch (Arce).''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to send Arce (20-3-1, 15 KOs) home a loser when it
seemed to almost everyone he would be going home a winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the main event, Erik Morales (34-0, 28 KOs) knocked out
Reynante Jamili in the sixth round to retain his World Boxing
Council super bantamweight crown.

OUTBREAK OF INJURIES NECESSITATES SEARCH FOR TIGHT END 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - Cardinals officials are spending many of
their waking hours looking for an available tight end.
</P>
<P>
   With a hamstring injury suffered by second-year pro  &UR; Terry Hardy
on Friday, the team is down to two healthy tight ends _  &UR; Derek
Brown and
 &UR; Jarius Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Starter  &UR; Johnny McWilliams already was out because of an ankle
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're way down in numbers there,'' Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said.
``Having only two guys causes a strain at that position and other
spots. We are trying to sign another tight end, but there are not a
lot out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was running with the first team before his injury. He is
listed as day to day but likely won't return for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just tightened up on me,'' Hardy said. ``I just need to
stay off of it. I was counting on being out there. This (camp) is
my big chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he didn't know when McWilliams will be available. He
was placed Thursday on the physically unable to perform list after
failing his physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can run all right, but he can't push off (the ankle) and
cut,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a former first-round draft pick of the New York Giants,
has been impressive the first two days of training camp. ``He looks
better in pads than without pads, which is a good attribute,''
Tobin said. ``A lot of guys look better without the pads. He has
caught the ball pretty well.'' &QL; 
Position switches
</P>
<P>
   An injury to starting right tackle  &UR; James Dexter (ankle) and the
absence of first-round pick  &UR; L.J. Shelton forced the Cardinals to
make two position switches on their offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jon Clark, who had been working strictly at right tackle, also
was used some at left tackle Saturday. Shelton was expected to
battle with veteran  &UR; Matt Joyce and second-year pro  &UR; Anthony
Clement at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ernest Dye, who had been playing guard, was moved to right
tackle to offset the loss of Dexter.
</P>
<P>
   Also hurting on the offensive line is backup center  &UR; Allen
 &UR; DeGraffenreid (neck).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't run (the team) at the end of practice because I don't
like to condition the squad piecemeal,'' Tobin said. ``We have a
few positions that are so thin, we couldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing this year that all of the injuries are on the
offensive side of the ball.'' &QL; 
Good news &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day,  &UR; Eric Swann participated in
several drills, his most extensive work since having knee surgery
in December.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be moving fine north and south, but his movement is
restricted laterally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's moving a lot better than in minicamp,'' defensive line
coach
 &UR; Joe Greene said. ``He moved well (Friday). He moved even better
(Saturday).'' &QL; 
Close race &QL; 
Don't expect the place-kicking competition between  &UR; Joe Nedney
and &UR; Chris Jacke to be decided soon. Both are listed on the first
team, and Tobin expects it to remain that way for much of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a hard call,'' Tobin said. ``We'll see how
well they kick in the preseason. Sometimes it boils down to a gut
decision by the head coach, and that could be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacke's career was on hold a year ago. What he did for us
coming in and winning those games down the stretch increased his
value around the league. Nedney also made a lot of clutch kicks for
us and has a tremendously strong leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke, out of football for nearly two years, had three
game-winning kicks after replacing Nedney, who suffered a knee
injury on his kicking (left) leg while making a tackle in Kansas
City on Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney also had three game-winning field goals before being
injured. &QL;

SANDERS BEST, MANY CARDS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals players held an informal survey Friday to pick the
best running back of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive players, including history buff  &UR; Corey Chavous,
picked career rushing leader  &UR; Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the offensive players, including starting running back
 &UR; Adrian Murrell, voted for  &UR; Barry Sanders, the league's
second-leading rusher of all-time, who informed the Lions last week
that he was retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm a modern day player, I look at what Barry is doing
against guys bigger, faster and stronger,'' Murrell said. ``What he
has accomplished in 10 years is incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing against him in '97 when he got 2,000 yards and
got it against (the Jets) in the last game. In the first half, he
had about 20 yards. In the second half, he broke a run about 30
yards. From that point on was an amazing run. It looked as if he
was going to break a big one every time he touched the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals cornerback  &UR; Aeneas Williams has played against Sanders
for nine seasons and been a teammate on the NFC's Pro Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's symbolic to trying to hit a fly,'' Williams said of
trying to tackle Sanders. ``That's what I'll remember, his change
of direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a doctor on ESPN said in order for someone else to
do this (run a similar style to Sanders), he literally would have
to have a broken ankle. The ankles would have to dislodge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has caught a lot of criticism for informing the Lions
right before training camp started that he had retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a coward,'' said  &UR; Kirk Gibson, the former major league
outfielder who was a two-sport star at Michigan State. ``Barry
Sanders should have announced his retirement before a packed house
at the Silverdome. He hung 'em out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's not a phony, but it sure looks like it.`
</P>
<P>
   Williams can't believe anyone would call Sanders a coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he could have let the team know a little earlier, but I
don't know when it finally hit him that he didn't want to play,''
Williams said. ``Coward is not even in the picture. I don't
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he understands how Sanders could leave the game,
about 1,400 yards away from breaking Payton's record because
``Barry never allowed this to determine who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as one individual in the Lions organization put it: ``What
does it tell you when a man is willing to give up $7 million just
to get away from your organization?''
</P>
<P>
   That is the amount Sanders will be asked to return from the $11
million signing bonus he received two years ago as part of a
six-year, $34.56 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions say they won't trade him, but don't be surprised if
several teams, particularly the 49ers and the Dolphins, where his
college coach at Oklahoma State,  &UR; Pat Jones, is an assistant, try
to acquire him in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Lions players know how much Sanders will be missed. They were a
5-11 team last year with him. They could do much worse this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost took it for granted that eight guys would be in the
box waiting to tackle Barry, and there'd be less traffic
downfield,'' wide receiver  &UR; Johnnie Morton said. &QL; 
Smashing debut &QL; 
It's easily forgotten that Sanders played his first pro game
against the Cardinals in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He signed two days before the season opener, practiced for the
first time the next day and then entered the game in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On his first run, he gained 18 yards. He finished with 71 yards
and a touchdown on nine carries. &QL; 
Reluctant participant &QL; 
All-Pro guard  &UR; Randall McDaniel, the Arizona State and Agua Fria
High School graduate, was scheduled to report to Vikings camp
today, ending any threat of a holdout or possible retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He won't show up a happy camper. He still is furious that the
team reneged on its promise to renegotiate his four-year, $12.5
million contract, a deal that has two years remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with what happened,'' McDaniel said last week.
``I feel a promise was broken . . . I wish they would step up and
honor what they said to me. I would hope they would.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Coach  &UR; Dennis Green, who blots all negative thoughts out
of his mind, including his 2-6 playoff record, was asked about
McDaniel's unhappiness and how it might affect his team's
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any player's not happy, he'll probably be by himself
because we come to camp with a happy team,'' Green said. ``That's
our style. The leaders on this football team, whether it be  &UR; Cris
Carter or  &UR; Robert
 &UR; Smith or  &UR; Johnny Randle or  &UR; Robert Griffith, come to camp on a high
road. Anybody not on a high road is going to be out of place. I
don't care who it is.'' &QL; 
Presumed innocent &QL; 
Jets offensive tackle  &UR; Jumbo Elliott doesn't seem concerned that he
is facing a lot of legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with misdemeanor assault, harassment, disorderly
conduct and public lewdness after allegedly urinating in the sink
in the women's bathroom at a bar and then punching a woman in the
chest, causing nerve damage to her chest and back. Elliott then
allegedly punched the woman's friend, breaking the friend's jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott and former teammate  &UR; Matt O'Dwyer, now of the Cincinnati
Bengals, have been sued for $6.3 million by three police officers
and two bar patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The July 10 incident doesn't have Elliott worried. In fact, he
thinks he has done little wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, basically, from Day 1 _ and I've been playing in New
York for 12 years and regardless of that _ it has been total
character assassination,'' Elliott said. ``You flip on
``SportsCenter'' and you hear you're the next  &UR; O.J. Simpson. I
mean, what the hell is that crap?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd wish the thing could go to trial and let the system do
what it has to do instead of listening to a couple of people, and
everybody rushing to judgment and just looking for headlines and
flashy stories. I'm not worried about any of this stuff because I
think in court, it'll come out.`
</P>
<P>
   Short shots &QL; 
Sometime this week, the Cardinals will back off their 1940s
negotiating stance and sign their two first-round draft picks _
 &UR; David &UR; Boston and  &UR; L.J. Shelton. If the rest of the league is
giving rookies ``bells and whistles,'' the Cardinals will have to
do it, too. They can't be on an island.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason the 49ers are playing in next year's Hall of
Fame game. Quarterback  &UR; Joe Montana is a lock to enter the Hall and
safety  &UR; Ronnie Lott likely will join him.
</P>
<P>
   The newest member of the Cowboys, defensive end
 &UR; Alonzo Spellman, says ``Big D'' is the perfect place for him. He's
right because if he has another meltdown and takes on a SWAT team,
the Cowboys probably will forgive and forget and let him back. Look
how many chances they've given  &UR; Michael Irvin. &QL;

ASU OVER HAULING SPORTS FACILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - When Jon Clanton, a former Peoria Centennial High
football standout, walked into Nebraska's weight room for the first
time, his jaw dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest place I've ever seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clanton soon committed and is now a nose tackle with the
Cornhuskers. His reaction is the type Arizona State hopes to spark
with numerous capital improvements that will upgrade _ and in some
cases replace _ nearly every campus sports facility.
</P>
<P>
   Several projects have been completed, others are under
construction and a few won't get under way for several years. ASU's
recent successful fund-raising efforts provided the impetus for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ambitious undertaking,'' Athletic Director Kevin White
said. ``But we feel when all is said and done, we'll have some of
the finest facilities in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   White is pleased with the results of one of ASU's earliest
completed projects: a new batting cage and weight room for Packard
Stadium. The Sun Devils led the nation in batting average and runs
per game at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's working,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Other completed projects include a new track surface at Sun
Angel Stadium and a 65-yard artificial turf practice field for the
football team.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the improvements is an addition to the
Intercollegiate Athletics Complex, which sits on the south end of
Sun Devil Stadium and houses coaches and administrators, as well as
the ticket office, sports medicine, academic services and the
football locker room and weight room.
</P>
<P>
   The new addition will extend farther south, almost to Stadium
Drive, and add approximately 40,000 square feet. The building will
be renamed the Student-Athlete Center.
</P>
<P>
   Key components in the facility include a 15,000-square-foot
weight room that is more than three times the size of the current
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Nebraska weight room, when you walk in there, you get the
impression they will make you the best athlete they can possibly
make you,'' said Vic Cegles, ASU's lead associate athletic director
for external affairs. ``You walk into their student services center
and you get the feeling that you're going to graduate, and that's
what they tell you. That's what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   A hall of fame room near the entrance of the facility will be
added, as well as a repositioned ticket office. A 150-seat theater
room will be built on the second floor in addition to breakout
rooms for football position coaches and their players.
</P>
<P>
   The entire third floor will feature an academic service area
that White believes ``will be as good as anybody's in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the ground-level football locker room will be
expanded, and a stadium club will be added on the fifth floor for
pre-game, post-game and halftime use by select groups. It will turn
into a training table for athletes during the week and a study area
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is going to be state of the art, first class,''
White said. ``We believe it will rival anybody's.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction is scheduled to begin in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Another key project is the addition of an Olympic Training
Center off Wells Fargo Arena. The 25,000-square-foot building will
house practice facilities for wrestling, gymnastics and volleyball.
It is a sorely needed building. Gymnastics and volleyball currently
practice away from Wells Fargo, and although wrestling is within
the building, its practice room is small and features a pole in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make a tremendous impact,'' ASU wrestling Coach
Lee Roy Smith said. ``It's an opportunity for us to impress our
recruits with more than just the campus, academics and tradition.
First and foremost, when you recruit blue-chippers who hope to
excel in their sport, they want to feel good about where they'll
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cegles: ``I think recruiting is a major part of this
project. When you're recruiting, say against Pac-10 schools,
everybody, for the most part, has full scholarship allocations.
What makes the difference is what your facilities are like, and
your coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have the chance to recruit the most outstanding
athletes, I don't think there's any question.''
</P>
<P>
   One project near completion is the $700,000 Robson Player
Facility at the Whiteman Tennis Center. It adds 4,500 square feet
of locker room, office space and an observation deck.
</P>
<P>
   Construction has begun on softball and soccer stadiums that come
with a $5.2 million price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Other additions to look for include new Sun Devil Stadium video
boards that will be 50 percent larger than the current ones and
$700,000 worth of stadium suite enhancement. Both are expected to
be completed by football season. &QL;

GIFT REQUIREMENT PROVES BOOST, NOT BUST, RAISING $6 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Two years after the uproar that accompanied
sweeping changes in athletic fund-raising, only one sound can be
heard around Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ka-ching.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic Director Kevin White's decision to overhaul the way the
Sun Devils raise money and sell tickets has proven fruitful for the
university and did not result in a mass exodus of supporters, as
some predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Major gift and corporate support has increased from $2 million
to $6 million in three years. Football season ticket sales,
although down from last year, still likely will be the
second-highest total of the decade, White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still educating people,'' said Vic Cegles, ASU's lead
associate athletic director for external affairs. ``It will still
be a few years before everyone understands, but we're a lot
closer.''
</P>
<P>
   After no ticket price increases in a decade, White announced in
1997 that about half the seats in Sun Devil Stadium would require a
gift, ranging from $50 to $2,500, from new season ticket
purchasers. Some current ticket holders saw modest increases up to
$50. The approximately 34,000 seats that do not require gifts
belong to students or are in and around the end zones.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, gift donations as low as $100 and as high as
$25,000 would qualify the donor for perks such as newsletters,
apparel and access to bowl tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paying a little more, but not much,'' said season ticket
holder Kristen White, 44, of Mesa. ``After the initial grumbling of
having to throw in another $50, it really doesn't seem like that
big of a deal. We kind of had the feeling that's what other
(universities) are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   White initiated the move so that ASU's fund-raising
infrastructure would resemble that used by most major universities.
By separating the gift requirement from the ticket price and
sending them in separate mailings, the department gives fans a
clearer sense of their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought was we needed to better acknowledge donors by
providing benefits commensurate with giving level,'' White said.
``This is what a lot of other institutions have been doing for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   And many have been quite successful at it. Last year, Tennessee
made $10.7 million from contributions tied to ticket priorities.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a risky venture on ASU's part. Unlike the schools
it is trying to emulate, ASU does not sell out its stadium on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   But on the heels of a 5-6 football season, 84 percent of fans
have renewed, and the Sun Devils expect to sell 7,000 to 8,000 more
tickets once students return to school. Currently at 34,678 season
tickets, ASU will not reach last season's 47,371, in part because
of the loss of a home game against Notre Dame. Last year, many fans
purchased season tickets to have access to tickets for the Notre
Dame game.
</P>
<P>
   Another decision by White was to bring ASU's booster groups,
which had control of season ticket sales, under one athletic
department umbrella. Previously, the Sun Angel Foundation
controlled distribution of prime seats at Sun Devil Stadium, but it
has since merged with Intercollegiate Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very dependent upon the activity of the Sun Angel
Foundation,'' White said. ``They're a very important part of
enhancing all of our resources. The merger was our attempt to build
centrality.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, White would like to see the number of donors increase
from 9,000 to 20,000. Tennessee has nearly 11,000 donors and
Florida even more.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Angel Foundation President Don Bocchi said the Sun Devils
plan to pursue out-of-state donors more aggressively than in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk to alumni groups in northern California,
Southern California, Chicago,'' he said. ``Now that it's easier to
communicate and stay in touch, we feel it's an area to tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing, to stay competitive in this market, is that
we have to establish loyalty. And that's what we're working on
doing.'' &QL;

SPARKS WIN SIXTH STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Playing their second game in as many days,
the Sparks, no question the hottest team in the WNBA, never
relinquished control.
</P>
<P>
   They won their sixth game in a row Saturday to end their longest
homestand of the season, outplaying Chamique Holdsclaw and the
Washington Mystics 81-64 in front of 7,716 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who defeated Utah just 24 hours earlier, matched
their longest winning streak. They are 16-6 and in second place in
the Western Conference. They have won 13 of their last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks stretched a five-point halftime lead to 21 in the
second half and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starters did a great job starting off the second half,''
Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge said. ``They really jumped on them
good. The defense stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, the WNBA's top draft pick who averages 17.6 points
per game, saw different defenders with La'Keisha Frett and Mwadi
Mabika switching to guard the game's most celebrated rookie. She
finished with 15 points, although 11 came late in the second half
after the Sparks had the game sealed. She was held to 7 of 20
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I got some great looks, but they just didn't go
in,'' said Holdsclaw, the four-time All-American from Tennessee.
``As far as the defense goes, every time I went off the screen
there were two people there and it made it tough at times.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Frett's second toughest assignment this week. On
Tuesday, she held Charlotte's top scorer Nykesha Sales scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Frett did an excellent job on Chamique Holdsclaw,''
Woolridge said. ``I thought she did a great job containing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Frett: ``First of all I thought we played good team
defense. My teammates helped. I just tried to pay attention to what
she likes to do. I know she has a nice crossover. It's just part of
the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie had 15 points, Frett added 12 and DeLisha Milton had
10. The Sparks shot 54 percent from the field. All 11 players saw
action and the bench added 30 points in the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki McCray had 19 points and Andrea Nagy, a former member of
the Long Beach StingRays, had 12 for the Mystics (6-17).

FINLEY STAYS AND LOSES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Chuck Finley did not clean out his locker Saturday. He
did not say his goodbyes or make travel arrangements to Cleveland
or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Finley pitched.
</P>
<P>
   The trading deadline passed at 9 p.m. Saturday and Finley was
still an Angel. In fact, Finley was the losing pitcher in the
Angels' 8-0 loss to the Minnesota Twins before 37,011 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (5-10) gave up five runs and eight hits in six-plus
innings. The Angels have now lost 14 of their past 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley, who said he would waive his trade veto rights if it
meant going to Cleveland or New York, never got the opportunity to
say yes or no to a trade.
</P>
<P>
   That's because general manager Bill Bavasi couldn't come to an
agreement with Indians general manager John Hart. The Yankees,
Bavasi said, were never serious contenders.
</P>
<P>
   What Bavasi and Hart could agree on was that speedy second
baseman Enrique Wilson would be a part of the Indians' package that
would go to Anaheim. But that's all they could agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi wanted three minor-league pitchers included in the deal,
but Hart refused. The Angels had interest in Willie Martinez, David
Riske and Jared Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a main player (Wilson) and we felt pretty good about
him,'' Bavasi said. ``We wanted to make sure there was enough
behind him to make the deal worthwhile. So probably from their
point of view we were looking for too much behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said Hart called him at 1:15 p.m. Saturday and said he
wouldn't meet the Angels' demands. And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning we gave them a group of players, what it would
take, and left it there,'' Bavasi said. ``There were further
discussions throughout the day but we didn't feel we should lower
the bar and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, when Bavasi said he felt he let the team
down by not making a deal at the deadline, Bavasi said it was OK
not to make a trade involving Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the very, very few times, and it'll probably
never happen again, when we were in a win-win situation,'' he said.
``We were doing this in part for us and in part for (Finley). If a
deal went though or if it didn't go through, we felt we couldn't
lose. In talking to Chuck, he felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bavasi said he was a little surprised a deal wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Finley) was a special commodity in the market because of his
status as a Yankee killer,'' Bavasi said. ``So I thought yeah, (the
Indians) would do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees apparently made plenty of noise but never were
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one serious team and the other team was a mirage,''
Bavasi said. ``The second team, it took us a day or two to flush
them out and get them to admit they were a mirage and quit calling
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said it was a relief to have the process over,
considering it was Finley who was being discussed. After all, it
was Bavasi's father Buzzie who let Nolan Ryan get away 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is in his 14th season with the team, the longest tenure
of any player in franchise history. (Brian Downing played 13
seasons, 1978-90). Finley holds club records in games pitched
(425), victories (158), starts (358) and innings pitched (2,590).

WITH DEADLINE PAST, ANGELS LOOK FORWARD

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Now that the trading deadline has come and gone, what
now for the Angels? Two months left in the season and nothing to
play for but pride. And of course, a nice paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I play because I enjoy it, plain and simple,''
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``If you don't enjoy it you won't
stay in the game very long. I missed 2{ months this year and it
reminded me how much I just want to be out there on the field every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mo Vaughn said he believes the last two months
will show who belongs and who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to show a lot about you as a player,'' Vaughn said.
``As players, we put ourselves in this situation. We've got to live
with it. I played in situations like this in Boston, and it's very,
very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of being traded might affect some players, but
not pitcher Ken Hill. At least that's what he claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control that, I can't worry about that,'' he said.
``I'm not worrying about it. I've already been traded five times.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Hill will be traded still exists because
trades can take place after the deadline _ although players must
first clear waivers. And it is doubtful any team would claim Hill
considering his history of elbow problems and his salary ($5.6
million next season).
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Omar: Omar Olivares was scheduled to start tonight's
game against the Twins until he was traded Thursday to the Oakland
A's. Saturday, he gave up one run and four hits in seven innings to
get the victory in a 5-1 win over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will start Steve Sparks tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher almost back: Pitcher Tim Belcher threw 80 pitches in a
simulated game Saturday and could be activated sometime this week.
He's been out since June 26 with a broken right pinky finger.

THIS TIME AROUND, ROCKET WAS A DUD 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As triumphant returns go, this one fell shy of Tuna
Bowl II, when Bill Parcells's Jets KO'd the Patriots on ``Monday
Night Football.'' This wasn't President-elect JFK coming home to
address the Massachusetts Legislature. It wasn't even Larry Bird
bringing his Indiana Pacers to Boston to show Rick Pitino who's
boss.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his life, Roger Clemens took the Fenway
mound Saturday wearing a Yankee uniform. It was weird. It was a
little like watching Natalie Jacobson on MSNBC or reading Mike
Barnicle in the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won the game in dramatic fashion when Clemens's
longtime teammate, John Valentin, dumped a ninth-inning,
still-unseen single into the hidden holy ground of the left-field
corner.
</P>
<P>
   But when the important win is long forgotten, the memory of this
sweltering Saturday in July of '99 will be the cascade of boos that
rained down on the big head of the man who won a franchise-record
(tied with Cy Young) 192 games for the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was introduced until he was mercifully yanked
in the sixth, Clemens was hooted by Red Sox Nation. They also
insulted him with a mock cheer of ``Rog-er.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hideous postgame interview, Clemens gave new meaning to the
word obtuse. He claimed he was happy with his performance and that
he did not hear the hazing. It was amazing. Evaluating a
performance (5 innings, 4 runs, 3 walks, 2 strikeouts, unable to
make a 5-2 lead stand up) that was miles shy of true Rocketry,
Clemens sounded like my dear old mom evaluating one of my
not-so-great report cards. He could only see the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' he said. ``I was real strong and I tried to
harness that. Sometimes being a little wild is good. It was pretty
much the same as usual . . . I felt great out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Why do we even bother to write this stuff down? Better to
leave the man alone than to repeat these preposterous remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: Were you disappointed?
</P>
<P>
   Roger: Not at all. It was a hard-fought game. We had our
chances. We'll get 'em tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: Did you hear the boos?
</P>
<P>
   Roger: No. You hear cheers and you hear boos. There were a lot
of Yankee fans and it was great to hear them cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: But this was harsh today. There were a lot of boos.
</P>
<P>
   Roger: I didn't notice it.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens can claim he didn't notice that the left-field wall is
still green, but his shaky start provided much titillation for the
angry masses. This was the day when the Rocket discovered what
happens when a former New England sports hero is found sleeping
with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big deal, guys,'' he said. ``I've been gone from
here a long time. I've been a Yankee for a while now and it's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Coming to Fenway with the Blue Jays was one thing, but
there's simply too much hard feeling for Boston fans to be rational
about Clemens-as-a-Yankee. He may yet wear a Red Sox cap when he
enters Cooperstown in the next century but right now he cannot be
loved here because he is a member of the hated Pinstripe posse.
</P>
<P>
   The Gotham Rocket struggled mightily. His control was awful (54
strikes, 40 balls) and hardly anybody swung and missed. There was
none of the mastery we saw here for a dozen seasons, and none of
the perfect rage that made him so dominant when he was here with
the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're surprised when he pitches the way he did today,''
admitted New York manager Joe Torre. Leaking a little more truth,
the skipper said, ``He seemed pretty relaxed. I didn't notice
anything other than his disappointment with the way he pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been one wacky weekend for Red Sox fans. Friday night
they suffered the indignity of a 13-3 beating and saw the Sox fall
behind the Jays in the wild-card fight. There were several fights
in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the New York cops and firemen up here for a holiday
weekend,'' said a Boston cop. ``They're the ones starting all the
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything flipped Saturday. The crowd was peaceful (save for
the verbal abuse heaped on Clemens), the Sox roughed up the Rocket,
and Boston won in the ninth in front of George Steinbrenner and a
national television (Fox TV, and we're still waiting for a shot of
the winning hit) audience. There were more boos than booze.
</P>
<P>
   The series concludes Sunday night with another made-for-TV
special. Bret Saberhagen never walks anyone, but it might be a good
idea to pitch around Chuck Knoblauch (two leadoff homers so far) at
the start of the game.

IT'S FAIR GAME FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The long-anticipated return to Yawkey Way of the Rocket
in all his pinstriped glory was trumped Saturday afternoon by the
unexpected resurfacing of Jose Offerman, the prodigal All-Star
second baseman, in a 6-5 Red Sox win over the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The perspiring right hand of Roger Clemens never was able to
seize the moment the way it did two years ago, when he first
appeared here in something other than a Red Sox uniform and struck
out 16 of his closest friends. This time, he lasted just one batter
into the sixth inning and had as many wild pitches (2) as
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger was working extremely slow _ he was sweating a lot,''
said umpiring crew chief Rich Garcia. ``He kept wiping his hands on
his pants, but they were sweaty, too. He couldn't get a grip on the
ball. He didn't have a feel for the ball. At least that's the way
it looked to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the swift feet, patient eye, and missing bat of
Offerman reappeared at the optimum moment for the Red Sox, who
recovered from a 5-2 deficit to overtake the Yankees before a
sellout crowd of 33,179 at a Fenway Park sweatbox.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, restored to the top of the order after being benched
for four games, led off the ninth inning with a triple into the
center-field triangle and scored the winning run on John Valentin's
fly ball single that plopped a foot fair down the left-field line,
climaxing an afternoon in which the Bombers couldn't keep him off
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I hit it I thought it was foul, but it started to
stay there,'' Valentin said. ``When it didn't hook, I knew it would
come back fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who came into the game batting a team-low .167 for
July, also had an RBI single, walked three times, stole a base, and
scored three runs. But he didn't take to the idea that perhaps Sox
manager Jimy Williams sat him in hopes he would respond in this
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to do something like that to make me play,''
Offerman said. ``We all go through slumps. I've been in a slump. I
know that. I've been trying to get out of it. No one likes to feel
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who twice had tied the score with a second-inning
sacrifice fly and seventh-inning double, delivered Offerman for a
third time with a line-hugging ball that Yankees left fielder Shane
Spencer chose to let fall, hoping it would land foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he caught the ball,'' Valentin said, ``the game was over,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, the loneliest man in a Red Sox uniform after Williams
sat him down because of his defense, crossed the plate and dived
into a gauntlet of hugs from teammates, who ended what has been a
tough month (11-15) on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping (Valentin) would hit a pop up or a fly ball,
because this was definitely a huge win for us,'' said Rheal
Cormier, who pitched three scoreless innings in relief of rookie
Brian Rose and combined with Derek Lowe, who worked the final two
innings, to hold the Yankees to three hits and no runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those relievers were vital for us, the job they did,'' said
Williams, whose team lost by 10 runs to the Yankees Friday night
but go into Sunday night's rubber match having split eight games
with the division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox overcame the shock of two more Yankee home runs in
the first inning. Three batters into the game, Rose already had
allowed the Yankees more runs (2) than he had in his previous two
starts against them combined (1 in 13 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Admitting he was more excited than usual at the prospect of
pitching against the Yankees and Clemens, his boyhood hero, Rose
needed just one more batter to accomplish what Mark Portugal did in
two the night before. Rose gave up a leadoff home run to Chuck
Knoblauch, then struck out Derek Jeter before Paul O'Neill hit his
next pitch into the visitors' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters into the fifth inning, when Rose was lifted, the
Yankees had a dozen hits, the 12th time in 15 games since the
All-Star break that Sox pitchers have allowed double digits in
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is we got a win today,'' Rose said. ``I'm not
going to sit here and analyze my start. I didn't do all that well.
My slider was (bad), my curveball was OK, my changeup wasn't all
that good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to pitch better than that. But the team picked me up,
and fought back, which is what this team is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Rose wilted Saturday, so, too, did Clemens. He walked the
first batter he faced, Offerman, on four pitches. Before the second
inning, he threw a warmup pitch to the screen. In the third, after
rookie Trot Nixon crushed a 430-foot home run to center field, he
walked Offerman again, and after Offerman stole second, he threw a
wild pitch over Valentin's head. That allowed Offerman to take
third, from where he scored on Valentin's fly.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, on a full-count pitch to Nixon, he nearly threw
the ball over the head of catcher Jorge Posada, then bounced a wild
pitch to Offerman, allowing Nixon to take second, from where he
scored on Offerman's ground single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was lifted when Nomar Garciaparra opened the sixth with
a single. This time, there was no staring at the owner's box.
Clemens walked off the mound, head down, before lifting his cap in
recognition of those cheering behind the visitors' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some trouble with his command,'' Valentin said. ``Why?
Maybe he was too emotional, the adrenaline was flowing too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an emotional player. He gets up for the big games. We
were expecting him to do that. But he just didn't have a feel for
his ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, meanwhile, was feeling much better than he has in
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' he said when asked if he'd be
playing again Sunday night. ``I'll just come back tomorrow and if
I'm in there, try to do my best. If not, I'll wait for my chance.''

CARROLL FIRED UP AS MILLOY MELLOWS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Perhaps five or 10 minutes before the end of
the Patriots' first practice, Lawyer Milloy wandered over to an
area not often visited by defensive players _ far behind the
offensive huddle. Milloy knelt next to wide receiver Terry Glenn
and began talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to let Terry know that we need him,'' Milloy
said Saturday in what may turn out to be the most important
half-hour of this New England camp. ``I told Terry, `I have all the
respect in the world for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn listened. Milloy kept talking.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours earlier, Milloy had exploded, upset that his
friend Willie Clay had been cut loose from the Patriots secondary.
``I don't care about one spectacular season somebody had,'' Milloy
said Friday, adding the team ``couldn't depend on someone who is
coming back from injury all the time every year.'' Milloy didn't
name names, but Glenn fit the profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Terry that he's a great player but he can't help us
from the sidelines,'' Milloy said as the two, each on one knee,
watched a play Saturday morning. ``I told Terry, `Out of everybody
on the field, you're the one who makes everybody's job easier,
including myself.' I told him that I respect him and that I want
him to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The fissures that divided the team late in the 1997 season, when
the offense fell apart and the defense felt it had shouldered too
much of the load, seemed back. An angry Milloy said Friday the New
England players most known to the fans were not the ones to count
on, similar to words said by other defensive players after the 7-6
playoff loss in Pittsburgh. That problem was not evident last year;
now it was creeping back.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll heard of Milloy's tirade and talked to his
safety Friday night and again Saturday morning. Milloy said he had
a long night and decided to rectify what he called ``a mistake in
judgement'' in publicly questioning some teammates. Milloy decided
to apologize to teammates; Glenn was the first.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn took Milloy's words as a ``kind of'' apology. The receiver
said Milloy ``is a grown man and he's going to say what he's going
to say and I'm one of those guys who comes down here to do my job
and all that other stuff I leave outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy got up to leave, heading back to the defensive side.
Glenn mingled with Troy Brown, Vincent Brisby, Shawn Jefferson, and
the other receivers. A few more plays were run. Practice ended.
</P>
<P>
   And then Carroll called his players together, stood in the
middle of a large circle and spoke, and pointed his finger, and
shouted, and waved his arms, and pointed his finger some more, and
shouted again, and waved his arms again. The coach stood in that
circle for more than 10 minutes; virtually every player listened
raptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be done before anybody could talk to these
guys,'' said Carroll of his heated, emotional speech to the
players. ``And that's why I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the questions about the 1999 Patriots were erupting, not
bubbling, from the surface only moments into camp. To some, it
seemed Carroll had taken a callous approach to releasing a player
so close to the start of camp, because if Clay had been released
earlier, he might have had a jump on finding another job.
</P>
<P>
   To others, it seemed Carroll was repeating a move from last
offseason when cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock was traded to Minnesota,
a move that had a domino effect on the New England secondary. As
with Hitchcock, this move was made without clearly having a player
to step in and fill Clay's position.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Carroll's status as a coach ``on the hot seat,'' as
Milloy insinuated Friday, was brought into the open almost
simultaneously with the opening of camp. Carroll had to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the situation called for,'' Carroll said. ``It's
an emotional time for (Milloy) and our club and we had to deal with
it. And we hit it right between the eyes. And I think we'll become
better because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a big mistake,'' Carroll said of Milloy. ``He stepped
out of line and said some things we don't want our players to
represent.'' Carroll told the team that individuals can speak their
mind in this country ``but when you represent a club, a team, a
business, or a group or whatever, you have to be conscious of the
impact of your statement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Milloy's case, Carroll went on, ``our guy got emotional,
spoke from his heart, and was hurt by what happened and what came
out of him was all kinds of things. He feels bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to the team, Carroll walked over to the edge of
the circle where Milloy was seated and motioned to his player to
step into the circle. ``Lawyer did it voluntarily,'' said team
owner Bob Kraft. Added Carroll, ``Lawyer volunteered and that was
exactly the way he wanted it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two minutes, as Carroll retreated to the
background, Milloy spoke to teammates and apologized for his
comments Friday. ``I was upset and it was my fault,'' Milloy told
teammates. ``I know you injured guys are trying your hardest to get
back on the field. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy added, ``They know I'm an outspoken person and they still
respect me. I didn't throw out any names (Friday) and I didn't
implicate guys. My teammates know that I'd die for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, in explaining his heated speech, said he had met with
Milloy Friday night after the positional meetings and also Saturday
morning and that his strong feelings carried beyond what harm
Milloy's words might cause the team. It's too common in American
society, let alone sports, for people to be too individualistic
when they are part of a group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not OK, when you represent a lot of people, to speak on
your behalf only,'' Carroll said. ``I think you have to learn how
to speak while being conscious of the group you represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Bruce Armstrong, one of the team's leaders, said he was
glad Carroll and Milloy stepped before the team ``and nipped this
in the bud. (Carroll) seemed to take this heartfelt and maybe it
had hurt him a little bit and he really got his point across. And
Lawyer? We all know how emotional Lawyer can be but there is no
more of a team guy on this team than Lawyer. We don't hold it
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy tried to leave Friday without speaking to the media only
to circle back and speak his mind about Clay's dismissal. ``You
guys know I tried to leave but there was a lot going on in my head
and I came back, which I probably shouldn't have. As far as what I
said, there was some truth to it. You guys know I speak from the
heart. But you live and die with whatever you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy and Carroll said there were no fines levied. ``The way
I'm going to get through this is to lead by example,'' said Milloy,
``and get everybody ready against the Jets (in the opening game).''

MEDIA PRESSURE, CONCERN FOR KIDS DROVE HASEK OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dominik Hasek was asked during a conference call on
Thursday whether he would change his mind about retiring if someone
offered him outrageous money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone would offer me $25 million to play, I would say,
`No, thank you,' '' Hasek replied.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Buffalo Sabres goalie, the best in the world at
what he does, is leaving a boatload of money on the table for
reasons he says have more to do with sanity and quality of life
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who said he will quit the NHL after this season to return
to his native Czech Republic, is walking away from $16.5 million
that he would've been paid over the 2000-01 season and the option
year after that.
</P>
<P>
   It's not $25 million, but it's close enough.
</P>
<P>
   He said he still has the competitive fire in his belly to play
in the league, but he has enough money and the harsh media
spotlight and the American influence on his children are more than
he can bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will speculate (about his reasons), like they did when
I was injured,'' Hasek said. ``But I'm doing this for two reasons:
my kids and too much pressure from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old father of two _ Michael, 9, and 4-year-old
daughter Dominika _ said he and his wife, Alena, were very
concerned about his children losing touch with their culture. Hasek
said every offseason, when they return to the Czech Republic, he
sees his children struggle more to adapt to their surroundings and
keep fluent in their native language.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the media pressure, Sabres owner John Rigas said Hasek
nearly retired this spring after contemplating it last November,
but he was talked out of it. From the way Hasek talked Thursday, he
doesn't sound like he will be talked out of it this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention I receive is overwhelming,'' he said. ``I don't
enjoy it. It's time to take a step back to a different life. I
don't want to live behind a wall. I hope once I retire, it will be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Czech Republic native Jaromir Jagr, the league's MVP this
season after Hasek was awarded the honor the previous two, said he
can relate to Hasek's frustration. ``I'm sure he's done the best
thing for him and for his family, although he's in such great shape
that he could play for another 10 years,'' said Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will be only one more year. Then the league, which
has already lost Wayne Gretzky, will be short another superstar as
it prepares to welcome two more teams into the fold in a league
already short on talent.
</P>
<P>
   More's the pity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have a confession. I'm going to miss Dale Hunter. Hunter
announced his retirement after 19 seasons and will take a
front-office job with the Washington Capitals. He finished the
season with the Colorado Avalanche because the Caps' classy GM,
George McPhee, wanted to give Hunter a chance to win a Stanley Cup.
He didn't, therefore completing his career without one, much as we
fear will be the case for Ray Bourque in Boston. Who can forget
Hunter grinding Craig Janney's face into the Boston Garden ice
during the 1990 Conference championships? Of course, Hunter went
way too far in jumping Pierre Turgeon when it became clear the
Islanders were going to eliminate Washington in the '93 playoffs.
He served his unprecedented 21-game suspension at the beginning of
the 1993-94 season for injuring Turgeon and went on to terrorize
opponents right up until he said goodbye. Hunter's distinction is
that he had 300 goals and 3,000 penalty minutes, but I'm still
struck by something I saw at the '97 All-Star Game, Hunter's first.
He looked uncomfortable, and friend Dino Ciccarelli said it was
because he was sitting with all the stars that he was being paid to
harass throughout the season. Hunter, who turned 39 Saturday, is as
humble and nice off the ice as he was a menace on it. When asked
about him a few years back, one of his former teammates in
Washington said, ``Why would anyone be afraid of him? He's just a
farmer.'' He was referring to Hunter's offseason occupation on the
family farm in Ontario. Yes, he was a farmer, making him an expert
at pitchforks in and out of the rink. And he was fun to watch. He
always looked for every edge he could find. He was a competitor and
went about his business quietly . . . The Sedin twins are all
signed up in Vancouver, but that's still no assurance they will
play for the Canucks this season. It's possible they could be in
attendance at training camp, but word out of that city is that the
youngsters _ Henrik and Daniel _ will remain in their native Sweden
for one more season, playing for MoDo of the Swedish Elite League.
If they do decide to stay home, Canucks GM Brian Burke said the
club won't do any lobbying to change their minds. ``That's not all
bad from our perspective,'' said Burke. ``If they elect to go back,
there won't be any hard sell from our standpoint.'' Henrik, a
center who was taken with the third pick in the June draft after
his brother (a left wing) was taken with the No. 2 selection, said
the twins would love to be in training camp, at least for the
experience, but since Sweden's season begins very early, it's
likely they won't be able to attend. Burke said even if the Sedins
committed to playing in the NHL for this year, it would take time
for them to adapt, as we all saw here with Joe Thornton. ``They
would be like most 18-year-olds,'' said Burke. ``Minimal impact
until Christmas time, until they learn the league and their way
around the smaller ice surface.'' What's funny is that the kids
look so much alike, the team color-coded them so reporters could
tell the difference at their news conference . . . This has nothing
to do with hockey (it is summer, after all), but I have to say the
Cummaquid Golf Club is home to some of the funniest people I've
ever met. Thanks for my one-day honorary membership despite my not
knowing the difference between a driver and a 9-iron.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa Senators have told star Alexei Yashin, who was a
finalist for the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player this
past season, that they will not renegotiate his contract or trade
him. Yashin, who is due to make $3.6 million in the final year of
his pact, reportedly wants between $8 million and $10 million. ``We
will not discuss changes in this contract,'' wrote Senators GM
Marshall Johnston in a letter to Yashin's agent, Mark Gandler.
Gandler relayed the information by telephone to Yashin, who is in
Paris on vacation. ``I spoke with him briefly,'' said Gandler. ``He
didn't appear overly concerned about the situation.'' It's widely
expected that Yashin will threaten to sit out the year with the
expectations that he'll make up what he loses this season in his
next contract. All of you sympathetic to Yashin's bratty plight,
raise your hands. Not a one? I didn't think so. These strong-arm
tactics designed to elicit more money on an existing contract are
nothing short of extortion. If you don't plan to honor it, then
don't sign it. If you sign it, live up to it. Simple. It won't ever
happen, but that's why one-year contracts across the board make the
most sense . . . The Canadiens are hoping, as well as expecting,
that forward Saku Koivu will be ready at the start of training
camp. Koivu has had a couple of ailments. He suffered a broken hand
at the world championships, but more bothersome was a left knee
problem that required surgery. He suffered the original injury Dec.
7, 1996, at which time he was leading the league in scoring. He
missed 32 games that season. It has been speculated he hasn't been
the same since. Playing on a team in a downward spiral probably
didn't help either . . . Much like the estimable Bourque, veteran
Guy Carbonneau keeps on ticking. The forward, who turned 39 in
March, has re-upped with the Stanley Cup-champion Dallas Stars for
two more years. Carbonneau will enter this year 31st on the
all-time games played list (1,249). He has won three Cups, with the
other two earned in Montreal in 1986 and '93. Carbonneau and Stars
GM Bob Gainey are the only two players to win the Selke Trophy as
the league's top defensive forward on three or more occasions.
Gainey won it four consecutive years _ 1978-81 _ as a member of the
Canadiens . . . Speaking of Jagr, he went back to his native land
this summer for two reasons besides taking a vacation. He opened a
bar and enrolled in college. ``Now that I'm 10 years older, I have
realized that after proving myself as a hockey player, I should try
something different,'' said Jagr of his reasons for his new
business venture. ``Then, I think, it wouldn't hurt to finish my
studies. I have to complete six college tests this summer in
Kladno, and four more tests are awaiting me in the winter. I would
return home for a few days to master it.'' . . . Only 34 days to
training camp, and the first regular-season game is Oct. 2. Tell
the truth: Are you painting those ``Sign Dafoe'' banners for
opening night yet? Better get busy.

RINGING IN AN IMPORTANT MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The phone calls will have some timeliness Sunday. Teams
will no longer have to say of trades, ``We'll talk about it some
more in August.'' Disconnecting itself from the last strand of the
lockout, the NBA will lift its monthlong moratorium on trades and
free agent signings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, get ready for Portland. The Trail Blazers have
called nearly everyone with an NBA affiliation in the past month.
They are expected to pull off one of the following deals in the
next several days:
</P>
<P>
   --Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson to the Hawks for Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are serious about changing the soul of their team.
Trading the 30-year-old Smith, a previous winner of the league's
Citizenship Award, for Rider and Jackson is proof. Who would come
out on top in such a deal? Depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the trade goes through,'' Washington coach Gar Heard
said. ``That would mean we wouldn't have to see Steve Smith in the
East anymore. He's a tough player.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana president Donnie Walsh said when the Pacers don't have
Derrick McKey and are expected to stop Smith, ``We're in trouble. I
said before that he's the most underrated player in the league. But
he's not underrated among his peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is good for 17 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, and above-80
percent free throw shooting each night he steps on the floor. But
the 6-foot-8-inch guard has never played a full season because of
knee and ankle injuries. In Rider and Jackson, the Hawks would gain
players in the final years of their contracts. If things don't work
out with the new arena in San Antonio, the Hawks could be one of
the teams to be in Tim Duncan bargaining position in 2000 because
they would be under the salary cap. The Blazers would have a
terrific inside-outside team with size with Smith, Rasheed Wallace,
and Brian Grant.
</P>
<P>
   --Jermaine O'Neal and Rider to the Magic; Penny Hardaway to the
Lakers; Glen Rice to the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   This trade makes sense for no one but the Magic, unless the
Lakers are also expecting Phil Jackson to make Shaquille O'Neal and
Penny buddies. A Damon Stoudamire-Rice backcourt in Portland? And
although Rider and O'Neal would help the Magic, word is that Doc
Rivers would like a chance to coach Hardaway rather than sign him
and trade him.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors, who already have acquired Mookie Blaylock, say
they have some trading plans, too. Detlef Schrempf is supposedly
ready to sign with the Blazers. And the Jonathan Bender-Antonio
Davis deal between the Raptors and Pacers is official.
</P>
<P>
   There still is a chance that free agent Vin Baker may sign with
someone other than the Sonics, although it will be tough for that
team to be Boston. Baker is not bluffing, though, when he says he'd
like to play for the Celtics. Any deal with Baker would have to be
a sign-and-trade with another team, and it would most likely have
to be a three-way deal. Chicago is out, because the Bulls
supposedly have said they are not interested in acquiring Antoine
Walker. Even if Walker and Baker could be traded straight-up, the
Sonics wouldn't do it because Gary Payton is opposed to playing
with Walker (although the two talk trash to each other very well).
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Almost everyone thinks they can win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the East is wide open,'' Heard said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The Heat were last season's top team, and they lost
in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the Blazers are obviously trying to take over the
fragile top of the conference. The champion Spurs are counting on a
34-year-old center (David Robinson) with a history of back
problems. Their starting small forward, Sean Elliott, has serious
health issues. The Lakers will be learning the triangle offense;
the Jazz and Rockets are old.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this week, we could be looking at the busiest
period since the lockout ended in January.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the Celtics will have a dramatically different
bench this season. They have three free agents on their roster _
Bruce Bowen, Damon Jones, and Eric Riley _ and will re-sign none of
them. One of the replacements will be 6-5 swingman Adrian Griffin,
whose contract should become official Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be the most fundamentally sound player on our
roster,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Griffin helps, because the Celtics are privately
wondering if Greg Minor (recovering from hip surgery) can play
again. If he can't, the team will try to do some things with at
least half of his salary _ a little more than $1 million _ while
Griffin could expect to absorb his minutes at backup shooting guard
and small forward. At power forward, Pitino is interested in Dallas
free agent Samaki Walker, whom the coach says he worked out last
month in Texas. According to Pitino, the 6-9 Walker is simply a
candidate for one of the Celtics's $2 million salary slots. People
in Dallas have different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks officials insist that the teams are discussing a
sign-and-trade agreement in which Walker and draft picks would be
sent to Boston in exchange for Ron Mercer and another player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' Pitino said. ``And if
anybody would know, I would.'' But Don Nelson, who is not the most
popular man in the Southwest, said the team will pursue the Mercer
deal. He should. Walker played 14 minutes per game last season,
averaging 6 points and 3.7 rebounds. His career high in games
played is 43. And his agent, former Laker and Clipper Norm Nixon,
put him in a position of no leverage when he rejected a four-year,
$20 million offer from the Mavs last season. Walker would love to
have a deal like that now. The Mavs were prepared to lose the
260-pound forward for nothing; now they see a possibility with a
deal for Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that deal doesn't work, the Celtics seem to have begun
preparing for Mercer's departure. One of their summer objectives
was to see if Paul Pierce, a forward, could play shooting guard.
They came away from Los Angeles last month confident that he could.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics swear they weren't dropping any hints last week at
UMass-Boston. Before a few of their summer league games, a
green-clad ``Celtics dance team'' was introduced. So, a dance team
is coming? The team says no. Just a summer gig for some local
dancers . . . One of the visitors at UMass-Boston was Boston native
and former Cleveland State coach Kevin Mackey. He is now coaching
the Trenton entry of the International Basketball League. When
Mackey coached in the old US Basketball League, one of his players
was Griffin. He says Celtics fans will like him . . . Heard was
asked if he thought Mitch Richmond would wind up playing somewhere
else. ``No,'' Heard said. ``We may not sign him Sunday, but we'll
get it done.'' The issues aren't so simple with the rest of his
rotation. Asked where he planned to fit natural shooting guard
Calbert Cheaney into a mix with shooting guards Richmond and rookie
Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton, Heard said, ``It's a good question. I've
been thinking about that for a while myself.'' Heard is certain
about this: It might be a good idea for Hamilton to work in the
weight room. ``He has to get stronger,'' he said. ``These guards in
the East will wear him down.'' Hamilton is listed at 185 pounds . .
. One of the controversial subjects of the summer has been the
officials' interpretation of the league's new rules. So far, there
have been some ugly games. The league has been trying to cut down
on gratuitous handchecking, forearms on the backs of offensive
players, and unabashed grabbing. ``But officials are going to have
to realize that you can't guard a guy without using your hands,''
76ers assistant Maurice Cheeks said. ``If you can't use your hands
a little, guys in this league will go by you. I know when I played,
I couldn't guard anyone without a little help.'' Another important
factor to consider is the officials who are currently calling the
fouls. There has been one regular NBA official among each group of
three for summer games. Once the exhibition and regular seasons
begin, games probably will not be called so tightly and literally
by full-time referees . . . The Pacers tried to get Bender onto
their summer league team, but since the deal is not official until
Sunday, the NBA wouldn't allow it. Bender, 18, may be one of the
few players who can say he doesn't remember seeing Larry Bird win a
championship. He was 5 when the Celtics won their last title in
1986. When Bird won his first, in '81, Bender was five months old .
. . The New York dailies ripped 7-2 Knicks rookie Frederic Weis
after his 2-point, 1-rebound debut last Monday. A silly Boston
sportswriter said that he couldn't play. Weis's agent, Frank
Catapano, insisted the following Wednesday that the judgment had
been made too quickly. He made a good point; Weis looked like a
completely different player hours later. Catapano explained that
Weis had back surgery in April and was playing his first organized
ball since then.

COLLINS TAKES BLAME, PROMISES CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Angels manager Terry Collins couldn't take it.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had just lost to the Minnesota Twins 8-0 on Saturday
night. They were shut out by Eric Milton, who went into the game
3-8 with a 5.30 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   So Collins let off some steam to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stink!'' he said. ``It's my fault. Nobody else's. The
responsibility comes to me. (Today) you'll see changes. There will
be no more finger pointing. The finger pointing should go right
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure on us. We need to relax and we need to
play the game the right way. I'm sickened by it. But it's my fault.
Some things happened and we couldn't stop the snowball.''
</P>
<P>
   No deal: The Angels didn't make any deadline deals, but general
manager Bill Bavasi said the team came close to trading pitcher
Jack McDowell to a National League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our opinion, Jack should be pitching for a contender if
he's healthy,'' Bavasi said. ``We tried to accommodate that.
Pitching here is almost a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   No worries: The possibility of being traded might affect some
players, but not pitcher Ken Hill. At least that's what he claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control that, I can't worry about that,'' he said.
``I'm not worrying about it. I've already been traded five times.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Hill will be traded still exists because
trades can take place after the deadline, but players must clear
waivers. And it is doubtful any team would claim Hill off waivers
considering his history of elbow problems and his salary ($5.6
million next season).
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Now that the trading deadline has come and gone,
what next for the Angels?
</P>
<P>
   There are two months left in the season and nothing to play for
but pride. And of course, a nice paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I play because I enjoy it, plain and simple,''
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``If you don't enjoy it, you won't
stay in the game very long. I missed 2{ months this year and it
reminded me how much I just want to be out there on the field every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Mo Vaughn said he believes the last two months
will show who belongs and who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to show a lot about you as a player,'' Vaughn said.
``As players, we put ourselves in this situation. We've got to live
with it. I played in situations like this in Boston, and it's very,
very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Omar: Omar Olivares was scheduled to start tonight's
game against the Twins until he was traded Thursday to the Oakland
A's. Saturday, he gave up one run and four hits in seven innings to
get the victory in a 5-1 win over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will start Steve Sparks tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher almost back: Pitcher Tim Belcher threw 80 pitches in a
simulated game Saturday and could be activated this week. He's been
out since June 26 with a broken right pinky finger.

   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ It's all in the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That's all you need to know about Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   When he plays, the Patriots have a .676 winning percentage _
23-11. When he doesn't, the Patriots are 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great number,'' said Glenn after a vigorous first day
of practice in which he got a lot of reps and looked in midseason
form catching balls from Drew Bledsoe against Ty Law, Steve Israel,
Kato Serwanga, and company. ``I don't know if that's all true, and
when they say that it makes me feel good because I've been hurt.
Even when I came back on the field, I felt the wrath of what it
means to have all your good players there to win.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Terry Glenn gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said at his daily press conference he's never
seen Glenn as physically and mentally prepared to start a season as
he is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shape right now,'' said Glenn. ``I really didn't
do things on my own (at the strength and conditioning program). It
was structured, and I had guidelines. Me and Coach Carroll talked
back and forth, and we went back and forth on what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll tried to get into Glenn's head this offseason, talking
to him constantly about his ``awareness on the field.'' Glenn was
talked to about being able to see what was going on around him
better and reacting to situations with more awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn harkens back to his rookie year, as most Patriots fans do.
He said it wasn't so much conditioning that made him play well, but
a better mental approach. He said that had nothing to do with the
coach at the time, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year, I was more in tune and more apt to do what I
had to do,'' said Glenn. ``It's become more like in your second
year and your third year, you forget about what got you there. You
come in and it looks like you're in great shape, but then a guy
turned over my ankle. I'm not sure that had anything to do with
conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding back, Glenn went full steam Saturday.
Cornerbacks are playing him tough and getting physical with him
when need be. The word is out that Glenn needs to be in playing
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going all out,'' said Glenn. ``I got a lot of reps. I
don't want to overdo it, but I want my to get my reps in. Last year
Lawyer (Milloy) hit me and it was a hit I'd take in a game so that
was fine. You want to make sure you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he is sick of always being talked about and whether
or not he ``gets it.'' But he understands only he can silence his
critics. He says he's greatly motivated by negative articles about
him in the newspaper but realizes he needs to stay healthy and be a
player of great impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming here and I'm trying to stay healthy for the team
and for myself. It's frustrating. I can pull my hair out all day
long, but I have to come here and go at it. I guess I do (get a bum
rap), but there's nothing I can do about it. When you get paid to
play 16 games and you don't play, then that's what happens,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is not getting down on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I was a good receiver, not one of the best in
the league, but I do what I need to do to get the job done. I can
do what needs to be done,'' he said.
</P>

NOW IS TIME TO DEBATE FEATS OF CLAY 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Eventually, the anger will subside in Lawyer
Milloy and Ty Law and others who disagreed with the Patriots'
cutting of Willie Clay.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy and Law will go on to be All-Pro defensive backs with or
without Clay, but the question is how the Patriots will be affected
by the loss of another veteran.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe published reports last week, Clay was a
malcontent, a cancer who'd whisper bad thoughts in the media's ear.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, no player wanted things done right more than Clay.
The truth is that Clay was a winner, not a whiner, who played 48
games in three years. Missed tackles? Apparently he made some. He
had 103 tackles, 66 solo, which was third-best on the team, and he
averaged more than 95 tackles and four interceptions a year.
</P>
<P>
   One would have to say he was a good investment for a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Clay was the leader on defense. When players didn't understand
things, which player did they go to? Clay. When things were falling
apart in the locker room, to whom did the players turn? Clay. This
was a bad guy? When the team went through its roughest road a year
ago, why did someone in the organization tell Clay to ``bring this
team together and win in spite of the coach''?
</P>
<P>
   He was verbal, perhaps too much so for the current regime. He
was also someone who was brought in by Bill Parcells. In fact, the
only player now remaining from the group of free agents Parcells
signed in 1996, which included Clay, Mark Wheeler, Monty Brown,
Michael McGruder, Pio Sagapolutele, Larry Tharpe, and Tom Tupa is
Shawn Jefferson, and his days may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of that, Clay never was perceived as a ``Parcells
guy,'' nor was he a ``Pete Carroll guy.'' He merely wanted things
done right, and when they weren't, he spoke up. Whispering things
to the media doesn't make you a bad player.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it wasn't a surprise that one NFC Central executive was
shocked when he saw Clay's name on the waiver list.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that team, Willie Clay was a perfect player,'' he said.
``Willie is a guy who can really help a team on the verge of
winning something because he understands the game. He's one of the
smartest players in the league. He can read defenses. He can tell
people where they're supposed to be on the field. Every team has to
make tough cuts, but this was a strange one, especially this late
in the game. They must feel they have someone who can play in his
spot, or they wouldn't have made the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Corwin Brown, the former Patriot now with the Jets, told a group
of New York writers Saturday, ``I know Willie's not happy about
being cut, but I'm sure he's glad it happened. A lot of guys want
out of there. Willie is being painted as a whiner, but he never
whined when Bill was there. Lawyer doesn't want to be there either.
I don't know why they do any of the things they do up there.
Everybody is saying bad things about Willie, but you look around
the league at some of the bums playing his position, and he's
better than all those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not proper for anyone not in the football business to
criticize Carroll and Bobby Grier's judgment on players. They have
spent their lives playing, coaching, and evaluating talent on all
levels. That is what they do for a living.
</P>
<P>
   But the feelings and words of Milloy and Law should not be
discounted either. Despite Milloy's outburst on Friday and his
subsequent apology to teammates he might have offended, he would
also not take back his thoughts, and they are the views shared by
many. Some chose not to make a big deal of it for the sake of team
chemistry and respect for the people making those decisions. And
those who chose the silent route did so admirably.
</P>
<P>
   But for the players who are on the field, when an offensive
formation looked funny and there was confusion, the person they
looked to for order is Clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't possibly expect the new guy to be able to come in and
make the same reads and recognize the things that Willie did,''
said Law. ``That's years of studying the game. He had that ability
that you have to have on the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the fastest or the quickest, but he was so smart,''
said wide receiver Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Third-round pick Tony George may become a great player. His
agent (as if he isn't biased) believes George will be an All-Pro.
That's terrific. If he's the next Milloy, then the move would be
worth it. But he won't be the next Milloy right off the bat. For a
team that tried to get a more veteran presence, the Patriots have
just gotten younger at a crucial position. They've had to make that
same sacrifice at center (Damien Woody for Dave Wohlabaugh), at
outside linebacker (Andy Katzenmoyer for Todd Collins), and now at
free safety (George or Chris Carter for Clay).
</P>
<P>
   These sacrifices aren't unique to the Patriots. Every team has
to make them in the new era of big-money deals that have strapped
teams to the limit. Andy Wasynczuk is forced to work miracles on a
daily basis so the Patriots won't be in tough situations in the
years to come and find themselves, like the Jets, already $13
million over the cap for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots obviously have a game plan in restructuring their
contracts, though two things stood out this offseason: The team
didn't do a major renegotiation of Drew Bledsoe's deal, which would
have freed up major money, but opted for a smaller maneuver
guaranteeing part of Bledsoe's enormous salary. Under the cap
rules, the team can't renegotiate a new deal for the quarterback
until next winter.
</P>
<P>
   The other question is why the Patriots didn't restructure Ben
Coates's deal. If anyone deserves to have more money thrown his
way, it's Coates, a future Hall of Famer who, even more than Glenn,
is essential to the success of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Coates is in the second year of a three-year deal and is being
paid $2.1 million this year. That cap number could have been
reduced significantly, but the Patriots never spoke to his agent.
Why? There's a method to what they're doing. But Coates not making
as much money as Mark Chmura or Frank Wychek?
</P>
<P>
   Those renegotiations probably could have led to keeping Clay and
possibly keeping Collins and Wohlabaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, management and the coaching staff didn't want to
keep those people for whatever reason. Like Milloy said earlier
last week, it's not the popular players whose jerseys kids wear
most often who make a difference to a team; it's the less popular
players _ the middle-of-the-road salaried players _ who seem to
make the biggest difference in whether teams win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Clay alone may not make a huge difference, but when you add his
loss to those of Wohlabaugh, Collins, Ferric Collons, Wheeler, and
others who added depth and veteran leadership to a team, it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Now a younger player is going to have to make important reads.
Now Milloy is being forced to come out of his element a bit and
take over some of Clay's duties. Milloy became an All-Pro because
he didn't have to worry about those little things. He could just
play and hit people and be intimidating. Now he has to think more.
Will that affect him? Only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   What's unfortunate is all of the mudslinging that goes on when a
player gets cut. Clay was a good player. Period. Everything else
said about him is nonsense. Certain players were told this week
that if Clay hadn't opened his mouth to the Globe and criticized
the decision to release him, the team might have reworked his
contract and re-signed him. Unfortunately, that sentiment never was
expressed to Clay.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that the first person to call Clay when he
was released was Bill Belichick, the former Patriots' secondary
coach whose input brought Clay to New England. Belichick told Clay
to be wise about the next team he plays for and to make sure it's a
team that can take advantage of his style. He told him that Clay
has the power to make a great impact on any defense because of his
smarts, his hands, and his ability to make the big play.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are a team that has field-savvy players and usually
keeps them around. Some of the Jets may be a little older, and
maybe they don't have the physical tools of a Tebucky Jones, but
they have the knowledge to make up for it. That's what Clay brought
to the table.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll and Grier felt it was an area they could afford to
downsize and give a younger player a chance. We will watch the
outcome with great interest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every year it comes straight from the de facto captain's mouth.
This is the Patriots' world according to Bruce Armstrong:
</P>
<P>
   --On his new workout philosophy that has created a newly
proportioned body:
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just lifting weights, I had a program. I did the
work. If I wanted to work out four days, I worked out five or six.
Instead of wrapping my workouts around my daily schedule, I wrapped
my daily schedule around my workouts. In the past, if I wanted to
play golf in the day, I used to work out at night. I didn't do that
this year. I was pretty much focused on getting the results I was
looking for. As you get older it gets harder. You have to work
harder. I didn't want to disappoint my teammates or the coaches. I
had to find a way to get something more out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   --On the importance of training camps:
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that I detest training camp, hate it with a
passion, it's a necessary evil. You can't get this kind of
preparation anywhere else. I used to joke with my neighbors in the
offseason about how hard training camp was. In other sports, as a
basketball player you can find five friends for a pickup game. As a
baseball player you can go hit balls and throw. As a football
player, you can't go get 10 of your buddies and go out and beat the
(expletive) out of each other. There's nothing you can do to make
up for it. Training camp has to be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   --On whether Carroll's camps have been hard enough:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been different. The hardest training camp I'd ever been
under was Rod Rust and we went 1-15. We hit both practices with
full pads because Rod thought the team had gotten a little soft
under Raymond Berry. What he wanted was a battle-hardened team. You
have to find the right gauge. There are teams who don't practice in
pads at all. The 49ers never use pads. The Broncos the past couple
of years don't wear pads and they won two Super Bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   --Are the Patriots playing to save the coach's job?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm talking to the players, I'd say, this is a great team
sport. It's full of individual performances. What are you playing
for? For prestige, money to make the team, for a championship? If
you get the most out of each guy no matter what his motivation is,
that's good for the team. I hope everyone's motivation is to win a
championship because then everything takes care of itself. Are you
playing so that your head coach doesn't lose his job? I can't
answer for anyone else, but for me that's not a consideration. I'm
better off if he stays because that means we're winning, and that's
what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   --On the negativity surrounding the team:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a problem. It's shocking to say we'd be
fifth or fourth at best. Nationally, we're not thought of well. But
the year we went to Super Bowl, I said no matter what the
predictions are, you have a chance to disprove them.''
</P>
<P>
   --On the fractured leg that hindered his play last year:
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt for a long time. Hopefully last year was an aberration
and that I can play the way I'm capable of playing. Sometimes it
was fine, and sometimes the pain was shooting. When it hurts, there
was nothing there; I couldn't push off from it. Luckily, it healed.
It shouldn't be a factor. I know what kind of player I am. If I
don't play to the level I think I'm capable of, there's no bigger
critic than me. You have to ask, `Is the guy not playing at the
high level he's accustomed to, or does the guy just suck?' I don't
think I suck. I think I was still contributing to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   --How good the Patriots can be:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's realistic to win at least one game. That's if Drew gets
picked off by a sniper and Ben gets captured by one of those
aliens, and if we had no players. If the people on this team who
have Pro Bowl ability play like Pro Bowlers, then this team can win
it all. This team had some great moments. As long I've played, we
never could beat Pittsburgh at Pittsburgh, we beat San Franciso in
a big game, and the Buffalo and Miami games we won gave me the best
feelings I've ever had after a football game. We didn't quit, and
something good came out of it. We also had some times when guys
were hurt and had some problems. The bottom line is I want to win.
All you can do is get that across to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A call was placed to Ray Anderson's Atlanta office Thursday
afternoon, but the agent who represents Milloy didn't return it. It
wasn't until Friday morning when Anderson called this reporter.
``Sorry I couldn't get back to you,'' said Anderson. ``There were
some real-life things going on that I couldn't avoid.'' Anderson's
office is located in the building in Atlanta where a gunman opened
fire on workers. Anderson and his staff, advised that the gunman
was in the building, ran for their lives into the street. We were
glad to hear from Anderson Friday morning . . . Anderson was the
man who filed the complaint against Tank Black that got Black
de-certified by the players union Wednesday. Black has 20 days to
appeal, and it's almost certain Anderson will have to testify
against Black for alleged recruiting violations. Anderson was
especially peeved about Black's recent comments that he was being
targeted because he was black. Anderson, who is also black, said,
``The people he's screwed the most over the years are
African-Americans. How can he say that?'' . . . Despite problems
between management and 10-time All-Pro Vikings left guard Randall
McDaniel, he has committed to the team for the next two years amid
rumors he was retiring. McDaniel had been promised by former vice
president Jeff Diamond, now with the Tennessee Titans, that he
would have his deal redone after last season because he was the
third-highest paid offensive lineman on the team. A future Hall of
Famer shouldn't be third. But McDaniel decided to honor the final
two years, though he's not doing it without a bitter tone in his
voice that may be disruptive to Dennis Green in the future . . .
The Jamal Anderson contract situation gets nuttier by the day. It's
one thing to nickel and dime the best running back in the NFC (with
Barry Sanders gone), but it's another to insult him. Anderson is
asking to be in the same echelon with Terrell Davis, and on higher
one than Marshall Faulk. Seems sensible. Then what's the holdup? If
he's available a second time and the Patriots don't bite, even if
it means releasing another veteran or two, shame on them . . . The
Bengals are demanding a first- and a third-round pick from
Baltimore for the services of disgruntled wide receiver Carl
Pickens. Right now the Ravens are offering only a two and a five,
which is the deal the Colts made with the Rams for Faulk. Right
now, it doesn't appear there will be a trade, and it looks more and
more as if Pickens will stage a holdout, perhaps for the entire
season . . . Mike Ditka may be using his own plane on road trips.
He recently purchased a plane and flew to the team's training
center in LaCrosse, Wisc. Wonder if anyone will ask, ``Why doesn't
he fly with the team?'' . . . It sure looks like former Denver
backup Jeff Lewis is being groomed to be the starter in Carolina.
While George Seifert insists it's Steve Beuerlein's job to lose, he
may lose it quicker than anticipated. The Panthers reworked Lewis's
deal, giving him a $1.2 million signing bonus and salaries of $1.5
million in 2000, $3 million in 2001, and 3.75 million in 2002.
Seifert said, ``Steve Beuerlein is still our starting quarterback,
and it's still a competitive situation.'' You can see now where
Carroll gets his coachspeak . . . Can you imagine with all that's
going on in the world, agent Fletcher Smith actually tried to use
the race card against the Eagles in negotiations with Donovan
McNabb? If Black gets decertified for giving out money and gifts to
college recruits, then what should happen to a guy who brings up
something so ridiculous in negotiations for a rookie football
player? He claimed that white quarterbacks like Peyton Manning,
Ryan Leaf, and Tim Couch all received the popular voidable years in
their contracts, but the Eagles wouldn't give him any because
McNabb is a black quarterback. The Eagles should have been a lot
more insulted than to have worked out a deal so quickly after those
comments.

LEONARD FOCUSING ON RYDER CUP SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Just two weeks ago at Carnoustie in Scotland,
Justin Leonard suddenly found himself being handed an opportunity
to win his second British Open when Jean Van de Velde, the leader
by three shots, blew up with a triple bogey on the 72d hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be for Leonard, however, as Scotland's own Paul
Lawrie ran away from both him and Van de Velde in the four-hole
playoff with birdies on the third and final playoff holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still pretty tough,'' said Leonard as he recalled the
events at Carnoustie while he paused between rounds at this
weekend's Greater Hartford Open. ``I feel good about the things I
did, the decisions that I made. You know, hindsight is 20/20. If
I'd have known, I would have done things differently. At the time,
I think I made all the right decisions, and that feels good. It
certainly makes it easier. But it's tough to go through that for
four days and to get so close and just have four holes between
three guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two birdies on the last two holes would have been very hard to
beat. But if you go through all that and be so close to winning, it
really would have been something special.''
</P>
<P>
   There were various reactions in Dallas, his home town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through the story quite a few times,'' said Leonard.
``People have asked me, `When did you know? Where were you? What
was going on?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny to hear the stories about where my friends were and
what they were doing and how they had all turned their TVs off and
started doing something else. All of a sudden somebody called and
said, `You've got to flip it back on.' That happened to just about
everybody. My friends and family were great. Nothing but positives.
Those kind of things certainly help you get over something. I think
any golf fan was pretty surprised in watching what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup has been high on Leonard's list of priorities.
``It's a great event,'' he said. ``It's unique. Playing with the
best 12 players from the US and to be a part of that group and be
together in some social occasions is great. I had as much fun in
the practice rounds and going to dinner two years ago at Valderrama
as you could want to have. It's a different kind of fun from the
actual competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed that . . . to be able to get in a situation where
you're pulling together and you just have one goal in mind. Right
now, I'm not thinking about Ryder Cup. I'm working harder to
impress my caddie. I figure if I play well these next three weeks,
that's all I can do, and hopefully everything will take care of
itself.''

   The LPGA returns to Pleasant Valley CC in Sutton, Mass., this
week for the first time since Pat Bradley was a rookie in 1974 and
the LPGA Championship was there. This fills a void on the New
England calendar, since the Friendly's tournament left Crestview CC
in Agawam and Welch's event left Blue Hills CC after last year.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA sold the rights to the event to Entertainment Sports
Equities of Brighton, and after a lengthy search for a title
sponsor, the event will be known as the areaWeb.com Challenge.
``Everything's in full gear,'' says ESE's Frank Neer. ``The tents
are up. The sky boxes are up.'' There has been talk the sponsorship
money isn't there. Neer said it is.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk that other big sports events in Greater
Boston this year has strapped the corporate coffers, which has hurt
the LPGA event. ``What should be talked about,'' said Neer, ``is
that Boston has been blessed to have these events. The All-Star
Game, the Davis Cup, and the Ryder Cup won't be in the area next
year. The LPGA will.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament falls between the LPGA's fourth and final major
championship _ the du Maurier _ and the Weetabix British Women's
Open. The field seemed to be outstanding, but late defections by
SeRi Pak, who won the LPGA Championship and the US Women's Open
last year, Karrie Webb, and Kelly Robbins leave just five of the
top 11 money winners in the field: No. 3 Lori Kane, No. 7 Dottie
Pepper, No. 8 Sherri Steinhauer, No. 9 Kelli Kuehne, and No. 11
Rachel Hetherington.

   David Duval, who stirred up the embers over a potential boycott
of the Ryder Cup in years to come, leaves the GHO Sunday night for
a flight to southern California and Monday's played-for-TV match
with Tiger Woods. The winner of the 18-hole match will collect $1.2
million. ``The way I look at it,'' said Duval, ``is it may bring a
few more people into the game. Because of the time it's going to be
on television, it'll hopefully be exposed to people who
traditionally don't tune in on Sunday afternoon. It's a showcase.
In the end, is it important who wins, and is it important to our
careers? Probably not.'' Duval was somewhat apprehensive when the
proposal was initially advanced. ``I didn't want it to be perceived
as an elitist competition,'' he said. ``It seems to me it has
become something that's an exposure of golf. It just happens
Tiger's 1 and I'm 2. I think it's pretty fair to say the most
important player of the match is Tiger, because of his popularity,
and the brightness of his star is certainly a lot greater than
mine. Once I realized we had to separate ourselves, I felt good
about it.''

   Golfers are taking to the vineyards. David Frost seized the
opportunity to have a little wine-tasting gathering in the press
building on Wednesday night, and Greg Norman has a gala planned for
Monday and Tuesday ending on his yacht. ``I grew the grapes,'' said
Frost. ``He's just putting his name on the label.'' Frost, who grew

on the PGA Tour. ``I don't feel I'm out to prove anything when I go
out and play now,'' he said. ``I feel what happened last year was a
dream year. But I feel throughout my career I've been a very
consistent uplayer. I've had a little bit of ups and downs, but
when you look at the PGA Tour media guide and see how many times
I've finished in the top 30, how many times I've traveled around
the world and played here, it's a lot. This is my 14th event in the
US, but I've traveled around the globe quite a bit already.
Needless to say, I'm trying to capitalize on what happened last
year. Let's face it. I don't draw galleries like Tiger Woods and
Greg Norman, but I sat down last year and put a game plan together
with my manager. I said, `This is what I want to do. Now is my time
to shine a little bit.' I'm not 27. I'm not 32. I don't need to
worry about burning myself out. I need to think about trying to
capitalize on what happened last year, and I'm trying to do that.
If somebody sits me down in the media room and says, `You should
not have done that,' my banker says I should and my wife says I
should. I'm 42; I'm not a kid. I'm going to play this year and next
year, and then I'm going to back off and do more things with my
family. I may not play that much after next year. I might back down
really a lot.'' . . . There are no Ryder Cup tickets available at
this address.

VALENTIN FLY BALL BROUGHT FAIR RESULT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-KEY PLAY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When John Valentin hit a fly ball into the left-field
corner Saturday, the universal sign for victory changed. The
split-fingered salute favored by war heroes returning home and
former president Richard Nixon became a two-handed gesture. After
the Red Sox' 6-5 victory over the Yankees, members of both teams
could be seen holding their hands 1 foot apart.
</P>
<P>
   For the Yankees, the gesture illustrated the narrow margin of
the Boston triumph. Manager Joe Torre, third baseman Scott Brosius,
and left fielder Shane Spencer held up their hands and looked down
at a distance so small they could only smile and shake their heads.
For the home team, the gesture was thanks for the peculiarities of
Fenway Park. Those steeped in Red Sox lore know the difference a
foot and a favorable breeze can make in matters foul or fair. Both
sides used the two-handed signal as an explanation of the Red Sox'
winning play.
</P>
<P>
   With the stage set for a come-from-behind victory in the ninth,
Boston fans held their breath as Valentin's shot to left traveled
along the foul line. The Yankee infielders and outfielders were
playing shallow with Jose Offerman representing the winning run on
third. The ball traveled past Spencer on a trajectory that deviated
little from the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee left fielder could only hope for interference by a
fan or for it to go foul. The angle of the ball and its distance
precluded any chance for Spencer to throw out Offerman at the plate
if he caught it. The ball dropped behind the left-field stands and
beyond the view of the anxious crowd. It fell just a foot inside
the line, ending the game as Offerman scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I hit it, I thought it was foul,'' said Valentin.
``But as I looked at it, it started to just stay there. It didn't
hook at all. When it didn't hook, I kind of knew it was going to
come back fair from just the experience of playing here. I've seen
so many balls come back to the left fielder. I was just hoping it
did so he could catch and, basically, (I'd have) a sacrifice fly to
win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was left with a Catch-22. In the visiting clubhouse, no
one wanted to talk about the outfielder's RBI or his fifth multihit
game this season. Yet, there really was no play. Whether he caught
the ball or let it drop, as he did, home plate was out of reach.
The second-year player denied that left field at Fenway was the
most difficult corner he has patrolled, ranking Yankee Stadium
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It carried,'' he said of Valentin's drive, which fell
approximately 5 feet short of the wall. ``It got up there and was
foul and kept carrying. It was foul for a while and then it just
came back. Anything toward the (warning) track, you pretty much
know you're not going to be able to make a play anyways. That's why
we were playing real shallow. That's all you can do right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, who had a good view of the play from third base,
thought the ball would stay foul. He agreed that Spencer made the
right decision and complimented Valentin for sending the ball to
the right spot.
</P>
<P>
   Added Torre as he opened his hands a foot wide, ``We can't see,
but we could guess what happened. That if he does catch the ball,
(Offerman's) going to score anyway. The ball was foul and it blew
back and it was fair, I guess, by yea much at the end. It's a
decision that you make there and I can't fault that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Red Sox dugout faces left field and has
unobstructed sight lines to the foul pole, Torre's counterpart
didn't have a much better sense of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even see third base from where I am,'' Jimy Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   But his third base coach saw all that he needed. Wendell Kim
watched the wind blow the ball back. He also saw the ball blow far
enough away from the fans that they had no chance to interfere. The
coach told Offerman to stay at third until the outfielder caught
the ball or let it drop. Kim said making a play facing the wall was
difficult, because the outfielder must stop and turn around to have
any chance of reaching his target.
</P>
<P>
   A 305-foot throw looks very long when a 1-foot difference can
decide a one-run ballgame.

 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sometimes we forget this is a different Red Sox team.
They know they can't win games by trading cannon shots with a club
like the New York Yankees. But on any given day they can bump and
grind and beat anybody. That's especially true at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody understands this more than veteran third baseman John
Valentin, one of the heroes of Saturday's 6-5 victory over New
York. Twice he drove in the tying run to overcome deficits of 2-0
and 5-4. In the ninth inning, he won it with a moon shot to left
field that fell for a single, scoring Jose Offerman, who had
tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin accomplished all this, mind you, while facing Roger
Clemens and two excellent relievers in Jason Grimsley and Ramiro
Mendoza. Later, after the sellout crowd of 33,179 had departed,
Valentin summed it all up logically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approach all the games the same way, every day,'' he said.
``Sure, it's a little more exciting when the Yankees come in. But
that's because the fans make it so. Basically, we pitched well
today and that gave us an opportunity to score runs. Our style is
almost like a National League style, unlike Red Sox teams of the
past. We're a team that puts the ball in play. When you do that
you're going to get contributions from all sorts of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody gave Valentin and his teammates much of a chance against
Clemens, who came in with a 3-0 record in five career starts
against Boston, two of the victories coming with Toronto. The other
was a 4-1 decision May 19 at Yankee Stadium, and twice he had
no-decisions. Saturday, Clemens was given a 2-0 lead in the first
inning, but it vanished in the third as quickly as you could say
Trot Nixon. The rookie's home run was followed by a walk to
Offerman, a stolen base, a wild pitch, and a sacrifice fly. They
score like that all the time in the senior circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who had taken the opener of this weekend series,
13-3, Friday night, took a 5-2 lead but single runs by Boston in
the fifth and sixth ended Clemens's day. In the seventh, Offerman
walked and again scored, this time on a wall double by Valentin.
Then came the kind of ninth inning that can only happen at Fenway.
A shot to the triangle that Offerman turned into a triple followed
by a fly ball that gave Boston the win. ``I knew it was going to
come back,'' said Valentin. ``The left fielder let it drop because
if he'd caught the ball, it would have been a sacrifice, game over.
Anything that is hit into the air on the line usually comes back
into fair play. I was hoping it would do that, and that's exactly
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin has 10 home runs this season but is happy to settle for
the kind of hits he got Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job,'' he said. ``I try to play hard and do the best
I can when I'm out there. Offerman got on base a bunch of times and
did a good job. The bullpen did a great job against a good hitting
team. All around, we did a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you face a Roger Clemens, you come out prepared for his
best game. He had some control problems and he got in trouble. He's
still Roger Clemens. He still pitched very good. We were just able
to tie the game and win it.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Valentin also worked his magic on defense,
robbing Scott Brosius of a sure double with a leaping catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to time my leap just right so I could catch the
ball,'' Valentin said. ``But it wasn't hit that hard and if it had
gotten by, it would have caused some trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   What Valentin did Saturday was something his teammates have been
doing a good portion of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence in everybody who comes to the plate, be it
veteran or a first-year player,'' Valentin said. ``We stick
together.''

REVOLUTION QUELLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Ariel Graziani displayed some inspiring touches and
excellent offensive instincts in his Revolution debut
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. But Graziani could not be expected to solve the
team's defensive problems and lack of midfield spark during a 4-1
loss to the Tampa Bay Mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This was a demoralizing defeat, the Revolution's third in
succession, as once again they did not appear competitive, falling
behind early and displaying few resourceful qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the team could change with the return of John
Harkes and Joe-Max Moore from US national team duty, possibly in
time for Friday's visit to Colorado. But, like Graziani, neither
can be expected to solve the Revolution's defensive
vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will have to regroup quickly to avoid a prolonged
slump such as the nine-game losing streaks they endured the last
two seasons. They are in fourth place in the Eastern Conference
with 18 points in 19 games, but have earned points in only one game
since June 19, a win over the Mutiny. And they have been outscored,
11-3, in the last three matches.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they surrendered a sixth-minute goal to Raul Diaz
Arce, then seemed to be fighting an uphill battle, bogged down by
lack of possession and straining against the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Carlos Valderrama directed the Mutiny offense. Or,
more accurately, he wandered around the Raymond James Stadium field
and dissected the Revolution with slick touches and sharp passes.
The Revolution had few responses, and Valderrama and Mauricio Ramos
were virtually untouched as they applied pressure in the offensive
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave Valderrama too much room,'' said Revolution defender
Dan Calichman, who departed at halftime after reinjuring his hip.
``He was on the ball too much and he hurt us pretty badly. We were
late to balls all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running fine in the first half. The injury is not an
excuse for letting in two goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had avoided early deficits and appeared to have a
more organized defense under player-coach Walter Zenga this season.
But the team's weaknesses have become apparent in recent games.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal set the tone for the game. Diaz Arce, who scored
18 goals for the Revolution last year, outmanuevered Ted
Chronopoulos near the penalty spot as Valderrama curled a pass over
the defense in the sixth minute. Diaz Arce trapped the ball and had
time to slot the shot low to Zenga's left.
</P>
<P>
   Chronopoulos had actually played Diaz Arce offside, but teammate
Mario Gori kept him onside. Gori, though, should not be blamed,
since this was not a situation for an offside trap, especially
against a goal-poacher such as Diaz Arce.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani provided a threat almost immediately. But the
Revolution struggled to link between midfield and attack, so he was
seldom in a scoring position in the first half. His first shot, in
the second minute, was a leftfooted laser just wide from 30 yards.
Midway through the half, Graziani simply touched on a through ball
to send Jamar Beasley into the penalty area, but Beasley squandered
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution nearly tied the score when Jair sent Graziani in
alone on goalkeeper Scott Garlick, but Graziani chipped the shot
onto the top of the net in the 43d minute. Seconds later,
Valderrama sent Diaz Arce in on Zenga, and Diaz Arce found Musa
Shannon in front of an open goal for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny clinched the win as Valderrama set up Steve Ralston
for a give-and-go, with Ralston converting in the 55th minute.
Substitute Carlos Parra drilled a 30-yard blast for the Revolution
in the 76th minute, and Diaz Arce scored again in the 88th minute.

ARMSTRONG PROVING INSPIRATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Haussmann has a message for the thousands of people who
have been calling, writing, and e-mailing the Lance Armstrong
Foundation: ``Please be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Armstrong won the Tour de France last Sunday, the
foundation that he helped create in his hometown of Austin, Texas,
in December 1997 has been deluged _ not just by cycling fans
responding to his feat of becoming only the second American to win
the race, but by people awed by his comeback from life-threatening
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Haussmann, executive director of the foundation, said he first
caught wind of the magnitude of interest soon after Armstrong had
crossed the finish line in Paris. More than 500 e-mails were dashed
off even as TV viewers watched the American raise his hands in
victory on the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came in the next day, there were too many, and we had
some trouble with the system,'' he said. ``But it's a great
problem. We're loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   The correspondence ranges from congratulations for Armstrong, to
questions about how one can help his foundation, to personal
stories from others who have battled cancer and found the cyclist
an inspiration. ``Those are the most heart-wrenching,'' Haussmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   All this electronic response has convinced Haussmann that it's a
good thing the US Postal Service team didn't let Armstrong, a
computerphile, take his laptop on the road. In an interview during
the Tour, Armstrong said he was answering as many e-mails as he
could, although he answered only ones about testicular or
urological cancer, his initial diagnosis. ``I can't respond to
every one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong discovered that often it's not the patient who writes
the e-mails. ``Mostly they come from a family member or a friend,
so when I contact them, they have no idea how I got their
address,'' he said, smiling at the Secret Santa-like role he was
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, which has an endorsement deal with Armstrong, donated
$25,000 to the foundation, which according to Haussmann has raised
more than $1 million for research, education, and awareness of
testicular cancer _ most from much smaller donations.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation holds a fund-raising ``Race for the Roses'' over
Memorial Day weekend, which includes a road race and criterium
(both of which Armstrong rides in) as well as a family and kids
race. Those who raise $3,000 in pledges are flown to Austin to
participate in the race and parties. Last year 150 reached that
level of pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong flew to the United States last week for a whirlwind
tour of talk shows and other appearances, including a press
conference in New York at which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proclaimed
last Thursday Lance Armstrong Day. Now Armstrong is back in Europe,
wearing the yellow jersey in criteriums in different cities, a
tradition for the Tour de France winner.
</P>
<P>
   Next week he and his wife, Kristin, will fly back to Austin,
where he'll likely be welcomed with a parade. And he'll get to see
Haussmann, who has been busy with all the correspondence pouring
into the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a nice kind of busy,'' he said.
</P>

SANTERRE'S RIDING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Andy Santerre's long, uphill climb began in
February when he suffered multiple fractures of his right leg in a
crash at the Busch Series opener at Daytona International Speedway.
Against all odds, Santerre fought to get back on his feet and back
behind the wheel of his Busch Series car _ with some sense of
trepidation, of course _ only to face even more adversity when he
failed to qualify in his first two races back at Dover, Del., and
South Boston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with self-doubt, Santerre wondered if he was capable of
driving the No. 47 Monro/Muffler Brake Chevrolet for car owner
George deBidart. After receiving a vote of confidence in a June 13
closed-door meeting with his owner and Innovative Motorsports
teammates, Santerre emerged with a sense of restored confidence.
</P>
<P>
   It showed last month when the 30-year-old native of Cherryfield,
Maine, returned to his New England roots and won a Busch North
Series event at New Hampshire International Speedway, where he had
never won before. Last Saturday, that victory helped catapult him
to another, his first Busch Series triumph of his career at Pikes
Peak, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going up to New Hampshire and winning there was special to
me,'' said Santerre. ``I got the chance to go back home and to be
with family and friends. It gave me a big boost of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly enough, Santerre's ascent to the heights of euphoria
came in the rarefied air of Pikes Peak International Raceway, where
he started 20th, ran door-to-door with Dale Earnhardt Jr. before
taking the lead from him with 16 laps to go, and, finally, fought
off runner-up Tim Fedewa to win the NAPA AutoCare 250.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, it's been a tough year for us,'' said Santerre,
who carried so many expectations into his sophomore campaign in the
Busch Series after winning Rookie of the Year honors last season.
``We had a lot of lows, with the first one being Daytona. We went
into that one with our heads high, thinking we were coming off a
pretty good freshman year. We had a lot of expectations here at
Innovative Motorsports.''
</P>
<P>
   But his crash at Daytona, which resulted in a four-month layoff,
proved the first and foremost of the obstacles Santerre faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tough to deal with that, so we put Elliott
Sadler in our car and he had some pretty good runs, but he also had
some problems with engines and whatnot,'' Santerre said. ``It was a
tough start, but I came back and thought I was in A-1 shape and
thought I was ready to get back in, but we missed the first two
races and couldn't qualify. At that point, I was pretty down on
myself, and I'd been through a lot, and I didn't really know if I
was doing the right thing by coming back. . . . I sat down with my
team and my car owner and said, `Hey guys, you know you're better
than this, and you've run decent with Elliott, and you deserve
better. If I'm the weak link here, I'm going to do something about
it and step aside and let someone else drive the car.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But my car owner would have no part of that,'' Santerre added.
``He said, `If you want to drive, you're our guy, you're our
driver.' He said, `If there's anybody here that doesn't want to
stick behind you, they can leave now.' But the whole team said,
`No, no. We want Andy to drive.' So this first win was for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for them, I probably wouldn't be here because I
was going to step aside and let somebody else take over. But they
wanted to stick with me and encouraged me to stay. It worked out
pretty well, and I'm glad I stayed now,'' said Santerre heading
into Saturday night's Gateway 200 at Gateway International Speedway
in St. Louis.
</P>

<P>
   Jack Birmingham, a 57-year-old businessman from Boston, threw
his hat into the ring as a NASCAR Winston Cup owner this week by
purchasing Bahari Racing from Chuck Rider. Birmingham, who has
homes in Osterville and Vero Beach, Fla., indicated that Derrike
Cope will remain as driver of the No. 30 Pontiac through the end of
the 1999 season, but he did not make any commitments to Cope or the
rest of the team beyond that. ``I've been looking to retain a
business interest in the sport for some time,'' Birmingham told the
Associated Press. ``This seemed like it would be a challenge but a
lot of fun, too.'' There will be plenty of challenges as Birmingham
assumes control of a team _ which he plans to rename Bahari-Eel
River Racing _ that has won five poles and no races in 13 seasons
on the Winston Cup circuit. ``I think purchasing Bahari Racing
gives us an opportunity to turn the fortunes of the team around and
eventually go on to be a winning Winston Cup team,'' said
Birmingham . . . After he was knocked out of third place by a Turn
3 crash in the July 11 Jiffy Lube 300 at NHIS, Bobby Labonte
rebounded last weekend by winning the Pennsylvania 500 NASCAR
Winston Cup race at Pocono, Pa., marking a clean sweep of both
events at the track. ``It wasn't a pretty picture,'' Labonte said
of his NHIS wreck, which totaled the car he had driven to victory
at Pocono in June. ``I know when I got out of the car, I was trying
to tell them what was wrong with it. I told (crew chief) Jimmy
(Makar), `You think you can get it back by Pocono?' He said, `I
don't think so.' '' Labonte's victory, his third of the season,
enabled him to climb to third in the standings with 2,731 points,
almost 300 behind leader Dale Jarrett (3,014) . . . Next stop for
the NASCAR Winston Cup Series: Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Jeff
Gordon, a homegrown Hoosier from Pittsboro, Ind., will make a
triumphant homecoming Saturday for the Brickyard 400. Gordon won
the inaugural race in 1994, a momentous victory he credited for
launching his career. ``When you grow up racing in and around
Indianapolis,'' said Gordon, who also won the 1996 Brickyard 400,
``you can't help but dream of one day racing at one of the greatest
speedways in the world. Once I decided my future was in stock car
racing, I figured I might never have the chance to race at Indy.
But when NASCAR made the announcement that the Winston Cup Series
was going to race at Indy, I couldn't believe it. To be able to go
out and win that first race was a very emotional experience.'' . .
. The Indy Racing League resumes action Sunday in the MBNA
Mid-Atlantic 200 at Dover, Del. Eddie Cheever Jr. is one driver who
hopes not to reprise his performance of a year ago when he and
former teammate Robby Unser tore up a lot of expensive equipment at
Dover's Monster Mile. ``I had just come from the big prize money
win at Indy and proceeded to leave Dover with $800,000 less on my
balance sheet,'' Cheever recalled. ``It was the fastest dissipation
of assets in my life . . . with the exception of my divorce.''

FINLEY STAYS AND LOSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Chuck Finley did not clean out his locker Saturday. He
did not say his goodbyes or make travel arrangements to Cleveland
or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Finley pitched.
</P>
<P>
   The trading deadline passed at 9 p.m. Saturday and Finley was
still an Angel. In fact, Finley was the losing pitcher in the
Angels' 8-0 loss to the Minnesota Twins before 37,011 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (5-10) gave up five runs and eight hits in six-plus
innings. The Angels have now lost 14 of their past 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who said he would waive his trade veto rights if it
meant going to Cleveland or New York, never got the opportunity to
say yes or no to a trade.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Angels general manager Bill Bavasi couldn't come
to an agreement with Indians general manager John Hart. The
Yankees, Bavasi said, were never serious contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really put myself anywhere else but here,'' Finley
said. ``I'm not disappointed I'm here. . . . Any player would be
crazy not to want to be in a situation like Cleveland or New York.
But I'm deeply rooted in this team. Nobody in this clubhouse has
experienced the highs and lows except the two trainers, (vice
president) Tim Mead and Billy Bavasi. The high point came in '86
and the low point is right now. It's no fun, but I know there are
good times ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't be until next year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi and Hart agreed that speedy Indians second baseman
Enrique Wilson would be part of a package for Finley. But that was
all they could agree on. Bavasi wanted three minor-league pitchers
included in the deal, but Hart would only give up two. The Angels
had interest in Willie Martinez, David Riske and Jared Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a main player (Wilson) and we felt pretty good about
him,'' Bavasi said. ``We wanted to make sure there was enough
behind him to make the deal worthwhile. So probably from their
point of view we were looking for too much behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said Hart called him at 1:15 p.m. Saturday and said he
wouldn't meet the Angels' demands. And that was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning we gave them a group of players, what it would
take, and left it there,'' Bavasi said. ``There were further
discussions throughout the day, but we didn't feel we should lower
the bar and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, when Bavasi felt bad about not making a deal
at the deadline, Bavasi said he felt fine about not trading Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the very, very few times, and it'll probably
never happen again, when we were in a win-win situation,'' he said.
``We were doing this in part for us and in part for (Finley). If a
deal went though or if it didn't go through, we felt we couldn't
lose. In talking to Chuck, he felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years with the Angels, Finley said he doesn't know how
he would have responded to a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to say goodbye to my teammates,'' he said. ``I
don't know what would have happened if it had gotten to that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bavasi said he was a little surprised a deal wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Finley) was a special commodity in the market because of his
status as a Yankee killer,'' Bavasi said. ``So I thought yeah, (the
Indians) would do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees apparently made plenty of noise but never were
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one serious team and the other team was a mirage,''
Bavasi said. ``The second team, it took us a day or two to flush
them out and get them to admit they were a mirage and quit calling
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said it was a relief to have the process over,
considering it was Finley who was being discussed. After all, it
was Bavasi's father Buzzie who let Nolan Ryan get away 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is in his 14th season with the team, the longest tenure
of any player in franchise history. (Brian Downing played 13
seasons, 1978-90). Finley holds club records in games pitched
(425), victories (158), starts (358) and innings pitched (2,590).

NEWPORT HAS CHANCE TO RENEW GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 11 weeks the gun will sound in Auckland, New
Zealand, to begin an America's Cup competition that could return
the oldest trophy in sports to Newport, R.I., its home for 132
years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since 1987 that the New York Yacht Club
has had the chance to compete for the Cup. Because in the Cup's
most recent US residency it was held by another club, the San Diego
Yacht Club, the New Yorkers who had lost it in 1983 were not able
to mount a challenge to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   But since New Zealand won the Cup from San Diego in 1995, New
York now has a clear shot at reclaiming it through a series of
challenger round-robins _ the Louis Vuitton Cup _ capped in
February by a best-of-seven series between New Zealand and the
surviving challenger.
</P>
<P>
   While it is far too early to ante up the bets, the early
handicapping has Young America, John Marshall's second attempt with
the 1995 PACT syndicate, in the top three.
</P>
<P>
   The other choices to win the 31st America's Cup are the single
defender, New Zealand, and Italy's Prada syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, 12 years ago, the betting also would have gone to the
New York Yacht Club to win the Cup back in Fremantle, Australia. It
had plenty of money, a reason to be inspired, and what seemed a
strong young team with John Kolius at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   But in any sport, expert guesses are still just guesses, and the
1987 New York entry in Fremantle came apart like a blown spinnaker.
Dennis Conner (the Cup's loser three years before) went on to beat
the Aussies and take the Cup to San Diego, where it resided until
New Zealand won it eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   So take all early bets with about as much salt as they deserve
here, three months before we see anything like relative team
strength. That will be apparant only when boats sail in anger in
Auckland on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But should New York prevail in February and bring the Cup back
to Harbour Court, New York City's Newport outpost, or to its empty
pedastal in Manhattan, it will have a broad representation of
sailors and boatbuilders from New England.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Young America is based in South Portland, Maine,
home state of CEO John Marshall. The waterfront training facility
is in Quonsett, R.I., the state in which both New York racing boats
are being built, at Goetz Boat Builders in Bristol. The spars are
coming from Hall Spars in Rhode Island, and North Sails in
Connecticut is building most of the challengers' sails.
</P>
<P>
   The newest member of the Young America team is JB Braun, vice
president of Doyle Sailmakers in Marblehead, who will be manager of
the sail program for the New Yorkers. Aside from his many national
titles in a variety of boats _ Mumm 30, Melges 30, Flying Dutchman,
and 505s _ Braun's most noteworthy achievement was taking the helm
of the 80-foot Nicorette for a world record-setting Atlantic
crossing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Young America will have two boats in New Zealand, one to be
launched in early August and the second coming in the fall.
According to Bob Campbell, vice president of operations for Young
America, the boats are similar enough so they can leapfrog in their
progress through the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making them radically different is too big a chance,'' says
Campbell, a veteran of both Bill Koch's Cup winner and the Conner
campaigns. ``There are slight variations, but we still believe that
we always have to know where we are and work to get better. When
one boat is radically different, you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young America will not be the first US challenger in the water
this Cup season. On May 26, Dawn Riley's America True campaign,
based in San Francisco, launched the first US boat, after Italy's
Team Prada became the first challenger in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Some other developments on the America's Cup scene:
</P>
<P>
   --Also based in San Francisco is Paul Cayard's America One
Challenge. Fresh from his Whitbread round-the-world victory last
year, Cayard will helm the new boat, launched this month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Cayard helmed Italy's Il Moro team to a semifinal
victory in San Diego, beating the favored New Zealand team for the
honor of losing to Bill Koch's America/3 in The Match. In 1995,
Conner chose Cayard as his co-helmsman on Stars &AMP; Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   --Though Conner's winning 1987 Stars &AMP; Stripes team trained in
Hawaii, the first America's Cup Class yacht ever built in that
state, Abracadabra 2000, was launched and christened on June 12.
This Waikiki Yacht Club challenge, Aloha Racing, is skippered by
Kolius, whose Cup background stems from 1983, when he helmed
Courageous, the trial horse for Tom Blackaller and Gary Jobson's
Defender. Some believe that Kolius and the Courageous team could
have given Conner's Liberty campaign a better fight for the
defender's role in '83, the year Conner lost the Cup to the
Australians.
</P>
<P>
   --Still at it after 25 years, Conner will be the last American
to launch his boat; it will happen this week. Though based in San
Diego, Stars &AMP; Stripes 2000 built its single boat at New England
Boatworks in Portsmouth, R.I. From there it will be shipped
straight to Auckland to begin trials.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't expect to see the Fremantle Doctor _ the big onshore
wind that came up almost daily in Australia's Cup season, creating
a condition known as ``full-blown survival'' sailing. New Zealand
has a strong wind, but often it blows offshore, so the seas stay
flat. When it comes out of the Northeast, wind and sea are so heavy
that they are well out of range of IACC yachts, at least in the
trials. Sustained wind above 23 knots will allow for an abandoned
race in the trials. There have been no wind limits set yet for The
Match in February.

BIRTHPLACE OF GOLF MUST DECIDE ON PLANS FOR EXPLOITATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ In the 15th century, there were so many
golf balls flying around the open, windswept fields here that King
James II briefly banned the game on Sundays because his archers
couldn't practice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, it would have been heresy to suggest, as
the king did in 1457, that there were too many golf courses and too
many golfers in the town that is the birthplace of golf.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just what some of the 14,500 residents here believe,
and they have mounted what may be a quixotic attempt to prevent
their quaint, medieval university town from being turned into what
they see as a tacky golf theme park with perpetual gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the town's community council will decide whether to
launch a legal challenge to block the construction of a hotel, two
courses, and a conference center on what used to be Kingask farm, a
500-acre tract that runs along St. Andrews Bay with breathtaking
views of the town and the Firth of Tay.
</P>
<P>
   There are already six golf courses in St. Andrews, including the
proudly public Old Course, arguably the world's most famous, and
the snooty private Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club, headquarters of the
game's governing body. About 300,000 visitors come here every year,
many of them to enter the daily lottery for the privilege of
playing the Old Course. About one in five gets picked.
</P>
<P>
   As the popularity of golf continues to soar internationally,
there is no shortage of developers who believe that the demand to
play here will only increase. Besides the Kingask development,
there are two other proposals in the pipeline that would add three
more courses near the town.
</P>
<P>
   For Frank Riddell, the mild-mannered chemistry professor who has
emerged as the unlikely leader of those trying to stop the Kingask
project, the implications are stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't stop this one, we can't stop any,'' he said. ``The
town as we know it will cease to exist. The goose that lays the
golden golf egg will be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Iain MacKinnon, the local representative of St. Andrews Bay
Development Co., the American-based company that is behind the $80
million Kingask project, the 300 jobs and what he called ``a
first-class facility'' far outweigh claims about the streets and
the Old Course being clogged with more golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell and MacKinnon live four doors away from each other. They
are not on speaking terms.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this is just a variation on the NIMBY argument,
altered slightly to NOMBN, Not On My Back Nine. But on closer
inspection, this is not just a battle over a few new golf courses
but a war over who owns St. Andrews, and it is a war of epic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   It has split families, made neighbors enemies, and reignited the
smoldering class warfare epitomized by the schism between
university types and townies. It has, says Craig Nisbet, who runs
the weekly newspaper, the St. Andrews Citizen, ``divided this town
like never before.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a small, friendly place, where everybody knows everybody
else's business, or thinks they do. There are two levels of
conversation: public and private. Private ones reveal the extent of
the split here. People's English accents are commented on, as is
the length of time they have lived here. Class distinctions are
held up as either an indictment or validation of character.
</P>
<P>
   Those most opposed to or most in favor of the Kingask
development say they do not want to cast aspersions on the motives
of others, but they invariably do.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the development are derided as hypocritical
snobs who are biting that hand that has long fed St. Andrews. They
are accused of wearing rose-colored glasses, of extolling the
town's university and medieval architecture while ignoring the
empty shops and shabby apartments where students are crammed in to
maximize profits for university-connected landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the Kingask project are dismissed as shallow,
money-hungry Judases, willing to sell the town's character for a
few pieces of silver.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stereotypes, however, are strongly held beliefs on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his modest university office, somewhere between a
driver and a three-wood from the Old Course, Riddell talks
passionately about preserving the character of the town, one that
is as much if not more rooted in its medieval heritage as in its
place in golf history. As chairman of the community council, he has
molded a grass-roots movement that looks at something other than
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews was once the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, and
its university was founded in 1410, the first in Scotland and the
third in Britain, after Oxford and Cambridge. Like Oxford and
Cambridge, the St. Andrews campus dominates the town, its buildings
extending everywhere. Those buildings and other examples of
medieval architecture are already crumbling under the weight of
tourist traffic, Riddell says.
</P>
<P>
   The Fife Council, which represents the region, overrode local
opposition to the Kingask project, pointing to the 300 jobs that
will be created. But Riddell and others accuse the council of
ignoring its own standards on controlling development in the rush
to create jobs. They point bitterly to the fact that none of the
Fife Council members who approved the plan come from St. Andrews.
And they say that because there are only about 650 people in the
St. Andrews area unemployed, the jobs aren't needed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put it in another part of Fife that really needs
the jobs,'' said Riddell.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell bristles at suggestions the opponents are snobs. If
anything, he says, they are looking out for the little guy. He says
the new hotel and conference center will attract mainly rich
Americans whose presence will make it even harder for locals to get
on the Old Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotland is a very egalitarian country,'' he said. ``They're
going to come in here and push locals aside. It's going to create
resentment. The only reason the people behind Kingask are coming
here is to cash in on St. Andrews' name. All this is about is
money. There are things more important than money, such as quality
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his Jeep wagon, dragging on a Camel and looking out
over the 18th fairway of the Old Course, MacKinnon is candid in
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the accusation is we're trying to make money, we stand
guilty as charged,'' he said. ``What's wrong with that? This town
exists on tourism and inward investment. There is nothing for the
young people here except the hospitality industry. I know because
my two daughters have had to move away to find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is not a little enclave, sheltered from the rest of
the world. It has to deal with the real world, real economics. It
has marketed itself as the home of golf, and it has been
successful. This is a project of the highest quality. There's no
public funding. It can only be good for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the shops and restaurants here cater to golfers, and it
is hard to find people in them who oppose the Kingask project, or
think St. Andrews is on the verge of turning into a tacky golf
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Myles, 38, sells sweaters and other clothing at the
Johnstons Woolen Mills, just around the corner from the Old Course.
Most of her customers are golfers. She thinks the opposition is
small but loud, limited to those who can afford to live with the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think 300 more people will hurt the town, but I think
they will help the town,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Taylor, 18, who works at Aikman's Bistro, says he does not
oppose the project in principle, but thinks the process has been
flawed. He sees a generational gap in the dispute, with older
people opposed and his generation ``generally supportive or
indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I don't think the public has been informed
about the process as it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   That process is the last hope of the opponents. If they can show
the approval was legally flawed, they could put the Kingask project
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late, however, to stop the development, or repair
the rifts in familial relations. When Ted Brocklebank used the
local paper's letters page to vent his opposition to the project,
his cousin, Dave Seeley, used the same forum to denounce him as a
hypocrite. At the time, Brocklebank was a candidate for the
Scottish Parliament. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``His own cousin attacking him didn't help,'' said Nisbet.
``They haven't spoken to each other for months.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nisbet sees it, ``The arguments will go on for years, even
after the place is up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all golf war stories, this one has legs.

   TOAD _ BASTROP, Texas _ The endangered Houston Toads' mating
chorus _ an unmistakable high-pitched trill that cuts through the
warm, humid air of late winter evenings in the Lost Pines of
Bastrop County _ has lost some of its resonance in recent years.
Biologists have taken stock of the muzzled mating calls and
concluded recently that the fragile toads are disappearing at a
dangerous rate that throws their survival in the balance. U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service officials met in April with Bastrop County
leaders to share their findings _ that the toad, first listed as
endangered in 1970, is hurtling toward extinction due in part to
haphazard development within the loblolly pine forests the toads
call home. (Gee, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

 &HT;    Perez makes no apology for retaliating
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves catcher Eddie Perez didn't make any apologies
for starting the Friday night fight against the Phillies,
retaliating an inning after he was hit by a Paul Byrd pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he's trying to hit me or not, I've got to do
something,'' said Perez, who was good friends with Byrd when they
were teammates for parts of the past two seasons. ``I've been
getting hit too many times. I can't take it anymore.... I did what
I'm supposed to do. That's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Since replacing the injured Javy Lopez, Perez has taken a
beating from foul tips and now pitches. Saturday, he wore a bandage
just above his left elbow, where Byrd's pitch hit him.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he got more frustrated as the game continued. After
getting hit by the pitch, he was called out for interference on a
baserunning play. In the top of the fourth, John Smoltz got ejected
for hitting Alex Arias with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd maintained that he didn't hit Perez on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``God blessed me with a short right arm that only throws 85
miles an hour,'' said Byrd, who leads the majors with 13 hit
batsmen. ``I have to throw inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a devout Christian who has considered entering the
ministry after his baseball career, made it a more civilized and
surely a shorter brawl when he began praying aloud at the bottom of
the pile, which stunned Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stopped doing what I was doing,'' Perez said. ``I said,
`Stay with me Byrdie.'... We used to be best buddies. I think he
knows what happened last night was part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez hasn't heard yet from the National League office about a
possible suspension, but he probably will. Manager Bobby Cox may be
suspended too because he went out on the field during the brawl
after he'd been ejected while arguing the interference call against
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just sit down here,'' Cox said. ``When your team is
out there on the field, you've got to make sure nobody gets hurt,
and that's what I did...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate,'' Cox said of the fight. ``Eddie probably
went a little too far there. Quite honestly, I don't know if Paul
was trying to hit him or not. We're not a head-hunting team, and
neither are they.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan to be tested Monday
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan will have an MRI and a bone scan on his sore right
hand Monday. He was out of the lineup for almost a week to rest the
hand, which was hit by a Mike Thurman pitch on June 22, before
returning on Friday night. He was 3-for-5 with four RBIs Saturday
night, but wants to have his hand examined further because he's
felt no improvement despite two cortisone shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way I'll know if I'm hurting it or it's something I can
play through,'' Jordan said. ``I'm kind of nervous about it because
after a couple cortisone shots I thought the pain would lessen.
That leads me to believe something may have to be taken care of,
now or later on. Hopefully later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said batting was painful on Friday night, especially on a
checked swing during his third at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz update
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed by the brawl and the loss on Friday night was the
condition of Smoltz's right elbow. Smoltz has gone almost
exclusively to throwing fastballs and change-ups with only an
occasional breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   His slider may be his best pitch, but it's the one that causes
him the most pain. The Phillies took advantage by scoring four runs
in 3 2/3 innings, but it's how Smoltz is going to have to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say rest until the playoffs,'' he said. ``I could be
resting for a long time. It's not a given thing. The simple fact of
the matter is we have to do the little things better. I'm just
trying to contribute any way I possibly can.'' Smoltz said the next
several weeks would be critical in determining whether he can
continue pitching in his current condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't do me any good to speculate,'' Smoltz said. ``That's
not to say I can't pitch like this and be better.... Mentally I've
got to be tougher, stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading north
</P>
<P>
   Recently released reliever John Hudek was signed to a
minor-league contract by the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday and sent
to their Class AAA team in Syracuse. The right-handed Hudek, 32,
was 0-2 with a 7.64 ERA in 17 games for the Braves and the
Cincinnati Reds.... Wednesday's Braves-Pirates game in Pittsburgh
has been changed to a 7:35 start and will be shown on ESPN.

 &HT;    Creaking Cowboys will stretch age limits
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The early exit from the NFL playoffs last
season exposed a glaring weakness in the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   They have old legs.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which defeated the Cowboys 20-7 in a surprisingly easy
game, looked younger, quicker, sharper. Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer spun like a swizzle stick while dodging would-be tacklers.
Were the Cowboys really as tired as they looked that January
afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   Nate Newton, his untucked jersey covering his massive belly,
could have used a cane to walk away. Other Cowboys left Texas
Stadium with their heads down, wondering how a team with three
Super Bowl titles in the decade could lose to the Cardinals. Maybe
the team of the '90s has evolved into the team of the 30s. The
Cowboys' combined three-year record after winning Super Bowl XXX is
27-24. Most of their best players are at least 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jerry Jones has heard critics contend his once-proud
team is too old to make another serious challenge for the Super
Bowl. When pressed on the subject during a recent chat, Jones
paused several seconds before responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have great players _ and we have a base of great
players _ it warrants erring on the side of hanging on too long as
opposed to being too quick to make a change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs this question: Did the Cowboys wait too long for a
transfusion of new blood?
</P>
<P>
   Jones steadfastly believes Super Bowl contenders are built with
veteran players, no matter how many years of NFL service they have.
NFL champion Denver, for example, was the oldest team in the league
last year. Jones has invested heavily in players who were stars in
the Super Bowl years.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys prepare for the 1999 season, the majority of
contributors already reached the pinnacle of their careers long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin have each lost a step. Erik
Williams and Daryl Johnston have had career-threatening injuries.
Kevin Smith and Chad Hennings might not be starters much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are training without their best defensive players,
Leon Lett and Deion Sanders. Lett is serving another drug
suspension and Sanders has nursed a bad toe for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   And these are some of the team leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an older group,'' 32-year-old quarterback Troy Aikman
said. ``There is no question about that. I still think we have some
good years left. We can still be a productive team. I think we have
a nice mix (of veterans and young players).''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but the majority of Cowboys prospects are unproven.
Defensive linemen such as Kavika Pittman (25), Greg Ellis (23),
Ebenezer Ekuban (23), Darren Benson (24) and Michael Myers (23)
have not made an impact so far. The Sporting News ranks the Cowboys
defensive line 30th in the 31-team league.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the youth movement Jones was referring to?
</P>
<P>
   There is very little youth on the offense. The only starters who
are younger than 30 are guard Everett McIver (28), wide receiver
Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail (29), tight end David LaFleur (25) and
tackle Flozell Adams (24).
</P>
<P>
   If one player symbolizes the plight of the aging offense, it's
the 33-year-old Irvin. In the last year of his contract, Irvin must
recapture the game-breaking ability he displayed in the early part
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   All of the veterans need to improve on what they did last year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to prove that we're a better football team than we
were last year,'' Irvin said. ``More importantly, we have to show
we're a better football team than 10-6. For a lot of teams, that
would be a great accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were10-6 and swept the division. A lot of teams would sit
back and rest and say we've accomplished something. But this
football team, with the nucleus it's had for the last few years,
that's not acceptable to us. You want to come out, you want to work
hard, you want to try to accomplish more. You think you deserve
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has injected some youth into the system. Ismail and
newcomer James McKnight (27) bring speed to the passing game.
Although Aikman and Irvin have been a terrific combination on
intermediate passes, the Cowboys have not had a consistent deep
threat since former teammate Alvin Harper left the club after the
1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will continue to get the majority of carries, but the
Cowboys hope they can rest him occasionally. That was the plan last
year, too, but backup running back Chris Warren, who boasts four
1,000-yard seasons in his NFL career, was sidelined for much of
last season with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Smith responded well, finishing with his eighth straight
1,000-yard season. But he rushed for 100 yards only once in the
last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   To add punch to the lineup, Smith and Warren will be in the
backfield at the same time at various stages of games. The Cowboys
hope to prolong Smith's career by taking some of the focus off him
in running situations.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the new additions _ namely Ismail, McKnight
and center Mark Stepnoski _ will jump-start the offense. If
anything, the Cowboys should be faster than they showed in their
playoff loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed poses a threat to defenses,'' Irvin said. ``As long as
they know you can do it, they have to account for it. If we can get
defenses to account, maybe with the safety staying back in the
middle of the field that may give us the opportunity to get some
things open on the other side one-on-one.''

 &HT;    Going deep for halibut
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMER, Alaska _ Fish heads and Spider Wire _ one a body part
used for bait, the other a brand of braided line _ may be the
oddest compoments of halibut fishing, but the main attraction is
still the flatfish himself.
</P>
<P>
   With weights exceeding 300 pounds, two eyes on the same side of
their head and a huge, toothy mouth only a mother could love,
Alaskan halibut have a little bit of sea monster lure about them.
They live in water colder than 40 degrees, at depths exceeding 400
feet, and in places where being seasick is about as common as being
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   When halibut surface on the end of a heavy rod, it's with an
aura of the unknown ocean depths. Smart captains dispatch them with
a .410 round before brining them on board, lest the thrashing
behemoth play havoc with rods, cameras and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But, let's face it, halibut are really not much more than
flounder on steroids with an affinity for one of nature's least
hospitable, yet most scenic and alluring pieces of oceanfront
property.
</P>
<P>
   Who could resist? Certainly not my wife and I when our friends
Jan and Jerry Wilt, of Anchorage, invited us to join them on the
charter boat they own with businessman Mike Alred. The prospect of
big fish, flaky, white fillets and the wilds of Alaska's Barren
Islands was too much to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we found ourselves banging around the Hit-A-Homer two hours
out of Homer, listening to other captains talk about calm seas and
fishing any place they wanted. Though we were dry and warm inside
the sturdy steel boat's cabin, things didn't look all that calm
from where we sat.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we cleared Port Graham, though, where a left turn would
have taken us toward Prince William Sound and the famous ''inside
passage'' route to British Columbia, the seas flattened out and the
sun broke through. It was a great day to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Whales (humpbacks, minkes and orcas) spouted in the distance.
Loons and puffins and marbled murrelets bobbed on the water near
the boat. Alred and Wilt rigged rods with hooks and weights, then
tipped them with salmon heads. ''Reds,'' Wilt said. ''Halibut love
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alred explained the long ride and our current location, half a
mile from one of the uninhabited islands that make up the small
group, about 40 miles south-southwest from Homer. ''That's Kodiak
Island there in the distance,'' he said. ''There's a shelf here
where the water is only about 120 feet deep and the halibut really
like it. We usually can't come this far because the water is too
rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a 3-pound weight as a sinker, bait takes a little time
to reach bottom in 120 feet of water. ''Some of the boats are
fishing in 400 to 500 feet,'' Alred said, ''but there's nothing fun
about reeling a big halibut up from that far down.''
</P>
<P>
   Once on the bottom, with four or five baits out for maximum
coverage, we waited for the beginning of the tidal movement. When
the water moves, salmon and other fish move with it. Halibut line
up along the bottom to vacuum up whatever swims by. If it fits in
that mouth, they'll eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Alred scored first, using a big white jig bounced wildly off the
bottom. He boated a large ling cod, a prehistoric looking, very
aggressive and highly prized food fish. Two more lings followed,
one of them a 49-inch monster that Jan Wilt caught.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the ling frenzy, lines suddenly moved toward the
back of the anchored boat. The tide had begun to move and all the
halibut veterans on the boat got ready for action.
</P>
<P>
   My wife Rana got the first halibut bite, a 40-pound class fish
that bit a salmon carcass and stripped line quickly before she got
him stopped. Jan Wilt caught one, Jerry caught a pair and I caught
another. Three of the fish were in excess of 50 pounds. Then we
quit. The limit is two fish per person per day, but there was no
need to kill any other fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just about as big as you want to keep to eat,'' Wilt
had explained earlier. ''Much bigger than that, they get mushy and
they just aren't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some really big halibut in this area,'' Wilt said.
''In the past, we didn't have to come this far, but there's more
competition and pressure on them than ever before. We don't like to
see people keep the giants, 150 and 200 pounds, or the small ones.
We call those chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still lots of halibut in Alaska, but there are more
people than ever fishing for them,'' Wilt said. ''We have to take
care of them.''

 &HT;    Making a grizzly discovery
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENALI NATIONAL PARK, Alaska _ Alaska is a state where people
don't have to leave home to touch the wilderness. It comes to you.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Snow-covered mountains loom above every town on the map. Black
bears chase little kids in their yards. Salmon, pursued by beluga
whales from Cook Inlet, swim upstream through downtown Anchorage,
the state's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Whales may circle your fishing boat today and seals might steal
your salmon. Bald and golden eagles perch along the highway, and
moose fight off the summer heat by soaking in kiddie wading pools.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the 240-mile drive up Alaska Highway 1, from Anchorage
to Denali National Park, is one long, stomach-churning adventure in
search of the signature Alaskan wildlife: the grizzly bear.
</P>
<P>
   The grizzlies of Denali are not the monstrous brown bears of
coastal Alaska or the1,000-pound heart-stoppers of Kodiak Island,
though they are plenty big.
</P>
<P>
   Denali bears _ the main reason we made the long drive and got up
at four in the morning to claim our seat on the bus _ are of the
famed blond variety, the Toklat grizzly of early Alaskan history
fame, that live and thrive in this virtually untouched wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment our driver and guide, Frank, pulled away from
the visitors center, to the time two hours into the trip that we
saw our first grizzly, 50 sets of eyes were glued to the slopes and
canyons of the park's back country.
</P>
<P>
   Park administrators do a remarkable job of handling the massive
numbers of international tourists who travel to Alaska and then to
the park. Personal vehicle traffic is limited, but buses run often
enough and far enough to allow everyone a chance to see a part of
America that can't be found anyplace else.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere past the Savage River parking area, past the lone
Arctic wolf, a couple of golden eagles and a few caribou, a large,
extremely blond young male was spotted feeding on berries and sedge
near the bottom of a small hill.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who said he'd been driving the route for five years, had
given us the requisite warning about talking too loud and treating
the animals as if they were living in a zoo. That didn't stop the
''oohs and aahs'' or the comparisons with people or even the
occasional ignorant outburst about how clumsy he looked.
</P>
<P>
   I could have pointed out that the bear, if he wished, could have
covered the 100 yards from his feeding spot to the bus, UPHILL, in
three or four seconds. When he got there, he could have opened up
the vehicle like a sardine tin and fished out a tourist or two for
brunch. All without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   But it was enough to know we'd seen the first grizzly of our
trip, the first that my wife had ever seen. The next would be even
more memorable, a sow and cub on a feeding jaunt that brought them
to within 25 yards of the astounded crew on the shuttle bus.
</P>
<P>
   I've been close to bears on rivers as they fished for salmon and
inland as they laid claim to a moose I'd just killed. But this big
female and her youngster were special. The bond that keeps a young
grizzly alive his first few years was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Baby bears face lots of obstacles to adulthood, the most
dangerous one being other bears. At the very top of the food chain,
bears fear little else in the wild. Males often kill young bears
and even other adults. While we were in Alaska, one male known as
BB killed a bear cub in full view of the stunned human visitors to
salmon fishing grounds on the Brooks River.
</P>
<P>
   But this female kept a close watch on her young one, even while
allowing him to roam and play while she dug for ground squirrels
next to the road. The smaller bear eventually lay down and went to
sleep while she dug.
</P>
<P>
   After his mother gave up and began to wander off, the cub
climbed over into the 3-foot deep hole for a quick lesson in
digging before loping off to join her.
</P>
<P>
   Those sightings alone would have been enough to make our trip to
Denali, but we saw another eight or nine bears on the way in and
out to Eielson Visitor Center, 67 miles into the sprawling park. It
was a splendid trip, rivaled by no other in the country for
wildnerness or wildness.

 &HT;    Toad specie disappearing at alarming rate from Texas home
 &HT;    By Robert W. Gee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASTROP, Texas _ The endangered Houston Toads' mating chorus _
an unmistakable high-pitched trill that cuts through the warm,
humid air of late winter evenings in the Lost Pines of Bastrop
County _ has lost some of its resonance in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have taken stock of the muzzled mating calls and
concluded recently that the fragile toads are disappearing at a
dangerous rate that throws their survival in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials met in April with
Bastrop County leaders to share their findings _ that the toad,
first listed as endangered in 1970, is hurtling toward extinction
due in part to haphazard development within the loblolly pine
forests the toads call home.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for a struggle that is only beginning for the
cash-poor Bastrop County government, which finds itself caught
between the federal endangered species act and a seemingly
contradictory new state law that does not allow counties to
``discriminate'' against home builders for land that lies within
the habitat of an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone of us wants to save the pine trees,'' says Bastrop
County Judge Ronnie McDonald. ``We need authority. Right now, we
can't dictate whether a person can cut down a pine tree or not.''
</P>
<P>
   And property owners, developers and real estate agents worry
about the future of several thousand acres of county-approved but
undeveloped subdivisions within the Lost Pines, the habitat of a
toad that few residents have ever seen but also prime land for
development in the fast-growing county. About one-third of all new
homes in Bastrop County are built north of the Colorado River, many
within the toads' domain, according to the county's health and
sanitation department, which issues permits for new homes.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists say that if nothing is done to protect the toads'
habitat, it may soon be too late to save them. Officials estimate
their numbers in Bastrop County to be about 5,000. In a
representative sample within Bastrop State Park studied by the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department over the past 10 years, the
toad's numbers have dwindled by half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching a crisis point with this species,'' said Lisa
O'Donnell, biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
agency charged with enforcing the endangered species act. ``My
concern is if development continues at this rate _ random, all over
the place _ you're going to preclude your options forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Toad does exist in smaller numbers in eight other
Texas counties _ and no where else in the world _ according to a
1990 survey, but the largest and historically most robust
population is in Bastrop County.
</P>
<P>
   In the April meeting, O'Donnell suggested that the county start
work on a habitat conservation plan that would include 15,000 acres
of undeveloped prime habitat for the small, secretive toads, who
spend much of the year burrowed under the soft, sandy soil. County
officials say they don't know the first thing about establishing a
habitat conservation plan and, furthermore, couldn't possibly
afford the estimated $20 million cost of the land needed for a
permanent toad habitat. The county's annual budget is $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Fish and Wildlife officials, concerned about the
county's inaction, ordered their legal staff to determine whether
or not the county could be found culpable in facilitating the
destruction of endangered species by continuing to issue sanitation
and development permits within the roughly 50,000-acre toad habitat
area of Bastrop County. Federal wildlife officials met with county
leaders again on July 9 to inform them that they may be breaking
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some verbal (legal) opinions that there is some
liability involved in issuing a permit that would allow the 'take'
of an endangered species,'' said Bill Seawell, assistant field
supervisor of the Austin office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The county immediately stopped issuing sanitation and
development permits _ the necessary steps to start building a home
_ for lots within the loosely defined toad habitat area, a broad
swath running east and north of Bastrop to the Lee County line. But
county officials worried that that move could run counter to the
Texas Legislature's Senate Bill 1272, signed into law in June and
effective in September, which does not allow a county to deny
building permits solely because the platted land falls within the
habitat of an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on July 19, the county decided to resume issuing
permits, but included a disclaimer that informed property owners
that they may also need to apply for an additional permit with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new state law ``kind of makes (county officials) choose as
to which law they wish to obey,'' Seawell said. ``And I think
they've taken the middle road.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state law, which was designed to ensure private
landowners aren't coerced into contributing land to a regional
habitat conservation plan, doesn't preclude a county from
establishing a conservation plan, which is a solution touted for
Bastrop County since April by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a voluntary effort to pull something together on a
regional basis,'' O'Donnell said. ``The flip side of that is to
make every single person in the area get in line and wait for a
permit.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a regional habitat conservation plan, the county would
apply for an umbrella permit for ``incidental taking'' of the
endangered species, which would allow new development to harm or
kill the toads as long as it doesn't put the species' survival in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin to such a plan would be the preservation of a
minimum of 15,000 acres of contiguous property to ensure the toad's
survival. The 3,700-acre Bastrop State Park would probably be a
part of that. One thousand acres will come from the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department. The remaining 10,000 or so acres would be
private land that the county, or someone, would have to preserve
from development.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will provide a consultant to
help the county find funding, which could include matching grants
from foundations or corporations or a bond issue from taxpayers.
Then the county would need to determine how to preserve the land,
either through the outright purchase of land, or through the
purchase of the development rights through conservation easements,
which would keep the land in property owners' hands and on the tax
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, the county judge, appealed for help in paying for the
land. ``It would be a tremendous strain for the people of Bastrop
County to fund a project of this magnitude without the help of
outside sources,'' he said. ``If we're going to be the torch-bearer
for the Houston Toad . . . this is something that goes beyond
Bastrop County, beyond Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   One source of funding for the conservation area will likely be a
mitigation fee charged to new home builders in the toads' habitat
area. That fee would be similar to the $1,500 charged to most new
home builders within the habitat area of the endangered golden
cheek warbler in western Travis County, under the Balcones
Canyonlands Preserve plan.
</P>
<P>
   In several interviews last week, some real estate agents,
subdivision managers and property owners in Bastrop County said
they think a mitigation fee and a three- or four-month wait time
for the permit would hurt new home builders, and that the fee could
steer development away from the Lost Pines region.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said their Austin
office was receiving about 20 calls a day last week from concerned
property owners in Bastrop County.
</P>
<P>
   Paying to protect the toad first became an issue in 1990, when
the Texas Department of Transportation touted a $628,000 project
that would build toad crossings underneath a portion of Texas 21
northeast of Bastrop. The agency ended up spending only $100,000 to
build special fences to herd the toads into existing culverts.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Trull, 58, who lives in a rental home with his wife and
children in Cedar Creek, hopes to break ground soon on a
1,850-square-foot home in a subdivision located within the toad's
habitat. He said a $1,500 mitigation fee wouldn't deter his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good chunk for us,'' Trull said. ``(But) I
definitely don't want to upset any ecological balance. I'd be very
concerned if in the long run we helped to hurt the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trull, like many property owners, said he wasn't sure how
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, (the situation) is leaving the citizens
panic-stricken in some cases,'' said David Coombs, director of the
county's health and sanitation department. ``They don't know what's
expected of them and we don't sometimes have the answers to give
them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials hope to provide those answers
at a public hearing Aug. 23.

   BBA-BLUEJAYS-GREEN (Toronto) _ When Jim Fregosi, longtime
baseball man and current manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, was
asked to compare his 26-year-old right fielder, Shawn Green, to
players of the past or present, he started with a contemporary
all-star and ended with a legend. ''I think about Larry Walker at
Colorado and Dave Parker, who used to play right field for
Pittsburgh,'' said Fregosi, who has been active in the major
leagues as a player, manager or executive since 1961. ``Those guys
were complete players. You can even go back to Roberto Clemente, a
guy that could run and throw, hit for average, hit for power and
drive in runs.'' By Chris Broussard.

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Madison Avenue was as hooked on cigarettes as any
two-pack-a-day smoker. Agencies vied for the big accounts of the
big tobacco companies as avidly as they did for the accounts of
automakers, brewers, soft-drink bottlers and other free-spending
marketers of mass consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   The pages of trade publications like Advertising Age were once
filled with the comings and goings of cigarette brand assignments.
Which agency was going to get the Camel account? Was Lucky Strike
on the loose? Would Winston advertise good like a cigarette should?
</P>
<P>
   But now, to paraphrase the old slogan of another smoke,
Tareyton, many shops have determined they would rather switch than
fight for cigarette accounts. While tobacco marketing is still a
huge source of revenue for agencies, a significant countertrend is
building as increasing sums of money are devoted to what could be
called the unselling of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising has really been the No. 1 accomplice in selling
smoking,'' said Alex Bogusky, partner and creative director at
Crispin Porter &AMP; Bogusky in Coral Gables, Fla. ``The reason for
cigarettes being among the most powerful brands in America is us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a shameful role in this for a long time,'' he
added, ``so I'm excited about us as an industry trying to fix what
we did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The unselling efforts are being fueled by a turnabout in
societal attitudes about smoking, coupled with the intensification
of so-called social marketing campaigns, aimed at changing
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, people accepted smoking,'' said Stephen Badenhop,
president at Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG in New York,
part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, whose
agency produces campaigns for anti-smoking drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the last five to 10 years, it has become acceptable for
people not to smoke,'' he added, ``and agencies like to get
involved with trends that are topical and important to vast numbers
of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up efforts to fight smoking include spending by
states like Arizona, California, Florida and Massachusetts on
campaigns intended to dissuade youngsters from taking up the habit;
a coming national anti-smoking initiative, also aimed primarily at
young people, to be funded by the recent $206 billion settlement
between 46 state attorneys general and the tobacco industry; ads
for a panoply of prescription and over-the-counter drugs like
Nicorette and Nicotrol meant to help smokers stop, and even a
handful of anti-smoking campaigns aimed at young people by tobacco
marketers like the Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's suddenly changing dramatically,'' said William D.
Novelli, president of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, an
advocacy organization in Washington. ``It's a totally new day, and
I'm very thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, the money is there for some major
countermarketing against tobacco,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   By one rough estimate, the amount of money spent in 1998 to
unsell tobacco totaled $200 million. That compares with the $575.7
million spent to advertise tobacco products in print, through
outdoor advertising and over the Internet in 1997, the most recent
year for which figures were available. (The total tobacco marketing
budget that year was $5.66 billion, which includes promotional
spending like display allowances for retailers and signs in
stores.)
</P>
<P>
   The sums on the unselling side of the equation will increase
substantially with the planned national anti-smoking campaign, to
be overseen by an organization known as the American Legacy
Foundation, based in Washington. Its initial annual budget for
advertising, marketing and public relations will be $150 million to
$225 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic reaction is to go where the money is,'' Novelli
said. And indeed, some of the best-known, most creative agencies in
advertising, joined by several leading public relations shops, are
vying for the foundation's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the sea change'' in Madison Avenue's attitudes about
smoking, said Chuck Wolfe, the foundation's executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some amount of, shall we say, realization among
agencies that maybe they've been part of the problem,'' said Wolfe,
who earlier directed a pioneering anti-smoking advertising effort
sponsored by Florida. ``They see the handwriting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``And some are more calculating,'' he added, ``interested
because there's money on the street: `If we can't get tobacco
business, maybe we should get the anti-tobacco business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivations, the agencies that have been in the
hunt for the foundation's account work on familiar, blue-chip
brands like Foot Locker, Intel, Kellogg, MCI Worldcom, Mitsubishi,
1-800-FLOWERS, Snapple, Southwest Airlines, Target, Volkswagen,
Volvo and Wal-Mart.

<P>
   ``How many opportunities are there to do the right thing?''
asked Lisa Unsworth, executive vice president and group director at
Arnold Communications in Boston, the unit of Snyder Communications
that is among the agencies competing to create the foundation's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A campaign like this should redefine the way society as a
whole thinks about tobacco,'' said Ms. Unsworth, who oversee
Arnold's work on anti-smoking ads for the Massachusetts Department
of Public Health, ``whether smokers, kids or advertising
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the foundation narrowed the competition for its
account to four groups from nine. The finalists are: Arnold, teamed
up with Crispin Porter, the agency for the Florida anti-tobacco
campaign, and the Porter Novelli unit of Omnicom Group; Kirshenbaum
Bond &AMP; Partners in New York, teamed up with Asher &AMP; Partners in Los
Angeles and Rogers &AMP; Associates in Los Angeles; Messner Vetere
Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York, also part of the
Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas, teamed up with Dan Klores
Associates in New York; and Richards Group in Dallas, teamed up
with the Golin/Harris International unit of the Interpublic Group
of Companies. A decision is expected in September.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be everywhere the tobacco industry is and put up
roadblocks,'' said Bruce Dundore, a partner and the creative
director at Asher, which is the agency for the anti-tobacco
campaign sponsored by the California Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never completely stop the tobacco charge,'' he added,
``but we can consistently thwart them.
</P>
<P>
   ``An educated public, a more knowledgeable public, tends to
change its behavior,'' Dundore said. ``And we'll keep educating
people until they feel that putting a cigarette in your mouth is
the same as putting a lit torch in your mouth _ and few people do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many smokers have started to use gums, inhalers or patches to
help them stop smoking. Spending on ads for anti-smoking products
totaled $121.5 million in 1997 and $106.2 million in 1998,
according to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU N.V. that
tracks ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 40 million or more smokers out there,'' said
Badenhop at Jordan McGrath, whose agency creates ads for the
Nicoderm and Nicorette anti-smoking brands sold by SmithKline
Beecham. ``And smokers all know they shouldn't be smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The money spent to unsell smoking ``is nowhere near what the
tobacco companies spend in a couple months,'' he added, ``but it's
a good, competitive amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   And that amount will grow further because of the foundation's
national anti-smoking campaign, scheduled to begin before the new
year, as well as additional states joining the anti-smoking
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six states now with meaningful campaigns,'' said
Novelli of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, ``and about
10 new ones coming on board, including Washington, Hawaii, New
Jersey, Minnesota and even Virginia, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   When the prototypical tobacco-growing state begins to spend
money on ads against smoking, Madison Avenue takes notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into the business, one of the keystone accounts you
needed as an agency was a cigarette,'' said Jonathan Bond,
co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond. ``They were the most visible
products with the most money behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, not smoking is the better image,'' he added. ``I wish
every category had an `anti'; the whole ad business would double.''

 By ANDY WANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of his readers are still asleep, James Romenesko is
up at 5 a.m. each weekday, furiously surfing the Web. He reads
newspaper sites, magazine sites, gossip sites and alternative sites
in search of stories that are appropriate for the two digests of
Web links he publishes.
</P>
<P>
   For Mediagossip.com, Romenesko seeks news and criticism about
the media and those who work in it. For The Obscure Store and
Reading Room (www.obscurestore.com), he scours for stories that are
more offbeat, like a recent piece about a batboy attacking a
baseball team's mascot and another about the struggles of a Pee-Wee
Herman impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is absolutely the best for finding goofy stories,'' said
Steve Knopper, himself a practitioner of the emerging specialty of
Net scavenging. Knopper writes Yahoo Internet Life's Daily Net Buzz
column (www.zdnet.com/yil/content/depts/netbuzz), which also
provides links to articles from a variety of news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Summaries of news predate the Internet, of course. But in the
digital era, when virtually anyone with Net access can operate an
electronic clipping service, the genre has spawned thousands of
news hounds _ not to mention the news links on big portal sites
like Yahoo and Excite. Yet, largely through grass-roots,
word-of-mouse popularity, sites like Romenesko's are catching on
with a discerning crowd _ including reporters and editors of many
news organizations, who rely on the sites to help filter the welter
of information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Such digests, whether compiled as a collection of links on a Web
site or distributed by electronic mail, sift the online content of
established media organizations like ABC News (abcnews.go.com),
MSNBC (msnbc.com) and The New York Times on the Web (nytimes.com),
as well as alternative outlets like New York Press
(newyorkpress.com) and The Smoking Gun (thesmokinggun.com).
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of Net digests, with their own growing audiences,
include Media Grok and Davenetics (www.davenetics.com).
</P>
<P>
   Many digests do not link to news sites like The Wall Street
Journal Interactive Edition or TheStreet.com that charge readers a
fee. And Romenesko even declines to include free sites that require
readers to register, like The New York Times Web site _ though he
will sometimes cite some of the articles that appear on the Times'
affiliated city guide, New York Today (nytoday.com), which can be
read without registering.
</P>
<P>
   A gatekeeper for gatekeepers, Romenesko said that, according to
the traffic logs for his two sites, his ``many thousands'' of daily
readers included regular visitors from National Public Radio, CNBC,
Conde Nast, Hearst and numerous other media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of the other more popular Web news sifters, Romenesko
is himself a professional journalist. But it is not until after
updating both his sites with new links and images by about 8:30
a.m. each weekday that he heads off for work at The St. Paul
Pioneer Press, where he covers the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He receives no pay for the time he devotes to his own Web sites,
though he does use them to link to items he is auctioning on Ebay,
like old issues of Spy magazine. And recently he began running paid
banner ads on the sites. Mainly, though, he operates the sites
``for personal pleasure and not for great financial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in DIY _ do it yourself _
movements and projects,'' Romenesko said. ``And I see my work as an
online DIY venture. While other sites brag about growth and
expanding employee payrolls, I talk about staying a one-person
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another soloist is Knopper, who writes Daily Net Buzz from his
home in Chicago. Daily Net Buzz includes breaking news,
entertainment, sports, technology and quirky stories. ``I'm always
looking for stories that have a twist,'' Knopper said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other news digests focus on a specific industry or
niche. Some readers say these compilations are changing the way
people consume news in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Erik Rydholm, chief operating officer and a
founding partner of the Motley Fool financial site, said he was
much less informed before he began reading Media Grok, a daily
online newsletter published on the Web site of a technology
magazine, The Industry Standard
(www.thestandard.com/articles/mediagrok). Media Grok provides
summaries of and links to media coverage of the Internet and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this thing came out, I actually didn't keep up with the
industry, because it was too much of a pain to go from site to
site,'' Rydholm said. ``Now I can do my competitive research, and
it only takes me about 15 minutes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an industry where value is often measured by page views
and unique users, the most popular digests play an important
promotional role for the World Wide Web sites that they send
readers to. In fact, many journalists now pitch their stories for
inclusion in Mediagossip, Media Grok or other digests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly getting e-mail from people at media
outlets,'' said Mark Glaser, one of four writers who compile Media
Grok. ``And we appreciate it. If people are pointing us to things,
it makes our job easier.'' By the same token, Glaser said he had
received e-mail from reporters asking why their articles were
neglected in favor of competitors'.
</P>
<P>
   James Poniewozik, the television critic for Time magazine, a
former media critic for Salon and a regular reader of Romenesko's
sites, noted that online journalism provided more immediate
feedback than print journalism. ``Online,'' he said, ``you are, at
least theoretically, constantly aware of the number of hits you're
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsletters and Web sites that link to technology news are among
the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find especially in the coverage of technology is that
there is such a scrum of journalism today,'' said Scott Rosenberg,
managing editor of Salon and a longtime technology reporter.
``There is such a pile-on. It's almost impossible for a single
human being to monitor it all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg relies on about a dozen digests of links to technology
coverage. These sites include Scripting News (www.scripting.com),
which is published by Dave Winer, a software developer who has
written for Hotwired.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Pell, managing director of Arba Seed Investment Group in
San Francisco, publishes a free e-mail newsletter called
Davenetics. Each day, Pell summarizes and links to the latest
technology stories, putting his own spin on the news through the
headlines and summaries he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Pell started Davenetics in February with about 50 subscribers,
after realizing that he often e-mailed his business associates
several times a day about news stories he had found. Davenetics now
has more than 1,500 subscribers, and Pell says most of his readers
work for or invest in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pell, who has invested in companies including the online
magazine Feed and the product information site Productopia, calls
himself a ``total content fanatic.'' And he says he is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the growth of e-commerce, it still doesn't come
close to the people who are looking for information,'' Pell said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to independent newsletters like Davenetics, digests
published by media outlets like The San Jose Mercury News or The
Industry Standard publish links to their own stories as well as
articles from their competitors. In that respect, the digests can
serve as supplements to the originating publication _ or as
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Media Grok's Glaser, for example, says that readers have told
him that they read his site's news summaries instead of the actual
articles he links to. Glaser, though, says he reads about 25
stories and skims another 10 or 15 each evening that he works on
Media Grok, which he does from home. The Industry Standard says
Media Grok, which is available by e-mail and on the magazine's Web
site, is read by about 100,000 people each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who are reading it who are business
people that are using it as a service to keep up with the news,''
Glaser said. ``I didn't realize we would become a substitute for
the news.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A SURGE OF SEXISM ON THE ROCK SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
 By ANN POWERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that Woodstock '99 did bring back one custom from the
classic days of rock: treating women like sexual toys, often
against their will. Four rapes have been reported at the festival,
including one said to have occurred near the stage during Limp
Bizkit's set.
</P>
<P>
   This abominable news would be more shocking if not for the
rampant displays of vicious male behavior throughout the festival
weekend that began on July 23, from the lone fan who scrawled a
demand for oral sex across his chest to the many who shouted at
female performers like Sheryl Crow to expose their breasts onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Sexy fun is one thing, but this was an orgy of lewdness tinged
with hate. If only this were an isolated phenomenon arising from
the primal state that concertgoers entered after three days amid
the dust and the garbage. Sadly, though, boneheaded sexism is on
the rise throughout the rock scene.
</P>
<P>
   At the Warped Tour, which came to New York City a week before
Woodstock '99 came to Rome, N.Y., numerous performers shouted nasty
remarks at the ``ladies'' in the crowd, culminating in a suggestion
by Mark Hoppus of Blink 182 that female fans come up to the stage
and sexually service his band mates. A few nights later, Limp
Bizkit and Kid Rock shared the Hammerstein Ballroom stage. Both
artists proclaimed they loved women even as they performed songs
condemning them as whores.
</P>
<P>
   At these shows, women screamed their adulation for the very
stars hurling invective at them. They climbed the shoulders of
their male companions and waved to the throng waiting to grope
them. The women seemed to be reviving the role of the old-fashioned
rock chick, who gained the right to be sexually expressive by
running a gantlet of degradation and scorn. And the men were all
too ready to debase them.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening during the summer of yet another ``year of the
woman'' in pop, when the music business is congratulating itself
for the gains it has made. VH-1 is promoting its five-hour special
on contemporary music's 100 most notable women. Sarah McLachlan is
leading her gynocentric Lilith Fair festival to a graceful finish
after three years. Ms. Crow, Courtney Love, Tori Amos and Alanis
Morissette continue to tour behind strong, career-building albums.
</P>
<P>
   Across the stylistic divide, in rhythm and blues and in pop, the
self-aware soul singers Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott and TLC rule,
while the Backstreet Boys and their teeny-bopper brethren lay
prostrate at the feet of the girls who are their fans. Even the
Lolita-like Britney Spears sends a message mixed enough to be
considered empowering by some of her teen-age admirers.
</P>
<P>
   With all this evidence of ``girl power'' still abounding, what
are those female rock fans doing getting clobbered, metaphorically,
by the boys?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are knotty. Foremost is the fact that so many young
women consider the struggle for equality over. In society, that was
their mothers' battle; in the pop world, it belonged to their older
sisters. The remarkable gains made by the likes of Ms. Morissette
in the mid-1990s, when loud, angry women selling millions of
records seemed to be changing rock forever, are now viewed by many
as part of a passe trend.
</P>
<P>
   The pop market feeds on novelty; rageful female rockers are
several seasons old. Artists like Ms. Love and Polly Jean Harvey,
who broke through during that moment, have refined their music.
Their softer images suggest that successful women need no longer be
aggressive, that all the shouting got boring and we need to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, women in rock in the '90s have only partly triumphed.
There are great young female-powered rock bands, like
Sleater-Kinney; veterans to emulate, like L7, Patti Smith and
Chrissie Hynde, and even singer-songwriters with rock-and-roll
hearts, like Ms. Amos. But those artists are being forced back into
the realm of the exception, kicking against the boorish male norm.
</P>
<P>
   The new hip-hop-flavored hard rock that commands the mass market
has no American female stars. Skunk Anansie, an English band with a
black female singer, is esteemed in Europe, but so far has not
gained many admirers in the United States. Only one
female-dominated band, the Lunachicks, was on the Warped tour,
playing the third stage with several other journeyman punk bands.
</P>
<P>
   The moment when women confronted male rockers on their own
terms, displaying a sexual forcefulness and self-respect that threw
the genre's historic chauvinism into question, has faded. In its
place is the culture's new custom of either placing female artists
and fans within a female ghetto, or ignoring them.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Two safe havens exist for women in pop. The Lilith-fair style
singer-songwriter genre is the most likely to endure. After the
success of Ms. McLachlan and Jewel, record companies began signing
pretty, soft-voiced artistes in droves. Radio formats adjusted to
this style, as did VH-1, which treats it as the present while
celebrating male rockers in much of its historically oriented
programming.
</P>
<P>
   For those who embrace the trappings of conventional femininity,
the Lilith style is a promising niche. But it has done little to
change the essence of rock, instead confining mainstream female
artists within the gilded cage of the pop songbird.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest pop arena ruled by young women is teeny-bopper
music. Hard rock's popular resurgence is partly a reaction against
the emotionally submissive, romantic music that teeny-bopper bands
like the Backstreet Boys produce. Male fans are lining up to buy
and defend music that makes them feel the way boys are supposed to
feel, according to sexist stereotypes. Angry boys are back,
alongside squealing girls.
</P>
<P>
   This gender split is reinforced within the union of hard rock
and hip-hop. Any rock fan should be thrilled that the racial
segregation common within the music industry may be breaking down
as a new generation, raised on Snoop Doggy Dog and Nirvana,
emerges. The white artists plundering hip-hop, like Kid Rock, seem
eager to actually collaborate with artists of color; one can only
hope that the racial exploitation that has marred rock history
won't repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential of racial unity seems to be coming at the cost
of women's dignity. Hard-core hip-hop is famous for portraying
women in heinous ways, and in a misguided effort to prove their
authenticity, many hard rockers have emulated that tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet plenty of women also grew up loving hard rock and hip-hop.
Sugary romance and feminine fluttering aren't going to satisfy
them. In the early '90s, they could hear their turbulent emotions
expressed in the voices of female rockers, but they will look to
male performers if that is what is offered them. They relate to the
frustration expressed by Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit, or the
strutting pride of Kid Rock. When those performers direct outrage
at women, these female fans mentally deflect it, just as their
predecessors did when Mick Jagger sang ``Under My Thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   The lure of the bad boy remains; he entices because he presents
a challenge. A woman who adores Kid Rock can imagine herself as the
one lover who could earn his respect by matching his strength. The
Limp Bizkit fan dreams that once he got to know her, Durst would
like girls again.
</P>
<P>
   Personalizing their fantasies, fans do not always see the bigger
messages that artists put forth. And so the young women, feeling
free and charged with life, jump into the mosh pit. If only their
confidence were not then crushed by the men they trust.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company is thriving, the shareholders are rich and its name
is synonymous with high technology and success. But is the
Microsoft Corp.'s sterling image losing some of its luster?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question posed, at least, by the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide telephone survey two weeks ago, 60 percent of
the people who use a computer at work or at home said that they had
a favorable opinion of Microsoft. Most companies would envy such an
approval rating. But Microsoft is no ordinary company.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, 67 percent of computer users had a favorable
opinion of the company in a Times/CBS poll. And when the same
question, word for word, was asked in a Gallup poll in October
1997, 73 percent of computer users held a favorable view of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is troubling, even though Microsoft's
favorable-rating level remains very high,'' said Nicholas
Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a market research firm in San
Francisco that studies consumers' views on technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that its own market research _ using a somewhat
different methodology than the Times/CBS and Gallup polls _ finds
no erosion in its public image. The big software maker says its
favorable ratings have long held steady at 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll did find some good news for Microsoft on
other fronts. People, according to the survey, are less convinced
than a year ago that the government is doing the right thing with
its major antitrust suit against the company. And the Times/CBS
survey found that people, especially computer users, are far more
likely to agree with Microsoft that its practices are good for
consumers instead of harmful to them, as the government contends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet marketing experts say Microsoft should be watchful for any
hint of declining support for the company in general, as suggested
by the recent Times/CBS poll. Susan Fournier, an associate
professor at the Harvard Business School, says Microsoft could be
particularly vulnerable because of the relationship that consumers
tend to have with the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fournier applies ``relationship theory'' to consumer-brand
research. Based on surveys of adults, she has characterized the
primary relationship consumers have with products they are familiar
with. For example, Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle brand with a
fanatic following, is ``best friend.'' The ``mother-child''
relationship tends to be how consumers regard Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
AT&AMP;T, while McDonald's and Kraft Foods' Jello dessert brand fall
into the category of ``childhood buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft relationship, according to Ms. Fournier, is
``master-slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other kinds of brands, she says, fit into the master-slave
grouping: monopolies like the local cable television supplier or
the local telephone company, and products that are addictive like
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, Ms. Fournier points out, have double-edged feelings
about technology in general _ that it both frees and enslaves,
saves time and consumes time, assimilates and isolates. Still, she
notes that some Microsoft rivals like Apple Computer Inc. evoke
more ``positive socio-emotional responses'' from consumers. Apple,
her research suggests, is seen as a ``close friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fournier warns that if genuine alternatives to Microsoft
products develop _ say, the Linux operating system for Internet
server computers or a newly resurgent Apple in the consumer market
_ the slaves may quickly side with the competition. ``Microsoft
should see this as a huge red flag,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft should be particularly concerned about its image among
information technology professionals, according to Techtel Inc. The
market research firm, based in Emeryville, Calif., conducts
quarterly opinion surveys of about 900 information technology
professionals, who work with and buy business computer products.
</P>
<P>
   Techtel found that Microsoft's ``net positive rating'' _ the
percentage of those with a positive opinion of the company minus
the percentage with a negative opinion of it _ peaked in the second
quarter of 1997 at 60 percent and has since declined to 44 percent
in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's net positive rating within the nontechnical business
community and among households _ two other groups that Techtel
surveys quarterly _ has also declined, but not as much as among
information technology experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are the most forgiving, but the most knowledgeable
people have come down the most in their opinion of Microsoft,''
said Michael F. Kelly, president of Techtel. ``This is a building
and significant problem for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Times/CBS poll shows that opinions about Microsoft _
as a corporate symbol of wealth and technology _ can be complex and
ambivalent, and still generally positive. The Times/CBS poll,
conducted July 17-19, surveyed 1,178 adults. Seventy-three percent
of them said they used a computer at home or at work.
</P>
<P>
   One finding that intrigues polling experts is that while
Microsoft's favorable ratings fell, so did the percentage of people
who have an unfavorable opinion of the company _ to 11 percent
among computer users last month, down from 17 percent in the fall
of 1997. With both the favorable and unfavorable percentages
dropping over time, the various categories of uncertainty _
including ``neutral/neither,'' ``mixed'' and ``don't know'' _ have
increased.
</P>
<P>
   To Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup poll, the
growing pool of undecided respondents suggests an increasing public
ambivalence about Microsoft. He compares it to the phenomenon that
in political polling is termed ``hiding out,'' as people become
less enamored with an incumbent or front-runner but have not yet
decided to side with anyone else.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll also has comforting news for Microsoft about
public opinion concerning its long-running antitrust battle with
the Justice Department and 19 states. The government's suit and its
courtroom attacks on Microsoft may have tarnished the company's
reputation. Still, there is less support for the government's
position than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   People in the Times/CBS poll were less likely than a year ago to
agree that the government did the right thing by suing Microsoft.
And people were more inclined than a year ago to agree with
Microsoft that its practices are good for consumers _ 52 percent of
computer users agreed with Microsoft versus the 25 percent who
agreed with the Justice Department that the company's practices
harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Herbold, the chief operating officer at Microsoft,
said two weeks ago that the company's own polls found that most
people viewed the antitrust case as consumers. ``The American
public looks at this from the standpoint of what's in it relative
to the capabilities of the personal consumer and what they can do
for us, and are we being harmed,'' Herbold told a gathering of
securities analysts in Seattle. ``The general answer, as you can
see, obviously is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as obviously, though, the outcome of the Microsoft
antitrust case will be determined in the federal courts _ not in
the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when the polling data and market research on Microsoft
are combined, people still have an overwhelmingly favorable opinion
of the company, even if they describe their relationship with
Windows or Microsoft Office as master-slave. What does that make
Microsoft? A benevolent dictator, perhaps?

`THANKS': A PILGRIM NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE GRAMMY RUNS WILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(th)

<P>
   Things are hard in the Massachusetts Bay colony, but at least
the long, morale-destroying winter is over and the spring thaw is
under way. It's a beautiful day, James Winthrop (Tim Dutton)
declares, people are ``airing out their clothes, dragging out their
dead.'' His lovely wife, Polly (Kirsten Nelson), cheerfully calls
their two daughters and one son to breakfast: ``Get up, children!
Your boiling water's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   James is a happy Pilgrim, and he is pretty much alone in his
optimism. Everyone else in town is fed up and wants to go back to
England on the next ship. Especially his cranky mother (Cloris
Leachman), who lusts after sailors and loves to tell her
grandchildren pirate stories about her having been violated.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Thanks,'' a limited-run sitcom beginning on Monday night on
CBS, the Winthrops and their neighbors specialize in deliberately
anachronistic (and/or culture-specific) observations.
</P>
<P>
   Young Elizabeth Winthrop (Amy Centner) tells the local doctor
that he should wash his instruments because there might be tiny,
invisible animals living on them that could spread disease.
Elizabeth is promptly charged with witchcraft (not for the first
time).
</P>
<P>
   James speechifies about ``not saying what this colony can do for
me but what you can do for your colony.'' And when he responds to a
complaint by his daughter Abigail (Erika Christensen) with ``And I
suppose if half the girls in your class jumped off a cliff, you'd
do that too,'' Abigail's answer is extremely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The lasciviousness of Ms. Leachman's character could get old
fast, as could James and Polly's running joke about the difficulty
of finding privacy for sex in a one-room house, but the show's dark
humor has promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, laughs are drawn from starvation, plague
and fire-and-brimstone preaching. And when a pregnant woman talks
about having had contractions while attending a public execution,
Polly sighs and remarks, ``Ah, the circle of life!''
</P>

FUNDING HEAVYWEIGHT THROWS ITSELF BEHIND THE IDEA OF CULTURAL
POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pew Charitable Trusts, the $4.7-billion foundation that put
its weight behind causes like global warming, civic journalism and
campaign finance reform when they were first emerging, has a new
crusade: shaping a national cultural policy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the Pew plans to devote about 40
percent of its culture budget, some $50 million, to an attempt to
get policymakers to focus on issues like arts financing,
intellectual property rights, zoning in historic areas and an arts
curriculum for public schools. The new effort will involve academic
research, opinion polls and more media coverage, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next presidential election should be the last one in which
the parties are without a cultural policy plank in their
platforms,'' said Stephen K. Urice, the Pew official who will
direct the initiative. ``But first they need to have smart
academics, think tanks and data focusing on this, and that's where
we're headed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about developing an infrastructure for
understanding the role of culture in America,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scholarly work the Pew intends to sponsor would try
to establish the long-held but unproven belief in the arts world
that cultural programs are valuable intrinsically and not simply as
leisure activities, as many Americans see them, or as economic
engines, a more recent view.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew also plans to create an information center within a
year, perhaps in Washington, to collect and publish data, conduct
polls and organize conferences. It also plans to start a
communications effort to support more media coverage of the arts,
particularly on television. And it intends to work with orchestras,
theaters, museums and other arts institutions to develop new ways
to measure their value to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about strengthening the arts organizations of
this country,'' said Marion A. Godfrey, the director of the Pew's
culture programs, which include the new initiative.
</P>
<P>
   A few other foundations and universities have also started
thinking about cultural policy, though on a smaller scale, and many
in the arts world think it is time to grapple with other festering
issues, like federal funding for the arts and humanities. Urice
said it was ``overstating the case just a bit to say that this is
like the period following the publication of `Silent Spring,''' the
1962 book by Rachel Carson that galvanized the environmental
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Arts and culture, which make up between 3 percent and 6 percent
of the gross domestic product and which, including everything from
dance group tours to movie distribution, are the nation's second
largest export after technology, also suffer from official
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, the policymakers who venture into virtually
every other corner of American life all but ignore culture. So do
federal bureaucrats. Although the government knows, for example,
that Americans spend $5.1 billion on television repair, make 504
billion local phone calls, eat on average 4.4 pounds of canned fish
a year, and have 12,400 compatriots who produce leather goods at an
average wage of $10.98 an hour, it has no idea how many people
attend dance performances, what violinists earn or how many art
museums or community theaters exist across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As the program's first grant, the Pew has commissioned an
18-month study by the Rand Corporation that will map the locales,
types and budgets, among other things, of the 18,000 nonprofit
cultural institutions that file annually with the Internal Revenue
Service. Later, the Pew hopes to expand this databank to include
many more cultural outlets, from unincorporated storefront
community arts centers to giant entertainment corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the United States wants or needs an arts policy is a
matter of debate, of course, even among people in the arts. The
director of one large museum physically retreated from a
conversation at the mere mention of the words ``cultural policy,''
Urice recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term jars people,'' he said. ``They think you are talking
about centralized authority or regulation'' _ not, as the Pew is
suggesting as possibilities, discussions about grants to individual
artists, about mandatory arts curriculum in schools or about laws
that would prohibit the export of items that are considered part of
the national heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that foundations would divert their money to the study
of culture, rather than to cultural programs themselves. And some
believe that anything that has an influence on creative activity is
un-American.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, there are people like Glenn D. Lowry, the
director of the Museum of Modern Art. In a new book called ``250
Ways to Make America Better,'' published by George magazine, he
makes the case for a national cultural policy. America, he writes,
``must recognize that the arts are not just important to our
society but a national responsibility, just as education, science,
health and the environment are national responsibilities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   That view is gaining currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some time ago, a handful of us realized that there wasn't a
solid research basis for advocacy,'' said James Allen Smith, a
historian and the former executive director of the Howard Gilman
Foundation. So in 1994, the Gilman, along with the Pew and the Ford
Foundation, banded together to form the Center for Arts and Culture
in Washington, a policy center working to define the issues, themes
and actions that affect the cultural sector.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton, Northeastern, Harvard and a few other universities
also are looking at cultural policy questions, as are individual
scholars at other universities. Several nonprofit organizations,
like the Rockefeller Foundation, are exploring cultural policy,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pew, the Philadelphia-based behemoth started by the
heirs of Sun Oil Company's founders, is taking the most
comprehensive approach. ``No foundation has gone as far as the Pew
in starting a long-term strategic program,'' said Smith, now board
president of the Center for Arts and Culture.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Pew, which last year spent $213 million on educational,
environmental, health and social policy and cultural and religious
issues, has so far shared its plans with only a few likely
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll ask what are the right questions, what is the right
information we need to gather,'' said Joan Shigekawa, an associate
director of the Rockefeller Foundation's arts and humanities
program. ``It's really about preserving and enabling American
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the Pew's initiative is fallout from the culture
wars that flared in the late 1980s, when conservatives began
attacking the National Endowment for the Arts for financing artists
whose work dealt with sexuality and other provocative themes. The
Endowment survived repeated attempts to kill it, but its annual
budget, now $98 million, has been cut nearly in half from its peak.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pew, Ms. Godfrey was disturbed not just by the attack but
by the lack of an articulate rebuttal. ``I've watched the arts
community really struggle in its ability to make the case for
itself,'' she said. ``That was the backdrop I was stewing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Godfrey, who is the new initiative's main proponent, said
she hoped that a case for more government money for the arts can be
made with data the Pew will collect.
</P>
<P>
   But Pew officials dispute any notion that the initiative is
really just about getting more money for the Endowment. ``People
saying that will miss the point,'' said Urice. ``It may be we
discover the arts simply need reliable, more consistent support or
consolidation in some areas where there is oversupply. I wouldn't
say more money is the solution; smarter money may be the answer
instead. And there are many other forms of support _ political
support, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fragile financial health of cultural institutions is
a matter of concern. While many arts institutions, including art
museums and opera companies, are thriving, others, including a good
number of symphony orchestras and dance companies, are not. Many
are ``drastically undercapitalized,'' Ms. Godfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those arts groups that are doing well are highly dependent
on individual and corporate donations, which in turn rest on the
continued strength of the stampeding stock market, now in its ninth
bull year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem stems from the way Americans view culture.
``I don't think the arts are seen as integral to human existence,''
Ms. Godfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The few participation studies that exist _ some are 10 years old
or more _ seem to indicate that hard-core arts lovers comprise 10
percent to 12 percent of the population but also that a vast
majority of people visit a museum, attend the theater or otherwise
participate in the arts at least once a year. (One new, unpublished
study of Philadelphians, financed by the Pew and the Heinz
Endowment, found that 90 percent of those surveyed did so, and that
74 percent engaged in an arts activity three or more times a year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how to take participation and raise that to a
level of concern,'' Urice said.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort's early stages, however, the Pew has set its
sights on a smaller target. ``The primary audience of our
initiative is really the arts community, policymakers and the
media, to help people who think about the arts think about them in
a more informed way,'' Ms. Godfrey said. ``A big part of our effort
will be the media part.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the financier of the National Arts Journalism Program at
the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University, the Pew
will look into supporting or creating a national arts news program
in broadcasting. And it expects the results of its research and its
polls, with precise subjects yet to be determined, to make news.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew's goals with arts institutions may be the most difficult
to accomplish: It wants to try to measure intangible results as an
indicator of their value.
</P>
<P>
   Arts groups usually depend on two other indicators of that,
attendance and economic benefits studies. But many people think
those are at best mistaken and at worst traps: wrong-headed because
neither is why arts institutions exist, dangerous because both
could easily drop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Godfrey said the foundation would center on
documenting other benefits. For example, she said, ``research shows
that arts in schools help kids develop their thinking and learning
skills, there is anecdotal evidence about the role of arts in
community revitalization, and there is the impact of arts on
individuals, the stories of how one person's life is changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, outsiders said, the Pew's plan could help frame
a long-needed debate. ``Their plan is very smartly put together,''
said Smith, the historian. ``The question I have is whether they
can make it as long a commitment as it needs. Will it disappear
after five years? Will the board understand it? Will it draw in
other foundations?''

DANKA, COPIER-WAR CASUALTY, IS BACK ON ITS FEET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danka Business Systems plans to report financial results this
week for the first quarter of its new fiscal year, and revenue will
probably be way down, debt high and profit minimal, at best.
</P>
<P>
   But for several weeks now, Danka's top brass have beamed as they
anticipated showing those numbers to the world. Who can blame them?
Scarcely six months ago, no one was certain that Danka, which is
incorporated in Britain but run out of St. Petersburg, Fla., would
survive at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not declaring premature victory,'' said Larry Switzer,
Danka's chief executive. ``But we got our hands around the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Any immersion in black ink is a triumph for Danka, the
second-largest distributor of copiers, which posted sales of $3.35
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since last fall, when Danka's board changed the company's
management, plucking Switzer from Fruit of the Loom and selecting
Brian Merriman, from Toshiba, as president, the two men have been
cutting, chopping, negotiating and otherwise wrenching Danka back
from the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   They talked the company's banks, which were poised to call in
loans, into extending more credit. They persuaded Eastman Kodak Co.
to let them wriggle out of a contract that forced Danka to buy
copiers it could not sell. They got Xerox Corp. to buy back a
lackluster business for servicing older, scattered Xerox machines.
</P>
<P>
   And they squeezed $108 million out of yearly costs. Danka used
to have 48 warehouses; it now has three. It had 45 billing centers;
five now suffice. The new team sharply cut prices to move older
inventory. It eliminated 1,400 jobs, reducing the work force to
17,000, and integrated data systems. It sold Danka's facsimile
business, closed its wholesale business and cut out ``a ton of
superfluous marketing programs,'' Merriman said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are phasing out products from all but three vendors:
Canon, Toshiba and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. The German
company bought Kodak's copier business in March, giving it
ownership of the Digisource 9110, the only copier fast enough to
rival Xerox's Docutech line.
</P>
<P>
   Danka's operating expenses are still high, as are the
double-digit interest rates it is paying on its $1.1 billion debt.
A deal to sell its international operations to Schroder Ventures, a
British holding company, fell through in June, depriving Danka of
cash it needs to service debt. Its sales remain sluggish. And
competition keeps getting fiercer as more companies introduce
digital copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may see more pricing pressures on everyone in the next 12
to 18 months,'' warned Jack Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Danka no longer seems headed for extinction. ``We've seen
the last really horrendous quarter,'' said B. Alexander Henderson,
an analyst with Prudential Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are coming around. Danka's stock closed Friday at
$11.21875, nowhere near the $51 it traded at two years ago, but
well above the $1.75 it had sunk to in October. ``I bought this
stock at $4, and I expect to make a lot of money on it,'' said
Frank Cannata, who edits a copier-industry newsletter and who said
he expects Danka share price to top $15 in a year. ``They've made
progress in every critical area.''
</P>
<P>
   To fully understand the magnitude of Danka's turnaround, one has
to first understand the depths to which the company had sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Danka, which was formed in 1977, immediately began gobbling up
other dealers. It, in turn, was purchased by a British holding
company in 1986, and Danka's shares began trading in London that
year. Its American depository receipts began trading on Nasdaq in
1992. By last year Danka was an international giant, handling more
than 40 copiers from six manufacturers, each with hefty costs for
training and spare-parts inventories.
</P>
<P>
   But few Danka dealers carried the entire product line. If a
large customer wanted to install one type of equipment in all its
branches, Danka could not guarantee service at every location. That
problem became critical as more companies moved to digital copiers
that could link throughout their networks.
</P>
<P>
   Woes intensified in 1996, when Danka bought Kodak's copier sales
operation for $558 million. Danka never consolidated facilities or
data systems and was left with huge overhead costs and slow data
flows. Culture clashes caused many of the best sales
representatives to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danka's sales force was a street-fighting machine, while
Kodak's people were genteel, slow-moving, paternal,'' said
Henderson of Prudential. ``Frustrations were surfacing even as
Xerox was introducing its first digital products in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Merriman ruefully agreed. ``The difference in sense of urgency
was night and day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, sales plummeted. That was no problem for Kodak,
since Danka had agreed to buy products whether they sold or not.
But the growing gap between what it bought and what it sold pushed
Danka to the point of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, Switzer and Merriman reported to the Securities
and Exchange Commission that Danka might file for bankruptcy. ``We
had to shock Kodak and the banks into realizing how serious our
situation was,'' Switzer said. The move worked: In December, Kodak
let Danka out of its contract.
</P>
<P>
   Danka has since been helped by fortuitous timing. Both Canon and
Toshiba came out with full lines of digital copiers, helping Danka
flesh out its scrawny digital product line.
</P>
<P>
   And Danka negotiated a deal with Heidelberger for distributing
the Digisource that does not involve high fixed prices or promises
to take Heidelberger's entire output. While the distribution
contract is not exclusive, Danka's participation in Digisource's
development _ and its relationships with Kodak's customers _ gives
it a head start in selling and servicing the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've even had other potential distributors of the device ask
us if we would service the machines for their accounts,'' Merriman
said.

 UNDATED: Merriman said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, Danka's path to growth remains obstacle-strewn. Since it
has stopped servicing Xerox's older machines, it has lost an
invaluable foot in the door to some clients of Xerox, which uses
neither Danka nor the country's largest distributor, Ikon Office
Solutions. Meanwhile, IBM has announced its own high-speed copier.
And many of the Kodak salespeople who left Danka have customer
relationships they can build on for rival distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Merriman has been reorganizing Danka's sales force, putting
former Kodak people in charge of many major accounts and leaving
most of the aggressive selling to the Danka sales force. Still,
several analysts say that sales is Danka's weak link.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that Danka has the experienced personnel to sell
high-speed digital devices,'' said Edward Lee, a senior analyst at
Lyra Research.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Danka's revival has not prompted its competitors or
suppliers to shift strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting more than 200 resellers for our products, and
no change in Danka's prospects will have an impact on our marketing
plans,'' said a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., which is pushing
a line of hybrid printer-copiers called mopiers, that it had once
planned to distribute through Danka.
</P>
<P>
   And Canon is trying to bring its direct sales up to 45 percent
of total revenue from 35 percent now. The company also stopped
granting any independent distributors exclusive territories. That
can help Danka sell equipment and service packages to large
customers _ but, it can help Ikon do so as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danka has a lot of potential to grow with us, but Ikon is
still a bigger channel for us,'' said Tod Pike, senior vice
president for Canon USA's imaging systems group.
</P>
<P>
   Ikon also spent much of this year paring vendors and shoring up
a sagging bottom line, and it has said that it will concentrate on
pumping up sales of a few big vendors _ including Canon _ when its
2000 fiscal year starts in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narrowing down vendors is a smart move for anyone,'' said
Dennis Le Strange, senior vice president for Ikon North America,
``but we remain focused on our own plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Danka's competitors hope the company makes it.
They see a revived Danka as an ally in the battle to prevent Xerox,
which declined to comment for this article, from getting the same
hammerlock on the digital copier market that it has enjoyed in
analog copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll root for any company that can persuade customers to buy
from someone other than the big X,'' said Jim Ivy, chief executive
of Savin Corp., a copier manufacturer owned by Ricoh. ``If Danka
grows, it'll be more effective in competing with Xerox, and anyone
who hurts Xerox is good in my books.''

SUN MICROSYSTEMS SET TO INTRODUCE NEW MICROPROCESSOR DESIGN FOR
POST-PC ERA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems has disclosed the first details
of a new microprocessor design the company hopes could become a
standard for computing in the post-PC era.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to be formally introduced at an industry technical
conference to be held at Stanford University later this month, the
new chip design _ known as Microprocessor Architecture for Java
Computing, or MAJC _ is intended to be used in computing
applications beyond the standard desktop personal computer market
that is dominated by the Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, based in the Mountain View, Calif., has made a number of
attempts to develop processor standards that are independent of
both Intel and Sun's rival, the Microsoft Corp. Neither of those
designs _ Sparc and Pico Java _ have gained broad market acceptance
beyond Sun's products.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer industry is widely believed to now be at a
crossroads because the Internet has opened the possibility of
extending computing to many new applications, including everything
from television set-top boxes to navigational systems for cars.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of new chip designs are now on the horizon, ranging
from Sony's Emotion Engine for the Playstation II to a variety of
specialized chips for a new generation of hybrid cellular telephone
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry executives expect such consumer computing
applications to require alternative processor designs than those
that have been standard for the computing industry until now. That
belief has touched off a race toward new types of processors that
have features known as very long instruction word, or VLIW, and
digital signal processing, or DSP. Such chips might be better
suited than today's to handling so-called multimedia information,
such as video, voice and animation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sun MAJC chip is also intended to run modern programming
languages more quickly than today's microprocessors and as such
will be viewed as a competitor with Intel and Hewlett-Packard's new
IA64 chip design, which is initially aimed at the market for
high-end corporate computing.
</P>
<P>
   If Sun is to be successful this time it will be because of the
most significant features of the chip are what computer designer's
refer to as ``scaleable'' _ able to be expanded and created in a
modular fashion to permit it to be used across a range of computing
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an architecture that is designed to allow you to make
good use of all the transistors that will be available in the
future,'' said Tom Halfhill, a computer analyst at Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's new design project was started four years ago by a group
led by William Joy, a software designer who is one of the company's
four founders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to take a clean sheet of paper and start over,''
said Marge Breya, vice president of marketing and business at the
company's microelectronics division.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Cooler, drier Canadian air will filter to the south across much
of the Northeast and the Middle Atlantic states Monday as a
refreshing area of high pressure moves into the region. The cool
front that is the leading edge of this air will move into the
Southeast, sparking showers and thunderstorms over the Carolinas.
Behind the front, several locations in the Northeast will have
below normal temperatures for the first time in over a week.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms are also likely across the central
Plains as a weak area of low pressure becomes nearly stationary
over the region. Winds blowing up the gently sloping terrain
towards the Rockies on the north side of this low will lead to
showers, along with a nearly solid deck of low stratus clouds. To
the southwest, the monsoon will remain active in New Mexico with
showers and thunderstorms likely.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Great Lakes will remain dry as high pressure slides
to the south. A jet stream disturbance at 18,000 feet will clip the
northern Lakes, however, bringing cloudy skies and some isolated
showers to the region. Meanwhile, farther south, there will likely
be a few showers along the coast of Florida and along the Gulf
Coast as sea breezes undercut and lift very warm and humid air.
</P>
<P>
   The interior West will be sunny and turning hotter under
abundant amounts of sunshine. Along the coast in Washington and
Oregon, low clouds and fog are likely as ocean air gets pushed
inland. A weak disturbance aloft will promote isolated showers in
interior portions of Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TWO-FACED RALEIGH
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh, North Carolina sweltered under 104 degree heat on
Saturday, its second highest reading on record. This also marked
the seventh time in July and eighth time this season that the
mercury eclipsed 100 degrees, a feat that has never been matched
before in the capital. However, Raleigh residents need only recall
the second week of July when on four consecutive days the afternoon
high temperatures were the lowest on record. During the midsummer
cool spell, clouds, showers and a brisk wind from the ocean brought
the respite from the hot weather. This week should be cooler.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: INSTANT MESSAGING AND OTHER `STICKY' ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The keening outrage in the national news media last week over
America Online's proprietary behavior toward its Instant Messaging
customers strikes many veterans of the computer industry as just
plain goofy.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is whether America Online has the right
to enforce _ and by what means _ the network barriers that separate
its 80 million Instant Messaging customers from (a) the clutches of
its grasping competitors and (b) the rest of the instant-messaging
world.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, this is just business as usual. Examine the
practices of any market leader and its products in the last 20 or
30 years _ IBM, Digital Equipment, Lotus Development, Microsoft _
and it is clear that America Online is simply acting out one of the
most enduring concepts in the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Today's buzzword for the concept is ``stickiness,'' a rather
glib term for how a company gets and keeps customers in the
notoriously slippery world of the Internet, where a Web site can be
come-and-gone at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sticky'' has also long been the goal of vendors and service
providers. Many have built their biggest successes upon enticing
customers with sweet-smelling technical solutions that, once
installed, make it extremely painful to switch to a competitor's
product.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the dominant, albeit unheralded, business model of
the computer and software industry since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days of ``big iron'' mainframe computers and
workstations, companies like IBM Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.
were the biggest flypaper vendors in town, selling the computers,
the operating systems and often the software, too.
</P>
<P>
   Their hegemony was broken by the personal computer _ and then
stickiness between Windows and its applications catapulted
Microsoft to its monopoly in the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   That's because once buyers commit their customer databases,
corporate documents and financial data to an operating system and
brand of application software, they are basically stuck. Anyone who
has tried even to switch from one company's word processor to
another's can imagine the exponential agony of trying to move an
entire corporation from, say, Unix to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a classic sticky application, one that effectively
``persuades'' customers to stick around. First they are enticed by
how convenient it is to use the product. Then they stay because it
becomes so terribly inconvenient to leave.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, stickiness has more to do with collecting
valuable personal information about consumers and holding their
attention than with storing their data bits. Finding a way to
create consumer stickiness is a high priority most particularly for
portal sites _ Yahoo, At Home's Excite, Lycos, America Online,
Microsoft's MSN _ and retailers like Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, these vendors hang a few more strips of
flypaper: free e-mail, custom news services, address books and
directories, calendars and event planners, gift services, personal
Web sites. Customers sign up and stick around, plugging in more and
more personal and family and financial information as they return
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like America Online and Microsoft are planning
``digital wallet'' services that will enable users to consolidate
all their sign-in names and passwords. The sales pitch is
convenience _ ostensibly consumers would not need to keep
re-entering the same personal information over and over as they
travel and shop the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But obviously such wallets are also powerful flypaper
applications that, if successful, will tie up consumers' data with
a single vendor who will process all their Internet purchases and
activities.
</P>
<P>
   This type of ``service'' raises the collective eyebrow of those
who remember the enormous power shift in the technology industry
when the Internet's open protocols and the Web's freely available
programming language, HTML, first loosened the hold that the
flypaper vendors had on their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the goal of the free market economy is to whup all
your competitors and become the de facto flypaper standard.
</P>
<P>
   And that is fine as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   But as the technology food chain has lengthened to include
hundreds of millions of consumers, the concept of ``sticky'' versus
``stuck'' has taken on new cultural and economic portent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, America Online's competitors _ particularly
Microsoft _ are acting purely in their own commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the great imposer of unilateral standards, provided
the industry with a Fellini-esque moment last week when an
executive was quoted as saying, ``We should all just speak the same
language,'' adding, ``It shouldn't matter what software or phone
you are using.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaining access to America Online's Instant Message system, thus
its customer database, puts a crimp in the online giant's growing
domination of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But you can bet that if America Online's competitors succeed,
they will scramble for a way to alter any new standard to their own
ends, just as Microsoft unilaterally rewrote two key open Internet
languages, Sun Microsystems' Java and Netscape's Javascript.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, an open standard for instant-message
applications has the potential to unstick consumers and reconnect
them to the rest of the Internet. Which is why today, battles for
dominance of the Internet are of great public interest. Everyone is
watching, and millions more people have a stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   As one entrepreneur said last week, ``It's the users who are
going to decide if they prefer to stay in a segregated community or
talk to other communities.'' And that is the kind of sticky
situation the industry may not have a strategy for.

<P>
   Danka Business Systems plans to report financial results this
week for the first quarter of its new fiscal year, and revenue will
probably be way down, debt high and profit minimal, at best.
</P>
<P>
   But for several weeks now, Danka's top brass have beamed as they
anticipated showing those numbers to the world. Who can blame them?
Scarcely six months ago, no one was certain that Danka, which is
incorporated in Britain but run out of St. Petersburg, Fla., would
survive at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not declaring premature victory,'' said Larry Switzer,
Danka's chief executive. ``But we got our hands around the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Any immersion in black ink is a triumph for Danka, the
second-largest distributor of copiers, which posted sales of $3.35
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since last fall, when Danka's board changed the company's
management, plucking Switzer from Fruit of the Loom and selecting
Brian Merriman, from Toshiba, as president, the two men have been
cutting, chopping, negotiating and otherwise wrenching Danka back
from the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   They talked the company's banks, which were poised to call in
loans, into extending more credit. They persuaded Eastman Kodak Co.
to let them wriggle out of a contract that forced Danka to buy
copiers it could not sell. They got Xerox Corp. to buy back a
lackluster business for servicing older, scattered Xerox machines.
</P>
<P>
   And they squeezed $108 million out of yearly costs. Danka used
to have 48 warehouses; it now has three. It had 45 billing centers;
five now suffice. The new team sharply cut prices to move older
inventory. It eliminated 1,400 jobs, reducing the work force to
17,000, and integrated data systems. It sold Danka's facsimile
business, closed its wholesale business and cut out ``a ton of
superfluous marketing programs,'' Merriman said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are phasing out products from all but three vendors:
Canon, Toshiba and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. The German
company bought Kodak's copier business in March, giving it
ownership of the Digisource 9110, the only copier fast enough to
rival Xerox's Docutech line.
</P>
<P>
   Danka's operating expenses are still high, as are the
double-digit interest rates it is paying on its $1.1 billion debt.
A deal to sell its international operations to Schroder Ventures, a
British holding company, fell through in June, depriving Danka of
cash it needs to service debt. Its sales remain sluggish. And
competition keeps getting fiercer as more companies introduce
digital copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may see more pricing pressures on everyone in the next 12
to 18 months,'' warned Jack Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Danka no longer seems headed for extinction. ``We've seen
the last really horrendous quarter,'' said B. Alexander Henderson,
an analyst with Prudential Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are coming around. Danka's stock closed Friday at
$11.21875, nowhere near the $51 it traded at two years ago, but
well above the $1.75 it had sunk to in October. ``I bought this
stock at $4, and I expect to make a lot of money on it,'' said
Frank Cannata, who edits a copier-industry newsletter and who said
he expects Danka share price to top $15 in a year. ``They've made
progress in every critical area.''
</P>
<P>
   To fully understand the magnitude of Danka's turnaround, one has
to first understand the depths to which the company had sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Danka, which was formed in 1977, immediately began gobbling up
other dealers. It, in turn, was purchased by a British holding
company in 1986, and Danka's shares began trading in London that
year. Its American depository receipts began trading on Nasdaq in
1992. By last year Danka was an international giant, handling more
than 40 copiers from six manufacturers, each with hefty costs for
training and spare-parts inventories.
</P>
<P>
   But few Danka dealers carried the entire product line. If a
large customer wanted to install one type of equipment in all its
branches, Danka could not guarantee service at every location. That
problem became critical as more companies moved to digital copiers
that could link throughout their networks.
</P>
<P>
   Woes intensified in 1996, when Danka bought Kodak's copier sales
operation for $558 million. Danka never consolidated facilities or
data systems and was left with huge overhead costs and slow data
flows. Culture clashes caused many of the best sales
representatives to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danka's sales force was a street-fighting machine, while
Kodak's people were genteel, slow-moving, paternal,'' said
Henderson of Prudential. ``Frustrations were surfacing even as
Xerox was introducing its first digital products in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Merriman ruefully agreed. ``The difference in sense of urgency
was night and day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, sales plummeted. That was no problem for Kodak,
since Danka had agreed to buy products whether they sold or not.
But the growing gap between what it bought and what it sold pushed
Danka to the point of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, Switzer and Merriman reported to the Securities
and Exchange Commission that Danka might file for bankruptcy. ``We
had to shock Kodak and the banks into realizing how serious our
situation was,'' Switzer said. The move worked: In December, Kodak
let Danka out of its contract.
</P>
<P>
   Danka has since been helped by fortuitous timing. Both Canon and
Toshiba came out with full lines of digital copiers, helping Danka
flesh out its scrawny digital product line.
</P>
<P>
   And Danka negotiated a deal with Heidelberger for distributing
the Digisource that does not involve high fixed prices or promises
to take Heidelberger's entire output. While the distribution
contract is not exclusive, Danka's participation in Digisource's
development _ and its relationships with Kodak's customers _ gives
it a head start in selling and servicing the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've even had other potential distributors of the device ask
us if we would service the machines for their accounts,'' Merriman
said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, Danka's path to growth remains obstacle-strewn. Since it
has stopped servicing Xerox's older machines, it has lost an
invaluable foot in the door to some clients of Xerox, which uses
neither Danka nor the country's largest distributor, Ikon Office
Solutions. Meanwhile, IBM has announced its own high-speed copier.
And many of the Kodak salespeople who left Danka have customer
relationships they can build on for rival distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Merriman has been reorganizing Danka's sales force, putting
former Kodak people in charge of many major accounts and leaving
most of the aggressive selling to the Danka sales force. Still,
several analysts say that sales is Danka's weak link.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that Danka has the experienced personnel to sell
high-speed digital devices,'' said Edward Lee, a senior analyst at
Lyra Research.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Danka's revival has not prompted its competitors or
suppliers to shift strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting more than 200 resellers for our products, and
no change in Danka's prospects will have an impact on our marketing
plans,'' said a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., which is pushing
a line of hybrid printer-copiers called mopiers, that it had once
planned to distribute through Danka.
</P>
<P>
   And Canon is trying to bring its direct sales up to 45 percent
of total revenue from 35 percent now. The company also stopped
granting any independent distributors exclusive territories. That
can help Danka sell equipment and service packages to large
customers _ but, it can help Ikon do so as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danka has a lot of potential to grow with us, but Ikon is
still a bigger channel for us,'' said Tod Pike, senior vice
president for Canon USA's imaging systems group.
</P>
<P>
   Ikon also spent much of this year paring vendors and shoring up
a sagging bottom line, and it has said that it will concentrate on
pumping up sales of a few big vendors _ including Canon _ when its
2000 fiscal year starts in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narrowing down vendors is a smart move for anyone,'' said
Dennis Le Strange, senior vice president for Ikon North America,
``but we remain focused on our own plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Danka's competitors hope the company makes it.
They see a revived Danka as an ally in the battle to prevent Xerox,
which declined to comment for this article, from getting the same
hammerlock on the digital copier market that it has enjoyed in
analog copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll root for any company that can persuade customers to buy
from someone other than the big X,'' said Jim Ivy, chief executive
of Savin Corp., a copier manufacturer owned by Ricoh. ``If Danka
grows, it'll be more effective in competing with Xerox, and anyone
who hurts Xerox is good in my books.''

<P>
   While most of his readers are still asleep, James Romenesko is
up at 5 a.m. each weekday, furiously surfing the Web. He reads
newspaper sites, magazine sites, gossip sites and alternative sites
in search of stories that are appropriate for the two digests of
Web links he publishes.
</P>
<P>
   For Mediagossip.com, Romenesko seeks news and criticism about
the media and those who work in it. For The Obscure Store and
Reading Room (www.obscurestore.com), he scours for stories that are
more offbeat, like a recent piece about a batboy attacking a
baseball team's mascot and another about the struggles of a Pee-Wee
Herman impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is absolutely the best for finding goofy stories,'' said
Steve Knopper, himself a practitioner of the emerging specialty of
Net scavenging. Knopper writes Yahoo Internet Life's Daily Net Buzz
column (www.zdnet.com/yil/content/depts/netbuzz), which also
provides links to articles from a variety of news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Summaries of news predate the Internet, of course. But in the
digital era, when virtually anyone with Net access can operate an
electronic clipping service, the genre has spawned thousands of
news hounds _ not to mention the news links on big portal sites
like Yahoo and Excite. Yet, largely through grass-roots,
word-of-mouse popularity, sites like Romenesko's are catching on
with a discerning crowd _ including reporters and editors of many
news organizations, who rely on the sites to help filter the welter
of information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Such digests, whether compiled as a collection of links on a Web
site or distributed by electronic mail, sift the online content of
established media organizations like ABC News (abcnews.go.com),
MSNBC (msnbc.com) and The New York Times on the Web (nytimes.com),
as well as alternative outlets like New York Press
(newyorkpress.com) and The Smoking Gun (thesmokinggun.com).
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of Net digests, with their own growing audiences,
include Media Grok and Davenetics (www.davenetics.com).
</P>
<P>
   Many digests do not link to news sites like The Wall Street
Journal Interactive Edition or TheStreet.com that charge readers a
fee. And Romenesko even declines to include free sites that require
readers to register, like The New York Times Web site _ though he
will sometimes cite some of the articles that appear on the Times'
affiliated city guide, New York Today (nytoday.com), which can be
read without registering.
</P>
<P>
   A gatekeeper for gatekeepers, Romenesko said that, according to
the traffic logs for his two sites, his ``many thousands'' of daily
readers included regular visitors from National Public Radio, CNBC,
Conde Nast, Hearst and numerous other media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of the other more popular Web news sifters, Romenesko
is himself a professional journalist. But it is not until after
updating both his sites with new links and images by about 8:30
a.m. each weekday that he heads off for work at The St. Paul
Pioneer Press, where he covers the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He receives no pay for the time he devotes to his own Web sites,
though he does use them to link to items he is auctioning on Ebay,
like old issues of Spy magazine. And recently he began running paid
banner ads on the sites. Mainly, though, he operates the sites
``for personal pleasure and not for great financial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in DIY _ do it yourself _
movements and projects,'' Romenesko said. ``And I see my work as an
online DIY venture. While other sites brag about growth and
expanding employee payrolls, I talk about staying a one-person
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another soloist is Knopper, who writes Daily Net Buzz from his
home in Chicago. Daily Net Buzz includes breaking news,
entertainment, sports, technology and quirky stories. ``I'm always
looking for stories that have a twist,'' Knopper said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other news digests focus on a specific industry or
niche. Some readers say these compilations are changing the way
people consume news in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Erik Rydholm, chief operating officer and a
founding partner of the Motley Fool financial site, said he was
much less informed before he began reading Media Grok, a daily
online newsletter published on the Web site of a technology
magazine, The Industry Standard
(www.thestandard.com/articles/mediagrok). Media Grok provides
summaries of and links to media coverage of the Internet and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this thing came out, I actually didn't keep up with the
industry, because it was too much of a pain to go from site to
site,'' Rydholm said. ``Now I can do my competitive research, and
it only takes me about 15 minutes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an industry where value is often measured by page views
and unique users, the most popular digests play an important
promotional role for the World Wide Web sites that they send
readers to. In fact, many journalists now pitch their stories for
inclusion in Mediagossip, Media Grok or other digests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly getting e-mail from people at media
outlets,'' said Mark Glaser, one of four writers who compile Media
Grok. ``And we appreciate it. If people are pointing us to things,
it makes our job easier.'' By the same token, Glaser said he had
received e-mail from reporters asking why their articles were
neglected in favor of competitors'.
</P>
<P>
   James Poniewozik, the television critic for Time magazine, a
former media critic for Salon and a regular reader of Romenesko's
sites, noted that online journalism provided more immediate
feedback than print journalism. ``Online,'' he said, ``you are, at
least theoretically, constantly aware of the number of hits you're
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsletters and Web sites that link to technology news are among
the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find especially in the coverage of technology is that
there is such a scrum of journalism today,'' said Scott Rosenberg,
managing editor of Salon and a longtime technology reporter.
``There is such a pile-on. It's almost impossible for a single
human being to monitor it all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg relies on about a dozen digests of links to technology
coverage. These sites include Scripting News (www.scripting.com),
which is published by Dave Winer, a software developer who has
written for Hotwired.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Pell, managing director of Arba Seed Investment Group in
San Francisco, publishes a free e-mail newsletter called
Davenetics. Each day, Pell summarizes and links to the latest
technology stories, putting his own spin on the news through the
headlines and summaries he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Pell started Davenetics in February with about 50 subscribers,
after realizing that he often e-mailed his business associates
several times a day about news stories he had found. Davenetics now
has more than 1,500 subscribers, and Pell says most of his readers
work for or invest in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pell, who has invested in companies including the online
magazine Feed and the product information site Productopia, calls
himself a ``total content fanatic.'' And he says he is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the growth of e-commerce, it still doesn't come
close to the people who are looking for information,'' Pell said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to independent newsletters like Davenetics, digests
published by media outlets like The San Jose Mercury News or The
Industry Standard publish links to their own stories as well as
articles from their competitors. In that respect, the digests can
serve as supplements to the originating publication _ or as
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Media Grok's Glaser, for example, says that readers have told
him that they read his site's news summaries instead of the actual
articles he links to. Glaser, though, says he reads about 25
stories and skims another 10 or 15 each evening that he works on
Media Grok, which he does from home. The Industry Standard says
Media Grok, which is available by e-mail and on the magazine's Web
site, is read by about 100,000 people each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who are reading it who are business
people that are using it as a service to keep up with the news,''
Glaser said. ``I didn't realize we would become a substitute for
the news.''

   TOAD _ BASTROP, Texas _ The endangered Houston Toads' mating
chorus _ an unmistakable high-pitched trill that cuts through the
warm, humid air of late winter evenings in the Lost Pines of
Bastrop County _ has lost some of its resonance in recent years.
Biologists have taken stock of the muzzled mating calls and
concluded recently that the fragile toads are disappearing at a
dangerous rate that throws their survival in the balance. U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service officials met in April with Bastrop County
leaders to share their findings _ that the toad, first listed as
endangered in 1970, is hurtling toward extinction due in part to
haphazard development within the loblolly pine forests the toads
call home. (Gee, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: ILLNESS AND 3 RENDELL MYSTERIES, ALL AT ONCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By a happy conjunction, or so it seemed at the time, just as I
was felled by a bout of illness, three new paperback reprints from
the extensive works of Ruth Rendell arrived to keep me company.
Between spurts of pain and the cushion of painkillers, I was in no
shape for heavy reading and mysteries seemed just undemanding
enough yet sufficiently diverting to occupy my weakened
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I was not unaware of Ms. Rendell's lustrous reputation as a
practitioner of what are known as classic British mysteries. She
has earned three Edgars, four Gold Daggers and something called the
Grand Master award, although some of these may rightly belong to
Barbara Vine, her occasional pseudonym. But I had never read one of
her books. So here was my chance, and I went at it with gratitude
and anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   The well-designed reprints, from Vintage Crime/Black Lizard,
made a tidy package, and it felt disrespectful to separate them. I
kept the neat pile at bedside, where I found myself switching, as
is my custom with weightier books, from one volume to another.
Impatient with the mystery apparatus, my technique was to pick up
whichever volume lay close at hand and test myself on fragments of
plot to see whether I could keep track from one work to another. I
had read enough of other mysteries to recognize the formulas on
which many are constructed, and I felt up to the challenge between
author and reader.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rendell's language did not prove much of a guide. It turns
out that she has a literary bent (``So shalt thou feed on death
that feeds on men, and death, once dead, no more dying then.''),
and I found myself confronted by chapter headings from Sir Thomas
More's ``Utopia'' along with such unhelpful sound-alike titles as
``Murder Once Being Done'' and ``Some Lie and Some Die'' as well as
``No More Dying Then.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the books feature Inspector Wexford, a country
chief inspector of shrewd insights, high standards and testy
disposition who has served the author at least 17 times. So overlap
was invited. As the denouements approached, specifics of the
particular felony to which the inspector was applying himself
tended to merge in my misty pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Was that gent who liked children a threat or was he a figure of
sympathy or was he just there to start a scene or two? Was the
unlikable character who allowed a child to drown on his watch just
forgetful or was it something more menacing? What was I to make of
that curious figure who is so fond of fur coats? What about those
mothers who seem to be a trifle careless with their children, and
how is one supposed to distinguish between adopted babies and
others and what difference does it make many years later?
</P>
<P>
   Such perplexities were of my own doing, of course. I was asking
for them. Yet trying to handle three books at once did illuminate
the elements that have served Ms. Rendell so well. She is attentive
not only to the character of Wexford but also to his subordinates,
like Detective Inspector Michael Burden, who have their own
troubles. The family lives of detectives, which can be slightly
dreary and keep getting in the way of their professional endeavors,
is a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wexford, that good man can be pretty pretentious in his
reach for high values, deep reflections and a touch of the poet.
Here, for example, are his reflections on the nature of criminal
responsibility: ``Who kills, Tate, the one who holds the knife, the
one who says `Stab!' or the one who sends the victim to the
appointed place? Which of the three Fates is responsible for our
destinies, she who spins the thread, she who cuts it or she who
merely holds the scissors?'' It can be a relief when he forgets
domestic arts and gets back to manly police work.
</P>
<P>
   The Rendell plots are filled with vanishing children and
psychologically disadvantaged adults. The conscientious reader may
resort to devising charts of significant relationships across the
years to abet memory. I wouldn't be surprised if Ms. Rendell made
use of such schematics in her plotting.
</P>
<P>
   There are intimations of violence, usually off the page, but
nothing gross. Ms. Rendell keeps her distance from the bloody
encounters with which much of the crime genre is obsessed. The play
between detective and perpetrator is mostly psychological. Her
subject, as reviewers have noted appreciatively down the decades,
is the human mind or heart, not the vulgar organs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of her colleagues who have illusions of being
humorists, she shuns jokiness. She is earnest about her work and
concerned for those dedicated and fallible creations, her sleuths.
And she gives good value, with plenty of plot tangles, even if you
read her books one at a time. With three at once, the herrings of
diverse shades kept straining my weakened comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd of suspects and the required complexities, I often
lost track of things. Was I following Ms. Rendell's plot or my own
dreamy variations? On one medicine-influenced afternoon I found
myself reaching the climax of a mystery, as Inspector Wexford
carefully wrapped matters up, only to realize that I couldn't
remember where I had been introduced to the murderer, if indeed I
had met him at all.
</P>
<P>
   I was hurting, and kept hurting for a week. My resort to ever
more powerful sedatives added a new, ferocious figure to Ms.
Rendell's already large cast. Drifting between fiction and reality
I found my prime suspect in my doctor, who was causing me such
misery.
</P>
<P>
   So there in my shadowy discernment and residual ache was that
good old mystery mastermind, the evil doctor. A culprit worthy of a
nightmare. Arrest her, Inspector Wexford! Get her off the streets
before she does even more damage!

MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL: A SMALL AND EMINENT PACKAGE OF MOZARTEAN
EXPERTISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alicia de Larrocha has long been called the ``first
lady of the Mostly Mozart Festival.'' Of course it is mostly the
public relations branch of the festival that keeps attaching this
title to the renowned Spanish pianist, and what was once, arguably,
an affectionate promotional gesture has become patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Ms. de Larrocha remains deeply popular with Mostly
Mozart audiences. Her appearance on Saturday night in Mozart's
Concerto No. 19 in F Major, with Pinchas Zukerman conducting, was
joyously received. She is a pianist of unquestionable integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Her fingerwork was limpid and supple, though an occasional
awkward passage indicated that at 76 she may be losing technical
resiliency. Her trademark pearly bright and singing tone was as
always a pleasure. And this diminutive woman (standing up she was
barely taller than the seated first violinist) offers a lesson in
how to produce full-bodied tone without force. Her playing was
consistently lyrical and tasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its fine qualities, Ms. de Larrocha's Mozart has
never been everyone's ideal. I prefer Mozart pianists who surprise
me more.
</P>
<P>
   This concerto is filled with impish humor, unexpected turns of
phrase and rhythmic gymnastics that other pianists capture more
vividly. The marchlike first movement was here taken at a rather
leisurely tempo. Perhaps Ms. de Larrocha was trying to uncover
deeper eloquence in the music. But it lacked buoyancy. The final
Rondo was quite satisfying, played with fleetness and greater
fancy. Zukerman and his players provided sympathetic and informed
support.
</P>
<P>
   In Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola, a de
facto double concerto, Zukerman, playing viola and also conducting,
was joined by Viviane Hagner, a 22-year-old German violinist making
her New York debut. In January the Munich-born artist performed
Prokofiev's Concerto No. 1 with the Berlin Philharmonic under
Claudio Abbado, a performance reportedly so successful that the
conductor invited her to repeat it at the prestigious Easter
Festival in Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of this first hearing Ms. Hagner seems an
accomplished and already mature musician. She has a resourceful
technique, and her tone is special: vibrant but slightly dark in
color, almost plaintive. The color of her sound lends a poignancy
to her playing, even in passages where the music is cheerful. And
in the work's lamenting slow movement the effect was deeply
affecting.
</P>
<P>
   Zukerman's dramatic, burly musical temperament is quite
different. He seemed to be admirably trying to match Ms. Hagner's
approach, especially in the slow movement, where he played with
beautifully subdued lyricism. Here and there in the work, however,
he could not control his penchant for layering lines with schmoozy
vibrato and dispatching passagework with bursts of
attention-grabbing energy.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra is
contracted each year; this summer's ensemble is strong. The program
began with Schubert's Third Symphony and at first the performance
was off-putting: Zukerman's conducting of the slow introduction to
the first movement was terribly ponderous. But in the allegro
section, and for the rest of the work, the performance had
confidence and brio.

`CITY OF LIGHT': ILLUMINATING DARK SECRETS IN VICTORIAN BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of its dimensions, Lauren Belfer's impressive debut,
``City of Light,'' is a stereopticon of a novel, sepia-tinged at
the edges yet bursting with color at its center. Its title refers
to Buffalo at the turn of the 20th century, when that city by Lake
Erie and Niagara Falls was a leading commercial center, a vital
maritime and railway hub, the most important inland port in
America, a gateway between East and West and, in the words of
Louisa Barrett, the novel's narrator, ``flush in an era of
extraordinary economic prosperity and civic optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   The city was proud to have sent two presidents to the White
House, Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland, and of being chosen
as the site of a world's fair to be called the Pan-American
Exposition, which, as Louisa relates, ``would celebrate the
commercial links between North and South America as well as
America's technological breakthroughs, particularly in the area of
electricity, which was being developed at nearby Niagara Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   About the promise of that electricity, Louisa's friend, Thomas
Sinclair, the director of the power station at Niagara, tells her:
``I have found light. Literally. It's become a kind of religion to
me, as sacrilegious as that may sound: creating electricity from
water, using alternating current to send the electricity wherever
it's needed.'' Tom concludes: ``Electrification is a fundamental
change in the nature of life itself. I know that sounds ridiculous,
but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are also those who are less optimistic about the
city's prospects. The workers who must inhabit industrial
shantytowns, the women whose roles are constricted by Buffalo
society, the black people who feel misrepresented by the
Pan-American Exposition, the so-called Preservationists, who worry
that the production of electricity may divert all the water from
glorious Niagara Falls: these people see Buffalo as a city of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   In the crosscurrents of these powerful forces, Louisa shares the
intimacies of her life with us. To all appearances a spinster and
bluestocking whose position as headmistress of the elite Macaulay
School has earned her the confidence of the city's leaders, Louisa
harbors a secret concerning Tom's young daughter, Grace. As Louisa
explains, 10 years earlier her best friend, Margaret Sinclair,
after years of childless marriage to Tom, ``had feigned pregnancy
when she learned that a child from a good family might be available
for adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisa had been the intermediary in that arrangement, under
circumstances threatening to respectability, of whose details she
believes she alone is aware. In gratitude the Sinclairs had made
her Grace's godmother. In the meantime Margaret had finally become
pregnant but had died in childbirth, and Louisa has grown ever
closer to Grace and Tom. Now, at the novel's opening, the murder of
one of the power plant's engineers not only serves to concentrate
the city's contending social forces, it also threatens Louisa's
relationship with her beloved goddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   This somewhat fustily Victorian plot is not the novel's
strength. The evidence of who committed the murder points so
strongly to Tom that the reader knows he cannot possibly have been
responsible. And for anyone even dimly aware of American history,
the knowledge that eventually President McKinley will show up at
the Pan-American Exposition and be assassinated hangs somewhat
heavily over the story's development.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the plot, which is serviceable enough, is not really what
counts in ``City of Light.'' What matters more is the vivid sense
of the time and place that Ms. Belfer has created: the heaviness of
the architecture with its classical pillars and coffered ceilings
and mahogany wainscoting; the layout of the city with its system of
parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, and the weight of a social
order in which commerce alone conferred power.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa glimpses the light, both literally and figuratively. Here
she is, entering Tom's newly electrified house. ``I stopped,
leaning against the banister to look. To gawk. I had never been in
a house lit by electricity. The change was _ miraculous. I'd heard
that in cities like New York and Chicago, the rich had been showing
off their wealth by installing steam generators and electrifying
their homes for the sake of novelty. But here in Buffalo, the old
families had no need for novelty, and the nouveaux riches emulated
the old. Compared to this, the other homes I visited were shadowy
and claustrophobic. Here the air itself seemed clear, vibrant and
somehow invigorating. All at once I knew why: Gaslight consumed the
oxygen in a room; electricity did not.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hypocrisy of a society where wealth matters more than
justice threatens to darken Louisa's life. Symbolic is the conduct
of Grover Cleveland, who, when he was a rising politician in the
city, Louisa reminds us, carried on an affair with a widowed shop
girl, Maria Halpin. As Louisa relates it, Cleveland acknowledged
the resulting illegitimate son, but ``refused to consider marriage
to Mrs. Halpin, who was known to have bestowed her favors on other
well-to-do men of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisa continues: ``To console herself, she'd begun drinking,
and Cleveland arranged to have his son taken from her by force and
adopted by an established local family. When Mrs. Halpin refused to
accept this separation, Cleveland had her committed to an insane
asylum, where she remained until she saw `reason.' '' The story
caused a ``national trauma'' when it came out during Cleveland's
1884 presidential campaign, Louisa concludes. But Cleveland was
elected for two terms nonetheless, and Buffalo society eventually
forgave him and welcomed his return.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we've progressed from those times remains highly
debatable. But in her powerfully atmospheric book Ms. Belfer makes
them seem real and very far away, and at the same time eerily
familiar and relevant to the present.

   NEW YORK _ At the turn of the 20th century, some of its
historical figures _ from Albert Einstein and Neil Armstrong to
Lucille Ball and Mohandas K. Gandhi _ will be taking a spin through
Grand Central Terminal beginning on Friday aboard a grand carousel
created by the School of Visual Arts. Redesigning and restoring a
neglected 1909 Victorian-style carousel, 36 feet in height and 42
feet in diameter, students and faculty replaced the horses with 29
moving three-dimensional images and objects like a Swanson's TV
dinner and an Andy Warhol Campbell's soup can. Accompanied by music
and cinematic time lines furnishing background on people and
events, ``The Turn of a Century: A Carousel Celebrating 100 Years
of Ups and Downs'' will revolve most of each day for about 5
minutes at 20-minute intervals until Sept. 9 in the terminal's
Vanderbilt Hall. Information: (212) 592-2010.

   NEW YORK _ With the opening Tuesday of a program of three short
plays, including ``Bound East for Cardiff,'' ``Abortion'' and ``The
Movie Man,'' the Playwrights Theater of New York starts the second
year of its Festival of Eugene O'Neill at the Provincetown
Playhouse in Greenwich Village where, in 1916, ``Cardiff'' became
the first O'Neill play to be produced. Traversing chronologically
the 8th through the 13th of O'Neill's 49 plays, this year's
segment, ``Birth of an Artist,'' offers three more productions
after the short plays close on Sunday. ``Servitude'' is to be
staged for the first time beginning on Aug. 10, ``Sniper'' will
open on Aug. 24, and the first staging of ``The Personal Equation''
starts on Aug. 28. Information: (212) 998-5801.

   Once upon a time the works of an up-and-coming playwright named
William Shakespeare were presented at the Globe Theater in London.
Little wonder, then, that its reincarnation there, Shakespeare's
Globe, is home not only to Shakespeare's works but to new dramas as
well. Beginning on Friday, Shakespeare's Globe will present its
first commission, ``Augustine's Oak.'' Written in verse by Peter
Oswald and based on Bede's ``Ecclesiastical History of the English
Nation,'' it tells of a mission to the pagan English by St.
Augustine in the year 597 A.D. ``Augustine's Oak'' is to run in
repertory through Sept. 24. Information: 011-44-171-902-1406.

<P>
   For more than a week, the Microsoft Corp. and America Online
Inc. have engaged in a public spat over open access to the
instant-message systems that have become increasingly popular on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their rhetoric, though, neither company has much of a
track record for making it easy for competitors to gain access to
the markets that America Online and Microsoft hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, stands accused by the Justice Department
of unfairly using its control of the Windows operating system to
stifle the market for Internet browser software from Netscape
Communications _ a company that America Online now owns. And much
of the appeal of America Online's service lies in its offering both
content and features, like instant messages, that are not available
to other Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The current showdown between the two companies concerns America
Online's refusal to let Microsoft, among others, link its online
users to America Online's instant-messaging system _ a form of
electronic mail that lets two people conduct a real-time
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Jealously as each may guard its advantages, both Microsoft and
America Online are quick to call for openness in any market in
which they are behind.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, America Online has initiated a vast lobbying campaign
calling for open access to offer Internet service through cable
television systems, largely because it has been shut out by the
AT&AMP;T Corp. and other operators.
</P>
<P>
   And it is no accident that Microsoft is taking the lead in
talking about open standards in instant messaging, a service in
which America Online has 80 million users. Until very recently
Microsoft had no instant-messaging subscribers on its MSN online
service.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike E-mail, which can be exchanged by all Internet users
regardless of the service they subscribe to, instant-message
systems so far have been proprietary. Thus, users of Microsoft's
new instant message system can communicate only with each other and
not with the far larger number of instant messengers on America
Online's networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has found a backdoor to America Online's main
instant-message system, setting off a heated debate that embroiled
much of the Internet industry last week.
</P>
<P>
   And during the last two weeks, the two companies have played at
least six rounds of hide and seek, as America Online blocked access
to Microsoft, and Microsoft quickly found another way in.
</P>
<P>
   By last Friday, many observers were fed up with both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unseemly for Microsoft to hijack their way into AOL's
system,'' said Eric Schmitt, an analyst with Forrester Research.
``But America Online should open the thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   The history, culture and underlying technology of the Internet
has pressed most proprietary systems to give way to open technical
standards. And America Online acknowledges that it cannot fight
these forces forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL realizes in the end this will all be open,'' said Paul W.
Noglows, an analyst with the investment firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
``They just want to control how it becomes open.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online's reluctance to embrace an open standard is
certainly understandable, considering how much its instant-message
system _ and the related ``buddy list'' technology that lets
friends quickly determine if each other is online _ have
contributed to its rise as the most powerful company on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important reason you pay your $21.95 for AOL each
month,'' Noglows said.
</P>
<P>
   But even three years ago, America Online acknowledged that it
could not keep instant messages limited to its proprietary online
service. So the company introduced AOL Instant Messenger, a program
that anyone with an Internet account could download and use free to
send instant messages to both America Online members and any other
AOL Instant Messenger user.
</P>
<P>
   Instant Messenger enables America Online subscribers who use
instant messages at home to also use them at work, even if their
office computers do not use the America Online subscription
service. But the product also allows people to drop the American
Online subscription service entirely and still keep chatting with
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dropouts, America Online can theoretically still
make money from Instant Messenger users, because the software has
space for advertisements. But since people rarely click on those
ads, the revenue is slim. Still, the company believes it will
ultimately find ways to make money from a program that millions of
people use for hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was so enamored with instant messages that last
year it bought Mirabilis, an Israeli company that makes ICQ, the
second most popular instant-message system. ICQ is the classic Web
business: It has grown purely by word of mouth to an audience of
some 38 million users, but it still has no visible source of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   So far, America Online has not linked the two instant-message
systems, largely because the hip, college-age ICQ audience does not
care to associate with American Online users, who are mainly
high-school students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, America Online has been wary of doing anything that
would open up instant-message systems too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now that other companies _ not only Microsoft, but even more
notably, Yahoo Inc. _ have created their own instant-message
systems, there has been increasing demand to link all the systems
together. In fact, an industry task force has been formed to
develop a standard for such interconnection.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has long said that it would support such a
standard, once it was developed. But it has done nothing to hasten
the development of a consensus _ though, in hindsight, the company
planted the seeds for its current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   First, America Online did nothing to prevent someone from
mimicking its software, as Microsoft has. Microsoft's own message
program, by contrast, encrypts messages, so that no one can create
backdoor links to its system, as it has done to America Online's.
</P>
<P>
   America Online also published on its own Web page a method that
people could use to write their own programs to exchange instant
messages with users of the Instant Messenger system and to see
which of their America Online buddies were online.
</P>
<P>
   The company now says that this recipe was meant only for
computer hobbyists and users of the Unix operating system. But on
the Web page, America Online did not note any restrictions on the
use of the system. And so several companies, including Yahoo and
Prodigy, used the information to create instant-message programs
that linked to America Online's system.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The systems from Yahoo, Prodigy Communications and Microsoft
came to light the week before last, and America Online blocked them
all _ attracting the glare of publicity. Suddenly, the company's
go-slow strategy no longer seemed feasible.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's well-oiled crisis-handling machine, led by the
public-relations firm Robinson, Lerer &AMP; Montgomery, declared that
the company would put the development of an instant-messaging
standard ``on a fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   The company promised to work actively with the existing industry
task force, and it convened its own parallel committee of top
industry executives to help shape an instant-messaging standard.
</P>
<P>
   These moves, though, did little to appease Microsoft and the
other companies. American Online's parallel committee, for example,
represents companies like Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer and Real
Networks, that are more notable for their longstanding grudges
against Microsoft than their involvement in instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   A group of eight other companies, led by Microsoft and Prodigy,
wrote a letter to America Online's chairman, Stephen M. Case,
arguing that the best thing he could do to further instant-message
standards was to stop blocking their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for a real gesture from AOL,'' said Brad
Chase, one of the executives in charge of Microsoft's consumer and
Internet division. ``They should stop blocking users now.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Prodigy say they will convene their own group to
forge a standard at a meeting in New York in September.
</P>
<P>
   With all the attention, an industrywide instant-messaging format
is likely to be developed this year. And unless there is
significant disagreement about how the standard operates, all the
major players _ including America Online _ have now committed to
linking their systems to it.
</P>
<P>
   That should mean that, ultimately, that people will choose their
instant message systems as they do E-mail programs: on the basis of
marketing, distribution and product features.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is what will happen until a standard is adopted. Last
week, America Online made overtures to several companies, including
Prodigy, to begin discussions about linking to their message
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the bad blood, such deals may be hard to negotiate
now, especially with Microsoft still intent on cracking America
Online's system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, however extreme Microsoft's approach _ and however unlikely
an advocate of open systems the company may be _ the walls that
divided instant-message users are tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's tactic worked,'' Schmitt said. ``It was the
fastest way to get AOL to move toward standards.''

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS ABUSE LED TO PRESIDENT'S INFIDELITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton says in a new magazine
interview that she thought her husband had overcome his womanizing
10 years ago, but that deep scars from an abused childhood had led
to his infidelity and that he had not sufficiently examined those
problems to conquer them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was resolved 10 years ago,'' Mrs. Clinton is
quoted as saying in an article titled ``The Intimate Hillary,'' to
be published this week in the premiere issue of Talk magazine. ``I
thought he had conquered it; I thought he understood it, but he
didn't go deep enough or work hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said that President Clinton ``has been working on
himself very hard in the last year,'' adding, ``He has become more
aware of his past and what was causing this behavior.'' She
attributed his infidelity to ``abuse'' caused by conflict between
his mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she had to remain ``vigilant'' about her
husband's behavior but that his infidelity did not negate the rest
of his life and she would not abandon him. Asked what would happen
to their marriage when she is off campaigning for the Senate in New
York, Mrs. Clinton said, ``He's responsible for his own behavior
whether I'm there or 100 miles away.''

HEWLETT-PACKARD SEES ITS FUTURE AS AN E-COMMERCE REVOLUTIONARY
</HEADLINE>
  (With HEWLETTPACKARD-AGILENT) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In the computer industry, power comes not
from the barrel of a gun but from the interface of a protocol.
</P>
<P>
   And no one may be more aware of that right now than Rajiv Gupta,
a 36-year-old Hewlett-Packard computer designer, who for years has
seen how the Microsoft Corp.'s control of a series of software
protocols, or technical formats, has made Microsoft the dominant
force in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta is now leading an ambitious Hewlett-Packard effort to
establish a comparable edge in Internet-commerce technology with a
set of programming protocols called E-Speak. The E-Speak initiative
is perhaps the most crucial part of a sweeping makeover by Hewlett,
which is intent on transforming itself from a stodgy maker of
computers, printers and test equipment into a 21st-century Internet
services company.
</P>
<P>
   So intent is the company that it is jettisoning its 60-year-old
test-and-measurement equipment business and has just gone outside
the computer industry to hire a new chief executive, Carleton S.
Fiorina, from the telecommunications equipment company Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   E-Speak, which Hewlett introduced last month, is a
network-oriented programming language designed to let companies and
individuals quickly put new Internet business ideas into action by
easily translating them into software code. It is a measure of the
company's commitment that it has put Gupta, one of its top hardware
designers, in charge of this effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open a whole new service economy,'' he said. ``You
will have a business ecosystem that is created.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if this effort sounds conceptually similar to the
Java software initiative that Hewlett's chief rival, Sun
Microsystems, began mounting several years ago, Gupta does not
necessarily rebut the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing against the idea of standing on the shoulders
of giants,'' he said, before adding whimsically, ``or on the toes
of dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, E-Speak is the technical foundation for Hewlett's new
E-Services business as it tries to catch up not only with Sun but
with IBM; both rivals have used Java effectively to develop
E-commerce offerings for corporate customers. And E-Speak is
compatible with Java, as well as Jini, Sun's newest attempt to
develop a networking system to automatically link together all
kinds of computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Hewlett business vision is a radical one, even by
Internet standards: The company contends that E-Speak and
E-Services will help usher in an information service economy that
goes a step beyond that made possible by the first generation of
Web protocols, known as HTML and HTTP. Those first protocols made
possible electronic directories like Yahoo and E-commerce Web sites
like Amazon.com. But HTML and HTTP alone are unable to support
electronic bazaars that can allow for transactions between
thousands of independent buyers and sellers, who may have had no
prior contact and want to do business on a single, one-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the example of a person who speaks French and English
and wants to set up a home business translating business letters in
French into idiomatic English.
</P>
<P>
   In the E-Services model, all that our translator would need is a
personal computer connected to the Internet. The E-Speak software
would act as a broker for the translation service, matching buyer
and seller in cyberspace and handling all of the underlying
financial details of the service.
</P>
<P>
   If the E-Services model works, the boundaries of such a new
electronic economy are extensive. Gupta concedes that there are
already hundreds of different E-commerce business models based on
the concept of acting as a broker between buyer and seller. But he
insists that Hewlett's E-Services approach, based on E-Speak
technology, will win because it offers a complete computing system
intended to easily link different components of a business venture,
rather than forcing the businesses to worry about the underlying
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the Internet messiahs want to create commerce
brokerages,'' he said. ``Our vision starts where other visions
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is whether the market will see what
Gupta sees. This is not the first time Hewlett has tried to create
a new computing paradigm. In 1990, the company rolled out NewWave,
a system that worked on top of Microsoft's Windows and was intended
to automate many of the basic tasks of using a personal computer.
NewWave, though, was largely ignored in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   And this time around, Hewlett is facing a variety of competing
technologies, each with a head start on E-Speak and each meant to
bring similar capabilities to the Internet. One of them is
Microsoft's BizTalk version of the XML extension of the HTML Web
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   XML is an Internet protocol that is intended to make it easier
to interconnect different kinds of business computing systems. Sun
Microsystems has already incorporated XML into its Jini technology,
which is still feeling its way in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts, like E-Speak, are meant to make it easier to
incorporate new business models into computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can E-Speak whip Jini?'' said Paul Saffo, a computer industry
consultant at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.
``It will be interesting to watch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Gupta, at least, has no doubts about the world-altering
potential of his system, which began as a so-called skunkworks, or
secret, research project by three engineers at Hewlett-Packard
Laboratories in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in a family of small-scale industrialists in
Northern India, Gupta, arrived in the United States in 1984 to
attend graduate school at the California Institute of Technology,
in Pasadena. He recalls being more surprised by the similarities
between Indian and American cultures than by the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something of an anticlimax,'' he said. Though it was
his first time outside of India, Gupta found it easy to adapt to
life in California. ``Unlike the books and movies, people were
quite normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta, who is married and has two children, lives in Los Altos
Hills, near Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, even by Silicon Valley standards Gupta will have
proven to be something of a wunderkind. He came to Hewlett-Packard
at age 28 in 1991, fresh out of graduate school as an expert in
processor design and software compilers _ software that translates
the programmer's instructions into machine code. Until three years
ago, his principal role was as the technical lead designer for the
joint Intel-Hewlett IA-64 microprocessor project _ the chip that
became the Merced, on which the Intel Corp. is banking its
post-Pentium future. The E-Speak software project was still only a
sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   But when the IA-64 chip design left the lab to be turned over to
a development team, Gupta shifted his full attention to pursuit of
his E-Speak vision.
</P>
<P>
   And now, even if the IA-64 chip design ultimately becomes
Intel's technical standard-bearer, Gupta contends that E-Speak has
the potential to make a bigger impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the rapidly moving Internet economy Hewlett-Packard is
staking its future on a huge gamble _ a vision of the business
world transformed by Internet software, which is the same strategy
being pursued by some formidable competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Gupta contends that when E-Speak technology finds its way
into the world it will have an impact that extends beyond business,
helping recreate the genuine human communities that are so far
largely missing on the Internet. Beyond today's chat rooms and
E-mail lists, he looks to build the Internet into every aspect of
life through a software system that will interconnect computers,
cell phones, pagers and whatever other digital gadgets may come
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very passionate about this,'' he said. ``This will
fundamentally change our lives.''

HP'S EQUIPMENT SPINOFF RESTARTING LIFE AS AGILENT
</HEADLINE>
  (With HEWLETTPACKARD-SOFTWARE) 
(nk) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Edward W. Barnholt, Nov. 1 will be a day of reckoning. That
is when the test and measurement equipment business of
Hewlett-Packard is to begin operating as Agilent Technologies Inc.
with Barnholt at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett announced in March that it would spin off the
test-equipment business to shore up the company's core computer and
printer business. Since then, Barnholt, a former engineer with more
than three decades of experience at Hewlett, has had the delicate
task of carving a new company out of one that is nearly 60 years
old and is among Silicon Valley's most revered institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hewlett announced the name and specific plans for
Agilent, which will have annual sales of about $8 billion and plans
a public stock offering next year. Agilent will also take 43,000
employees, many of whom, like Barnholt, have been been with Hewlett
for most of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Barnholt, 56, who is known as Ned, said last week he felt sad
leaving Hewlett-Packard. ``There was a sense of loss, of sadness to
no longer be with the company where I'd spent 32 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever initial disappointment they may have felt,
employees seem to be getting on with the business of making the new
arrangement work, and the company has not seen any rise in
departures.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent plans to make its headquarters on the same Palo Alto,
Calif., site where the original Hewlett-Packard building stood in
the 1940s. It builds test equipment for the electronics industry,
including the testing of semiconductors and wireless networks.
Agilent's other products include medical diagnostic devices like
ultrasound machines. There is also a semiconductor products group
that supplies chip sets for hand-held devices and communications
systems, as well as a chemical analysis group that builds systems
for analyzing biological substances.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff will be made easier by the fact that the computer
company and the Agilent businesses have long behaved as two
distinct operations, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative
Strategies International, a Santa Clara, Calif., market research
company.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett executives decided to leave the Hewlett-Packard name
with the computer and printer operation because that business sells
to both corporate and consumer customers. The test and measurement
operation, on the other hand, sells strictly to a business and
professional clientele, through a direct sales force. ``Our
customers know us well,'' Barnholt said of the test and measurement
group. ``So we made a business decision, not a sentimental one.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnholt, who has managed the test and measurement operations
since 1990 and will be its chief executive, said the advantages of
the spinoff were already readily apparent. Within Hewlett, the test
and measurement group accounted for only 16 percent of overall
revenues of $47.1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what we did, we hardly made the needle wiggle,''
Barnholt said. As an independent company, he said, ``we're coming
out from the shadows.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About once a week, Dr. Tom Coburn, a family
practitioner in Muskogee, Okla., gets into a fight with an
insurance company over some service he wants to provide to a
patient. Nothing unusual there; a study released last week showed
the vast majority of doctors struggling with managed-care companies
over what they would cover and what they would deny.
</P>
<P>
   But Coburn gets to engage in what may be every doctor's fantasy.
``When they deny me, I call 'em up and say, `Do you know who you
just denied? We're going to fix this for this patient. And you're
exactly the reason you're going to get a law.''' Very quickly, he
said, the hapless bureaucrat realizes that Dr. Tom Coburn is also
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader in the fight for new patient
protection in the era of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, who still practices medicine on weekends, is one of a
handful of Republican doctors in the House who are bucking their
leadership and much of their party to pursue a broader, tougher
patients' rights bill than the one recently passed by the Senate.
It is a stand that has rattled their leaders, but one very much in
keeping with Coburn's political career path of scorched-earth
independence.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a man who cheerfully describes himself as
``a pain in the butt'' in this year's appropriations process, who
proudly declares that he is ``a purist to a fault,'' who readily
admits he has become so annoying to some colleagues that his
amendments are sometimes doomed from the start. He could be exhibit
A on the liberating effect of term limits; he does not have to
worry about the long-term effects of breaking ranks and irritating
committee chairmen because he will not be here over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch conservative and an emblematic member of the
Republican class of 1994, he vowed to serve no more than six years
and will retire next year, a citizen legislator to the end. ``I'm
one of those who really believe in term limits,'' he said late last
week, happily energized by all his fights. ``I don't know that six
years is the right number; I don't know the exact number. I just
know that there comes a time when Washington influence displaces
home influence up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has, indeed, kept Washington at arm's length. He said he
has spent only two weekends here in the last five years, both of
them because votes were scheduled. Carolyn Coburn, his wife of 31
years, ``brings me back to earth every Friday night when I get
home,'' he said, ``makes me realize `you're a husband and a father
and a grandfather first, and you're a congressman three days a week
when you're not here.''' He also stays grounded in medicine,
delivering 97 babies last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes me a much better congressman,'' he said,
scoffing at legislators with little experience outside politics. In
fact, he said, he has advised some young Republicans thinking about
running for Congress: ``You need to get more life.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's life was pretty full by the time he decided to run for
Congress in July 1994, at 46, because he was ``disgusted with
Congress.'' He became a doctor at 35, after working in his family's
large optical business, and winning a serious bout with cancer in
his 20s. He has three grown daughters and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   With an array of anecdotes at his command, Coburn makes the case
for a variety of procedural safeguards in managed care, like an
external appeal process ``with some teeth in it'' for cases where
coverage is denied. He is scathing about the managed care and
insurance industry's argument that more regulation will
automatically mean higher premiums and ultimately fewer people
covered. ``They've just been atrocious in their claims that if we
do anything we're going to hurt people,'' he said. ``That's like
saying child labor laws hurt employment in this country. There is a
bigger good.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, said it was not clear whether the Republican doctors in the
House were representing the interests of the patients or the
practicioners. ``The practitioners have a very strong self-interest
in this legislation, as do the health plans and others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's other great crusade this year has been the
appropriations process, challenging one spending bill after another
as excessive and outside the party's budget goals. ``We know what
we want to do, what we stand for, but the candy jar in front of us
is just so tempting,'' he said. ``What happens is you get addicted.
It's easy to say, `Oh, I can do it for my district because it's
just a little amount.'''
</P>
<P>
   His stance has, at times, infuriated Democrats and Republicans
alike, and he acknowledges he has ``taken a lot of abuse.'' But
Coburn finds solace in the to-the-barricades fiscal conservatism
that fired the class of 1994. ``I'm doing it for the next
generation, for our kids,'' he said. ``What we're doing right now
is sacrificing their standard of living because we don't have the
courage to make the tough decisions that we were sent up here to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn is flummoxed when a reporter asks what he would like his
legacy to be when he leaves the House. ``I don't really desire a
legacy here,'' he said. ``That's the genius of this place _ when
you come and you leave, nobody remembers you were here.'' Maybe, he
said, he would like his legacy to be a little restoration of public
trust.
</P>
<P>
   He won't miss campaigning, he said. ``The thing I hated most
about this job was campaigning and raising money,'' Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   A politician who hates campaigning?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I don't like it,'' he said. ``You know? I'm walking down
a parade saying, `Hey, I'm Tom Coburn.' It's counterintuitive. What

ADVERTISER-SUBSIDIZED SNAIL MAIL  
 HONK LOUD FOR MOTORING SAFETY  
 PATENT TALK ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    E-mail has become an indispensable mode of communication for
many people these days. Not only is it speedy, but it is free for
frugal souls in exchange for putting up with advertising taglines
at the bottom of their e-mails.
 &HT;    But what if someone were to take the same concept _
advertiser-subsidized correspondence _ and instead apply it to
snail mail?
 &HT;    That is what Joshua Reiter, a management consultant in
Baltimore, has done. He recently patented a way to reduce the costs
of mailing an old-fashioned stamp-and-envelope letter _ by printing
advertisements directly aimed at a specific household on the
outside of mail delivered to that household.
 &HT;    ``Originally, I thought about doing this on the Internet,''
Reiter said, ``but too many people were doing something similar and
so I thought there was no way I would get a patent on it.''
 &HT;    ``Then I thought, well, regular mail is still going to be viable
for many years,'' he said. ``People are still going to be sending
regular letters. The U.S. Postal Services handles 190 billion
packages and letters a year, and that number seems to still be
going up. I couldn't believe no one had thought of putting
advertising on the outside of envelopes before.''
 &HT;    Reiter's patent covers a computer system that tracks the
individual tastes and interests of vast numbers of households and
then prints advertisements tailored to specific households for
mailers who want to save on postage.
 &HT;    So, for example, a credit card company wanting to shave off a
few cents for each monthly statement it sends out would allow
advertising for other companies to be printed on its envelopes.
 &HT;    A family with small children might see an ad for a toy company
on the outside of their monthly bill. Meanwhile, a globe-trotting
elderly couple might receive an offer for a discounted cruise-ship
excursion. And an athletic middle-aged bachelor might be exhorted
to buy a new pair of running shoes.
 &HT;    ``Since the message is on the outside of the letter or parcel,
it must be seen by the recipients,'' Reiter said. ``They can't
discard it, as they might with an advertisement inside an
envelope.''
 &HT;    Reiter is quick to downplay any Big Brother overtones to his
invention. ``Advertisers have all this information already,'' he
said. ``We know a lot about who lives in a particular household.
Today with bar-coding information, you can identify who the
household is.''
 &HT;    He likened his system to groceries where cashiers print coupons
based on what a shopper has just bought. ``If you buy peanut
butter, they give you a coupon for jelly,'' he said.
 &HT;    The patent also covers the printing of coupons on
advertising-subsidized mail and even musical advertising that
recipients hear when they open an envelope.
 &HT;    Reiter acknowledges that his system is more likely to benefit
mass mailers rather than an individual mailing a birthday card to a
cousin.
 &HT;    ``If you only send out one letter you're probably not interested
in saving a nickel,'' he said.
 &HT;    Reiter, who received patent 5,819,241, said he is attempting to
license his invention. ``This would work for the Postal Service or
Federal Express or Airborne Express,'' he said, noting that he
thought his concept would also work well with new types of
electronic postage.

   A Car Horn Linked to the Gas Pedal
</P>
<P>
   Chester Cotter says the inspiration for a new car horn came to
him sometime after a harrowing drive on the interstate. ``I nearly
got smacked by an 18-wheeler who was trying to move into my lane,''
he said. ``The driver had earphones on and was too busy boogeying
to hear me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotter and his friend, Henry Darlington, have recently patented
a car horn whose volume increases proportionally to the speed of
the car. Their electronic relay system fits into a two-inch cube
that is attached to the speedometer. ``Ideally it would be factory
installed,'' Cotter said. The device has three settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very polite horn when you're driving downtown,'' he
said. ``When you're driving from 30 to 50 miles an hour it sounds
like a normal horn. But when you really get going on the highway it
sounds like the Queen Mary pulling out of port.''
</P>
<P>
   The physics of horn projection necessitate the different
volumes, according to Cotter. ``If you're out on the highway, the
wind just blows the sound away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter and Darlington hope to license patent 5,883,571.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stanley Kubrick &LR; 's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' tells the story of a
young doctor, William Harford, and his wife, their marital
troubles, sexual fantasies and escapades. In his online journal
 &LR; healthcentral.com &LR; , East Bay physician  &UR; Oscar London  &LR; compares the
capers of the fictional doc, as played by  &UR; Tom Cruise &LR; , with the
capers of a real-life doctor:
</P>
<P>
   Harford's practice ``consists of seeing four patients a day in a
spacious office with eight assistants, knee-deep rugs and black
marble counter tops. ... By subtle contrast, I'm a Berkeley
internist with a practice that requires me to see 25 HMO patients a
day in a small, 50-year-old office that was recently given six
months to live by a specialist in dry rot.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the movie Harford makes a house call. After he
finds the patient dead, the patient's daughter ``throws herself at
him, kisses him with maximum passion and professes her love for
him. ... Many years ago, I made a house call. I don't remember
exactly when or precisely why. But I do recall that the elderly
patient's son, a haggard, unshaven man in his 50s, threw a copy of

HIS TEPID HOT DOGS HAVE LED TO A HOWLING FOOD BUSINESS SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first met Rich Komen over a hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   Make that a few thousand dogs.
</P>
<P>
   With mustard.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he was serving as the concessionaire in the
University of Washington's Husky Stadium when I wrote a newspaper
column complaining that fans were being served lukewarm ``red
hots.'' A tepid hot dog is the culinary equivalent of a blocked
punt, as Komen admitted during our conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Komen was new to the business. On Friday nights before home
games he would buy a case of beer and invite neighbors over to help
bag peanuts. Hot dogs were another problem, due to the antiquated
facilities and restrictions then in place at Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a quick learner. Komen solved the problems at the UW
and within a few years controlled virtually all the sports
concessions in Seattle. In a few more years he was running food
services at the Kansas City and Oakland sports complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he sold out to a conglomerate and entered the
restaurant business, establishing the highly successful
Clinkerdaggers chain of public houses in the Northwest. Komen
studied and introduced new concepts, then established his own
Restaurants Unlimited company.
</P>
<P>
   And it all started with a lukewarm ``red hot.''
</P>
<P>
   So there is hope for the pup pushers at Safeco Field. First time
around they became the butt of a good news-bad news joke.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that people were walking away hungry from the
long concession lines.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the good news, in the view of food safety
inspectors, who credited Volume Services and their vendors with
more errors than the 1962 New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   If Safeco's lines are still too long during and you find
yourself shut out at the hot links concession, wait until you get
home and pig out on some:
</P>
<P>
   Hoke's Pokes
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound hot Italian sausages, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 cup diced green pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup diced celery
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pita bread rounds
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded Swiss or Jack cheese
</P>
<P>
   Fry the sausages slices in a skillet until browned. Add the
onion, garlic, mushrooms, green pepper and celery. Keep cooking
until the veggies are softer than the sweet spot in Alex
Rodriguez's mitt. Season with pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the pitas in half, open up the pockets and stuff with the
sausage filling. Sprinkle with cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Place sandwiches upright in baking pan and shove into a
400-degree oven for 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts.
</P>
<P>
   The kielbasa dogs got a good rating from those Seattle Mariner
fans who could score a few. The others can feast later on:
</P>
<P>
   A 14th Inning Feast
</P>
<P>
   1 pound kielbasa sausage
</P>
<P>
   4 medium new potatoes, quartered
</P>
<P>
   4 large carrots, cut in 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 small head cabbage, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   Chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Dump the sausages into a large saucepan. Add the potatoes,
carrots, cabbage and water. Cook, covered, 30 minutes, or until
veggies are fork tender.
</P>
<P>
   Drain, reserving the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the sausage and veggies on a platter and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Combine in a saucepan three-fourths cup of the pot liquid with
the flour, brown sugar, vinegar, dry mustard, salt and pepper.
Stir-cook until thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the sauce over the kielbasa and veggies and serve in bowls
to four sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   As for sports concessions, just look up the word in your
dictionary:
</P>
<P>
   Concession. 3. A privilege granted by a government, company etc.
</P>
<P>
   See, it's not a right, it's a privilege. Shut up and eat your
hot dog ... if you can find one.

   ``Until the 1990s, simple design was reserved for those with
enough old-money insouciance or cultivated modesty to downplay the
appearance of success. ... In this era, of democratized and
virtually institutionalized good taste, where a Camry looks an
awful loot like a BMW, and J. Crew's pleated gray wool skirt might
be mistaken for Marc Jacobs' less itchy version, personal flair is
harder and harder to achieve. The bag, worn as a complement to the
monochromatic urban uniform, has become one of our few means of
individual fashion expression.''

GERMAN LABORERS CHALLENGE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' RIGHT TURN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ ``Miners or male models?'' asked the headline over
photographs of an elegant, smiling Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
a weary, coal-smeared worker. ``The party must decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The summary of the battle for the soul of Germany's Social
Democratic Party in the newspaper Die Welt was scarcely subtle, but
it caught the mood of the increasingly harsh struggle that has
erupted between Schroeder, in his tailored Brioni suits, and
workers who feel their party has abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, it seems, will determine not only the character of
the Social Democratic party, with its roots in the struggle of
factory workers for social justice, but also the future course of
Schroeder's coalition government with the environmentalist Greens.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, after some hesitation, has decided to take the Social
Democrats sharply toward the right, but over the past few days it
has become clear that he has not brought all the party with him.
Rather, resistance is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the dissent is Reinhard Klimmt, the state oremier of the
small Saar region bordering France, who last week described
Schroeder's latest ideas _ including abandoning the proposal for a
tax on large fortunes _ as nothing less than a betrayal of Social
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is missing?'' Klimmt asked in an open letter that
denounced the policies of both Schroeder and Tony Blair, the
British prime minister. ``That tangible concern for creating and
maintaining fairness in society _ the soul of Social Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Schroeder and Blair published a joint paper in
which they attempted to map out the essence of the Third Way _ a
Clintonian updating of Social Democratic values that attempts to
place political movements formerly regarded as of the left firmly
in the center of the political spectrum of modern societies.
</P>
<P>
   In their paper, Schroeder and Blair said: ``The promotion of
social justice was sometimes confused with the imposition of
equality of outcome. The result was a neglect of the importance of
rewarding effort and responsibility.'' They added, ``The weaknesses
of markets have been overstated and their strengths
underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders, clearly attacking the past values of the left,
went on to suggest that high state spending was responsible for
unemployment _ a highly contentious assertion in Germany.
``Achieving social justice,'' they wrote, ``became identified with
ever higher levels of public spending regardless of what they
achieved or the impact on taxes required to fund it on
competitiveness and employment.''
</P>
<P>
   While such ideas are scarcely regarded as heresy by the left in
Britain, where the ground for Blair was prepared by the long rule
of Margaret Thatcher, they have had a far more explosive impact in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   When Schroeder followed up on the ideas last month by announcing
austerity measures cutting about $16 billion in state spending and
freezing pensions, the rift in his party burst into the open.
</P>
<P>
   Klimmt, who took over in Saar from the former finance minister,
Oskar Lafontaine, and has now taken on Lafontaine's mantle as the
leader of the left within the Social Democratic Party, faces a
state election on Sept. 5. If he wins, his movement will clearly
gain strength.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several union leaders have expressed support for
Klimmt's position, saying that Schroeder's insistence on
``modernization'' as the solution for Germany's unemployment rate
of over 10 percent cannot come at the expense of social justice.
The chancellor's abandonment of a promised wealth tax has become
the symbol of what is called his betrayal of the party base.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern part of the country, where the successor party to
the former Communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, is
challenging the Social Democrats from the left with increasing
success, Schroeder's new course has also aroused mistrust and
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard Hoppner, the Social Democratic premier of
Saxony-Anhalt, expressed support for Klimmt, noting: ``East Germans
see it as the government's obligation to think in terms of social
measures. No discussion of modernization should allow this fact to
be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   But strongly supported by business leaders, and determined to
demonstrate that only greater flexibility and a smaller state can
bring down unemployment, Schroeder shows no sign of changing
course. In an interview published Sunday in the weekly Der Spiegel,
he said the benefits of his action would be clear by 2002, when the
next federal elections are to be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some on the left of the party are going to have to understand
that this form of attack is unhelpful,'' Schroeder said. ``It's
dangerous to constantly question in public the direction of our
program because voters will be alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is already clear is that the current debate is not
merely about short-term political calculations. For many in
Germany, it is about the essence of a party whose values helped lay
the basis for the ``social-market'' model that served the country
so well for many years.

WORKPLACE STARS AREN'T BORN _ THEY'RE MADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not hard to spot the stars at work.
</P>
<P>
   They're the people who get the coveted assignments, the biggest
bonuses, the fastest promotions. They're the 10 percent to 15
percent of workers known as the ``10-for-oners'' _ people who
outshine and outproduce their peers by a factor of 10 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying what makes those people star performers, however, is
trickier, and it turns out it's not what most people think.
</P>
<P>
   Stars are not generally smarter than average performers. They
don't necessarily work harder, and they're not better at
schmoozing. They aren't more creative, bigger risk-takers or born
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to believe that star performers are somehow better
in some fundamental sense than average performers, said Robert
Kelley, author of ``How to be a Star at Work'' (Times Business,
1999, $12). And by extension, they believe that average workers
lack the necessary qualities to turn themselves into exceptional
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But stars are made, not born,'' Kelley said. The difference
between an average performer and an exceptional one doesn't boil
down to talent as much as how people use their talents.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, a professor in the graduate school of Industrial
Administration at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, first
got interested in what makes some people shine at work when Bell
Labs asked him for help improving the productivity of its workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had all these really smart, really talented people,''
Kelley said. And they were facing deregulation of their industry.
They knew they were going to have to get exceptional work out of
their workers to compete, but they didn't know how.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley started by gathering data about what people believed made
a star performer. He came up with 45 qualities believed to be
associated with stars, including higher IQs, improved logic and
reasoning skills, high self-confidence, ambition and enhanced
interpersonal skills. Then he subjected 200 star and average
performers to a two-day battery of tests to figure out how they
rated in the 45 traits. He eagerly analyzed the data, expecting a
profile of star qualities to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Zippo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found none of those things separated the stars from average
performers,'' he said. ``In terms of unlocking productivity
secrets, our data showed no appreciable cognitive,
personal-psychological, social or environmental differences between
stars and average performers.''
</P>
<P>
   So what makes the difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``Average performers are not lacking in talent, motivation,
effort,'' he said. But they tend to use trial-and-error to try to
get ahead, and they often apply their talents in self-limiting
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star performers do their work very differently than the solid,
average-performing pack,'' he said. They apply a different set of
strategies to their work.
</P>
<P>
   Star-making strategies include taking initiative, networking,
gaining multiple perspectives on problems, being both good
followers and good leaders, knowing how to work on teams and being
savvy about organizational politics.
</P>
<P>
   Star-building initiative, for example, means taking charge of
tasks that fall in the ``white space'' between people's
responsibilities _ those opportunities that are critical to the
organization but aren't any one person's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Average performers take initiative, too, but they tend to
volunteer for non-critical extras, such as planning corporate
events or recruiting for the company blood drive.
</P>
<P>
   Star performers approach networking differently as well.
</P>
<P>
   An average performer thinks of networking as building a
communications grapevine to keep abreast of office gossip. Star
producers develop a network of ``knowledge experts'' who can help
them troubleshoot problems or do their jobs better.
</P>
<P>
   Another star strategy involves building multiple viewpoints.
Average performers tend to have tunnel vision, concentrating on
developing their own points of view and trying to get them across
to others in the organization. Star producers see projects or
problems through the eyes of others, including customers,
competitors, co-workers and bosses. That depth of perspective leads
to better solutions to problems.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, stars take charge of their own work life, what
Kelley refers to as ``self-management.''
</P>
<P>
   Average performers think of self-management as techniques to
help them better manage their time and projects. But star producers
view self-management as creating new opportunities for themselves.
They're constantly asking how to make themselves more valuable and
looking for ways to get the experiences and skills they need to get
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   By applying these strategies, Kelley said, workers can double
their productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can be a star.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, Va. _ The oyster scientist stepped out of the boat
into the western branch of the Elizabeth River, seeming to defy
nature and stand on the water itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is profound,'' said Robert D. Brumbaugh, a fisheries
specialist, standing on the barely visible tip of what scientists
say is a critical turning point in the beleaguered life of the once
supreme Chesapeake Bay oyster: an oyster reef laboriously created
by an armada of scientists and hundreds of citizen volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long since oyster reefs have been hazards to
navigation here,'' Brumbaugh said, proudly noting the ``Danger:
oyster reef'' sign rising from the murky water sloshing over the
tip of the reef at low tide.
</P>
<P>
   The sign stands as far more than a throwback to the 19th
century, when vast Chesapeake oyster reefs rose up fruitful as
orchards toward the thousands of watermen who used to harvest their
succulent treasure from skipjack sailboats. In fact, the reef
warning is pointing firmly to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return of oysters to Chesapeake Bay would probably be the
greatest signal that we really are heading in the right
direction,'' said William C. Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay
Foundation, a watchdog group of scientists and citizens that has
worked with surrounding state governments for the last 30 years to
repair and protect the bay. The foundation has been working toward
a tenfold increase in the oyster population by 2005, using
volunteers and the reef approach that is gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
   A new consensus report by the bay's principal scientists, after
years of life-support experimentation on the oyster, has
recommended an all-out commitment to three-dimensional reef
construction _ not mere flat-bottom beds _ as the key to restoring
the oyster to its central place in the life of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement marks a moment of rare optimism about the tattered
health of the oyster and, by extension, the bay itself, a vast
resource of 64,000 square miles with a watershed population of 15
million people across six states. The oyster is a keystone species
that had prodigiously filtered away impurities in the pristine
heyday of the bay while propagating upward like coral reefs as
magnets for other creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we have a technical consensus across state
lines,'' said Dr. Donald Boesch, president of the University of
Maryland Center for Environmental Science. The report was produced
by 10 marine scientists from Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina,
led by Dr. Gene Burreson of the Virginia Institute of Marine
Science.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is that in the last four decades, gross
overfishing and two protozoan diseases have devastated the oyster
population to about 1 percent of its glory years of a century ago.
The scientists concluded that 10 percent of the bay's historically
best oyster grounds must be set aside for the creation of permanent
reef sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Verticality is critical,'' the scientists of the Chesapeake
Research Consortium concluded, embracing the once-radical notion
that oyster restoration must be built on a return to the
three-dimensional reefs the first colonists found towering
hazardously up from the bay floor.
</P>
<P>
   That formation has been reaffirmed as the oysters' preferred
structure in reproducing by means of free-floating larvae that
attach to the existing mass of oyster shells and grow, fixed in
place to the reef. High-rise experimental beds have been found to
teem like apartment complexes as rich habitats for hundreds of
interdependent creatures, including a more secure breed of oyster.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, more than 20 million bushels of oysters were
harvested annually from the bay. Five years ago, the take was fewer
than 100,000 bushels and has rebounded only marginally while
scientists have pursued long-term solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeenth-century ship logs and sketches of the bay's old
reefs have been consulted in building the score of new reefs
dotting the bay. Up to an acre each, they rise up to 12 feet above
the floor sediment and cost up to $100,000 each. By far the most
ambitious step _ building a ring of 10 one-acre reefs plus
surrounding fields of shucked oyster shells 10 inches deep _ is to
begin next year in the lower Rappahannock River, once an oyster
mother lode that has gone fallow.
</P>
<P>
   For all the shifting problems of the bay _ chronic river
fishkills like the enormous one in late July from drought and toxic
microbes called pfiesteria, dangerous runoffs of sediment and
nutrients from the region's farms and lawns _ there are positive
new signs, like the pelicans that have migrated to swoop about the
bay. But the two keys to the bay's health remain the oyster and
underwater grasses, Baker emphasized. An estimated 88 percent of
grass acreage has been lost this century in various abuses of the
bay. This loss is increasingly a threat to the crab population that
has overtaken the oyster as the bay's main commercial harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If enough oysters can clear the water once more, the sunlight
may penetrate and nurture the grasses and reoxygenate the water,''
Baker said. He summarized a cycle pinned to encouraging experiments
with man-made reefs stocked with hatchery-produced,
disease-resistant oysters.
</P>
<P>
   The oysters are set in place by thousands of citizen
``gardeners'' _ from concerned boat owners to teams of
schoolchildren _ who nurture young oysters at home and dockside and
transplant them by hand to the reefs. The new reefs have been built
atop vast piles of old oyster shells. The results include a
remarkable improvement in reproduction rates as oysters mass upward
and propagate outward for miles beyond the initial reef, said James
A. Wesson, chief of conservation replenishment for the Virginia
Marine Resources Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a public relations strategy in showing the reefs at
low tide,'' Wesson said, noting that the reefs could have been
built to remain out of sight. ``This way, the kids can see and
touch the oysters right in place. They call themselves
grandparents. Planting trees, they'd wait 20 years for the fun they
get here in a year of tending to the oyster offspring.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his own act of bay adaptation, Wesson obtained a Ph.D. in
marine wildlife after seeing his early career _ a waterman in the
long tradition of his family _ evaporate in bedeviling
environmental problems and plummeting harvests.
</P>
<P>
   Now he works on the cutting edge of the oyster restoration,
overseeing 20 of the reefs and an annual budget of $300,000. Next
year Wesson expects a fivefold increase in budget, most of it from
the state, as he begins the Rappahannock's ring of reefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rappahannock is so big we're taking it in sections,''
Wesson said, looking forward to the next big test in restoration.
``It used to be  &UR; the &LR;  river oyster,'' he said, noting that it took
six years of experimenting with smaller reefs to approach the
challenge of the Rappahannock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the right track,'' he said, watching a boatload of
schoolteachers moving past the hazard sign to witness the growing
promise of the Chesapeake. ``We're on the point of showing what we
can do.''

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ On Friday night, as Rijko Jovanovic was
throwing an opening party for his new bar, handing out drinks to
the trendy and criminal in their tight clothes and skinhead
haircuts, Aleksandar Krika, a tailor, was still waiting across town
in a half-mile line for cheap gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Krika had been there since 3:30 a.m., hoping for a delivery of
state gas that might or might not come, holding on to a July coupon
for 20 liters that expired at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The coupon would get him gas for 7.2 dinars a liter, or about
$2.80 a gallon at the official rate of exchange. He could easily
buy it on the street, on the black market, but for 18 dinars a
liter, 2.5 times more. In fact, at the very end of the queue, a
streetwise entrepreneur had set up a stand to sell gas at that
price.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Krika said, ``my time is less expensive than the
money.'' His business is doing well enough, because he repairs and
alters clothes more than he creates them. In the deep recession
that has followed NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia, he said,
``people want money in their pockets now more than they want new
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it make him angry to wait in line for gas in Europe at the
end of the 20th century? He smiled, a mix between sheepishness and
indulgence for the naive assumptions of the foreigner. ``It's part
of life here these days,'' he said. ``Everyone knows the problems.
The refineries were bombed. You can get angry as much as you like,
but where does that get you?''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Belgraders, Krika wants political change and an end to
Yugoslavia's isolation. He is upset about the loss of Kosovo, and
he would like President Slobodan Milosevic, whom he supported until
two years ago, to leave office. But Krika, who has little respect
for the current crop of opposition leaders, is not about to die to
make it happen, ``to let one hungry gang take over from another
that's already eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic, presiding over the launch of his bar, Pingvin, a
companion to his restaurant Duga, is not much happier. He is taking
a risk, he says, because even the normal restaurant crowd is
spending less.
</P>
<P>
   During the 78-day bombing war, Belgrade seemed almost normal in
the daytime, with restaurants and coffee bars jammed until about 4
p.m., when there was an eerie exodus for home, before the air raid
alerts, lightless streets and thudding detonations.
</P>
<P>
   On these long, hot summer nights, Belgrade seems back to its
old, Italianate habits, people pouring out of their apartments to
hit the restaurants, clubs and bars from 9 p.m. until the early
hours. Most people have replaced their broken windows and roof
tiles and gotten together to clean the shards of glass from their
courtyards, where their children play.
</P>
<P>
   But economists say that incomes are down at least 40 percent in
real terms, that people's savings are becoming depleted and that
many have not been paid their salaries or pensions since mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic complains that people are ordering less. ``People sit
for four hours over two drinks,'' he said. ``During the war it was
almost better. Now people don't have any money, and the taxes, if
they catch you, are incredible. It hasn't been like this for 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he said, a bar owner can clear 30 percent of the
receipts, ``but now, it's like a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing for the owner, but we give two-thirds for
Marko and Marija,'' he said, referring to the two children of
Milosevic and his powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   What Jovanovic really means, of course, are taxes, including
some new postwar levies for ``reconstruction.'' But his comments
reflect the common urban mood about Yugoslavia's first family in
this soft authoritarianism, where people generally speak as they
please.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship is still the prime virtue here. ``People like to go
to the bars even without money,'' Jovanovic said. ``Old friends
come to chat and drink, and I can't charge them full price or I put
it on the tab.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 15,000 DM tied up in tabs,'' he said, referring to
German marks worth about $8,800. ``But how can I go into someone's
house these days and take money away from their kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Especially with the winter coming. Summer here is languid,
torpid and slow. But as Belgrade went through an unseasonably
chilly few days of rain last week, people started to worry openly
about this postwar winter, when a city that largely heats itself
with electricity expects to have serious difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate ads now highlight amenities like chimneys and
wood-burning stoves rather than marble bathtubs and all-electric
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubica Markovic, the chief editor of the independent Beta news
agency, said that ``I knew we were in trouble'' when a large
generator was delivered to her building for the new apartment of
Serbia's prime minister, Mirko Marjanovic. ``It's a sign they might
be expecting bad times,'' she said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   In Smederevo, the manager of the town's electricity plant went
out to buy a coal- and wood-burning stove for his family,
apparently to impress upon the town, known for its stoves, the
difficulties to come.
</P>
<P>
   Outside an electrical supply store here, on the sidewalk, is a
tinny little stovepipe, about 3 feet high, to burn wood or coal,
for 514 dinars, about $50. Inside, there is a more impressive
wood-burning oven, enameled in different colors, for about $400.
Zoran Przulj, 35, says he has sold 20 already and expects to sell a
lot more, and he offers a three-month payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are preparing themselves,'' he said. ``People expect a
bad winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, perhaps, the last time such stoves were so popular
in a Balkan city was during the Bosnian war in Sarajevo, which was
starved of electricity and gas supplies during the 3 1/2-year siege
and bombardment by Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But to use a stove, you need ventilation. In Novi Beograd, or
New Belgrade, where hundreds of thousands of people live, the
apartment buildings were not constructed with chimneys or much
storage space for wood. In older Belgrade, many younger people
tossed out the wood-burning stoves that kept their parents warm
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those like Branislav Bondzic, 29, his wife
Maja, 26, and their daughter Milica, 5. His building was built with
a chimney, but it is now useless. A few years ago, the owner of the
apartment two floors above ripped out the flue to build himself a
wet bar.
</P>
<P>
   Bondzic shrugged. He has electric radiators and a stove that can
also use bottled gas, so he has bought a few canisters. If it gets
really cold, he said, he will send the family to his parents' house
in a village near Obrenovac, 25 miles away, where there is plenty
of wood and food, two pigs and country-kind neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather was a World War II partisan who lost most of his
wealth, but was given a few fields around his house. There, they
still preserve pork in the ``vajat,'' or smokehouse, or lay it in
cold storage, in the ground, packed with layers of pork fat and
grasses, which also preserves the meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when we kill the pigs, we sold the fat, but not this
year,'' Bondzic said. ``We need it.'' Anyway, he said, ``when it's
grilled, the taste is wonderful _ in the freezer, it loses all
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Belgraders have connections to the countryside, or to
friends and relatives working abroad, who send in extra cash. Those
who do not have such ties find them. During Yugoslavia's
hyperinflation in the winter of 1993, for instance, the employees
of the liberal magazine Vreme got together and bought two pigs,
which they slaughtered, preserved and shared.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes are also going into cold storage, while nearly every
family in Serbia spends at least part of the summer cooking and
preserving vegetables _ the peppers, eggplants, onions and so on
that fill the green markets now at 30 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Even city dwellers pile up the jars and cans for storage, and
when they share with neighbors, make sure they get the jars back
again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at Belgrade's Zeleni Venac market, shoppers were
complaining about the price of eggs, with the large size costing 2
dinars or about 20 cents apiece. ``I tell them the price of chicken
feed and gasoline are up,'' said Ivanka Tankosic matter of factly.
``Two eggs and bread is still the cheapest dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tankosic, 65, has been working in the market for 15 years,
after more than 30 years as a salesclerk. ``It will be a hard
winter, and people will suffer, like during the war. Shoes are the
most important thing,'' she said laughing. ``Buy them three sizes
too big and then put on two pairs of thick socks.''
</P>
<P>
   She, too, would like things to change at the top, but she sees
no magic bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never know where we are,'' she said. ``Everyone wants
everything to be better. But how, and where, and what it is
exactly, no one knows.''

BLUE JAYS' GREEN BEING COMPARED TO WALKER, PARKER AND CLEMENTE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jim Fregosi, longtime baseball man and current manager of
the Toronto Blue Jays, was asked to compare his 26-year-old right
fielder, Shawn Green, to players of the past or present, he started
with an All-Star and ended with a legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about Larry Walker at Colorado and Dave Parker, who
used to play right field for Pittsburgh,'' said Fregosi, who has
been a player, manager or executive in the major leagues since
1961. ``Those guys were complete players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can even go back to Roberto Clemente, a guy that could run
and throw, hit for average, hit for power and drive in runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi did not hesitate when mentioning the great Clemente. The
name of the Hall of Fame right fielder flew from his lips as easily
as a fastball from a pitching machine, perhaps because Fregosi
knows that Green has been compared to even better. In 1991, when
Green was a gangly star at Tustin High School in California, the
Blue Jays scout Moose Johnson was so impressed that he likened the
youngster's swing to that of Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying at this time that Shawn's going to be a Hall of
Famer,'' Fregosi said. ``But he has the ability, if he can do it
over a long period of time, to put up the numbers that would make
him that kind of player.''
</P>
<P>
   No one watching Green this season would argue with Fregosi's
assessment. When Green leads the Blue Jays into Yankee Stadium for
a three-game series that begins Monday night, he will do so on the
heels of a franchise-record 28-game hitting streak, the longest in
the American League this season, which ended Sunday against
Detroit. He ranks among the American League leaders in seven
offensive categories, and is the league leader in fielding
percentage (.995) at his position. After becoming the first Blue
Jays player and only the ninth American Leaguer to record at least
30 home runs (35) and 30 stolen bases (35) in the same season in
1998, he has a chance to do it again, with 31 homers and 18 steals
in 24 attempts so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I always thought the home runs were harder, but now
I think it's the stolen bases that are tougher,'' Green said. ``You
get some sore legs here and there and get in situations where you
can't run as much, depending on the game. So it's a lot harder to
get those 30 to 40 stolen bases. I'd like to try and steal some
more this year, but it's been a little bit of a grind.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Green's major league career, at first. After Johnson's
glowing evaluation led the Blue Jays to select Green with the 16th
pick of the 1991 draft and pay him a $700,000 signing bonus _ the
second-largest in baseball history at the time _ Green spent four
seasons in the minors and the past four full seasons in Toronto.
The thinking throughout the organization was that Green, who bats
left-handed, could not hit left-handed pitchers, and some of the
club's officials even thought it might be best to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   But Green was not moved, and last season Tim Johnson, the Blue
Jays' manager at the time, decided to make him an everyday player.
Green went on to post career highs in nearly every statistical
category and hit .287 against both left- and right-handed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   While that has been a pleasant, if shocking, development for the
Blue Jays, Green's power was just as unexpected. Carrying only 200
pounds on his slender 6-foot-4-inch frame, Green looks like
anything but a slugger. And before last season, his career best was
16 home runs in 429 at-bats in 1997. He did not even show power in
the minors, where he hit only 13 homers in 433 times at bat at
Syracuse in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was anything that he ever really accented,''
the Blue Jays' General Manager Gord Ash said. ``He was a gap-type
hitter who really was going to hit for a high average and who was
going to be strong enough to hit 15 to 20 home runs. But he's
proven to be a unique combination of power and speed. To look at
him, you don't see that power build of a Mark McGwire or a Canseco.
But he has very, very strong arms and very quick wrists and that
allows him to hit with power.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing 11 starts with a broken left wrist after being
hit by the Yankees' Andy Pettitte on May 28, Green is on course to
hit at least 40 homers this season. The Blue Jays' other power
hitter, Carlos Delgado, who at a burly 6-3 and 225 pounds looks the
part, has been amazed by the strength of Green's stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back this year with unbelievable power,'' said
Delgado, who has played with Green since 1992. ``I mean, last year,
he hit some balls good. But now, it seems like everything that he
hits is just like, `boom.' It just takes off. Sometimes, you go:
`Did you hit that ball that good? It went 450 feet!'''
</P>
<P>
   Green made his first All-Star appearance this season, the talk
show host Larry King has referred to him as ``the game's next great
superstar'' and reporters and fans everywhere are beginning to
descend on him. While Green appreciates the attention, his quiet,
unassuming personality leads him to treat it more as a chore than
as a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really had to deal with much of this stuff,'' Green
said. ``I'm pretty much a private person. I'm pretty quiet, so I
guess it takes a little getting used to, dealing with all this
attention. But to get the attention, you have to perform well, and
obviously I want to perform well. So I'll just take whatever
consequences that come with that as part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has come to cherish one product of all the attention: an
increased awareness of his Jewish heritage. In a sport that
historically has boasted few Jewish stars _ Sandy Koufax and Hank
Greenberg are the only Jewish players in the Hall of Fame _ Green
has become a source of ethnic pride, drawing cheers from Jewish
fans in practically every ball park he enters and being featured in
numerous Jewish publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely get a lot of support from the Jewish community,''
Green said. ``I might not get booed as bad as somebody who isn't
Jewish in certain cities because there are always some Jewish fans
at the games that are cheering a little bit, and it feels good to
be welcomed like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who said he was not reared in a religious household, has
even decided he wants a bar mitzvah. ``Since I've been in the big
leagues, I've learned a lot more about my religion, my heritage,''
he said. ``I would like to have a bar mitzvah. I've got a full
plate right now, but I'm going to see if I can somehow accomplish
that.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that the Yankees would love to
acquire Green when he becomes a free agent after the 2000 season,
mainly because of his talent but also because his Jewish background
would be a draw. While Green says he is happy in Toronto, he
admitted to being a Yankee fan as a youngster in New Jersey and
California, one who dreamed of playing in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every kid has dreams of putting on those Yankee
pinstripes,'' Green said. ``I remember being a little kid, going to
a Yankees game, and it was like watching the Beatles or something.
That's the dream of a little kid, but at the same time, I've got to
do what's best for me when that time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Blue Jays, not wanting to lose the next Roberto
Clemente, will do everything in their power to keep Green in
Toronto, even if he didn't grow up dreaming of playing in Sky Dome.

ARAFAT MEETS WITH EXILED PALESTINIAN FACTION  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, made a
rare effort Sunday to secure unity among the Palestinian factions
in anticipation of renewed peace talks with Israel later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met in Cairo with representatives of George Habash,
leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which
is based in Syria. It is perhaps the most powerful of the exiled
Palestinian groups opposed to the peace made between Israel and the
Palestinians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official, Nabil Shaath, described the
meeting as ``very positive,'' but it was unclear whether the talks
would result in a more united Palestinian front. A spokesman for
Habash's group, Abu Ali Mustafa, said it would be important for the
Palestinians to forge a common position on the many sensitive
disputes remaining with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting served as a new sign that Arafat is more ready than
ever before to plunge into the kind of serious, sensitive talks
that could lead to a final peace. But it also served as a reminder
of the fact that the Palestinians are far from united, and that
exiled groups like that of Habash still carry considerable
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meeting was the first between Arafat and Habash's group
since 1993, when Arafat's agreement to the so-called Oslo accords,
the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, led to a
major rupture been the two factions. Habash, who is based in Syria,
did not attend Sunday's meetings. No public explanation was
provided, but journalists in Syria say that he has been in ill
health.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials in Cairo said the main focus of the talks
had been the recent proposal from Ehud Barak, Israel's new prime
minister, to postpone carrying out the latest peace measures
between the two sides until they could reach agreement on the
broader issues dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had asked the Palestinians to take two weeks to think
about his plan for delay. Arafat has shown no willingness to agree,
but President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, an important patron, has said
he would try to mediate. (In Jerusalem, a spokesman for Barak said
that Israel would begin carrying out outstanding pledges under the
agreement by Oct. 1, Reuters news service reported.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Arafat has decided now to meet with such an
important dissident faction seemed to suggest a recognition from
all sides about just how much might now be at stake. Barak has said
he believes a full peace with the Palestinians might be possible in
just 15 months, and such a timetable would confront Arafat and his
Palestinian rivals with some difficult questions.
</P>
<P>
   Among those would be not only the wisdom of the initial peace
agreement that Arafat signed with Israel in 1993, but the more
sensitive questions that will be at the center of any accord that
might lie ahead _ including the status of Jerusalem, the shape of
any Palestinian state, and the rights provided to millions of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians,
including many aligned to Habash's group. Along with Lebanon, its
ally, it has been the base for the most radical dissents among
Palestinians to Arafat. Habash formed the popular front in 1968 and
built it into a powerhouse second only to Arafat's Fatah
organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition, which for 10 years has led the charge
of the religious right in national and local politics, is now
weathering serious financial and leadership turmoil that could
affect its ability to exert widespread influence in the 2000
election, current and former staff members say.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is hobbled by a $2.5 million debt, the departure
of most of its experienced leaders, and so much turnover in local
leadership that it currently has strong affiliates in no more than
seven states, down from the 48 it claimed last year, the staff
members say.
</P>
<P>
   And now even its prior assertions to such widespread strength
are in doubt. Former national leaders who have recently left the
group said in interviews that the coalition, as critics have long
suspected, never commanded the numbers it claimed, and the former
leaders revealed some of the techniques that they said were used to
inflate the coalition's power and reach.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, these former leaders say, distorted the size of
its base by keeping thousands of dead people, wrong addresses and
duplicates on its list of supporters; printed millions of voter
guides that the coalition leaders expected would never be
distributed, and hired temporary workers to look busy in the mail
room and phone banks to impress reporters and camera crews.
</P>
<P>
   During some news media tours of coalition headquarters, in
Chesapeake, Va., former staff members say, a roving group of
employees leapfrogged ahead of the reporters to fill empty offices
and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the coalition's setbacks, Roberta Combs, its new
executive vice president of field operations, and a spokesman, Mike
Russell, sounded optimistic in an interview on Friday, saying that
they have started a campaign to hire directors for all 50 states by
the election in 2000. They would not discuss the group's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we've lost some momentum,'' Russell said. ``But
the grass roots of the organization are still there. It's just a
question now of getting back out and re-energizing the existing
network.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition now claims 1.8 million to 2 million supporters,
but its list includes many one-time donors, bad addresses and
people who once signed a petition or called an 800 number, former
and current staff members say. They could identify only seven
states where the coalition still has an organization strong enough
to affect upcoming elections: South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Texas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can reorganize, it certainly won't be in time at a
national level for the 2000 election,'' said Charles H. Cunningham,
who resigned in March as the coalition's director of national
operations and is now Capitol Hill lobbyist for the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition was ranked the seventh most powerful
lobbying group by Fortune magazine last year. But even if it
stumbles _ and its leaders insist they are turning things around _
the religious right as a force in politics is not likely to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is only one group, although the most politically
adept, in a larger movement. And many of the organizers who honed
their skills working with the coalition and recently left have now
moved on to work for other like-minded groups, or for the
presidential campaigns of such Republican candidates as Steve
Forbes and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't think the religious right is going to
disappear,'' said William Martin, the Chavanne Professor of
Religion and Public Policy at Rice University. ``Neither is it
going to become a majority. It's a significant substantial
minority, but it's not likely that it's going to become more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has always cast itself as a nonpartisan voter
education organization. But in June The St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times
disclosed that the Internal Revenue Service, after a 10-year
review, had decided to deny the coalition's application for federal
tax-exempt status because its voter guides and the remarks of its
leaders showed a partisan tilt toward Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition responded by announcing that it would was
splitting into two: a taxable entity called Christian Coalition
International that may eventually endorse candidates, form a
political action committee and donate to campaigns, and a
tax-exempt group, Christian Coalition of America, which will
conduct voter education under the tax exemption already granted the
Christian Coalition of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That reshuffling puts the group's very identity in jeopardy,
political analysts say: Can it be both a PAC and nonpartisan? And
what if the taxable arm endorses a candidate that many of its own
organizers and followers do not favor?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still under honest discussion,'' said Randy Tate, the
coalition's lobbyist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition was founded in 1989 by Pat Robertson, a
businessman and television evangelist, drawing on the support that
emerged for his run for president in 1988. Under the direction of
Ralph Reed, whose boyish visage soon became the public face of the
Christian right, the coalition took a disaffected voting bloc of
conservative evangelicals, applied campaign-style tactics and built
a force that strong-armed the Republican Party to move to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   At its height in 1996, the coalition claimed a grass-roots
network of 2.8 million people in 48 states and a budget of $26.5
million. In the 1998 elections, the coalition boasted of
distributing more than 40 million voter guides through cooperating
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never distributed 40 million guides,'' said Dave Welch, the
coalition's former national field director, who now organizes
Vision America to involve pastors in politics. ``State affiliates
took stacks of them to recycling centers after the election. A lot
of churches just put a pile of them on the back table. I never
considered effective distribution anything short of inserting them
into church bulletins, but in very few churches did that actually
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is that the coalition's ranks of grass-roots
organizers were far thinner than appeared. ``Say you've got a guy
in Wisconsin,'' said Jeffrey M. Peyton, the coalition's former
grass-roots communications director. ``He's listed as a voter guide
distributor, a chapter chairman and a church liaison. So that one
guy counts as three. And he may not do any of those things, because
he doesn't even know he's been asked to.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russell, the spokesman, denied that the coalition ever
exaggerated its supporter list. With voter guides, ``you're always
going to have some excess,'' he said, but the group ``got the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   About the staging done for visiting news media, Russell
acknowledged that temporary workers were hired to staff the phone
banks and mail room for camera crews, but he said this was done
with the knowledge of journalists who wanted footage of busy
offices. And of the leapfrogging staff during reporters' visits,
Russell said, ``I never saw that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one denies that behind the coalition's much-touted
millions was a nagging secret: It cost the group about 50 percent
of its budget to raise its millions, a ratio far in excess of that
spent on fund raising by established nonprofit groups, but closer
to that spent by political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   When Ken Hill, an official in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, became the coalition's chief operating officer in
1996, he discovered that the coalition was bringing in about
$100,000 daily in donations, and spending almost that much in
operating expenses and fund raising. With no endowment and very few
major donors, Hill said, the group depended on a steady stream of
small checks generated through direct mail and telemarketing, which
are notoriously expensive fund-raising techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were quite a bit of funds there, but the cost of raising
those funds was huge,'' Hill said in an interview. ``I remember
asking, `What happens when it doesn't come in like that?' And they
said, `It always does.' And I thought, `Just wait.'''
</P>
<P>
   The money and momentum began to dry up after Reed announced he
was leaving in April 1997. He was replaced months later by Tate, a
former Republican congressman from Washington state, and Donald P.
Hodel, a Reagan administration Cabinet member. They were stunned to
inherit an operation that was more than $3 million in debt, Hill
said. At the end of 1997, they dismissed staff, shut their magazine
and closed affiliates that were supposed to reach out to Catholics
and nonwhites _ a retrenchment that employees called the
``Christmas Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson came to the rescue with a $1 million contribution. But
former staff members say the group spent much of 1998 distracted by
the debt, by the battle to convince the IRS to grant it tax-exempt
status, and by a lawsuit filed by the Federal Election Commission
accusing the coalition of colluding with Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of employees began at the top, with Hodel himself. In
January, just after the coalition had mailed out one million
fund-raising letters and petitions urging the impeachment of
President Clinton, Robertson remarked on television that
Republicans ``might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing and
get on with something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition offices were immediately flooded with angry phone
calls and e-mail from coalition supporters, staff members who were
there say. Ripped-up contribution forms and checks soon arrived in
the mail. When Hodel asked Robertson to distance himself from the
coalition, Robertson asked him to resign, several former leaders
say.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who retains the title of board chairman, has now
reasserted control, moving Tate to Washington to lobby for the
coalition, and installing two people who also serve on the
coalition's board as leaders: Mrs. Combs, who led the South
Carolina chapter, and Richard Weinhold, a telemarketing executive
whose business consults for the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Combs says the group is gearing up for the 2000 elections
by holding ``God and Country Gala'' rallies featuring Robertson,
hiring a youth coordinator and a church liaison director, seeking
major donors and planning to distribute voters guides by Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really busy here at the national office,'' she said.

FASSEL SAYS BETTER PLAYERS WILL ALLOW GIANTS TO OPEN UP OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Giants had the worst offense in the National
Football League when Jim Fassel arrived as head coach in 1997. Two
seasons later, the Giants offense ranked 29th out of 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel acknowledges that this is mildly embarrassing, since his
forte is offensive artistry. It certainly troubles him, but he has
felt inhibited by the talent of the team he inherited.
Specifically, Fassel believes Dave Brown and Danny Kanell, his two
starting quarterbacks at the beginning of the last two seasons,
were unpolished and somewhat overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier on them, Fassel sacrificed ingenuity for
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   But at his third Giants training camp this summer, Fassel is
emphasizing something new about his offense. He says he is not
holding back any longer, promising to put in a host of new
wrinkles. He is assuring one and all that the Giants will attack.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel says the game plan will no longer be to play conservative
and hope the defense can win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting aggressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NFL training camps are full of such tough talk. But since
aggressive offenses often make mistakes that lose games, Fassel
could well find himself pulling in the reins to survive the season.
It's what happened in each of the two previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous to a fault, Fassel has thought this out and he
believes that this time his offense does not have to be dull to be
dependable.
</P>
<P>
   Why? For the simplest reason of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have better players,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel is convinced his situation at quarterback is much
improved and that the quarterback, whether it is Kent Graham or
Kerry Collins, will have better players to aid the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, Dave Brown was struggling with a lot of
things,'' Fassel said. ``He hadn't played well and he was
struggling with his self-confidence. He had been sacked more than
any quarterback in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't ask him to do too much. The priority was boosting
his confidence and keeping enough blockers in to reduce the sacks.
That's not going to lead to an aerial circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next season we had Danny, who was only in his second year
starting. He was a young guy still learning, and we couldn't put
too much on his plate or we might set him back.''
</P>
<P>
   So Fassel largely ignored the parts of his playbook that threw
the ball downfield, that aggressively split a tight end at the end
of the formation like a wide receiver. He didn't have a tight end
with those kind of pass-catching skills, and he didn't have a
quarterback who had ever demonstrated he could successfully throw
the deep pass.
</P>
<P>
   Graham may be 10-14 as a starter in the NFL and Collins may be
coming off a turnover-filled season, but Fassel sees the tandem as
experienced and poised.
</P>
<P>
   ``At quarterback, I'm not as worried about building confidence
as I was before,'' he said. ``I'm implementing more and more new
plays and a lot of new fronts. We have to display explosiveness. We
have to be more threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've advanced to where we can handle more. Our offensive line
is more athletic. Pete Mitchell at tight end is very knowledgeable
about how to get open and catch passes at his position. The offense
has changed a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell will most likely step in as the new third-down
possession receiver, a role filled in the past few seasons by Chris
Calloway, whom the Giants released this winter. Amani Toomer, who
is 6 feet 3 inches, will give the Giants a big target downfield _
and he seems to be Graham's favorite receiver, whereas Calloway was
a favorite of both Brown and Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was quarterback of the Arizona Cardinals in 1996 when
Fassel was the team's offensive coordinator. To Graham, Fassel is
turning back the clock to that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attacked, tried a lot of things and the offense opened
up,'' Graham said. ``Everything is related. Your running game is
made better by a long pass attempt. Even if you don't complete that
pass, you make the defense nervous, and they back off the line of
scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Fassel is convinced this Giants offense can handle a
more comprehensive system of plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any choice,'' he said. ``We have to get better.
To go to the next level in this league, you can't be ranked where
we are offensively.'' &QL;

DUVAL SAYS A RESTED WOODS HAS NO ADVANTAGE IN PRIME-TIME MATCH
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Having earned $57,500 for his four rounds of
work in the Canon Greater Hartford Open, David Duval left for
California and a head-to-head, made-for-television match Monday
night against Tiger Woods that will earn the winner $1.1 million
and the loser $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a seven-under-par 63 Sunday, Duval said he was
not concerned about playing for such high stakes 3,000 miles and
three time zones away against an opponent who took the week off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't play golf five days in a row, maybe I should find
something else to do,'' the 27-year-old Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who boarded a private jet at Bradley International
Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., about 30 miles from here, a few
hours after completing his round, was asked whether he thought
Woods might have an edge after not playing in a tournament this
weekend. Duval endured temperatures in the 90s for four days at the
Tournament Players Club at River Highlands, finishing at 11-under
269 and tying for 11th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine, and I'm not worried about it,'' he replied.
``I'll get to California by 5 this afternoon and have plenty of
time to rest up. Also, I'll be able to sleep late, since we're not
teeing off until 5 o'clock in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Some golf purists have criticized the Duval-Woods match, which
will be broadcast by ABC, saying that it may lead to other
prime-time television matches involving the game's biggest stars
while diminishing some regular tour events. Duval disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for golf,'' said Duval, who has won four
tournaments and more than $3 million this year. ``A lot of people
will be watching, and so it can't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   While Duval was competing in the Greater Hartford, Woods was
resting in California and getting in several practice rounds at the
site of Monday night's match, the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand
Oaks, Calif. Though the event is not sanctioned by the PGA Tour,
the PGA has reportedly agreed to accept $1 million from
International Management Group, the sponsor of the match, which
acts as the agent for both Duval and Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-hole match will bring together, in a rare head-to-head
competition, the two players generally acknowledged as the best in
the world. On the strength of his record over the last two years,
Duval is widely considered No. 1. Through 16 tournaments this year
he has nine top-10 finishes, and with $3,076,500 in earnings he is
the leading money winner. The 23-year-old Woods, meanwhile, has
been in the top 10 in 11 of 15 events, while winning three titles
and collecting $2,624,105 for second place behind Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Greater Hartford Open, Woods was leading the tour
in scoring average (68.66), followed by Duval, and in all-around
ranking, where Duval was fourth. Duval, meanwhile, led in hitting
greens in regulation and in birdie average.
</P>
<P>
   Given his flair and his length off the tee, Woods has
overshadowed Duval. After his record-breaking Masters victory in
1997, Woods, then only 21, was being projected as the most dominant
player for years to come. But then Duval began his remarkable run,
which has included 11 tournament titles within the last 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duval-Woods is hardly a rivalry comparable to, say,
Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. For one thing, Duval has yet to
win a Grand Slam tournament and Woods has won only one.
</P>
<P>
   So what will the match prove? Not much, probably, other than
that it will make both Duval and Woods much richer while scores of
professionals are trying to get through Monday qualifying and make
it into the main draw of the next tournament, with no guarantee of
making any money whatsoever. &QL;

MANY WOMEN, AND DOCTORS, UNAWARE OF HEART DISEASE RISK IN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Carolyn Day thought she had a sinus infection. The
pressure around her eyes and ears throbbed all day. Close to
midnight, a sudden pressure in her chest grabbed her attention.
</P>
<P>
   Day had experienced only limited health problems during her 65
years. But she instinctively knew something was wrong, and told her
son to take her to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Wash., a suburb of Seattle,
she found out the blood vessels that serve as pathways to and from
her heart were seriously blocked. The doctors performed a
triple-bypass surgery at 7:30 the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking it was heart problems because my symptoms
didn't seem right,'' Day said. ``I didn't have the pain going to
the shoulder and I didn't have the gripping chest pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Day is one of millions of women who suffer from problems with
heart disease in the United States. Like Day, many are unaware of
their risks, and unaware that their symptoms can vary from those of
men.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association lists heart disease as the No. 1
cause of death for both men and women in America. Yet heart attack,
stroke and other cardiovascular diseases have killed more women
than men every year since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, however, heart disease was considered a male
problem. Even many medical professionals remained unaware of the
high risk for women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Hammond of The Hope Heart Institute, a
cardiovascular disease research center in Seattle, attributes the
lack of awareness to training and research oversights.
</P>
<P>
   Reports such as the Framingham Study, a commonly cited report on
heart disease, focused primarily on early onset of heart attacks
and heart disease. That almost eliminates women, since the majority
of heart problems occur in women after menopause.
</P>
<P>
   In the 45-to-64 age range, 1 in 10 women has some form of heart
disease. These odds increase to 1 in 5 women 65 and older,
according to the national Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said awareness of women's risks for heart disease is
increasing among medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the past five to eight years, doctors are becoming
drastically much more aware,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sarah Speck, chief of cardiology at Seattle's Swedish
Medical Center and director of the Dean Ornish Program for
Reversing Heart Disease, said one reason women's risks have been
overlooked is that their conditions may differ from men's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think physicians and providers now know that the risk
factors are equivalent in men and women,'' Speck said. ``However,
women's symptoms are different and that's where the level of
awareness needs to be raised in the public and the medical
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical signs of a heart attack include: repetitive pressure or
squeezing in the chest; shooting pain to shoulder, arms and neck;
sweating; shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   Women, however, may experience additional symptoms, including:
stomach pain or nausea, unexplained fatigue, racing heart rate and
jaw pain.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, most women do not seek help until two to six hours
after the first symptoms, according to Speck. This cuts into
valuable time when a patient could be saved or serious damage to
the heart prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Men seek help more quickly because they are more aware of
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women don't complain about their health ailments often
and they don't seek medical attention as often as they need to,''
Speck said. ``If you have the risks ... you need to think of heart
disease first.''
</P>
<P>
   Those risks include a family history of heart disease, diabetes,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and use of oral
contraceptives, tobacco and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Women who do suffer from heart attacks are also more likely to
die than men. According to a recent study conducted by Yale
researchers, 17 percent of female heart attack victims die while
still in the hospital; only 12 percent of men do.
</P>
<P>
   For women younger than 50, the odds are even more skewed. Only 3
percent of men die and 6 percent of women do.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks among young women are especially rare _ one reason
they may be misdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Corrine DeJong, 28, was watching a high-school basketball game
in 1988 at Ferndale High School in Ferndale, Wash., when chest
pains grabbed her attention.
</P>
<P>
   The pains grew sharper. She was having difficulty breathing. The
17-year-old DeJong ran outside. It was raining and cold, but she
felt fiery hot. Sweat poured from her skin. A friend saw DeJong
leave and followed her.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gym, DeJong blacked out and fell to the ground, but
she could hear someone say she was going to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, the medical staff told her she was fine. DeJong
said one doctor told her she had heartburn and sent her home with
Maalox. He suggested the reason she passed out was because she was
flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed because the doctor made me feel like I was
an idiot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeJong's episodes continued with varying frequency and intensity
for two years. She went from being outgoing and athletic to
becoming a social recluse who couldn't jog to the mailbox without
her heart racing uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   At times she would experience chest pains or shortness of breath
several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of what she calls ``living hell,'' Dr. James
Brodie of Seattle's Providence Medical Center examined her and
correctly diagnosed her heart problem in just 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Several tests confirmed DeJong suffered from a heart murmur, an
arrhythmia and a condition called vasovagal syncope, which causes
veins to constrict and make her pass out.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are not immediately life-threatening, but life as a
``normal'' person will never be in DeJong's future. Her heart beats
faster than most and she cannot pursue many athletic hobbies she
used to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   DeJong, is small-framed, 5-foot-7 and 125 pounds. Her curly
brown hair and bright hazel eyes complement a glowing complexion _
hardly the typical picture of someone with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not your classic heart patient,'' said DeJong. ``I've
never smoked, I'm not male, I'm young, I'm not overweight, I look
fairly healthy, but I am not.''
</P>
<P>
   She attends massage school and volunteers for the American Heart
Association to help raise awareness of heart disease. She said her
experience can help others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what was going on inside me was not right and I want to
reach the women whose doctor or boyfriend or family, whoever, is
telling them they are all right when they know they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the women that stop going to the doctor and those
are the women who end up dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Awareness is key to women at risk of heart disease. They can
reduce the chance of disease by analyzing personal risk factors,
avoiding high-risk behavior and being conscious of danger signs.
This can mean everything from eating a healthy diet to asking the
doctor the right questions.
</P>
<P>
   One person who wishes she had asked more questions is Carolyn
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize now I should have been more aware,'' she said.`` I
was at risk and I didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Day paid the price. For six weeks after her surgery, she could
sleep only on her back. Simple movements were difficult and
painful. Even sitting down or getting up from a chair was
excruciating. The pain in her chest from the massive surgery was
numbed by medication that left her in a daze much of the time.
However, by recognizing that something was wrong, she avoided what
could have been a serious heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the behaviors that lead to her problem, Day has set
out to regain control of her life. Since her surgery in April, she
has quit smoking and started exercising. As a patient of a cardiac
rehabilitation program at Evergreen Hospital Medical Center in
Kirkland, she walks on a treadmill and rides a bike machine.
</P>
<P>
   She is starting to forfeit some of the meats and cheeses she
loves and is eating more vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of lifestyle changes, Day said she is feeling better
than she did before the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tips on lowering risk
</P>
<P>
   One in 5 women in the United States has some sort of heart
disease. Women can lower their risks by:
</P>
<P>
   _Exercising. Physical activity can strengthen the cardiovascular
system and help control weight, blood pressure, diabetes, and
cholesterol levels. While regular vigorous activity is encouraged,
even low levels can be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   _Eating right. Eat a well-rounded, moderate, healthy diet. Find
information from heart-disease institutes, doctors or dietitians on
heart-healthy eating.
</P>
<P>
   _Stop smoking. Regardless of how long you have smoked, quitting
will still drastically reduce your risks.
</P>
<P>
   _Limit drinking. Limit alcohol intake to a moderate level.
</P>
<P>
   _Take hormones. Use hormone replacement therapy if your
physician finds it a suitable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _Limit stress. Find healthy ways to cope with stress.
</P>

WOMEN CAN CONTROL SOME RISKS OF HEART DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BY SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several factors increase the risk of heart disease for women.
</P>
<P>
   There are fixed risks, such as age, heredity, diabetes or
previous heart attack or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are some variable risks that can be controlled ,
such as weight, tobacco use, cholesterol level, blood pressure,
physical activity, weight, use of oral contraceptives, alcohol
intake and stress.
</P>
<P>
   _Age: As women grow older, the chance of developing heart
disease also increases. After menopause, the loss of natural
estrogen may increase a woman's susceptibility. Hormone replacement
therapy _ the replacement of estrogen and progesterone _ has been
used in some cases to help reduce risk. A recent study suggests
that the hormone prostaglandin, secreted by the uterus, may also
have protective value. The effects of taking hormones vary
according to the individual and should be discussed with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   _Heredity: A history of heart disease or stroke in close
relatives increases risks.
</P>
<P>
   _Diabetes: Diabetic women have double the risk of having a heart
attack. Additionally, diabetes doubles the risk of a second heart
attack in women, but not in men.
</P>
<P>
   _Race: Black and Asian American women are in a higher risk pool
than their Caucasian counterparts because of traditionally
higher-than-average blood pressure levels. For ages 35-74, the
death rate from coronary heart disease for black women is almost 72
percent higher than white women. Native Americans and Hispanics are
more likely to develop diabetes, which can in turn increase
cardiovascular risk.
</P>
<P>
   _Previous disease: A previous heart attack or stroke increases
risk of a second attack. In 1999 an estimated 1.1 million Americans
will have a coronary attack. Of these, about 650,000 will be first
attacks and 450,000 will be recurrent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   _Weight: Being overweight by more than 30 pounds is itself a
risk factor for heart disease and stroke. However, excess weight
can contribute to high blood pressure, high cholesterol and
diabetes _ all of which, in turn, put you at higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   _Tobacco: A smoker's risk of heart attack is more than twice
that of non-smokers. Secondhand smoke also raises the risk of heart
disease. Smoking is also the greatest risk factor for peripheral
vascular disease, which causes the blood vessels to the legs and
arms to narrow.
</P>
<P>
   _Cholesterol: The odds of a heart attack are doubled with
cholesterol at high levels. Blood cholesterol is considered at a
high level when it rises above 240 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter
of blood). However, blood cholesterol levels between 200 and 239
are at an intermediate level. Approximately 52 percent of the
American population has blood cholesterol in the intermediate risk
category; 21 percent are in the high level.
</P>
<P>
   _Blood pressure: Almost half the women 55 years and older have
high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the heart's
workload. This forces the heart to enlarge and eventually weaken.
It increases risk of stroke, heart attacks and congestive heart
failure. When it is paired with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol
or diabetes, the risk of heart attack is greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
   _Birth control: Some forms of oral contraceptives can increase a
woman's risk of heart disease. Pills with high levels of estrogen
and progestin afford the highest risk. However, high levels of
hormones are traditionally found in older pills; newer forms are
lower risk. Women who smoke or have high blood pressure increase
their risk with the use of any contraceptive pill.
</P>
<P>
   _Alcohol: Moderate drinkers, women who average one drink per
day, are at lower risk than non-drinkers. However, more frequent or
greater intake of alcohol can contribute to weight gain and high
blood-pressure, which leads to heart attacks and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   _Stress: An individual's reaction to stress could lead to heart
disease or failure. Common responses such as smoking, overeating or
drinking place people in higher risk categories.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Shortly after taking office, President Ernesto
Zedillo sought to prove his credentials as a reformer by ousting a
brash young governor-elect, Roberto Madrazo Pintado, who was
accused of winning a Gulf Coast statehouse through blatant ballot
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrazo refused to go. Instead, he incited a virtual
insurrection in his state, Tabasco, forcing the president to
swallow hard and recognize Madrazo's governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Madrazo is seeking the governing party's
presidential nomination, and his candidacy is developing into a new
showdown with Zedillo. Madrazo has surged so rapidly in opinion
polls that the primary campaign, which began formally Sunday, has
already effectively boiled down to a two-man contest between him
and a former interior minister, who is Zedillo's preferred
candidate. In fact, polls show Madrazo in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's rise has given him a fighting chance of winning the
nomination and the presidency, a stunning development in a country
where 10 consecutive presidents from the same governing party have
hand-picked their successors.
</P>
<P>
   He has urged increases in social spending, even at the expense
of a balanced budget, policies that have alarmed some international
investors. That raises once again the prospect of financial turmoil
during the presidential succession in a country that is a neighbor
of the United States and one of its top trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Madrazo's strength has been particularly irritating to
the president because the candidate's recent speeches have been
piercing attacks on Zedillo's tight-money, export-oriented economic
policies, which are popular in business circles but not in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in total disagreement with a policy that has brought great
results for a few but few results for a great majority,'' Madrazo
said in one fiery speech recently that drew roars of approval from
a crowd of working-class party members.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when Zedillo renounced the tradition under which
Mexican presidents have picked the candidate of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, skeptics predicted that the
president's sympathies would help the interior minister, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, to win the nomination easily. But Madrazo's
surprising success means that Zedillo may soon have to choose
whether to honor his pledge to open up the nominating process or
reassert his powers to block a long-time nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has emerged as an all-out battle for the heart of the
PRI, and what's extraordinary is that the president's candidate
could be defeated,'' said Jesus Silva-Herzog Marquez, a law
professor with family ties to the party.
</P>
<P>
   The party was founded in 1929 in the ashes of the Mexican
revolution but has been dominated for two decades by Ivy
League-trained economists, including Zedillo, known here as
technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madrazo is the first governor in 60 years to defy the
president, survive, and come back to claim vengeance,'' said
Federico Estevez, a political science professor here. ``This is
terribly attractive to PRI members who believe the technocrats have
been scooting them around with a broom, making them the brunt of
whatever policies the president wants to impose.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo captured the mood in Mexico with a series of national
television ads he ran starting last year while he was governor of
Tabasco, before the governing party had even set the rules for its
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says we can't do it? Yes we can!'' runs the slogan of
Madrazo's ads. The jingle distills the conviction that Mexicans do
not lack for determination but have been kept down by bad
government.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has also stolen the president's thunder on electoral
reform, portraying himself as a maverick bent on opening up a party
dominated by presidential control. His father, Carlos Madrazo, was
an early advocate of internal party democracy. When he died in a
mysterious plane crash in 1969, he earned a permanent place in
party lore as a martyr to reform. His son Roberto portrays himself
as an heir to that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an ambiguous stance, since Madrazo's career is clouded
by charges of vote-rigging and recurrent questions about the origin
of his campaign funds. After his 1994 election, federal
investigators determined that he had spent $36.8 million on the
campaign in his state, 10 times the legal limit, most of it
recorded as anonymous cash donations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Labastida, a courtly gentleman who at 56 is nine years
older than Madrazo, has preferred to hint at his rival's checkered
ethical record but not to attack it head-on. In a ceremony Sunday
at party headquarters kicking off the primary campaign, Labastida
condemned those who accept ``shameful campaign funds,'' an obvious
swipe at Madrazo's use this year of state monies and anonymous
donations to fund his television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I arrive at this campaign with clean hands after a life of
public service that lets me hold my head high,'' Labastida said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's backers are even more direct. After one recent
Mexico City rally, Tabasco residents who support him crowded around
a reporter, asserting that Madrazo has ruled his tropical state
with a hard hand, repressing critics even within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Four politicians have been campaigning for the governing party's
nomination for months. But since May, party rules have prohibited
them from broadcasting television commercials. That ban ended
Sunday. The primary vote is scheduled for Nov. 7, and the
presidential balloting for July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey by the Indemerc Louis Harris polling firm
last week showed Madrazo favored by 52 percent of voters polled who
said they intended to cast ballots in the primary, while 42 percent
favored Labastida. Other polls have had similar results.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians say Madrazo's lead in surveys is deceptive
because under the primary rules, the winner must attract a majority
of votes in the largest number of Mexico's 300 electoral districts,
rather than a simple majority of all votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's support is better-distributed across the entire
country. That nationwide backing reflects the almost universal
belief that Labastida is Zedillo's favorite, but the candidate
denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, I don't represent the current administration,''
Labastida said in an interview last week. But he has not criticized
Zedillo's record aggressively on any issue. ``I don't think you
should change things just to change them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the perception that he represents the establishment is
the all-star campaign team he has assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fix your tie,'' Labastida was admonished as he sat in his
office, smiling into a photographer's circling lens. The fashion
advice came from Alejandro Valenzuela, a senior official at
Mexico's central bank, who stepped down last month to work on the
Labastida campaign, joining a parade of other influential
officials.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Labastida seems an unlikely standard bearer because
after his term as governor of the western state of Sinaloa ended in
1992, his career declined. In the first days of the Zedillo
presidency, he occupied a second-tier post, director of roads and
bridges, joining the Cabinet only belatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts describe Labastida as a compromise candidate, the one
senior official whose cordial ties to Zedillo's technocrats and to
the populists whose current champion is Madrazo could prevent a
rupture in the party that would probably bring defeat next year.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a split, based in the simmering resentment felt by
grass-roots party members, has been clear since the conflict that
followed Madrazo's election as governor in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A leftist opposition party accused Madrazo of fraud, paralyzing
Tabasco with protests, and an independent investigation ordered by
Zedillo confirmed their charges. Zedillo responded by boycotting
Madrazo's inauguration and by pressing him to step down. Instead,
Madrazo's supporters took to the streets, beating leftist
protesters and threatening to declare Tabasco an independent
territory if Madrazo's governorship was not recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, distracted by an economic crisis, backed down, ending
the pressure on Madrazo and later traveling to Tabasco to embrace
him publicly. By dint of tenacious legal maneuvers, the governor
avoided sanctions for fraud or for spending 10 times the legal
campaign spending limit. Many of his mysterious donors have never
been identified.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges ties to some of the party's most autocratic,
even tainted, leaders. Last week he defended Mario Villanueva
Madrid, a former governor who is a fugitive wanted on drug charges.
And in an interview, Madrazo described as a ``great privilege'' his
30-year friendship with Carlos Hank Gonzalez, who became a
multimillionaire while serving as mayor of Mexico City and in other
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo insisted that his donors are middle-class and poor
Mexicans, but he is barnstorming Mexico in a Lear jet.
</P>
<P>
   His television campaign began in July 1998, and it ran on prime
time for the next nine months. The ads, which he contends were
intended only to promote his programs in Tabasco, were financed by
Tabasco's Legislature, which is controlled by his party. Madrazo
said they cost $6.2 million, all from public funds, but critics
have offered far higher estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The ads made his face and slogan an instant national phenomenon.
In a strange twist, the slogan was written by Carlos Alazraki, an
advertising consultant who devised Zedillo's own 1994 television
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As Madrazo paraded down cobblestone streets in the state of
Queretaro last week, followers opened their doors to greet him
shouting, ``Yes we can!''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, who is trim at 47, managed to look at once casual and
well groomed in a leather jacket and starched shirt as he addressed
a welcoming crowd of townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a policy that puts people, not economics, first!'' he
said, following up with promises of new subsidies for Mexicans who
resent U.S. competition under the North American Free Trade
Agreement. He has pledged to conduct a review of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   He slams Zedillo's policies, but not the president himself. Half
praising Zedillo and half defying him to keep his word, he said,
``I really don't believe the president has a favorite candidate.''

IN MAGAZINE INTERVIEW, HILLARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT PRESIDENT'S
AFFAIR
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   c. 1999

<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a new interview, says
she believed President Clinton's marital infidelities had been
``conquered'' a decade ago and, even though that was not true, she
views his affair with Monica Lewinsky as ``a sin of weakness''
rather than one of malice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enormous pain, enormous anger, but I have been
with him half my life, and he is a very, very good man,'' the first
lady said. ``We just have a deep connection that transcends
whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   She appears to blame her husband's sexual affairs on childhood
``abuse,'' but that seemed to be a reference to disputes between
his mother and grandmother rather than physical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's comments come in an interview in the inaugural
issue of Talk magazine to be published this week. The magazine
issued a press release with bits of the interview, and more
extensive excerpts appeared in the Sunday Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   The White House _ neither the president's press operation nor
the first lady's separate staff _ had immediate substantive comment
on the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The article will speak for itself,'' said Marsha Berry, the
first lady's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not answer a reporter's questions about the
interview as he attended church Sunday near the White House. The
first lady remained at the executive mansion.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, a former top Clinton adviser and now an
ABC News commentator, said on the network's This Week program that
the first lady's political advisers were ``a bit blindsided'' by
her comments, which came to public light late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The interview is likely to throw the president's extra-marital
affairs _ and especially the one with Lewinsky, which took place in
the White House _ into the center of the first lady's expected
campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's responsible for his own behavior whether I'm there or 100
miles away,'' Hillary Clinton said in the interview when asked if
their marriage could survive the strains of a campaign that will
separate the first couple geographically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the confrontation with the person, and then it's
their responsibility, whether it's gambling, drinking or whatever.
Nobody can do it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Talk article was written by Lucinda Franks, an author who
shared a Pulitzer Prize with Thomas Powers for national reporting
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   A Hillary Clinton staff member quoted in the article said the
first lady had ``barely spoken'' to the president for eight months
after the semen stain on one of Lewinsky's dresses was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Melanne Verveer, the first lady's chief of staff, said that as
the president had attempted to make up she had seen ``physical
passion'' come back into the couple's lives.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the interview appears to be the frankest that
either Clinton or his wife have given about what he has earlier
described as rocky patches in their almost 25-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos pointed out that it was interview of the type
that for months ``Ms. Clinton swore she would not give.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of surprise in the White House and even
among Hillary's top team,'' Stephanopoulos. He said a meeting of
the first lady's team was planned for later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The former presidential aide noted ``a pattern'' of expansive
interviews by Hillary Clinton. He said she had become comfortable
with an interviewer during the 1992 campaign and suggested that
then-President Bush also should be challenged about affairs _ an
insinuation she quickly withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady acknowledged her familiarity with extramarital
affairs by her husband and her belief that they ended as he began
to campaign for the White House in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be alert to it, vigilant in helping,'' Hillary
Clinton said. ``I thought this was resolved 10 years ago. I thought
he conquered it. I thought he understood it, but he didn't go deep
enough or work hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   She expressed certainty that there had been times in their
marriage when Clinton had not strayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we did have a very good stretch, years and years of
nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the possible causes of her husband's affairs and his
``abuse'' as a child, Hillary Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he has weaknesses. Yes, he needs to be more responsible,
more disciplined. But it is remarkable given his background that he
turned out to be the kind of person he is, capable of such
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so young, barely four, when he was scarred by abuse.
There was terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother. A
psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle of a
conflict between two women is the worst possible situation. There
is always a desire to please each one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpts, at least, the first lady did not detail the
incidents to which she referred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been working on himself very hard in the past year,''
she said. ``He has become more aware of his past and what was
causing his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in Christian theology there are sins of weakness and
sins of malice, and this was a sin of weakness,'' the first lady
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady referred to her own mother, Dorothy Rodham, as
being the child of a broken marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has some dysfunction in their families,'' she said.
``They have to deal with it. You don't walk away if you love
someone. You help the person.''
</P>
<P>
   When author Franks suggested the biblical analogy from
Corinthians, the first lady said: ``Love endures all things? No, I
love that, but I was thinking of when Peter betrayed Jesus three
times, and Jesus knew it but loved him anyway. Life is not a linear
progression. It has many paths and challenges, and we need to help
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said she and the president ``have love'' but
added: ``I don't believe in denying things. I believe in working
through it. Is he ashamed? Yes. Is he sorry? Yes. But does this
negate everything he has done as a husband, a father, a
president?''

LARGE RALLY PLANNED TO PRESSURE MILOSEVIC TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslavia's opposition plans to hold a
large rally in Belgrade on Aug. 19 to press President Slobodan
Milosevic to accept a transitional government and resign,
opposition officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, which will be announced on Monday, will be the first
called for the capital since a rather haphazard series of rallies
by competing opposition factions after the Kosovo war ended in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The rally will have the support of Patriarch Pavle, the head of
the Serbian Orthodox Church, who will attend, and it will take
place on the religious holiday of Preobrazenje, or the
Transfiguration.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition figures had been saying there would be no rally here
until at least September, when students return and it is easier to
turn out big numbers. But Washington has been pressing the
fractious opposition to unite and not to lose momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the rally, which may be accompanied by a warning strike by workers,
will be sponsored by the church and the organizers of a ``pact of
stability for Serbia.'' General support is expected from the
Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic and the Alliance for
Change, a grouping of opposition parties dominated by Zoran
Djindjic of the Democracy Party. The rally is also supported by
Momcilo Perisic, the former army chief-of-staff, who was fired by
Milosevic in November and who has come out in favor of the
president's resignation and is contemplating the formation of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to name a transitional Yugoslav and Serbian
government of experts to serve a year, in which they would renovate
ties with the West, liberalize the economy and prepare free and
fair elections with outside monitors. Milosevic would be asked or
pressed to resign, though Draskovic believes that he might be able
to remain as a figurehead until calling new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The prime mover of the stability pact is Mladjan Dinkic, a young
professor and economist. Dinkic is considered a leading candidate
for the post of Serbian prime minister in any transitional
government along with Dragoslav Avramovic, 79, the former central
banker who ended Yugoslavia's hyperinflation in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The post of Yugoslav prime minister is reserved under the
constitution for a Montenegrin, to be chosen by that sister
republic's president, Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the transitional government, should it come to
pass, are supposed to promise not to run in the elections in a
year's time.
</P>
<P>
   Other key figures behind Dinkic and the Stability Pact are
Slobodan Vucetic, a member of the Serbian Constitutional Court;
Ljubodrag Simovic of the Serbian Academy of Sciences; Dusan
Kovacevic a writer and playwright; and Predrag Markovic, a
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Important differences remain among the opposition, and Vladan
Batic, the coordinator of the Alliance for Change, has said
Dinkic's project does not have the full backing of his members and
that ``it's too early to talk about a firm deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic is said to think that a transitional government need
not have cabinet ministers, and the Alliance generally backs
Avramovic, who is old enough not to want to hang on to power even
if he agrees to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in a news conference, Avramovic said he would consider
taking the transitional post of Serbian prime minister if and when
Milosevic resigns.

DRUG MAKERS BLOCK DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' ACCESS TO GENERIC AIDS
DRUGS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.Africa)  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. pharmaceutical industry, with help from
the Clinton administration, is trying to protect its patents by
blocking developing countries ravaged by the AIDS epidemic from
producing generic versions of life-saving medicines that are now
too expensive for most AIDS victims outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies are especially alarmed at efforts
by South Africa to allow local companies to make generic versions
of patented AIDS drugs or to import the drugs from countries where
they are sold more cheaply. Each day an estimated 1,500 people in
South Africa are infected by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Through court battles in South Africa, the U.S. companies have
so far managed to block a two-year-old law that would reduce the
price of AIDS-fighting drugs by allowing them to be manufactured
locally or imported without the permission of patent holders.
</P>
<P>
   But if a court injunction blocking the law is lifted, South
African companies are reported to be ready to begin producing or
importing the generic drugs within months.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where the per capita income is only $500 a month,
many South African AIDS sufferers cannot afford even basic medical
care, let alone the new patented chemical cocktails known as
protease inhibitors that are prolonging the lives of many American
victims of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, those drugs can cost a single patient more
than $10,000 a year. The drugs are sold in South Africa at a
similar price.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug company executives regard the South African law as
patent infringement that undermines their industry's
multibillion-dollar research efforts and could hinder the
development of new AIDS-fighting medicines.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has not endorsed the industry's call
for a ban on the manufacture of generic versions of AIDS drugs that
are otherwise protected by patents, it has asked that South Africa
clarify exactly how it will protect the rights of patent-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade representative, citing the 1997 law among other
factors, has placed South Africa on a ``watch list'' of countries
that can face sanctions if they do not revise their trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tussle between the companies' patent rights and
the need for developing countries to try to control an epidemic
that is killing millions of people has political implications for
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Clinton administration, Gore has long been seen as a
champion in the fight against AIDS. But he has been heckled at
recent political appearances by activists who charge that he has
put the concerns of the pharmaceutical companies above those of
AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who has also been the administration's point
man on relations with South Africa, has intervened to try to work
out a compromise between the South African government and
pharmaceutical companies that would allow more of the drugs to
reach AIDS victims there while protecting patent rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many AIDS activists say it is wrong to criticize Gore for
seeking a solution that would satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But others question why the United States would want to expend
any energy intervening in South Africa _ or other largely
impoverished, AIDS-ravaged countries _ on behalf of the powerful
and highly profitable pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, like many of its neighbors on the continent, is
being devastated by AIDS. Nearly a quarter of all pregnant women
test positive for the HIV virus, which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the Clinton administration is doing is immoral,''
said Mark J. Heywood, director of the AIDS Law Project of South
Africa, which is based in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember the context in which the United States is
acting,'' he said in a telephone interview from South Africa.
``This is a nation of almost 4 million people with HIV, and most
people are dying without any access to even the most rudimentary
medical treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry insists that it is sensitive to the
health emergency in South Africa but that it must protect the
rights of its companies to profit from their research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an excuse to attack the intellectual property rights
of the pharmaceutical industry,'' said Thomas Bombelles of the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association in
Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bombelles questioned whether the South African government would
be capable of properly dispensing sophisticated AIDS drugs _ which
can do more harm than good when prescribed incorrectly _ if they
did become more widely available. ``The real problem in South
Africa is a health-care system that doesn't deliver health care to
a majority of the population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be a response to pressure from AIDS activists, some
drug companies have announced plans to discount their prices for
AIDS drugs in poor countries or, in some cases, to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In May, Bristol-Myers Squibb, which makes drugs that prevent the
HIV virus from replicating, announced that it would spend $100
million over the next five years in South Africa and four other
African countries on the development of community AIDS-control
projects and on AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Glaxo-Wellcome, manufacturer of the anti-HIV drug
AZT, announced that it would cut the drug's price in the developing
world by as much as 75 percent _ down to about $100 for a course of
treatments of the drug _ to prevent mother-to-child transmission of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosshirt, a spokesman for the vice president, said Gore
``never put pressure on South Africa and never threatened trade
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's goal, he said, has been to resolve a
dispute between pharmaceutical companies and the South African
government that, because of the court action, was blocking the
distribution of more medicine to AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the vice president expressly opposed a request by
drug-industry lobbyists to step up the pressure on South Africa by
imposing trade sanctions if they did not revoke or revise portions
of the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said in a letter in June to the Congressional Black Caucus,
``I support South Africa's effort to provide AIDS drugs at reduced
prices through compulsory licensing and parallel importing, so long
as they are carried out in a way that is consistent with
international agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Compulsory licensing is a legal term that refers to the right of
countries to allow the local manufacture of a patented product _ in
this case, drugs _without the permission of the patent holder.
Parallel importing refers to importing a patented product from
another part of the world where it is sold more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Under international trade agreements overseen by the World Trade
Organization, all countries can engage in ``compulsory licensing''
and ``parallel importing'' so long as certain conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions are looser in situations in which there is a
``national emergency,'' a description that might apply to South
Africa as it attempts to grapple with the AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government has not joined in the criticism of
Gore, who has close ties to the new president, Thabo Mbeki. A
spokesman for the South African Embassy in Washington, Vicky
Maharaj, said that Gore appeared eager ``to work constructively to
resolve this issue _ we're not aware of any pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry fears that if South African courts
ever lift the injunction that has so far blocked implementation of
the 1997 law, small South African drug companies will begin to
manufacture low-cost, generic versions of a range of patented drugs
useful against HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Other local companies are likely to begin importing the same
drugs from India and other nations where patent rights are not
enforced and where AIDS drugs made in India and other countries can
be bought for a fraction of the price they command in pharmacies in
the United States or South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a
Washington-based research group that is harshly critical of the
pharmaceutical industry, said the law should allow many AIDS
sufferers in South Africa to have access to a range of more basic
drugs that would otherwise be too expensive for them to buy,
including antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that despite the pharmaceutical industry's
position, generic drugs produced or imported under the 1997 law
would be prescribed and used properly in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While poor by Western standards, he said, ``South Africa
probably has the best infrastructure in Africa to deliver medical
care to its residents, but their ability to deliver that care is
dependent on the price they pay for drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 law was designed to revamp the pharmaceutical industry
in South Africa, where there is little competition among drug
companies and drug prices are notoriously high. AIDS sufferers
without health insurance are generally left to seek help at
overcrowded public hospitals, where many AIDS drugs are unavailable
because of their price or because of theft. Alternatively, they
seek aid from traditional healers.

 &HT;    Braves show big bats
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves general manager John Schuerholz had that giddy,
post-trade look about him on Sunday morning, like he was overjoyed
to finally hang up the phone, catch up on his rest and watch his
team go to work for the last two months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   His day only got better.
</P>
<P>
   If there was disappointment that Schuerholz hadn't addressed the
Braves' proverbial ``big bat'' void on Saturday night, the Braves
didn't show it Sunday. They played like they had plenty of good
wood in their lineup already, making the trade for pitcher Terry
Mulholland and utility infielder Jose Hernandez look just fine for
now, with a 12-4 victory against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Vying for the big-bat title on Sunday afternoon were Chipper
Jones, with two home runs to increase his season total to 27,
Gerald Williams, who had his third career grand slam to give the
Braves their first lead at 8-4 in the fourth inning, and Andruw
Jones, who chipped in with his 22nd homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have not lost a series to the Phillies in Atlanta
since 1995 and under the hottest of circumstances _ on the field
and in the standings _ they sent the Phillies packing with a 2-1
loss in this series. Combined with the Mets' 5-4 victory against
the Cubs, the Braves kept their NL East lead of a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the people to go out and score five, six runs a
game,'' Chipper Jones said. ``We can't rely on the front office to
give us help. If we hadn't traded anyone, this team would still
have been prepared to do whatever we had to to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves rose from the depths of an inauspicious start by Greg
Maddux, who allowed three hits and two runs before recording an
out. He spent the first inning frustrated with Larry Poncino`s
interpretation of the strike zone and his 4-0 deficit. But he
snapped back into form, retiring 20 of the last 23 batters he faced
to collect his 12th win.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he got mad, he started pitching better,'' catcher Eddie
Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux allowed four hits in the first but gave up just two hits
in his final six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to stay positive and realize it's a tough day to pitch
and you try to hang in there,'' Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies rookie Randy Wolf has some first-inning troubles of his
own, giving up two runs. It got worse in the fourth when he yielded
consecutive singles and then fielded a Maddux sacrifice bunt,
thought about throwing to third and bobbled the ball to load the
bases for Williams. A changeup to Williams later, his outing was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't beat the Braves,'' a frustrated Scott Rolen said.
``We're not going anywhere.''

ARIZONA WILL BE ON PAC-10 THRONE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Are you ready for some COLLEGE football?
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, one month before UCLA and USC open their seasons,
the Pac-10 football media day is held here at the Sheraton Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   If you are just dying to know who will emerge as the No. 1
choice in the media and coaches polls, I'll save you the suspense.
It will be Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry Trojans and Bruins fans, but all signs point to this being
the year of the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   They have both of their quarterbacks (Newbury Park's own Keith
Smith and Ortege Jenkins) back, plus their top running back (Trung
Canidate) and their top receiver (Dennis Northcutt). On defense,
their top six tacklers return.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Arizona returns 16 starters from last year's team that
went 12-1 and missed its first Rose Bowl when UCLA got blown away
in the Massacre at Miami. So the Wildcats settled for the Holiday
Bowl, where they beat Nebraska 23-20.
</P>
<P>
   __ For the curious, USC returns 15 starters, UCLA 14. The
Bruins, however, will be . . . handicapped . . . because of their
lack of an experienced quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend of Aug. 28-29 is shaping up to be a sofa spud's
dream.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, you've got the Pigskin Classic, featuring Arizona
against Penn State. On Sunday, it's Miami vs. Ohio State in the
Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   __ New L.A. definition for the NFL: No Financial Leverage.
</P>
<P>
   __ If you haven't seen ESPN magazine's cover, let me just say
this, as a bride, Ricky Williams makes an awfully good-looking
running back.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking ahead, way ahead, to 2004, if Barry Sanders stays
retired, Canton is scheduled for one of the best Hall of Fame
classes ever. The class will include John Elway, Reggie White and
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   __ Look-alikes: Richie Phillips, head of the major- league
umpires union, and the Michelin man.
</P>
<P>
   __ If you are keeping score at home, the New York Mets, who are
threatening to end the Atlanta Braves' reign in the NL East, are
being led by: a hot-hitting catcher who's a former Dodger (Mike
Piazza); a speedy center fielder who's a former Dodger (Roger
Cedeno), and a wily old pitcher, who just happens to be a former
Dodger (Orel Hershiser).
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but aren't those three of the Dodgers' most glaring
weaknesses this year?
</P>
<P>
   __ Coincidence or not? Friday's Philadelphia Phillies at Atlanta
Braves game was delayed by a power outage. That phrase _ power
outage _ has been used a lot lately around Turner Field after
catcher Javy Lopez joined first baseman Andres Galarraga on the
sidelines for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ We've seen the future of baseball jerseys and the future
looks tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, for some reason, thought ``Turn Ahead the Clock'' _
what uniforms would look like in 2021 _ would be a great promotion.
Unexplained black stripes, vertical lettering, oversized logos. Who
designed these things, Cyndi Lauper?
</P>
<P>
   The reason throwback promos work _ and this one doesn't _ is the
old jerseys are classically cool, much like a '67 Mustang or a '57
T-bird are cool. Turn ahead the clock, jerseys are as cool as a
Chrysler K car.
</P>
<P>
   They were so bad, it made the old Chicago White Sox unis from
the '70s _ remember the big collars, V-necks and shorts? _ seem
darn-right fashionable. Here's hoping this novelty doesn't catch
on.
</P>
<P>
   __ It should be noted eight teams _ the Yankees, Cubs, Toronto,
Texas, Montreal, Houston, Cincinnati and, thankfully, the Dodgers _
refused to participate in the Turn Ahead the Clock promotion.
</P>
<P>
   __ While we're talking fashion, what's up with all those Dodgers
caps in funky colors? I've seen UCLA-blue hats and black hats and
old Tampa Bay Buccaneers orange hats all emblazoned with LA on
them. THESE ARE NOT THE DODGERS COLORS. DODGERS HATS ARE BLUE.
</P>
<P>
   Got it?

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Shortly after taking office, President Ernesto
Zedillo sought to prove his credentials as a reformer by ousting a
brash young governor-elect, Roberto Madrazo Pintado, who was
accused of winning a Gulf Coast statehouse through blatant ballot
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrazo refused to go. Instead, he incited a virtual
insurrection in his state, Tabasco, forcing the president to
swallow hard and recognize Madrazo's governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Madrazo is seeking the governing party's
presidential nomination, and his candidacy is developing into a new
showdown with Zedillo. Madrazo has surged so rapidly in opinion
polls that the primary campaign, which began formally Sunday, has
already effectively boiled down to a two-man contest between him
and a former interior minister, who is Zedillo's preferred
candidate. In fact, polls show Madrazo in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's rise has given him a fighting chance of winning the
nomination and the presidency, a stunning development in a country
where 10 consecutive presidents from the same governing party have
hand-picked their successors.
</P>
<P>
   He has urged increases in social spending, even at the expense
of a balanced budget, policies that have alarmed some international
investors. That raises once again the prospect of financial turmoil
during the presidential succession in a country that is a neighbor
of the United States and one of its top trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Madrazo's strength has been particularly irritating to
the president because the candidate's recent speeches have been
piercing attacks on Zedillo's tight-money, export-oriented economic
policies, which are popular in business circles but not in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in total disagreement with a policy that has brought great
results for a few but few results for a great majority,'' Madrazo
said in one fiery speech recently that drew roars of approval from
a crowd of working-class party members.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when Zedillo renounced the tradition under which
Mexican presidents have picked the candidate of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, skeptics predicted that the
president's sympathies would help the interior minister, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, to win the nomination easily. But Madrazo's
surprising success means that Zedillo may soon have to choose
whether to honor his pledge to open up the nominating process or
reassert his powers to block a long-time nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has emerged as an all-out battle for the heart of the
PRI, and what's extraordinary is that the president's candidate
could be defeated,'' said Jesus Silva-Herzog Marquez, a law
professor with family ties to the party.
</P>
<P>
   The party was founded in 1929 in the ashes of the Mexican
revolution but has been dominated for two decades by Ivy
League-trained economists, including Zedillo, known here as
technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madrazo is the first governor in 60 years to defy the
president, survive, and come back to claim vengeance,'' said
Federico Estevez, a political science professor here. ``This is
terribly attractive to PRI members who believe the technocrats have
been scooting them around with a broom, making them the brunt of
whatever policies the president wants to impose.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo captured the mood in Mexico with a series of national
television ads he ran starting last year while he was governor of
Tabasco, before the governing party had even set the rules for its
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says we can't do it? Yes we can!'' runs the slogan of
Madrazo's ads. The jingle distills the conviction that Mexicans do
not lack for determination but have been kept down by bad
government.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has also stolen the president's thunder on electoral
reform, portraying himself as a maverick bent on opening up a party
dominated by presidential control. His father, Carlos Madrazo, was
an early advocate of internal party democracy. When he died in a
mysterious plane crash in 1969, he earned a permanent place in
party lore as a martyr to reform. His son Roberto portrays himself
as an heir to that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an ambiguous stance, since Madrazo's career is clouded
by charges of vote-rigging and recurrent questions about the origin
of his campaign funds. After his 1994 election, federal
investigators determined that he had spent $36.8 million on the
campaign in his state, 10 times the legal limit, most of it
recorded as anonymous cash donations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Labastida, a courtly gentleman who at 56 is nine years
older than Madrazo, has preferred to hint at his rival's checkered
ethical record but not to attack it head-on. In a ceremony Sunday
at party headquarters kicking off the primary campaign, Labastida
condemned those who accept ``shameful campaign funds,'' an obvious
swipe at Madrazo's use this year of state monies and anonymous
donations to fund his television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I arrive at this campaign with clean hands after a life of
public service that lets me hold my head high,'' Labastida said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's backers are even more direct. After one recent
Mexico City rally, Tabasco residents who support him crowded around
a reporter, asserting that Madrazo has ruled his tropical state
with a hard hand, repressing critics even within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Four politicians have been campaigning for the governing party's
nomination for months. But since May, party rules have prohibited
them from broadcasting television commercials. That ban ended
Sunday. The primary vote is scheduled for Nov. 7, and the
presidential balloting for July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey by the Indemerc Louis Harris polling firm
last week showed Madrazo favored by 52 percent of voters polled who
said they intended to cast ballots in the primary, while 42 percent
favored Labastida. Other polls have had similar results.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians say Madrazo's lead in surveys is deceptive
because under the primary rules, the winner must attract a majority
of votes in the largest number of Mexico's 300 electoral districts,
rather than a simple majority of all votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's support is better-distributed across the entire
country. That nationwide backing reflects the almost universal
belief that Labastida is Zedillo's favorite, but the candidate
denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, I don't represent the current administration,''
Labastida said in an interview last week. But he has not criticized
Zedillo's record aggressively on any issue. ``I don't think you
should change things just to change them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the perception that he represents the establishment is
the all-star campaign team he has assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fix your tie,'' Labastida was admonished as he sat in his
office, smiling into a photographer's circling lens. The fashion
advice came from Alejandro Valenzuela, a senior official at
Mexico's central bank, who stepped down last month to work on the
Labastida campaign, joining a parade of other influential
officials.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Labastida seems an unlikely standard bearer because
after his term as governor of the western state of Sinaloa ended in
1992, his career declined. In the first days of the Zedillo
presidency, he occupied a second-tier post, director of roads and
bridges, joining the Cabinet only belatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts describe Labastida as a compromise candidate, the one
senior official whose cordial ties to Zedillo's technocrats and to
the populists whose current champion is Madrazo could prevent a
rupture in the party that would probably bring defeat next year.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a split, based in the simmering resentment felt by
grass-roots party members, has been clear since the conflict that
followed Madrazo's election as governor in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A leftist opposition party accused Madrazo of fraud, paralyzing
Tabasco with protests, and an independent investigation ordered by
Zedillo confirmed their charges. Zedillo responded by boycotting
Madrazo's inauguration and by pressing him to step down. Instead,
Madrazo's supporters took to the streets, beating leftist
protesters and threatening to declare Tabasco an independent
territory if Madrazo's governorship was not recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, distracted by an economic crisis, backed down, ending
the pressure on Madrazo and later traveling to Tabasco to embrace
him publicly. By dint of tenacious legal maneuvers, the governor
avoided sanctions for fraud or for spending 10 times the legal
campaign spending limit. Many of his mysterious donors have never
been identified.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges ties to some of the party's most autocratic,
even tainted, leaders. Last week he defended Mario Villanueva
Madrid, a former governor who is a fugitive wanted on drug charges.
And in an interview, Madrazo described as a ``great privilege'' his
30-year friendship with Carlos Hank Gonzalez, who became a
multimillionaire while serving as mayor of Mexico City and in other
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo insisted that his donors are middle-class and poor
Mexicans, but he is barnstorming Mexico in a Lear jet.
</P>
<P>
   His television campaign began in July 1998, and it ran on prime
time for the next nine months. The ads, which he contends were
intended only to promote his programs in Tabasco, were financed by
Tabasco's Legislature, which is controlled by his party. Madrazo
said they cost $6.2 million, all from public funds, but critics
have offered far higher estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The ads made his face and slogan an instant national phenomenon.
In a strange twist, the slogan was written by Carlos Alazraki, an
advertising consultant who devised Zedillo's own 1994 television
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As Madrazo paraded down cobblestone streets in the state of
Queretaro last week, followers opened their doors to greet him
shouting, ``Yes we can!''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, who is trim at 47, managed to look at once casual and
well groomed in a leather jacket and starched shirt as he addressed
a welcoming crowd of townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a policy that puts people, not economics, first!'' he
said, following up with promises of new subsidies for Mexicans who
resent U.S. competition under the North American Free Trade
Agreement. He has pledged to conduct a review of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   He slams Zedillo's policies, but not the president himself. Half
praising Zedillo and half defying him to keep his word, he said,
``I really don't believe the president has a favorite candidate.''

COMMENTARY: VOODOO REDUX 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1980, Ronald Reagan assured one and all that he could
cut taxes sharply, increase defense spending substantially and
balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been a television commercial instead of real life we
would have seen a close-up of Reagan happily saying, ``I can do
that,'' followed by a shot of him, perplexed, asking, ``How am I
gonna do that?''
</P>
<P>
   George Herbert Walker Bush famously derided Reagan's supply-side
fantasies as ``voodoo economics.'' And the veteran Washington Post
reporter Lou Cannon, in his book ``President Reagan: The Role of a
Lifetime,'' described the reaction of James Baker, Reagan's own
chief-of-staff, to the transformation of economic fantasy into
national policy. He wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Though not particularly well-versed in economics, Baker
suspected that there was something screwy about the idea that
massive tax cuts would increase government revenues. Later, he
would privately express regrets that the deficits had `gotten away'
from the administration and wished he had paid more attention to
the consequences of the tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken many painful years to overcome the worst of those
consequences, with the bulk of the burden being borne as usual by
ordinary working Americans. But for the Republicans in Congress
it's as if those painful years never happened. Now, with the budget
finally balanced and the first sightings of an emerging surplus,
they think it's once again party time. And so the Republicans in
both the House and the Senate celebrated by passing tax cuts
totaling nearly $800 billion over 10 years _ tax cuts that
overwhelmingly favor the very wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   This is economic lunacy. If you put aside the Social Security
surplus, which is already spoken for, the available budget surplus
over the next 10 years is estimated by the Congressional Budget
Office to be just shy of $1 trillion. But that estimate is based on
the assumption that appropriations for such ``discretionary'' items
as the national defense, education, housing, air traffic control,
etc., will remain within the utterly unrealistic budget caps passed
by Congress in 1997. That will not happen. We can be absolutely
sure of this because the caps have already been blown.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been resorting to clownish gimmickry, like calling
the census an emergency, in order to evade the spending limits
imposed by the caps. And even as some routine items are being
called emergencies for budget purposes, the budget office's 10-year
forecast (on which the estimate of the trillion-dollar surplus is
based) does not take into account spending for real emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has pointed out,
``Hurricanes, tornados, floods and international emergencies will
not magically disappear'' over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   What really takes the proposed tax cuts into the zone of total
lunacy is that both Congress and the Clinton administration are
planning for more _ not less _ in the way of discretionary
spending, including substantially increased expenditures for
defense.
</P>
<P>
   There is no trillion-dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, Robert Greenstein, said two very conservative
assumptions should be made when considering the tax cut _ that
overall nonemergency spending will at the very least remain at
current levels, adjusted for inflation, and that emergency spending
will continue at the average rate of the past several years, which
is about $8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   If you make those assumptions, he said, the estimated surplus
over the next 10 years shrinks from about $1 trillion to a little
over $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Said Greenstein: ``How can you fit a $792-billion tax cut into a
surplus that's only in the $100-billion to $200-billion range? The
answer is, you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton says he will veto the tax cuts, which is a
good thing for working people, whether they are Democrats or
Republicans. If the Republicans in Congress were to get their way
the entire non-Social Security surplus would vanish and the United
States would be back on the insidious slide toward Reagan-style
budget deficits.

 &HT;    Wife of deadly Atlanta shootings buried
 &HT;    By Duane Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIZELLA, Ga. _ Leigh Ann Barton's family buried her Sunday with
little mention of the husband who killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being angry at Mark O. Barton, Pastor Doug Davis
asked the congregation of about 200 mourners in Lizella Baptist
Church not to give into the ``temptation'' of focusing on last
week's ``horrific event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 27 years of wonderful memories of her life and only a
few hours of shocking memories of her death,'' Davis said. ``Let us
remember and celebrate her life today and in the days to come, and
not allow her murder to forever cloud our memories.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was evidence the nation was still focused on Mark O.
Barton's shooting spree Thursday at two Buckhead office buildings,
where he left nine dead and 12 injured. He later shot himself in
the head in an Acworth, Ga. gas station.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 news reporters and photographers lined the roadside in
front of the red brick church southwest of Macon to capture images
of grief for a country that wants to know why. Why a man would kill
his 27-year-old wife and children, Matthew, 11 and Mychelle, 8 with
a hammer?
</P>
<P>
   Church members passed out bottles of spring water and cups of
ice water to sweat-drenched photographers listening to the service
over a loudspeaker outside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Leigh Ann Barton's white coffin lay draped with a
blanket of pink roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leigh Ann loved to take photographs,'' Davis said. ``As a
result, the family has many pictures of Matthew and Mychelle being
accepted and cared for by this large extended family. Indeed,
Matthew and Mychelle were just as much a part of this family as any
of the other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the hymns of ``I'll Fly Away ,'' and ``Amazing Grace''
Davis read a note by Leigh Ann's older sister, Dana Reeves, 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dearest honey,'' the letter began, using the family's
nickname for Leigh Ann Barton. ``I am so very sorry for what has
happened to you. I only wish I could have spared you from all of
this.
</P>
<P>
   After the service a half-dozen pallbearers carried Barton's
coffin past white columns and down a walkway to a waiting blue
hearse. Organ music played from the outside speaker as parishioners
filed out of the church, some sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   One friend among a group of Girl Scouts in uniform cried out
loud.
</P>
<P>
   The blue hearse transported Barton's body to Old Valley Grove
Primitive Baptist Church, about 110 miles south of Macon. The
family decided to bury Barton in a small cemetery next to the Irwin
County church's new social hall. Barton's mother lives in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends who made the trip mingled in front of the new
building before gathering around the burial tent to lay Barton to
rest. Nearby, expansive fields of green soybean and cotton plants
withered in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Davis' words back in Lizella lingered: ``God's love is
stronger than pain. God's love is stronger than death. God's love
is stronger than any sickness than a Mark Barton or anyone else can
dish out.''

   FDA-WATCHDOG (Seattle) _ After investing nearly two-thirds of
his life safeguarding foods and drugs for the American public,
Roger Lowell plans to bicycle across the nation, celebrate his
successes and perhaps forget about what still troubles him. ``We're
doing a good job protecting your health and safety but we're not
protecting your pocketbook anymore,'' Lowell said. A
straight-shooter equally respected within the agency as well as by
many in the industries he has regulated, the FDA's top local
watchdog retired from his post Friday.

   NEW YORK _ Growing up in Brooklyn in the 1950s, Felicia Vilardi
knew that she could count on her older brother, John, to look after
her. Their father had died when she was 4 and John 8, and, she
recalls, ``John was always my protector.''
</P>
<P>
   The kid sister is 50 now, Felicia LaBanca by marriage, a direct,
determined woman with strong features and intense brown eyes. On
Thursday morning at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, it was her
turn, not just to protect her brother, but to save his life. Side
by side in hospital beds, the two reached out to clasp hands and
say goodbye before being moved to adjacent operating rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take care of him,'' she told the nurse who wheeled Vilardi
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take care of her,'' he called to the one attending his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. LaBanca, a perfectly healthy woman, was about to let
surgeons cut away 60 percent of her liver _ its entire right lobe _
and transplant it into her brother, whose cancerous liver was to be
removed. Within a month or so, doctors expected, both the donor and
recipient pieces would grow back into full-sized organs, through
the liver's unique ability to regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   This daring procedure, the use of a living donor to provide a
liver transplant for an adult, has been performed fewer than 100
times in the United States over the past year and a half, at only a
few medical centers. It is a bold response to the shortage of
livers from cadavers, by desperate families and surgeons who say
they are frustrated by seeing patients deteriorate or die while
waiting for organs to become available.
</P>
<P>
   The living-donor procedure is catching on, and doctors say it
could rewrite the history of liver transplantation. It is letting
people bypass the transplant waiting lists and schedule surgery
when it is best for the patient, rather than when an organ becomes
available, by which time the patient might be in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes elective surgery,'' said Dr. Myron Schwartz, deputy
director of liver transplantation and one of the surgeons who
operated on Vilardi.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Lake, director of liver transplantation at the
University of Minnesota, said, ``It could eventually rival cadaver
transplants or maybe even outnumber them.'' Lake said that his
university, along with many other medical centers, including New
York University and the University of California at Los Angeles, is
planning to offer the procedure soon.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, surgeons at Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond, led by Dr. Amadeo Marcos, had performed 36 liver
transplants in adults from live donors, all using the right lobe of
the liver, the larger of its two sections. Donors have included
siblings, grown children, spouses, friends, and in one case a
46-year-old man who came forward to help a woman he had never met.
Doctors at Mount Sinai have done 16, including five using the right
lobe. Three were done last week alone. Other centers have done
fewer transplants. No deaths or major complications have been
reported among the donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'd ever use living donors if there was an
adequate supply of cadaveric organs,'' said Dr. Charles Miller,
director of liver transplantation at Mount Sinai, who operated on
Mrs. LaBanca. ``But there are just not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jean Emond, chief of the liver program at New York
Presbyterian Hospital, said: ``As recently as six months ago I
counseled a family that this was still very early and we were not
clear about the risks. But the demand for organs is higher than
average, and our patients in this region are really suffering. Now
I feel there is an ethical imperative to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As of July 28, 13,519 people in the United States were awaiting
liver transplants, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing. Last year, only 4,450 liver transplants were performed,
and in 1997, 1,129 people died while on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Many others deteriorate, making the transplant operation more
difficult and risky when it is finally done. People with cancer,
like Vilardi, may lose out altogether, because if the tumor grows
too large or spreads beyond the liver while they are waiting, it is
too late for a transplant. The shortage is expected to become worse
as more people like Vilardi, infected decades ago with hepatitis C,
develop liver failure or cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing use of living donors worries some doctors, who
fear that the donors, unable to say no to friends or relatives who
need a transplant, may be taking too much of a risk. Even though
donors are counseled to make sure that they are acting freely and
understand the risks, a doctor who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said: ``It's like holding a gun to the heads of
relatives. It's a brave and honorable thing to do, but this is a
major, major operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons say that the operation is technically difficult, harder
to perform than a liver transplant from a cadaver, largely because
blood vessels and bile ducts must be painstakingly divided between
the donor and the recipient, instead of all going to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons say they use extreme caution in these operations,
because there is nothing they dread more than the death of a
healthy person who volunteered for surgery just to help someone
else. But Emond and Schwartz said they expected that sooner or
later a donor would die, as the operation became more common and
was taken up by less experienced surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very complicated,'' Miller said. ``It's not something
everybody should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, American surgeons did not dare use living donors
for adult transplants, because it was considered too risky to
remove so much of the donor's liver. The liver is divided into
right and left lobes, with the right making up about 60 percent of
the organ, and many adults who need transplants would require the
bigger right lobe. Partial liver transplants were done only from
adults to children, because that procedure requires removing a much
smaller piece, a segment of the left lobe amounting to only 15
percent to 20 percent of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early to mid-1990s, surgeons in Japan and Hong Kong
showed that the right lobe could be removed safely for adults.
Donors need only match the recipient's blood type, and be healthy
and large enough to provide the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   With a living donor, the operation can be done while the patient
is still strong, with high odds of long-term survival. Surgeons say
the procedure may also provide healthier livers than those that
patients get from cadavers. One reason is that the organ is usually
transplanted quickly, soon after it is removed from the donor,
instead of being stored on ice for hours, the way cadaver organs
usually are. In addition, living donors are tested more extensively
than cadaver donors, and only the healthiest are selected.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vilardi learned only about a month ago that he needed a liver
transplant. He had undergone surgery in February 1998 for liver
cancer brought on by his hepatitis, and recently, tests showed that
the cancer had recurred. His surgeon, Schwartz, asked if he knew
anyone who would act as a donor.
</P>
<P>
   Practically everyone he knew offered, it seemed: his wife, his
son and daughter, Mrs. LaBanca and her husband and sons, cousins,
his 78-year-old mother, friends and even people he worked with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a nice feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vilardi is a big man, and some volunteers were ruled out because
they were too small. Others did not match his blood type,
A-positive. And he was troubled by the idea of using his children
or nephews, ages 19 to 26.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. LaBanca met all the requirements, and passed a battery of
tests to make sure she could withstand the operation. ``Take me,''
she kept saying. ``I didn't think twice,'' she said before the
surgery. ``It had to be done, so we're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two operations last Thursday were precisely timed to
minimize the risks, particularly to Mrs. LaBanca. Vilardi was taken
to the operating room first, at about 8:30 a.m., so that a surgical
team led by Dr. Patricia Sheiner and Schwartz could open his
abdomen and make sure that the cancer had not spread beyond his
liver, in which case a transplant would be pointless. That took
about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, when it was clear that the transplant could take
place, was Mrs. LaBanca taken to the operating room adjoining her
brother's, and the process of removing part of her liver begun by a
second surgical team, led by Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But it would take several hours to free the organ, and meanwhile
Vilardi would be kept stable, under anesthesia, until it was time
for surgeons to begin removing his liver.
</P>
<P>
   Vilardi's liver came out at 3 p.m., and the right lobe of his
sister's about two minutes later. The organs looked strikingly
different: hers was smooth, gleaming and supple, like a picture in
a textbook, but his appeared hard and shrunken, with a pebbly,
nodular texture, the hallmark of scarring from hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons quickly rinsed Mrs. LaBanca's liver to clear out blood
clots, took a tiny plug of it for testing and recorded its weight,
830 grams (1.8 pounds). A nurse from Vilardi's operating room
bustled in, demanding to know what was taking them so long.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Dr. Sheiner and her team were starting to
sew the liver into Vilardi, and Miller's team was making sure that
Mrs. LaBanca had no leaky blood vessels or bile ducts, in
preparation for closing her incision.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., Mrs. LaBanca's abdomen was stapled shut, the incision
the shape of a large, inverted letter Y that surgeons call the
Mercedes, after the automobile logo. By 4:15 p.m., as anesthesia
was withdrawn, she was beginning to stir, to move her head and arms
and squeeze the doctors' fingers when they asked her to. The team
agreed it was the fastest and smoothest living donor procedure they
had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia, the surgery's over,'' a nurse said. ``You're doing
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How's my brother?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Dr. Sheiner had connected the blood vessels of Mrs.
LaBanca's liver to Vilardi's vessels, and the organ had begun to
function immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pouring out bile,'' Dr. Sheiner said delightedly.
</P>
<P>
   Bile ducts remained to be connected, and Vilardi would not leave
the operating room until 8 p.m., but shortly after 5 p.m. the lead
surgeons took a break to talk to the family, some of whom had been
at the hospital since 6 a.m. The relatives sprang from their seats,
hugged each other, laughed and cried and wiped away tears at the
good news.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Danile, Vilardi's and Mrs. LaBanca's mother, had turned
pale and withdrawn during the hours that both her children were in
surgery, but now she pumped the doctors' hands, thanking them
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz warned the family that although Vilardi's operation had
gone well, transplant recipients often had complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect transplant doesn't guarantee a perfect result,'' he
said. But the team would deal with any complications. ``Don't even
worry about it,'' he said. ``There's a great chance he'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday morning, Vilardi was feeling well enough to visit
his sister, who was expected to go home in two or three days. A
nurse wheeled him to her room, but outside the door he insisted on
getting out of the wheelchair so that Mrs. LaBanca would see him
walk into her room. He told her he loved her and presented her with
an onion _ to go with her liver. She was still laughing when the
nurses insisted on taking him back to his room to rest.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amit Sinai, 18, plopped down on her spot at Jones
Beach after a quick dip in the ocean, and before the sea water on
her face had a chance to dry she reached for her cellular phone and
started dialing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, it's me,'' she cooed into the palm-sized phone. ``I'm on
the beach. Where are you?''
</P>
<P>
   She prattled on with a friend while she soaked up the sun and
occasionally gestured toward her beach companion, Julie Papi, 19,
who sat nearby thumbing through a magazine. Ms. Sinai, a sophomore
at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, has had her own cell phone
for about a year, and Ms. Papi got hers when she was 16. Neither of
them can imagine life without one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need it to get in touch with my friends,'' Ms. Sinai said a
little incredulously when asked why she and her cell phone were so
inseparable. `` &UR; Everyone &LR;  has a phone.''
</P>
<P>
   While industry experts say specific numbers are not available,
they say there is no doubt that a growing number of teen-agers
across the country have acquired cell phones in the last year or
so. The trend was sparked by the recent drop in wireless phone
service costs, with service charges now averaging about $40 a month
and some plans offering youth-oriented bonuses like free phones or
free service on nights and weekends _ prime teen-age gabbing time.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Group, a Boston-based consulting firm that follows
global wireless trends, found in its annual nationwide survey of
cell phone users this year that 20 percent of them believed it was
important for children to have cell phones, and 8.5 percent had
already provided wireless phones to children under 18. It also
found that parents paid for the phone service 72 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless phone costs are 50 percent less than they were four
years ago, so it's become a lot more affordable,'' said Mark
Lowenstein, of the Yankee Group. ``Because of that, carriers have
become more focused in their marketing campaigns, and they've
definitely identified teens as a segment worth targeting.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Sprint PCS hired 100 teen-agers to pitch cell
phones to their peers in the New York area at malls, parks, pools,
concerts _ anywhere teen-agers hang out.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that teen-agers, both urban and suburban, see toting
a cell phone as cool. Many teen-agers have adopted cell phones as
their accessory of choice and got rid of their pagers _ that other
technological appendage that has become as much a teen-age fashion
statement as wide-legged jeans and platform sneakers. But others
have hung on to their pagers and merely added a cell phone as part
of their wireless arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Parents often buy cell phones for their children so they can
call for help. Cell phone providers said many parents took note
that when gunfire broke out at Columbine High School in Colorado in
April, some students called 911 on their cell phones. But parents
also provide the phones so they can keep tabs on their teen-agers
when they go out with their friends. While teen-agers could always
ignore a parent's page and claim they were nowhere near a pay
phone, parents can usually reach children directly on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a cell phone is a lot less free than having a pager,''
said Nahil Dhanji, an 18-year-old resident of Woodside, N.Y., and a
recent graduate of Townsend Harris High School. ``You can't get
away when you want to be alone, and you can't just turn it off
because then your parents get all worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry studies show that the vast majority of teen-agers who
carry cell phones talk to their parents on their phones daily.
Still, most teen-agers primarily use the phones as a lifeline to
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Papi, of East Meadow, N.Y., on Long Island, said her father
first got her a phone when she started driving to make sure she
would never be stranded. But she now uses the phone about 20 times
a day and screens calls with the caller ID function. ``If I see
it's a call from my house, I don't pick it up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a traditional ring, her phone _ a sleek Nokia in
iridescent purple _ trills the first few notes of the William Tell
Overture, but she said she frequently has to shift to another one
of the 30 tunes the phone offers. ``All teen-agers have the same
phone,'' she said with wide-eyed hyperbole. ``So if I'm at the mall
or I'm in a room with someone who has the same ring, I have to
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Latoria Gurley, a 15-year-old from New York City who plans to
buy her own phone next month with savings from a summer job as a
day camp counselor, said she would rather have a cell phone than
her own line at home. ``Because then I could be outside with my
phone showing it off to everybody,'' she said while waiting for a
midnight movie. ``I'd be on the phone all night, every night. Me
and my friends, we never get bored on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As more and more teen-agers clutch personal cell phones, the
nature of the time-honored teen-age pastime of aimlessly hanging
out has become more fluid. Instead of arranging to meet her friends
at a regular place and time, Phoebe Vickers, a 17-year-old from New
York City, said: ``I just tell them, call me. This way I don't have
to make specific plans, and I don't have to stick to them. It makes
it easier to find my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   While many teen-agers keep track of new cell phone colors and
styles the way car fanatics follow the new makes and models, there
seems to be a healthy contingent of teen-agers who use them
sparingly and pragmatically, and still others who detest cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Lawson, a freshman at Nassau Community College who met
some friends in Manhattan last week, said she tried to keep her
usage down to the 200 minutes that come with her $40 monthly plan.
She happily accepted the free phone that came with the plan and is
completely uninterested in fancy phone trends. ``It's not a tattoo,
it's a phone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But her friend, Julia Lucas, who was visiting from Philadelphia,
said she was vehemently opposed to cell phones. ``Cell phones are a
status thing, and it's not necessary,'' said Ms. Lucas, 17. ``Call
me prehistoric, but I can use pay phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vickers, a senior at the United Nations International
School, estimated that about 25 percent of her schoolmates had cell
phones. She said she made and received about 45 calls a day on
hers. She keeps it with her whenever she leaves the house, she said
as she fished it out of a shopping bag one recent day, and it has
been known to go off during class. ``Then I have to scramble for my
bag to shut it off,'' she said. ``Some teachers don't mind, but
some are really strict about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools across the region, including the New York City public
schools, have banned pagers and cell phones. A 1996 New Jersey law
bans pagers in schools, and many schools apply that to cell phones
too.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington Irving High School, a public school in New York
City, school officials routinely confiscate about 120 beepers a
year, but last year _ for the first time _ four or five cell phones
appeared in the pile of banned electronic items.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is going to grow because it's booming,'' said Bob
Durkin, the school's principal. ``Pretty soon they're all going to
have them. Technology will win, as it always does, and we'll adjust
and set up new social norms and go from there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Great Neck Public Schools on Long Island said that
pagers and cell phones were prohibited and that students caught
with either were subject to disciplinary action. But students at
Great Neck South High School said that cell phone use at the school
was rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Tomaselli, who graduated from Great Neck South last
spring, said she got her phone when she was 14 and uses it mainly
when she goes out at night. But she said students walking the
school's halls routinely talk to friends who are just on the other
side of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just silly,'' she said last week while hanging
out with friends at the Starbucks in downtown Great Neck. ``Plus,
my mom would kill me if I used it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Sarroff, a junior at Great Neck South who neither has nor
wants a wireless phone, said she thought cell phone mania was out
of control. ``People are very disrespectful with them _ they go off
in class, in the theater, in synagogue,'' she said. ``People have
no limit; it's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as prices have fallen, phones have also become
much smaller and lighter. Teen-agers seem to favor the tiny flip
phones that easily slip into a shirt pocket and the growing number
of brightly colored phones and phones with interchangeable covers.
Entrepreneurs have expanded the fashion value of cell phones by
selling customized covers with designs that range from an American
flag and a $100 bill with Benjamin Franklin's portrait to youth
icons like Michael Jordan and Hello Kitty.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in wireless phone service also offers many calling
options that teen-agers crave. ``I get more stuff on my cell phone
than my phone at home,'' said Kassy Ray, a 17-year-old from the
Riverdale section of the Bronx. Her companions at Jones Beach
nodded in agreement as she rattled off items like caller ID, call
waiting, caller ID for call waiting and conference calling.
</P>
<P>
   When cell phones first became readily available in the 1980s,
the primary market was business people, and the average bill was
about $100 a month. The number of cell phone subscribers grew from
about 92,000 in 1985 to 69 million at the end of 1998, when the
average monthly bill dropped just below $40.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wheeler, the president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, said that the $40 monthly bill was something
of a tipping point for the industry. He said that statistics show
that the growth of a new media technology usually does not take off
until its cost falls below 2 percent of average weekly income. ``It
was true for VCRs and color televisions,'' he said. ``And that
number for us happens to be $40 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone service became much more competitive after 1996, when
digital phone service was introduced as an alternative to the
traditional analog wireless service. The number of wireless phone
carriers in the New York area, for example, increased from two to
six, and competition drove phone and service prices down.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, who lives in the Washington area, said that he got a
cell phone for his teen-age daughter in 1993, even before the price
drop. ``I told her she could call me any time and place and I would
come get her, no questions asked,'' he said. ``And it gave me a
terrific sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the only time she used it for that purpose was when her
school volleyball team's bus broke down one night. ``She was the
only one who had a phone,'' he said. ``But that was six years ago.
Now it would be, `Here, let me use my phone,' or, `My phone's color
is better, and it matches the school uniform.'''

KEN BURNS TURNS HIS DOCUMENTARY SKILLS TO TWO NOTABLE WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eat your veggies! That was the unmistakable tone of a PBS
luncheon featuring turnips, squash, beets and Ken Burns' latest
historical documentary, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of
Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP; Susan B. Anthony.''
</P>
<P>
   With the finger-wagging zeal of a televangelist, Burns told TV
critics Saturday that Stanton and Anthony, pioneers of the women's
movement, are the two most important females in the American
experience, but most Americans know nothing about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are responsible for the largest social transformation in
American history,'' Burns said. ``I am outraged that this history
has been hidden from us, has been so long neglected. Not just on
our television screens, but in our history books.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns and co-producer Paul Barnes hope to rectify that Nov. 7
and 8 with their two-part documentary, the fourth in a five-part
series that has already profiled Thomas Jefferson, Lewis and Clark
and Frank Lloyd Wright. The fifth will be about Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the Stanton/Anthony saga, rife with drama and
inspirational commitment to a cause, should be one of ``the
hallelujah stories'' taught in classrooms around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't, Burns said, simply because ``men have written the
histories.''
</P>
<P>
   _Burns' brother Ric, probably best known for his 1992
documentary, ``The Donner Party,'' is on PBS' fall schedule with
``New York: A Documentary Film.'' Ten hours of the 12-hour project
will air Nov. 14-18, ending with the construction of the Empire
State Building. The final installment, to air sometime next spring,
will look at New York in the first year of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York's been kind of inventing the future for itself and
America for about 200 years now,'' Ric Burns said, ``and the space
that we've created for ourselves next year is to finish the story,
bring it down to the present and begin to look, at least
symbolically, at what the future is.''
</P>
<P>
   _Dick Wolf, producer of ``Law &AMP; Order'' and its new spinoff
series, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' is upset. He says
the new series, a police drama focusing on the aftermath of
particularly heinous sex crimes, is a 10 o'clock show, but NBC has
it penciled in on Mondays at 9, which is 8 p.m. for folks in the
Central time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Like its sire, ``Special Victims Unit'' is not violent. The
crime has already been committed when the show begins. Wolf said it
deals with the effect of violence on the victims, the families and
the investigators. Still, he says it's ``a mature show with mature
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The network knows how I feel about this'' said Wolf, who is
annoyed that the Monday edition of ``Dateline NBC'' has the 10 p.m.
slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have used every argument at my disposal ... and I'm very
surprised that the show has not been moved. I don't think it makes
a damn bit of difference where `Dateline' is. It's on five times a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Ally McBeal'' has spawned much imitation in the
dramatic-comedy genre. One new entry is NBC's ``Cold Feet,'' about
three couples at different stages of the commitment tango. Based on
a British comedy, it has had a rocky development. Last year, the
plan was to give it a more serious tone, with characters living in
New York. This year's recast pilot episode was more upbeat and set
in Portland. After one more cast change, the producers say it will
now be set in Seattle (and shot in Vancouver, B.C.).
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, really. One of the producers is John J. Sakmar, who
had a hand in the short-lived ``Medicine Ball'' and ``Mr. &AMP; Mrs.
Smith,'' both of which had Seattle settings. Sakmar hopes to do
some shooting in Seattle, and he'd like nothing better than to have
a couple's relationship take a turn for the worse as the Kingdome
implodes in the background.

GERMAN COURTS FAVOR GERMAN PARENTS IN CROSS-BORDER CUSTODY CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Didier Supersac and his German wife separated in 1993,
with an agreement that left the children in Supersac's custody in
France. With its legal protection, he thought, he sent their
4-year-old son, Maxime, and their 7-year-old daughter, Jeannette,
off to Augsburg to visit their mother in Germany that summer, and
then went off himself on a short vacation trip to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   When Supersac got back home, near Nantes, he found a letter in
the mailbox from a German court, curtly informing him that his wife
had charged him with mistreatment of the children and decided to
keep them with her.
</P>
<P>
   What followed, he says, has been a nightmare, with courts in
both Germany and France squabbling over jurisdiction and making
decisions that, in effect, allowed his former wife to kidnap their
daughter, now 13 1/2 years old, permanently to Germany after the
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk _ especially in Germany, Europe's biggest power
_ of a new Europe in which borders and even cultural divisions are
increasingly irrelevant, German courts often seem to side with the
German parent in contested cases of child custody, says Supersac
and others in situations like his.
</P>
<P>
   Even protests from President Jacques Chirac to the Germans, and
the considerable publicity generated by a Frenchwoman who is now
the wife of Britain's ambassador to Washington and has been unable
to see her half-German sons for five years, have failed to sway
German judges unwilling to order actions they considered to be not
in the children's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Supersac eventually took his son home to France, in 1994, after
a German judge interviewed him and awarded him custody of both of
his children, he said. The court gave him permission to take his
daughter then, too. ``But when we went to school to pick her up,
she wasn't there,'' he said. ``For three years, every attempt I
made to find her ended in failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The German court didn't even have the ability to enforce its
own decision,'' Supersac added. Other people in situations like his
say that German courts seem afraid of traumatizing children by
enforcing rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he got a decision by the highest court in France
confirming the children's right to spend time with both their
parents. But Jeannette's mother did not send the girl to visit
Supersac last summer, so he did not send Maxime to visit his mother
in Augsburg, either. ``I can't take the risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French-German reconciliation over the past half century has
brought many benefits to the 138 million people of the two closest
countries in Europe, including the right to enter into
transnational French-German marriages that were all but unthinkable
until half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   But international law has loopholes big enough to lose a child
in if the courts in one country insist that only that country's
legal standards and procedures can apply in child custody disputes
where one parent resorts to abduction.
</P>
<P>
   And Germany's reputation for siding with the German parent in
cases like this was so bad in France until recently that, of about
100 child-abduction cases involving Germany and known to legal and
French government authorities, not a single one had ended in the
return of the kidnapped child.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Chirac raised the issue with the German
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, angrily refusing to accept ``the law
of the jungle'' after Germany's highest court stayed a lower court
ruling ordering the return of a 3-year-old girl and her 7-year-old
brother to Cosette Lancelin, their mother in France.
</P>
<P>
   Their German father, Armin Tiemann, had hired five baby
snatchers, who used three cars to force Mrs. Lancelin off a French
back-country road on March 28, 1998, not far from the town where
Marshal Petain met Hitler in 1940 and was forced to pledge
collaboration. The Germans plucked the children out of Mrs.
Lancelin's car and whisked them off to the small north German town
of Kirchdorf where Tiemann is mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But things changed for Mrs. Lancelin this spring when the German
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe rejected Tiemann's appeal of the
lower court ruling, which had awarded Mrs. Lancelin custody of the
children because she was 20 years younger than her husband and had
been at home with the children full time. They have been with her
in France since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the impression that Tiemann accepts their being in
France,'' Mrs. Lancelin's lawyer, Michel Gendre, said in an
interview. ``But he is supposed to have the children visit him
again for three weeks this summer. We can only hope he will bring
them back.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the German court ruling in the Lancelin case has not
helped another prominent plaintiff in a painful child custody
battle in Germany, Catherine Meyer. Lady Catherine, a French
citizen who is now married to the British ambassador to the United
States, Sir Christopher Meyer, last saw her two sons, Alexander and
Constantin, in 1994 when she sent them off for a summer visit in
Verden, in northern Germany, with their father, Hans-Peter
Volkmann. He is now a doctor there; at the time, their mother was
working and living with the boys in London.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning the boys to London at the end of the
summer, as called for in the separation agreement, their father
kept them in Germany and applied to take custody away from their
mother. His action came as a complete surprise to his former wife,
who flew to Germany, fought to keep custody, and at first thought
she had won.
</P>
<P>
   The court in Volkmann's hometown in Verden turned him down, and,
with their mother in the courtroom, ordered him to turn the boys
over to her on the spot. Instead, he disappeared with them and
applied to a higher court, in Celle, for a stay in execution of the
order.
</P>
<P>
   As Lady Catherine recounts her story in her book ``They Are My
Children, Too,'' published this year by Public Affairs in New York,
the Celle court later awarded custody of the children to Volkmann.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Germany, like France, the United States and 52 other countries,
is party to an international agreement against international
parental child abduction called the Hague Convention, which
requires custody disputes to be settled in the country where the
children habitually live, and in this case that was Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But the Celle court ruled that they should stay in Germany with
Volkmann, partly because the boys themselves, then 9 and 7 years
old, had said that was what they wanted and that, as a German
child, Alexander had felt that Britain was ``an alien
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although my sons were trinational and trilingual, to the Celle
judges they were not French, not English, not European; they were
solely German _ and this overrode everything else,'' Lady Catherine
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She has not even been able to get visiting rights to see her
children since. ``The only thing I'm asking now is the right to
have my children visit on holidays,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Washington. Alexander is now 14 and Constantin is
12.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Catherine's book has not been published in Germany, where
Volkmann's lawyers have taken German newspapers that have written
about the case to court and made at least one television program,
the ZDF network's women's journal ``Mona Lisa,'' decide not to
pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   Volkmann could not be reached, but one of his lawyers, Manfred
Engelschall, said in a telephone interview from Hamburg, ``It's not
a sensational case. It's a perfectly normal one that Lady Catherine
happened to lose, that's all, and Volkmann will have nothing to say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rinaman, an American lawyer who said his 4-year-old
daughter was abducted by his wife to Germany before she got a
divorce there, said that he had concluded that German courts
considered Teutonic blood thicker than international law. ``I have
a visitation order but the courts won't enforce it,'' he said.
``They say they won't do it for the good of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Setright, a British lawyer with wide experience in
international parental child-abduction cases, said the underlying
problem was German judges' inexperience with the Hague Convention.
``There's undoubtedly a lack of consistency worldwide in enforcing
the Hague Convention,'' he said in an interview in his chambers in
Lincoln's Inn law courts recently. In Germany, he said, there are
hundreds of judges ``who have no special Hague Convention
experience at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, where courts and legal systems are split up into 15
separate state jurisdictions, is now changing its family court
decision-making on Hague Convention cases. Soon only 52 superior
courts, instead of 252 family courts, will be empowered to hear
them, German officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Setright and other lawyers say that fewer German judges with
greater familiarity with the accord might be less likely to turn
parental abduction cases into child welfare cases, because of the
Hague Convention's loophole for cases where returning a kidnapped
child to the previous home might carry a ``grave risk'' of
``physical or psychological harm.''

 &HT;    Funerals for last week's shooting victims continue
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett and Anne Cowles
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A mother of two. A father of three.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Hindu. A leader in the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   A housewife looking for extra income while her kids were in
college. A grocery store owner whose employees thought of him as
family.
</P>
<P>
   They may never have even met, but Vadewattee Muralidhara and
Allen Tenenbaum met the same terrible fate Thursday in a gunman's
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   For the loved ones of Muralidhara and Tenenbaum, Sunday was a
day for saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 mourners attended a service for Muralidhara at the
Carmichael-Hemperley Funeral Home in Peachtree City, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Her body will be taken to Trinidad Wednesday, with cremation on
Thursday, said Dolford Payne, a friend. According to the Hindu
religion, her soul will be released from her body and remain with
the family for 12 days of mourning. On the 13th day, the soul goes
to its place in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of this whole thing is that one of the reasons they
left Trinidad is the crime and the violence,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Muralidhara, 44, had recently returned from a pilgrimage to
India. The devout Hindu had returned with an inner peace, Payne
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave of herself without expecting anything in return,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Congregation Or VeShalom in Atlanta, light streamed through
the stained glass windows and onto the sweet, sad faces of
Tenenbaum's daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Megan, 11, and Brittany, 13, stood at the pulpit, just in front
of the chair their father sat in during services, and together read
Psalm 30 before the crowd of 600 who gathered for Tenenbaum's
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Then Megan read a poem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is my shield, my protector and my knight in shining
armor,'' she said. ``When in doubt, ask Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum's widow, Debra, sat in the front row surrounded by
family. She gave each of her girls a kiss on the cheek after their
reading, and the three sat close throughout the service, comforting
one another.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral for Tenenbaum, 48, was Friday. He had served as
president of the synagogue, and several of his friends and
relatives shared their memories during the Sunday service. Some
were lighthearted, like the time he stayed to the end of an Atlanta
Braves game even when the team was down by a very wide margin. Many
more were bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved him as a son,'' said Stan Fox, Tenenbaum's
father-in-law. ``We all have broken hearts. But with faith in God
and inspiration from Allen, we will mend those hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Handmacher Chanin saw Debra Tenenbaum Thursday morning, and
Chanin extended her sympathy for the recent death of Frances
Gaynes, who was Debra Tenenbaum's sister-in-law. Debra Tenenbaum
told Chanin it was the first close relative the children had lost.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. that night, as Chanin, her husband and children were
watching the movie ``Pleasantville,'' the phone rang. The bearer of
the bad news, she said, was Scott Galanti, whose family is related
by marriage to the Tenenbaums, and has endured similar loss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, cousins Morris Galanti and Isaac Galanti were shot to
death in separate crimes. Morris Galanti was killed during a
robbery at his grocery store. Isaac Galanti was killed during an
ambush while looking at some real estate. He also owned a grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   Chanin said Allen Tenenbaum's uncle was married to the sister of
Isaac Galanti. Allen Tenenbaum looked up to Isaac Galanti, learning
from him both the grocery business and sensitivity, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Capouya, president of the Or VeShalom Sisterhood, spoke
during Allen Tenenbaum's memorial. Sunday morning, while she was
gathering roses from her garden, she was still contemplating why
God would take a man in the prime of his life. Then, looking at the
bouquet she had arranged, she realized she had left the rose buds
that were not yet opened. She had also left the roses that had
begun to wilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that God must be a gardener too, for he will always
have Allen in full bloom,'' she said.

 &HT;    Henry county residents mourn two children
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jerry Martin, director of Scouting for The Rock
Baptist Church in Rex, Ga.,
</P>
<P>
   wept at the pulpit Sunday as he remembered Matthew Barton, 11, a
tenderfoot in the church-sponsored Troop 297.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scouting is like a family,'' Martin said. ''When you lose one,
it's like losing one of your own children.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said some members of the troop will attend Matthew's
funeral in their Scout uniforms today and will perform a flag
ceremony. He said counselors will attend Tuesday night's regular
Scout meeting at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll meet together, cry together, seek God's help in getting
through this,'' Martin said in an interview after the church
service. ''We'll try to explain that it's an isolated incident.
It's not something that should bring fear to the rest of their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bartons were not members of the church, but Matthew joined
the Scout troop earlier this year after graduating from a Cub Scout
pack, Martin said. Matt quickly earned tenderfoot rank. He attended
camp with the troop and earned several merit badges, which were
presented at a recent ceremony, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was a member of the troop committee, which was open to
all parents of Scouts, but he did not take a leadership role in the
troop, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a John Doe parent,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin spoke to the church congregation at the end of the Sunday
service. The minister, Ronny Spillers, touched on the killings
during his sermon. He said members of the congregation should start
reaching out and really communicate with other people, not just
wave and say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pray something good and redemptive will happen because of
this tragedy,'' Spillers said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bristol Green apartments on Rock Quarry Road in
Stockbridge, where Mark Barton's wife, son and daughter were found
dead Thursday, things seemed to be getting back to normal. Gone
were the television trucks and swarms of reporters and
investigators. One Henry County police car was parked outside the
apartment complex office early in the afternoon. The yellow crime
scene tape was removed from the entrance to the Bartons'
second-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Piled in front of the apartment door were half a dozen flowers,
mostly single roses wrapped in plastic. One note said: ''May you
rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   One resident of a nearby building, Brian Guild, said the
killings had changed him, though he didn't know any of the Bartons
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't trust anybody now,'' Guild said. ''You cannot trust
your neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Leng Tep, part owner of a convenience store near the entrance to
the apartment complex, said his business slowed down on Sunday,
mainly because the reporters had gone home. Television crews from
as far away as Germany and Japan had shopped at his store in the
last few days. Some even parked their trucks in the lot and slept
there overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's more like before,'' Tep said.
</P>
<P>
   Down Rock Quarry Road, Manoj Pendit ran the cash register behind
the counter at the Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   He said a wave of fear swept over his customers on Thursday as
soon as they heard about the killings. Customers started getting
change to use the pay phones. They called home to check on their
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the most unsettling thing, Pendit said, was hearing children
in the convenience store talk to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of he kids were asking, 'If something happens to Daddy,
will he do that to me?' '' Pendit said, shaking his head. ''My own
daughter asked me the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pendit said he told his 9-year-old daughter that she was safe.

   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Brent Geiberger's claim to fame has always
been his father, Al, the first player to break 60 in a PGA
tournament when he shot 59 at the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shoot 59 every time I go out and play,'' said the
31-year-old Brent, whose best finishes in three years on the PGA
Tour before this weekend were a pair of second places. ``But I
always have at least a couple of holes to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch Geiberger, whose smooth swing and lean build
make him resemble his father, established a mark of his own Sunday
at the Canon Greater Hartford Open, shooting a three-under-par 67
at the TPC at River Highlands to finish at 262, for 18 under par
and a tournament record. He finished three strokes ahead of Skip
Kendall for his first victory as a professional and shattered the
previous low of 266 recorded last year by Olin Browne, Stewart Cink
and Larry Mize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to calling my father,'' said Geiberger,
who started to play golf at the age of 5. ``He gave me some good
advice on the phone yesterday when he told me to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Geiberger, who finished at five-under 211 Sunday in the
Senior Tour's Novell Utah Showdown, learned of Brent's victory as
he stood at the seventh tee. ``I went down the fairway feeling like
I had won the tournament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Geiberger started the day with a three-stroke lead after
rounds of 66-63-66, and he increased the lead to as many as seven
strokes. But a double-bogey at the par-4 17th and a bogey at No. 18
reduced his margin of victory over Kendall, who shot a 66 Sunday.
Another stroke back were Mark Calcavecchia, Ted Tryba and Justin
Leonard. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves welcome reinforcements
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It wasn't the blockbuster move some might have hoped
for, but acquiring pitcher Terry Mulholland and
infielder-outfielder Jose Hernandez from the Cubs appears to be
popular within the Braves organization.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which gave up pitcher Micah Bowie, minor-league pitcher
Ruben Quevedo and a minor-league player to be named in a deal made
at the midnight Saturday deadline, had some offensive voids to fill
after the season-ending injury to Javy Lopez, plus the season-long
loss of Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves say this move improves their depth with veteran
versatile players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good trade,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Everybody
had heard Hernandez's name but nobody really thought about
Mulholland. Terry is going to give us a lot of flexibility. He can
be a starter, long reliever, a specialist, getting out a lefty.
Jose . . .plays every day. He's got speed. He's got power.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine said: ``It's easy to be disappointed because
everybody looks for a blockbuster deal around the deadline. To be
honest, I don't think many of us expected them to do anything. We
were able to add two quality guys who will help us win, which is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz had gone after some bigger bats _ Fred McGriff and
Will Clark _ but both would have come at too high a cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all we could do,'' Schuerholz said. ``We helped to fill
the void back up some. We're a stronger team and a deeper team with
these two guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, who was 6-6 with a 5.15 ERA for the Cubs, has made
16 starts and 10 relief appearances. The Braves can start him if
John Smoltz's elbow remains troublesome or if patience wears thin
with rookie Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have some options with Hernandez on defense, but
priority No. 1 is getting him at the top of the order. Hernandez
hit .272 with 15 home runs and 43 RBI in 99 games for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hernandez is a good player and Terry fits exactly what we were
looking for,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``If you ask people around
baseball who one of the best competitors is, his name is going to
pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Hernandez on the roster, the Braves have an
interesting decision to make and it will likely come down to
releasing either Ozzie Guillen or Otis Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest terms, the arrival of Hernandez means the Braves
have three shortstops along with Guillen and Walt Weiss. Guillen,
who's backed up Weiss, can play short, third or second, but so can
Hernandez. Guillen has outhit Nixon .234 to .188 and held his own
starting in place of the injured Weiss. But Schuerholz has stressed
how Hernandez could be the Braves everyday shortstop if Weiss'
quadriceps flares up again.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon hasn't been hitting this season and lost his attempt at
being an everyday left-fielder. But he is still a capable defensive
outfielder Cox can use late in games and he gives the Braves an
element Guillen doesn't, a consistent base-stealing threat.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is still leading the Braves with 18 stolen bases and is
their best option as a pinch runner. Guillen's best chance at
sticking around appears to be if the Braves choose to use Hernandez
in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby and I are still talking about it,'' Schuerholz said.
``We feel like Jose Hernandez is going to make us stronger than
whomever won't be on the roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and Mulholland aren't joining the team until they
arrive in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. The Braves plan to take until then
to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland is in the first of a two-year, $5.9 million deal. He
is scheduled to make $2.6 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 30, previously had stated a desire to become a free
agent after this season and the conclusion of a one-year, $2.4
million contract. The Cubs had made a ``significant'' offer
covering three years to keep him. Cubs general manager Ed Lynch
made a last-ditch offer after Saturday's game. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into an argument with my wife when I got home after
yesterday's game,'' Hernandez told reporters in Chicago. ``I didn't
know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to move along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, 36, was none too happy to be moving along. He's
played for five teams in seven years, and bought moving boxes
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it was a surprise,'' he said. ``I really believed
that after last year, we'd do bigger and better things. I still
believe these guys are capable of playing well. It kind of twists
in my gut that I'm not a part of it. On the plus side, I'll be with
Atlanta. It's a mixed emotion thing.''

VAN HORN ULTIMATUM MET FOR 6-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION WORTH $73
MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, Keith Van Horn watched the Nets engage in posturing
in contract negotiations with Jayson Williams. In the regular
season, he saw his close friend Kerry Kittles struggle with the
pressure of playing in a contract year.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn vowed that he would not stand for such treatment when
it was his turn to get a new contract. So in June, Van Horn, the
Nets' leading scorer, issued an ultimatum: the Nets would have
seven days from Aug. 1, the first day teams were allowed to declare
player signings, to offer him the maximum amount of money possible.
</P>
<P>
   One day was enough. The Nets announced Sunday that they would
sign Van Horn to a six-year contract extension worth approximately
$73 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an automatic, frankly,'' said John Nash, the Nets'
general manager. ``We said it from the beginning. There was no
mystery about the fact that Keith is one of our more important
players, so from the first opportunity that we had to talk with him
and his representatives, it was made clear that we wanted to do
everything in our power to retain his services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets also reached an agreement with Jamie Feick. The
free-agent forward, who averaged 10.3 rebounds in 28 games last
season, will receive a five-year deal believed to be worth $11
million. He turned down a similar offer from the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Feick and Van Horn, who is in Switzerland doing promotional work
for Nike, will sign later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get Keith signed was our No. 1 priority and to get Jamie
was No. 2,'' Nash said. ``Keith obviously is one of the league's
premier young players and Jamie is an emerging player.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn will be paid $3.4 million this season, with the
extension kicking in the next season. In Van Horn, Stephon Marbury,
Kittles and Williams, the Nets have a foursome that could make them
championship contenders. The group is under contract through at
least the 2004-2005 season.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Van Horn, who averaged 21.8 points and 8.5
rebounds last season, and the 22-year-old Marbury, the dynamic
point guard from Brooklyn, are two of the most exciting performers
in the league and, in the eyes of many, have the ability to become
this generation's signature backcourt-frontcourt combination, its
John Stockton and Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're two of the up-and-coming players who will be
featured probably not only by the Nets in our marketing campaign
but also by the NBA,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Feick, 25, gives the Nets 11 players under
contract and leaves them with only one available spot on the active
roster. They hope to fill it with Scott Burrell, the small forward
who played for them last season. The Nets have offered Burrell a
one-year deal worth $1 million, but he will probably wait to see
what he can command on the open market before making a decision.
San Antonio, Milwaukee and Cleveland have expressed interest in
him.
</P>
<P>
   If Burrell goes elsewhere, the Nets will try to sign an
experienced small forward who would contribute in the locker room
and on the floor. Among those available are Chucky Brown, Terry
Cummings and Chuck Person. Nash also mentioned the possibility of
trading for a small forward, and either of the team's backup point
guards, Eric Murdock or Elliot Perry, could be used in such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Because the health of center Rony Seikaly remains a concern, the
Nets are interested in Gheorghe Muresan. The 7-foot-7-inch Romanian
has worked out at the Nets' Champion Center facility all summer and
played last Saturday at the Shaw Pro Summer League in Boston. In 16
minutes against the Knicks, Muresan had 9 points and 6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really coming along quickly now,'' Nash said. ``We'll
monitor his progress over the month of August and determine whether
or not we want to extend a contract to him.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Nets sign Muresan, it will be for a one-year deal worth
$537,500.

BOMB DAMAGES INTERIOR OF A HALF-BUILT SERBIAN ORTHODOX CATHEDRAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ NATO troops were guarding the half-built
Serbian Orthodox cathedral here after a thunderous explosion
damaged the interior and woke the city early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, at 1:20 a.m., did little structural damage to the
Cathedral of Holy Salvation, but it roused condemnation from church
leaders and United Nations and NATO representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sava Janjic, known as Father Sava, spokesman for Bishop
Artemije, the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo,
denounced the bombing as part of a campaign by Kosovo Albanians to
remove all traces of the church in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack follows several others on churches in Kosovo, mostly
on those built since 1981, when communist restrictions were lifted
and Serbian religious nationalism revived.
</P>
<P>
   The main church in the western town of Djakovica has been
demolished, and two others have been seriously damaged. Several
other churches have been desecrated in the six weeks since Serbian
forces left the province and Kosovo's Albanian refugees returned.
The real gems of architecture, including 12th-century monasteries
and churches, are under NATO protection and have survived
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo condemned
the bombing, calling it a ``cowardly attack against a place of
worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the United Nations chief administrator for
Kosovo, visited the site Sunday and said he would not accept such
acts of revenge regardless of what the Albanians had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the brick-and-cement shell of the cathedral, two small
holes and scorch marks indicated where the charges had exploded,
shattering bricks and twisting an iron girder. The interior
scaffolding was barely disturbed. Outside, the cathedral, with its
aluminium-covered domes and golden cross, looked serene amid a
wasteland of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not someone who knew what he was doing,'' said a
security expert working with one of the international relief
organizations. ``Or he was just making a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   However ineffective the blast, the message will not be lost on
the small number of Serbs remaining in Pristina. Sunday, the entire
Serbian population of the southeastern town of Zitinje packed what
belongings they could and fled Kosovo after weeks of intimidation
and violence, the American peacekeepers told Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   With an American military escort, a convoy of 60 cars, tractors
and trailers moved toward the border of Serbia proper. All of
Zitinje's 450 Serbs were in the convoy, said a soldier observing
the exodus. The town's Albanians number 650.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, which had reverberated with the sound of the church
bombing hours earlier, the Albanian residents seemed to give little
thought to the explosion. Music and loud applause rose from the
soccer stadium a few blocks away Sunday afternoon as Albanians
enjoyed the first live concert since the end of the war. Children
splashed in the fountain on the square, and youths climbed into the
ruins of the Serbian special police headquarters, bombed by NATO in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile,
showed more concern for Russian peacekeepers' treatment of the
chief of staff of the rebel force, Agim Ceku, who was stopped and
briefly detained on Saturday when he failed to produce identity
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders angrily protested the action as proof of Russian
anti-Albanian bias, but a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeepers
played down the incident, saying the Russians followed standard
procedure.

JETS HAVE URGENT MISSION TO MOLD THEIR YOUNG GUARDS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Only minutes after the Jets' quintet of
untested guards heard their first encouraging words from Coach Bill
Parcells this training camp, they learned that he had gone out
Sunday and signed a veteran who has started at right guard since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Beckles, a free agent who had been with the Philadelphia
Eagles the last two years after beginning his career with the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, became the newest Jet and immediately said he
expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. He worked out with the third unit Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll shape up the line,'' Parcells said. ``This is no cinch
deal here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells does finally have a guard who has played the
position for pay. There had been five candidates for the two spots,
including three rookie draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   As problematic as that situation was, it became more serious on
Saturday when Erik Norgard, a veteran who had played guard but was
backing up at center, decided to quit. He had been Parcells' one
fallback on the team if none of the untested players could make it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells was sounding upbeat about the guard position
after three days of training camp. He is impressed with the guards'
athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells reiterated Sunday that the club is deeper in some areas
than it was last season. But he understands his situation at guard
and asked rhetorically, ``What am I supposed to do, go out to the
guard tree and pull one down?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to force-feed some guys in,'' he said of the
urgency to get the guards in place. The first exhibition game is at
Green Bay in 13 days. Then again, he admitted: ``I don't have a
choice. Hey, we had to draft three guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rookies, Randy Thomas, David Loverne and J.P. Machado,
have demonstrated they can block for the run. So have the
carryovers (but inexperienced) Alex Bernstein and Doug Karczewski.
They have not yet demonstrated special abilities in pass
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Muir, the offensive-line coach, as usual, has been
relentless in dogging the players as they struggle in the 90-degree
heat. To Loverne, there was this advice from Muir: ``I knew someone
would screw it up. What are you supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells hounded Thomas by shouting: ``The coach told you
something four times. When are you going to get it?''
</P>
<P>
   Beckles escaped the coaches' wrath, who signed a one-year
$400,000 contract, at least for Sunday. He does have some
credentials, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Beckles is slated for right guard, where he has started 122
games. That creates a tense situation for Bernstein and Thomas, who
had alternated there with the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said of his chances to start, ``I've always been
confident.'' Thomas, a second-round pick from Mississippi State,
was the first player the Jets drafted in April and was considered
by their staff to be the top guard prospect in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference here is that everyone is quick on the line and
much smarter than college players,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Loverne, who played tackle at San Jose State but is being tried
at left guard, described his chance as ``the opportunity of a
lifetime; maybe one in a million rookies get this chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been able to focus on football recently after having
concerns about family in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have uncles and aunts there,'' he said. ``Both my parents
are from Montenegro. But the family lives on farms and they've been
away from the bombing by NATO. They were able to feed themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For Karczewski, the Jets' fifth-round draft pick in 1998, ``I'm
feeling a heck of a lot better than I did last year.'' Still, he
said: ``It's tough. No one is set anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Vinny Testaverde said it will be a long process. He
recalls that last season, which began with Glenn Foley as the new
starting quarterback: ``It was tough behind Todd Burger and Matt
O'Dwyer. It took time. Until this is over, it's hard to say how
this will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many potential offensive linemen in camp that
Parcells has brought in his favorite from his Giants and Patriots
days, William Roberts, to help with the coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I want to do this as a career,'' Roberts said.
``I'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   But he brings a sense of humor to the fray, startling the
players at the beginning of practice, as well as the fans leaning
on the fences, by suddenly bellowing like a rooster.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it sounds like a wake-up call to the guards.

LITTLE ROCK WRESTLES WITH LEGACY OF CLINTON AS INVESTIGATION ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ For many in this state, the mood these days
is like the familiar exhale of relief that follows the destructive
storms of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has declared
the Arkansas phase of his investigation over. He has finished with
five years of intense scrutiny of hundreds of people, many of them
prominent citizens and associates of President Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, but also dozens of small merchants and peripheral
figures embittered by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all weary like at the end of a war,'' said Max Brantley,
editor of The Arkansas Times, a weekly newspaper that followed the
Starr investigation with a distinctly local perspective of feeling
unfairly assailed and looked down upon by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   While the after-effects of the investigation are still being
sorted out, it is clear that no one here could have predicted or
even imagined the raucous experience that was in store for the city
and state when Bill Clinton stood on a platform in front of the Old
State House in downtown Little Rock on election night 1992 to
celebrate his victory with thousands of local supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Arkansas thought at the time that governor Clinton's
victory was the beginning of redemption for a small state striving
to better its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I distinctly remember thinking that this was finally going to
wipe away the stain left by Faubus,'' said one of the state's most
distinguished citizens, a man who said he preferred to wear his
disappointment privately because he was still fond of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Orval E. Faubus tried in 1957 to prevent nine black
children from integrating Central High School, requiring President
Dwight Eisenhower to call out the National Guard. If the name
``Little Rock'' was no longer a symbol of that painful era, older
Arkansans felt their state had not yet overcome its backward image.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw Clinton's ascendancy as the chance for the state to
capture a new image; others saw it as a ticket for new
opportunities in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It has not quite worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we in Arkansas came out of this just looking
foolish,'' said Lesa Baker, a housewife interviewed recently on
Main Street in Benton, the Saline County seat. Lots of people were
dragged into the investigation, she said, ``and I can't think of
much good that came along to balance it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including Ms. Baker, believe that Clinton must bear
some responsibility, while others say that the president has
largely been a victim of a vindictive prosecutor. But it seems that
no one, not even Clinton's detractors, has any kind words for
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely excessive,'' Ms. Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Two women getting their daily exercise by speed-walking through
the McCain shopping mall in North Little Rock agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Reed, a retired bookkeeper from nearby Sherwood, said that
Starr ``was on a witch hunt from the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Williams of Little Rock, her exercise companion, said
Starr was ``on the edge of being evil. And he smiled the whole
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the July 25 issue of The Arkansas Times, an editorial
objected to a list of 10 ``very well-mannered'' public people,
including Starr, compiled by the National League of Junior
Cotillions. The Cotillion ladies got it wrong, the newspaper said.
The soft-spoken Starr was really like Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi
head of the Gestapo and the SS.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings about the Clintons may be less intense, but they
are more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's run for the Senate from New York has caused
tender feelings in Arkansas, where people generally liked her even
as they suspected that she endured her time here more than she
enjoyed it. Many people said in interviews that they had never
expected her to run for office from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure she ever really liked Arkansas,'' said Garrick
Feldman, a printing plant owner and the publisher of the Leader
newspapers in northern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence about Clinton was evident in the debate this
week in Little Rock over changing the name of a long stretch of
Markham Street to President Clinton Avenue. The city board of
directors voted for the change in 1997 _ before the Monica Lewinsky
scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-block route passes several sites connected in the public
mind to Clinton, including the Old State House, the Greek revival
antebellum building that was the site of the 1992 election night
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Now a museum, the Old State House is flanked on one side by the
Excelsior Hotel. According to Paula Jones, that is where Clinton,
when he was governor, had her summoned to his room and made a crude
sexual proposition. Clinton settled Ms. Jones' lawsuit last year by
paying her $850,000 but did not admit doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the museum sits the Doubletree, another
hotel linked to an accusation against Clinton. According to Juanita
Broaddrick, that hotel, then the Camelot, is where Clinton forced
her to have sexual relations with him when he was state attorney
general, a charge he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Little Rock refer to the hotels smirkingly as the
``Paula Jones Hotel'' and the ``Juanita Broaddrick Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the plan to rename the street in honor of
Clinton resulted in a meeting of the city board on July 27 to
reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the packed hearing room at City Hall, a woman forcefully
told the audience that the city should honor Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people from Arkansas have been elected president?''
she asked. ``Just one!''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman in the crowd was escorted out by the police after
she shouted back: ``He's also the only one to have been
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   A man held up a sign: ``Don't even name a toilet after him.''
</P>
<P>
   The board voted 8-4 to accept a compromise in which only about
six blocks at the east end of the street would be renamed President
Clinton Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is where supporters of Clinton, who are trying to raise
more than $100 million from private donors, plan to construct the
President Clinton Library and Museum. The 27-acre site, alongside
the Arkansas River, will house the library, the repository of
Clinton's presidential papers, a museum about him and a Clinton
Center, which will probably be devoted to improving race relations,
said Skip Rutherford, a longtime supporter and friend of Clinton's
who is overseeing its development.
</P>
<P>
   It will also include a furnished apartment for the Clintons to
use when they are in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford said the Clinton project would complement a
neighborhood that was experiencing a commercial renaissance, with
new restaurants, an old-time market, a children's museum and a
planned office tower.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Valentine, a veteran American League baseball umpire who is
now the general manager of the Arkansas Travelers, a minor league
farm team of the St. Louis Cardinals based in west Little Rock,
said it was well to remember that the tribulations of the Clintons
and Starr concerned only a small segment of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular folks, you know the down-the-road type of people,
never really paid much attention,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   But at a recent home game of the Travs, as they are called,
people lined up to get autographs from someone who owes her
celebrity to the Clinton presidency. Jones, who recently moved from
California back to Arkansas, to a small home in Cabot, 25 miles
northeast of Little Rock, happily signed score cards proffered by
children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clintons' former business partner Susan McDougal has
also returned from California to live in Arkansas. Ms. McDougal
served 18 months in jail while refusing to testify before a grand
jury about the Clintons' real estate dealings. Last April, a Little
Rock jury cleared her of obstructing justice and deadlocked on two
counts of criminal contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal's trial illustrated as well as anything the
us-versus-them mind-set about Starr that prevailed in Arkansas.
Some of Little Rock's most elegant and stylish women, who
previously would have little to do with Ms. McDougal, made a point
of helping her buy clothes for the trial and seeing that her hair
was done properly.
</P>
<P>
   One remnant of the Starr investigation is the outpost of the
prosecutor's office on Center View Drive in west Little Rock. It is
still staffed by W. Hickman Ewing, the chief prosecutor for the
Arkansas phase of the investigation, and a handful of others who
are gradually winding down the office's operations.

LEAGUE ACCEPTS RESIGNATION OF UMPIRE WHO SAID HE NEVER RESIGNED
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drew Coble is one of nine umpires whose resignations Gene Budig,
the American League president, accepted last week. The only problem
is Coble said he never resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Budig also accepted Greg Kosc's resignation, but Kosc said he
had rescinded his resignation in the same period when other umpires
withdrew their resignations and saved their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Coble, a crew chief in his 18th year with the league, was
notified in a letter from Budig dated July 26 that he had received
on July 15 a letter of resignation from Coble dated July 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret,'' Budig wrote, ``that you decided to take
part in this concerted resignation plan instigated by the Major
League Umpires Association. However, you have left me with no
choice but to accept your resignation and to fill the vacancy that
your resignation has created along with the other vacancies that
were created by this mass resignation strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coble said Sunday he did not sign a resignation letter dated
July 14 and did not attend the meeting in Philadelphia that day at
which more than 50 umpires did sign such letters. Coble said he was
at home in Graham, N.C., with his wife. ``Kim had chemotherapy that
day in the hospital,'' Coble said by telephone from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Coble said he was so involved with his wife's illness that he
was not even aware of the umpires' action until a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   He said he laughed when he received Budig's letter, but his
unemployment, scheduled to begin Sept. 2, the date of resignation
in the umpires' letters, is no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for them to accept a resignation they never
got,'' he said. ``The letter said my letter was dated July 14. I
didn't even know what went down until the 17th of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he did learn of the step his colleagues had taken to try to
induce baseball officials to begin negotiations for a new labor
agreement, Coble said, he decided to join them. ``I signed a letter
July 22 and sent it to Richie,'' he said, referring to Richie
Phillips, the umpires' lawyer and labor leader. ``To my knowledge
Richie never sent it to the league office.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips would not confirm that Coble had sent him a letter of
resignation, but whatever it was, Phillips added, ``I did not
forward to the league office.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, however, issued a news release July 22 saying that
Coble and Ted Hendry of the American League and Greg Bonin of the
National had advised the leagues that they were resigning. But both
Hendry and Bonin have retained their jobs, ostensibly because the
league offices never received their letters.
</P>
<P>
   Coble said he had heard from no one in the American League
office. ``They haven't even called to ask how my wife is,'' said
the 51-year-old umpire, who has not worked since July 3. Asked if
he has thought about calling the league, he said, ``I've been
tempted to call Budig, but I'm sure he doesn't have any answers for
me, so I've resisted the urge.''
</P>
<P>
   Budig was not at home Sunday. Phyllis Merhige, the league's
senior vice president, said the league would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kosc's circumstance is a little different. He resigned,
rescinded his resignation and then rescinded his rescission. But
like Coble's letter, Phillips said, Kosc's letter reinstating his
resignation was never sent to the league office even though he,
too, was part of the union's July 22 news release.
</P>
<P>
   Kosc, in his 24th year with the league, was en route home after
umpiring a game in Cleveland Sunday and could not be reached. But
Phillips said Kosc revoked his resignation, just as eight other
umpires did, before the league hired 12 new umpires. Even if he did
change his mind, Phillips said: ``They don't have anything from
him. They went by newspaper accounts apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   When lawyers had conference calls last Tuesday about the federal
lawsuit the union filed against the leagues, Phillips said, he
raised the Coble-Kosc issue with Judge Edmund Ludwig of United
States District Court in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court made serious inquiry into the Coble and Kosc
situations,'' and the leagues had no response, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Coble related one more element of his case. He said he had
received calls two days apart from two AL umpires who are
considered the leaders of the nonresigning faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Hirschbeck called and said his group was going with
baseball and if I went with them, I'd be `taken care of,''' Coble
said. ``Then Joe Brinkman called and said he talked to higher-ups
and explained what was going on.'' He meant with his wife's medical
condition. ``He said they agreed to make me an exception `if I
would go over to their side,''' Coble said. ``But he said I would
have to do it by that night.''
</P>
<P>
   But that same day the league sent notices to nine umpires
accepting their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received the letter the next day,'' Coble said. ``They
accepted a resignation that was never sent.'' &QL;

PARCELLS READY TO DISCUSS FUTURE WITH ANY POTENTIAL OWNER

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Although Bill Parcells has never disclosed how
long he plans to coach the New York Jets, he said Sunday that he
would be willing to discuss his future with any potential owner.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs has already prepared a prospectus on the team for
potential buyers. A leading figure in arranging the sale will be
the Jets' president, Steve Gutman, who could oversee a $500 million
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Steve Gutman, bring anybody by that you want,''
Parcells said. ``I'll be glad to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is in the third year of a six-year contract that calls
for him to coach the Jets for at least four seasons. He is also the
team's chief football operations officer and commands an average
salary of $2.4 million a year. He will be 58 later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has said there will be no front-office changes this
season, and Gutman added that the Jets operate just as they always
have, although he reports to the executors of the will of the late
Leon Hess. &QL;

SCIENTIST ACCUSED OF LEAKING NUCLEAR SECRETS SAYS HE'S INNOCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaking publicly in his own defense for the first
time, Wen Ho Lee, the scientist dismissed from his job after
security breaches at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said on
television Sunday that he was innocent and that he had not divulged
nuclear secrets to China or to ``any unauthorized person.''
</P>
<P>
   On the CBS News program ``60 Minutes,'' Lee confirmed that he
had transferred data from classified to unclassified computer
systems at Los Alamos but said he had done so to protect the
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do that routinely,'' he said, and he asserted that ``it's a
very common practice.'' Legal papers for Lee say he wanted to
create a backup copy of the information, The Los Angeles Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said on the ``60 Minutes''
program that it was ``wrong and improper to download nuclear
weapons information'' from the classified system. ``This is
something that we are not going to tolerate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Lee had ``massively violated our security
procedures'' by having ``improper contact with Chinese officials,''
by deceiving U.S. officials at Los Alamos and by transferring
nuclear weapons information to unclassified computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials acknowledge that other employees
have sometimes violated computer security procedures, but say the
infractions were on a much smaller scale than Lee's.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, Lee said: ``The truth is, I'm innocent. I have not done
anything wrong with _ what they try to accuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a naturalized citizen who was born in Taiwan, said he had
become a convenient scapegoat for U.S. investigators, in part
because he was the only Asian American working in the weapons
design group, known as the ``X division'' of the laboratory, in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why I was singled out for this particular
issue,'' Lee said. ``I still don't understand why. I know that many
people do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson insisted: ``There was no effort to scapegoat this
man. We have tried to protect his legal status, his reputation, as
much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is considering whether to prosecute Lee.
Federal authorities say it is unlikely that he will ever face
criminal charges of espionage, but officials say they are also
weighing other charges, related to the mishandling of classified
information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lee have submitted legal briefs to the Justice
Department in a last-ditch effort to head off an indictment, The
Los Angeles Times reported. Arguments in those papers are similar
to the arguments Lee made on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs contend that Lee transferred information from
classified to unclassified computers to protect it in the event of
a computer crash, the newspaper said. Even in his ``unclassified
machines,'' Lee said, the data were protected with three passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three passwords,'' Lee said. ``It's almost impossible for
anybody to break in. You know, sometimes I even had a hard time to
break in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In summary, Lee said: ``The reason I downloaded the computer
code from a classified machine to an unclassified machine is part
of my job. To protect my code, to protect my file. I do that
routinely.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, after an extensive investigation, a congressional panel
said China had used nuclear secrets stolen from U.S. laboratories
to develop advanced miniature warheads and a mobile ballistic
missile. Counterintelligence officials have said they suspect that
China obtained the data in the mid-1980s, but U.S. authorities did
not realize that the information had been stolen until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on CBS if he had ever passed nuclear secrets to China,
Lee, a computer scientist, said, ``No, I never have done that, and
I have no intention of doing that at all.'' In addition, Lee said
he had never given secrets to ``any unauthorized person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he had been maligned. ``I devote the best time of my
life to this country, to make the country stronger, particularly in
the nuclear weapon area,'' Lee said. ``And I try to make the
country stronger, so we can protect the American people. But
suddenly, they told me I'm a traitor. And I'm just totally _ I
mean, I'm, I'm just _ don't understand this.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, investigators found that Lee had downloaded thousands
of secret codes used in the design of the most sophisticated U.S.
nuclear weapons, as well as the records of hundreds of weapons
tests.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, Lee confirmed that he had had access to extremely
sensitive information. ``I know the top secret of nuclear weapon
very well, yes,'' he said. ``I'm one of the important people in our
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher, could not immediately be reached
for comment and did not return messages left at his office. In May,
Holscher issued a statement denying that his client had spied for
China. In June, the lawyer said Lee had been ``unfairly injected
into a politically charged debate over America-China relations.''

DECLINE IN WEB SHOPPING, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The percentage of people with Internet access who are making
purchases from Web sites declined slightly in the second quarter of
1999 after four sequential quarters of spectacular growth,
according to Greenfield Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Greenfield, a Westport, Conn., Internet marketing
research firm, hints at the limits of market penetration of the
medium as a shopping platform _ suggesting a ceiling that has been
unknown until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first indication of the size of the population
that will use the Internet to shop,'' Rudy Nadilo, Greenfield's
president and chief executive, said.
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooming e-commerce sales _ and visions of geometric growth
into the future _ have fueled the recent boom of Internet stock
valuations. Greenfield's study does not necessarily indicate that
sales on the World Wide Web have stalled, since the total number of
people with Web access continues to grow rapidly. And the finding
that 71 percent of people online bought at least once in the last
three months is respectable, even if it stays at that level.
</P>
<P>
   From the first quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of this
year, the percentage of people with online access who said they had
bought something through a Web site rose to 74 percent from 47
percent, Greenfield said. But in the latest quarter, Greenfield
found that the percentage had slipped to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on 2,598 respondents selected randomly
from Greenfield's national pool of more than 1 million individuals
who have volunteered to participate in online research.

ADDS CALIF. DATELINE  
 KEN BURNS TURNS HIS DOCUMENTARY SKILLS TO TWO NOTABLE WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Eat your veggies! That was the unmistakable
tone of a PBS luncheon featuring turnips, squash, beets and Ken
Burns' latest historical documentary, ``Not for Ourselves Alone:
The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP; Susan B. Anthony.''
</P>
<P>
   With the finger-wagging zeal of a televangelist, Burns told TV
critics Saturday that Stanton and Anthony, pioneers of the women's
movement, are the two most important females in the American
experience, but most Americans know nothing about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are responsible for the largest social transformation in
American history,'' Burns said. ``I am outraged that this history
has been hidden from us, has been so long neglected. Not just on
our television screens, but in our history books.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns and co-producer Paul Barnes hope to rectify that Nov. 7
and 8 with their two-part documentary, the fourth in a five-part
series that has already profiled Thomas Jefferson, Lewis and Clark
and Frank Lloyd Wright. The fifth will be about Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the Stanton/Anthony saga, rife with drama and
inspirational commitment to a cause, should be one of ``the
hallelujah stories'' taught in classrooms around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't, Burns said, simply because ``men have written the
histories.''
</P>
<P>
   _Burns' brother Ric, probably best known for his 1992
documentary, ``The Donner Party,'' is on PBS' fall schedule with
``New York: A Documentary Film.'' Ten hours of the 12-hour project
will air Nov. 14-18, ending with the construction of the Empire
State Building. The final installment, to air sometime next spring,
will look at New York in the first year of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York's been kind of inventing the future for itself and
America for about 200 years now,'' Ric Burns said, ``and the space
that we've created for ourselves next year is to finish the story,
bring it down to the present and begin to look, at least
symbolically, at what the future is.''
</P>
<P>
   _Dick Wolf, producer of ``Law &AMP; Order'' and its new spinoff
series, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' is upset. He says
the new series, a police drama focusing on the aftermath of
particularly heinous sex crimes, is a 10 o'clock show, but NBC has
it penciled in on Mondays at 9, which is 8 p.m. for folks in the
Central time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Like its sire, ``Special Victims Unit'' is not violent. The
crime has already been committed when the show begins. Wolf said it
deals with the effect of violence on the victims, the families and
the investigators. Still, he says it's ``a mature show with mature
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The network knows how I feel about this'' said Wolf, who is
annoyed that the Monday edition of ``Dateline NBC'' has the 10 p.m.
slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have used every argument at my disposal ... and I'm very
surprised that the show has not been moved. I don't think it makes
a damn bit of difference where `Dateline' is. It's on five times a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Ally McBeal'' has spawned much imitation in the
dramatic-comedy genre. One new entry is NBC's ``Cold Feet,'' about
three couples at different stages of the commitment tango. Based on
a British comedy, it has had a rocky development. Last year, the
plan was to give it a more serious tone, with characters living in
New York. This year's recast pilot episode was more upbeat and set
in Portland. After one more cast change, the producers say it will
now be set in Seattle (and shot in Vancouver, B.C.).

<P>
   No surprise, really. One of the producers is John J. Sakmar, who
had a hand in the short-lived ``Medicine Ball'' and ``Mr. &AMP; Mrs.
Smith,'' both of which had Seattle settings. Sakmar hopes to do
some shooting in Seattle, and he'd like nothing better than to have
a couple's relationship take a turn for the worse as the Kingdome
implodes in the background.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Of all the real estate debacles and broken
dreams of the recession a decade ago, few were more spectacular
than the collapse of Port Liberte. Starry-eyed developers
envisioned it as a kind of Venice-on-the-Hudson, with a network of
canals dredged out of a dilapidated waterfront and high-priced
European style town houses offering views of the Statue of Liberty
and the Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   But only a tiny portion of the $750 million project _ a few
apartments and only one canal _ was ever built here, and Port
Liberte earned its spot in history as the largest real estate
bankruptcy east of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   From that disaster, though, Joseph Barry anticipates making a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Barry, a former antipoverty lawyer, bought the carcass
for a pittance, completed the existing apartments and waited out
the recession. Now he is building 134 more condominiums and an
18-hole golf course. And he is hardly by himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a real estate boom taking place up and down New Jersey's
industrial coast, developers are building as fast as they can, and
reshaping the skyline from Bayonne to the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel and Richard LeFrak are building two apartment towers, two
office buildings and a hotel on their 600-acre Newport complex in
Jersey City. Ara Hovnanian is building 15 million-dollar,
4,000-square-foot town houses in West New York, and a dozen other
developers are jostling for space on River Road, below the cliffs
of the Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   And Barry, chairman of Applied Cos. of Hoboken, a development
company, has five projects in the works worth $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a speculative boom,'' Barry said. ``It's
Manhattan-driven. It's a market of young workers who are trading
the convenience of living in Manhattan for the price and amenities
of Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, developers have struggled to build a
post-industrial frontier along what many wishfully call New
Jersey's ``gold coast.'' And for many, those wishes are finally
coming true: White-collar office parks are going up where factories
once stood; luxury apartments are replacing gantry cranes on the
piers, and stylish shops are being carved out of railroad
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is caught up in the real estate euphoria. While
many of the eight towns along the Hudson River waterfront see an
economic bounty, Weehawken and Hoboken worry about traffic-choked
streets at rush hour and the esthetics of brick-and-vinyl-sided
town houses and boxy glass office buildings that rob the views and
block public access to the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   In May, development issues figured prominently in the City
Council elections in Hoboken, where dissidents captured two seats
and community protests forced Mayor Anthony Russo to recommend that
a developer withdraw his plan to build the tallest towers in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   And just to the north, in Weehawken, which embraces the mouth of
the Lincoln Tunnel, residents at a recent community meeting
criticized proposals for a pair of office towers and for more than
1,600 apartments and 1.3 million square feet of commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid of the cumulative effect of all this,'' said
Judith Wadia, a 16-year resident of Weehawken. ``I'm afraid this
project is going to choke itself to death. There'll be so many
thousands of new residents trying to get into the Lincoln Tunnel
that the whole project will come to a screeching halt. Then we'll
be stuck with empty buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   But the debates in Weehawken and Hoboken have done little to
dampen the construction craze. And while some economists warn that
too much housing is being built, most developers just shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot to turn this baby off,'' said an
ebullient Gabe Pasquale, executive vice president for sales and
marketing at K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, which is
building 445 town houses at three projects in Guttenberg and West
New York just north of the Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of the waterfront started in the late 1970s
and early '80s. From Jersey City to Weehawken, municipal leaders,
residents, environmentalists and developers discussed what to do
with the abandoned factories, docks and warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Developers including the LeFraks, Arthur Imperatore and Hartz
Mountain assembled large tracts of land, expecting the demand for
new offices and apartments to continue unabated. Eventually, plans
to build 30 million square feet of office space and 37,000 housing
units were drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   But the recession of the late '80s and early '90s left vacant
more than 37 percent of the 7.8 million square feet of office space
that had been built in Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken.
Condominiums sold for less than 70 percent of construction costs,
and apartment rents plummeted. Developers went bankrupt, leaving
behind half-finished projects that resembled Roman ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous one, the current building boom is fueled by
the surging economy in Manhattan. The number of jobs on Wall Street
has jumped by 40,000 since 1991, forcing many investment banks to
look for expansion space. Most want to stay in Manhattan, but with
prime offices in Manhattan renting for $50 to $60 per square foot a
year, Jersey City and the other gold coast towns look inviting at
less than half the price.
</P>
<P>
   Apartments and town houses are also significantly cheaper on the
New Jersey waterfront. A luxurious 2,300-square-foot town house on
the water might cost $500,000, less than half the price of the
average Manhattan apartment of the same size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hesitant to consider anything out of the city,'' said
Deena Edington, an executive with Ralph Lauren who moved with her
husband from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Jacob's Ferry, a
new town house development in West New York. ``But we're
quadrupling our living space for the same payment as our city
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the waterfront, Jersey City has been transformed
from an industrial backwater into a corporate annex to Manhattan's
financial district. American Express recently announced plans to
move 900 employees to Hartz Mountain's new office building at 90
Hudson St. in Jersey City, while PaineWebber, Cigna and U.S. Trust
are moving hundreds of employees to the newest office building at
the nearby Newport complex.
</P>
<P>
   But the memories of what happened in the late '80s, when the
stock market crash of 1987 sent the region into a tailspin, remain
quite fresh, and some developers and investors worry privately that
with so many apartments and town houses under construction, the
supply may soon exceed the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 5,000 units coming on line in a market that's never
absorbed more than 300 to 400 a year,'' a developer lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Daibes, chief executive of Daibes Brothers development
company of Edgewater, said he worried constantly about the next
downturn. His family firm is building a 16-story luxury apartment
house on River Road in Edgewater and twin 14-story residential
towers for the elderly, also in Edgewater. But carpenters are hard
at work building town houses and apartments all along River Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous,'' Daibes said. ``I'm battening down the hatches.
The population isn't growing as fast as we're building
apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The music does not have to stop,'' said Richard Speciale, a
managing principal at Aequitas, a Manhattan real estate investment
firm, ``but it always slows down. And some of these developers
could get hurt. We tend to forget about the cyclical nature of
markets.''

AMSTED AGREES TO BUY VARLEN, A SMALLER RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After raising its unsolicited offer, Amsted Industries, which
makes products for the rail, truck and auto components industries,
said Sunday that it would acquire the Varlen Corp. for $740 million
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Amsted, based in Chicago, will also assume $50 million of
Varlen's debt. Varlen, which is based in Naperville, Ill., makes
products and components for the transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   Amsted said the boards of both companies had approved the
acquisition, which values Varlen at about $42 a share, or about 62
percent above the share price of Varlen on May 17, the day before
Amsted began its hostile takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the Nasdaq market on Friday, shares of Varlen were
unchanged at $37.875 on light volume. Amsted is a privately held,
employee-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Varlen was initially hesitant to reach a deal with Amsted but
was apparently swayed in recent weeks after Amsted raised its bid
from the $35 a share it originally offered.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have maneuvered warily around each other amid
reports that a competitor might emerge to counter Amsted's bid for
Varlen. But the companies decided to put aside their differences
and said in a statement Sunday that the merger would create a
``worldwide transportation equipment leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For our employees, this offers opportunities in an
organization which will have greater scale and resources,'' said
Raymond A. Jean, Varlen's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Amsted had revenue of about $1.3 billion last year, about twice
as much as Varlen, which reported sales of $647 million in 1998. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese authorities seized a Taiwan freighter over the
weekend near a Taiwan military post on Matsu, a heavily fortified
island under Taiwan control.
</P>
<P>
   During a tense diplomatic tussle between China and Taiwan, the
incident provoked concern in Taiwan that China might have acted
improperly, using the ship as a pretext to aggravate an already
strained situation.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese coast guard vessel approached the ship on Saturday,
and four armed policemen boarded and forced it and its 10 Taiwan
crew members into a port on mainland China, accusing the crew of
trying to smuggle goods to China.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Taiwan officials countered by saying that the ship
had been conducting a normal operation of carrying provisions for
Taiwan soldiers posted on Matsu, a few miles from China's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 6,000 civilians live on Matsu, with about an equal
number of soldiers, it remains a sensitive military post for
Taiwan, which military analysts say could be a strategic location
in any military conflict between China and Taiwan. Matsu was the
site of a military battle between Taiwan and China in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidents like this will not benefit normal exchanges between
the two sides,'' Taiwan's justice minister, Yeh Chin-feng, said in
Taipei, and he urged China to return the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Yeh and other Taiwan officials, apparently careful not to
inflame a delicate situation, refrained from accusing China of
deliberately aggravating the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, according to information gathered by relevant
authorities, I haven't seen any linkage between the seizure and
political motivation,'' said Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman of
Taiwan's semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's and China's military forces in the region have gone on
alert in recent weeks, after President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan
asserted on July 9 that Taiwan would only talk with China on the
basis of ``special state-to-state relations,'' abandoning the
diplomatic framework that has kept peace between the two sides for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders were outraged by Lee's new stance that China and
Taiwan are effectively separate countries, shedding the previous
framework of ``one China'' in which the two had recognized each
other as different political entities under a single Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Defense Minister Chi Haotian accused Lee of going
``further and further down the dangerous road of splitting the
motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sternly warn Lee Teng-hui and the Taiwan authorities not to
underestimate our constancy of purpose,'' Chi said at a reception
to celebrate the Aug. 1 anniversary of the founding of the People's
Liberation Army. ``The Chinese People's Liberation Army is combat
ready, prepared at any moment to defend the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the motherland and resolutely smash any
plot to split the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough talk, China has so far shown little
willingness to take military action against Taiwan _ as it did in
1995 and 1996, when China fired several test missiles into the
ocean off the coast of Taiwan, causing alarm over the possibility
of military conflict that was quelled only when the United States
sent two aircraft carriers toward the region as a show of support
for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But China has pointedly reminded Taiwan that Beijing has never
renounced the possibility of using force against Taiwan if it
formally declares independence, even though the two have in
practice been separated and independent since China's civil war
ended 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, China's news media have covered several minor
military exercises in Fujian province, across the 100-mile-wide
Taiwan Straits from Taiwan. The relatively small size of the
exercises appeared to reflect an unwillingness to inflame the
situation, while subtly delivering a message that military action
is always possible sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, seizing a Taiwan freighter and accusing it of
smuggling, a common form of trade in the area, may be a way to
tweak Taiwan's authorities without actually confronting them.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Nung-ti, owner of the freighter, told Reuters that the ship,
the Shin Hwa, was carrying provisions, including rice and canned
food, for the military servicemen in Matsu.
</P>
<P>
   Since Taiwan bans direct trade, transportation and communication
with China, smugglers willing to defy the ban ply the waters every
day, and China offers landing visas to Taiwan residents who make
the illicit passage.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Cheng-ching, a legislator from Matsu, was quoted in local
newspapers as saying that he believed the ship may simply have run
afoul of smugglers who pay the Chinese police to keep rivals out of
their areas of operation.

METS AND ATHLETICS MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH TRADES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, the New York Mets' manager, never did like
Jason Isringhausen. He was young and sometimes did youthfully
foolish things, like playing softball when he was recovering from a
broken wrist. But the Oakland Athletics like Isringhausen; all they
do is look at his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a great arm for the future in Isringhausen,'' Billy
Beane, the Oakland general manager, said Sunday. It was the day
after the non-waiver trading deadline, and general managers _ those
who made trades in the hours before the deadline, those who tried
but could not complete them and those who sat out the dance _ were
studying the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen teams were involved in trades on Saturday, some more
than once, making nine deals involving 28 players. It was not a
particularly awesome day for trades, but some teams made
significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, for example, including the Kenny Rogers deal made a
week earlier, have turned over 20 percent of their roster. The
Athletics have done the same. But Oakland made a most curious
combination of moves. Believing it is a wild-card contender, it
bolstered its starting rotation by adding Kevin Appier and Omar
Olivares after trading Rogers at his request. But the Athletics
traded their closer, Billy Taylor, for Isringhausen and Greg
McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   Beane explained the first part first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen was very good in the first half but has struggled
in the second half,'' he said by telephone from Oakland. ``We
adopted the theory that you use when you strengthen the muscles
around an injured knee to support the knee. We improved our
starting pitching to help the bullpen. If the bullpen needs to get
only six outs instead of 12 or 15, we will improve our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bullpen still needs a closer, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's done a great job here,'' Beane said of the 37-year-old
Taylor, who spent 14 years in the minor leagues and was a major
league rookie at age 32. ``But at some point, in the very near
future, we were going to have to address the fact that we don't
have a closer for the coming years. Everything we've done we've
tried to address the present and the future.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Beane said, 42-year-old Doug Jones will handle most of
the closing chores. He has been a closer for five other teams, has
had as many as 43 saves in a season and has a career total of 295
saves. He at least knows the territory, even if his ability won't
allow him to cover it well all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But this is where Isringhausen comes in. Beane doesn't want to
say it too loudly, but Isringhausen is the team's instant No. 1
candidate for closer of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he has the ability, but we have to be careful,''
Beane said. ``If you look at the history of closers, those who are
anointed closers before they do it usually fail. Good closers often
just develop into being closers. We're careful not to stamp him as
our closer. But he's got a great arm.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 26, Isringhausen, an injury-plagued right-hander,
has time to grow into the role (another general manager said
Oakland very likely will ``sneak'' him into save situations now and
then). Beane acknowledged that trading Taylor, who had 26 saves,
fourth most in the American League, was a risk, but with a $22
million payroll, he said, ``You have to roll the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Mets bolstered their bullpen, which has
been overworked this season, by adding Taylor and Chuck McElroy,
who were quickly put into action Sunday in Chicago and combined for
two shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also got a new center fielder, Darryl Hamilton, who is
a better, more consistent hitter than the old one, Brian McRae, and
who once played an entire season (1996) without making an error.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, actually struggling for the first time in
years and working hard to stave off the Mets, acquired a starting
pitcher, Terry Mulholland, and a shortstop, Jose Hernandez, because
they can't be certain about the health of John Smoltz and Walt
Weiss. But they were unable to address the hitting shortage they
have developed with the loss of Javier Lopez, their good-hitting
catcher, for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has an adage that the best trades are sometimes the
ones you do not make, but Sunday there were questions why some
teams didn't make seemingly obvious moves with certain players.
Why, for example, didn't Tampa Bay trade Fred McGriff, or even
Roberto Hernandez, their expensive, sought-after closer? Why did
Baltimore demand so much for Arthur Rhodes, a reliever-in-demand
who will be a free agent in two months? Why didn't Anaheim trade
Chuck Finley to Cleveland or the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the second part of the last question is that the
Yankees didn't really want Finley; they were more interested in
making it difficult for the Indians to get him, dragging out talks
with the Angels until it was too late for Cleveland to strike.
``The Yankees were a mirage,'' Bill Bavasi, the Angels' general
manager, said from Anaheim. ``We flushed them out Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi provided the answer to the first part of the question,
too. ``We set the bar at a certain level,'' he said, and the
Indians refused to jump that high.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi declined to provide details, but the Angels wanted
Enrique Wilson, the attractive young second baseman, and three
minor league prospects, not necessarily all top-flight ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very realistic, in our opinion, in expecting what to
get back,'' Bavasi said. ``We don't feel we overcharged.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians did, especially with Finley's poor record this
season, and chose not to play.

   Danka Business Systems plans to report first-quarter results
this week, and revenue will probably be way down, debt high and

six months ago, no one was certain that Danka would make it at all.
But ever since last fall, when Danka's board plucked Larry Switzer
from Fruit of the Loom to be chief executive and selected Brian
Merriman from Toshiba as president, the two men have been cutting,
chopping, negotiating and otherwise wrenching Danka back from the

   STUDY HINTS AT LIMIT OF WEB SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of people with Internet access who are making
purchases from Web sites declined slightly in the second quarter of
1999 after four sequential quarters of growth, according to
Greenfield Online, an Internet market research firm. The study
hints at the limits of market penetration of the medium as a
shopping platform _ suggesting a ceiling that has been unknown
until now.
</P>
<P>
   SIFTING THROUGH NEWS ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   The ability for virtually anyone with Internet access to operate
an electronic clipping service has spawned thousands of
do-it-yourself news summaries in addition to news links on big
portal sites. Some of the digest sites are catching on with a
discerning crowd _ including reporters and editors, who rely on the
sites to help filter information on the Web.

   AMERICA ONLINE FENDS OFF MICROSOFT

   The dispute between America Online and Microsoft over access to

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ NATO troops were guarding the half-built
Serbian Orthodox cathedral here after a thunderous explosion
damaged the interior and woke the city early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, at 1:20 a.m., did little structural damage to the
Cathedral of Holy Salvation, but it roused condemnation from church
leaders and United Nations and NATO representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sava Janjic, known as Father Sava, spokesman for Bishop
Artemije, the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo,
denounced the bombing as part of a campaign by Kosovo Albanians to
remove all traces of the church in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack follows several others on churches in Kosovo, mostly
on those built since 1981, when communist restrictions were lifted
and Serbian religious nationalism revived.
</P>
<P>
   The main church in the western town of Djakovica has been
demolished, and two others have been seriously damaged. Several
other churches have been desecrated in the six weeks since Serbian
forces left the province and Kosovo's Albanian refugees returned.
The real gems of architecture, including 12th-century monasteries
and churches, are under NATO protection and have survived
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo condemned
the bombing, calling it a ``cowardly attack against a place of
worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the United Nations chief administrator for
Kosovo, visited the site Sunday and said he would not accept such
acts of revenge regardless of what the Albanians had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the brick-and-cement shell of the cathedral, two small
holes and scorch marks indicated where the charges had exploded,
shattering bricks and twisting an iron girder. The interior
scaffolding was barely disturbed. Outside, the cathedral, with its
aluminium-covered domes and golden cross, looked serene amid a
wasteland of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not someone who knew what he was doing,'' said a
security expert working with one of the international relief
organizations. ``Or he was just making a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   However ineffective the blast, the message will not be lost on
the small number of Serbs remaining in Pristina. Sunday, the entire
Serbian population of the southeastern town of Zitinje packed what
belongings they could and fled Kosovo after weeks of intimidation
and violence, the American peacekeepers told Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   With an American military escort, a convoy of 60 cars, tractors
and trailers moved toward the border of Serbia proper. All of
Zitinje's 450 Serbs were in the convoy, said a soldier observing
the exodus. The town's Albanians number 650.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, which had reverberated with the sound of the church
bombing hours earlier, the Albanian residents seemed to give little
thought to the explosion. Music and loud applause rose from the
soccer stadium a few blocks away Sunday afternoon as Albanians
enjoyed the first live concert since the end of the war. Children
splashed in the fountain on the square, and youths climbed into the
ruins of the Serbian special police headquarters, bombed by NATO in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile,
showed more concern for Russian peacekeepers' treatment of the
chief of staff of the rebel force, Agim Ceku, who was stopped and
briefly detained on Saturday when he failed to produce identity
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders angrily protested the action as proof of Russian
anti-Albanian bias, but a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeepers
played down the incident, saying the Russians followed standard
procedure.

VARGAS MUST FORGET PAST FOR FUTURE'S SAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might be that the only person who can bring down Fernando
Vargas is Fernando Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   And based on recent events, no one will be surprised if one of
boxing's brightest young stars flickers and then fades into
darkness as a result of his own self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It might turn out that the 21-year-old IBF junior middleweight
champion is innocent of assault, for which he was arrested with
four companions July 25 outside Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the manner in which he placed himself in this position
and handled a difficult situation should be disturbing to anyone
who cares about this normally friendly young man who can't seem to
grow up.
</P>
<P>
   His key failure on the day of his arrest became evident after he
fought with the boyfriend of a woman he was with, or was beaten by
two men, depending on who tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the smart thing to do would have been to leave and
call the police, if in fact he was a victim. Instead, he apparently
called his buddies from Oxnard, Calif., and had them come to the
home, where they allegedly pummeled a second man and established
the grounds for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He chose revenge and its ramifications in spite of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   That decision is a symptom of his greatest weakness: He reverts
to the don't-you-dare-disrespect-me street kid of his childhood
when he's among his friends in Oxnard. And, as evidenced by the
beating incident, that equates to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason his promotional firm, Main Events, has had
him live and train much of his career on the East Coast; he's
separated from the elements many fear will lead to his demise.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's a better solution. Vargas must let go of the
past, which, frankly, might take more strength and determination
than he has.
</P>
<P>
   He must stop and think about his promising future _ a lifetime
of financial security for his family, unlimited fame, a sense of
tremendous accomplishment, the ability to do some good with his
celebrity and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Weigh that against momentary satisfaction that revenge or any
other base instinct might provide and it's no contest. Indeed, to
trade a dream life for a nightmare in prison or on the streets in
the name of some macho street code is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, who is bright despite evidence to the contrary, must see
that.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his sense of loyalty _ an admirable quality _ is
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   All those who comprise Team Vargas were there when he was an
amateur. That's how loyal he is. Obviously, that sense of
responsibility also extends to those who he fought with and for
since he was a child on the rough streets of Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable. It's also stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas has said repeatedly he cares deeply about his family,
particularly his beloved son, Fernando Jr. And he has a longtime
girlfriend, his son's mother, who must have been hurt tremendously
by the genesis of last week's incident _ his liaison with a
stripper.
</P>
<P>
   What about them? Don't his loyalties and responsibilities to
them supersede those to his friends? And isn't his family more
precious than his perilous pride?
</P>
<P>
   If the answer to each of these questions is yes _ and Fernando
would agree it is _ it's time to prove it. It's time to prove he
can be a mature, responsible adult who can establish priorities in
his life and abide by them, not a street thug who can't handle
success.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of Vargas' problem is his disposition. The fact
his father abandoned his family when he was a child, at least in
part has left him with a chip on his shoulder. He's wound up so
tightly that he's ready to fight _ in or out of the ring _ at
almost any time. It's as if he's convinced the world is against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? The opposite is true. Much of the world sees
him as an exciting, charismatic, immensely talented athlete who has
a chance to do something special and is opening its loving arms to
him.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to him to accept the embrace. Vargas must look into the
mirror and ask himself this question, ``What do I want?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Reid ready? WBA junior middleweight champ David Reid doesn't
have to fight tough Keith Mullings on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   He could face a string of nobodies and wait for a big-money shot
at Vargas or Oscar De La Hoya. That he's not is admirable and could
prove to be wise.
</P>
<P>
   Mullings (16-5-1, with 11 knockouts) lost his WBC super
welterweight title to Francisco Castillejo _ who could be De La
Hoya's opponent at the Staples Center in December _ but is a crafty
boxer capable of giving anyone a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   Reid (13-0, seven KOs) _ coming off a marginal performance in a
decision over quick, awkward Kevin Kelly last month _ is willing to
learn his craft under fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only his 13th fight,'' said trainer Al Mitchell,
referring to the Kelly bout. ``He's still learning. I'm glad that
happened at the time it did. He'll learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to find a guy to stand in front of him and
get knocked out,'' Mitchell added. ``That's not what we want,
that's not what will be good for him in the long run. He's learning
on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reid of Mullings: ``I !ital!need these fights to get ready
for the Vargases and De La Hoyas. Yeah, it's risky, but I can
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   He probably will. Prediction: Reid by unanimous decision, which
will repair some of the damage done to his image by Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   On the Reid-Mullings card, San Fernando Valley product Lance
Whitaker will face unbeaten Monte Barrett in a 10-round heavyweight
bout.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker (18-1, 16 KOs) is coming off a loss to Lou Savarese in
which he almost knocked out the winner. Like Reid, Whitaker didn't
look for an easy opponent to rebuild any lost confidence; Barrett
(20-0, 12 KOs) is one of the best young heavyweights out there.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitaker loses, it will set him back considerably; if he
wins, a title shot might be around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The card will be televised on HBO's ``Boxing After Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More Reid: Reid and Co. once again dismissed questions about
his droopy eye, even though it seemed he had difficulty seeing
rights landed by Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel said his youth was at the root of the problem, not his
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (left) hand was down. It's as simple as that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ruelas watch: Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas are scheduled to
return to the ring Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Ruelas will face Jose Rodriguez in Miami on Telemundo.
Rafael Ruelas will take on Hicklet Lau the following night in Las
Vegas on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, trainer Joe Goossen will not be in their
corners as both are working with new people.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who have followed the Ruelases' careers wonder
whether they should come back. Goossen doesn't believe it's his
place to say such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect me to tell guys who have done this their
whole lives what to do with their lives _ even their boxing
lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If they win this weekend and move back into the championship
picture _ as is the plan _ Goossen won't bemoan the fact he won't
be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that they're successful, obviously someone is
doing the right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ At the Pond: Guty Espadas will seek his 10th straight victory
when he faces Prangky Mamuaya in a 10-round junior featherweight
Aug. 9 in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   In the co-main event, Israel Vazquez faces Nelson Medina in a
junior featherweight bout. &QL;

EDITORIAL: LEGISLATION BY STEALTH  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Wash., Idaho)  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, August 2:
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Republicans swept to power on Capitol Hill in
1994, they adopted a strategy of attaching last-minute legislative
proposals, or riders, to essential appropriations bills. The point
is to insure passage of controversial changes in policy that might
not survive if subjected to full hearings and debate as
freestanding bills. The Democrats have used this profoundly
undemocratic device, but the Republicans have perfected it _
especially the Western Republicans, who once again have produced a
batch of anti-environmental riders aimed at helping their allies in
the oil, gas, timber, mining and ranching businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Their vehicle this year is the Interior Department spending
bill, debated briefly on the Senate floor last week and likely to
come up again this week. In the name of fiscal restraint, the
Republicans have already slashed President Clinton's requests for
several important land acquisition and conservation programs. But
that has not stopped them from rewarding their special friends.
</P>
<P>
   One rider has already been approved, and it may be the worst of
the lot. With various contributions from Slade Gorton of
Washington, Harry Reid of Nevada and Larry Craig of Idaho, the
rider would overturn the 1872 Mining Law and later rulings by the
Interior Department that limited companies mining on federal lands
to one five-acre site per mine to dump their mine wastes. The
amendment will allow the companies to use as much public land as
they need to store mountains of toxic wastes, threatening the
landscape and increasing the potential damage to streams, fish and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Two other riders deserve note. One would invite federal agencies
to ignore their duty under present law to conduct detailed wildlife
surveys before proceeding with timber sales and other activities
that could destroy habitat for fragile species. The other, devised
by Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, would invite the Interior
Department to renew thousands of expiring grazing permits on
millions of acres of federal land without requiring ranchers to
adopt responsible grazing practices mandated by the secretary of
the interior to minimize damage to the land and streams.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the House has been largely unaffected by the rider
mania, with one big exception. Urged on by home builders,
Republicans added a rider to an energy and water appropriations
bill that, despite some last-minute softening, would unnecessarily
complicate the administration's efforts to prevent the rapid loss
of valuable wetlands to development and other commercial
activities. This provision could be harmful to New York City, which
needs to preserve its upstate wetlands in order to protect the
purity of its water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened to veto the energy and water
bill, as well as the Interior appropriations bill, if they arrive
on Clinton's desk in their present form. But responsible members of
Congress can avoid that fate if they will recognize these
amendments for what they are _ special favors for powerful interest
groups _ and eliminate them from the bills.

ATLANTA MAYOR ACTS QUICKLY TO FILL GAPS IN CRISIS COVERAGE  
 SQUABBLES PERSIST OVER KENNEDY REPORTING  
 A WELL-KNOWN FACE IS TAKING TO THE STREETS  
 FALLOWS JOINS THE GROWING STAFF OF AN INTERNET BUSINESS MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y.)  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching the horrifying news about the rampage of a deranged
gunman in Atlanta last Thursday, some were struck by how quickly
the city's mayor appeared on the scene, and how regularly he
briefed reporters as the crisis unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Atlanta journalists were surprised, too. And even
though they have not always had the smoothest relationships with
Mayor Bill Campbell, most gave him high marks for preventing rumors
from overtaking the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to commend him for being accessible and for being in
command of the situation,'' said David Roberts, the vice president
and news director of WXIA, the Atlanta NBC affiliate, whose
helicopter pictures were the first to be seen nationally, via the
MSNBC cable network. ``The leadership role he took in disseminating
information made it easier to prevent the reporting of speculation,
rumor and potential misinformation to viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Carter, news director of WSB, Atlanta's ABC affiliate,
agreed. ``There certainly was an ease of information, which we are
not accustomed to,'' said Carter, adding that he had worked at
stations in six other cities and had never seen such cooperation
from city officials. ``Not that it was fast and furious, but it was
forthright and full of detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists did point out that, in his zeal to keep them
updated, the mayor conveyed incorrect information at one point
(saying the police believed the shooter, Mark O. Barton, had killed
his wife and two children after, not before, killing nine people in
two brokerage offices).
</P>
<P>
   CNN, although based in Atlanta, relied at the outset on local
stations' news reports, as it does in times of crisis elsewhere
around the country. The stations affiliated with ABC, CBS, Fox and
NBC are all CNN affiliates; the Fox station, WAGA, also serves the
Fox News Channel, one of CNN's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Station news directors attributed the smoothness to two things:
the scope of the tragedy and the fact that Atlanta's police chief,
Beverly Harvard, was out of town when the gunman struck,
eliminating the sort of jockeying that often occurs between a
mayor's staff and the police about the logistics of releasing
information to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to disparage Chief Harvard at all,'' Carter said, ``but
there was a void there, so the mayor stepped in to help.''
Campbell, who was elected in November 1993, has been through other
such crises, most notably the Olympic Park bombing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it will come to be seen as a watershed
moment,'' Carter said. ``But it certainly was refreshing.''
</P>

   Squabbles Persist Over Kennedy Reporting
</P>
<P>
   By late last week, the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. had finally
begun to fade as a news story, but at least one issue lingered in
the world of network correspondents: who knew what, and when did
they know it?
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Media Talk said that the CBS correspondent Bob Orr
was the first to reveal, a few days after Kennedy's plane was
reported missing, the details of the radar track that indicated
Kennedy had turned out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   But some at ABC News are angry at CBS News for stealing their
thunder. That is because Lisa Stark of ABC News was the first to
disclose _ on Saturday, July 17 _ the radar reports that showed the
plane beginning the precipitous nose dive that eventually resulted
in the deaths of Kennedy, his wife and her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest relevant radar story was that the plane took a
sharp descent into the sea,'' said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for
ABC News. ``And ABC News had it before CBS did.'' Ms. Stark, Ms.
Murphy said, was the first to report that news, and CBS Radio and
Orr of CBS News ran stories counter to Ms. Stark's through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   From July 17 to July 19, the National Transportation Safety
Board denied that radar indicated the plane had begun a nose dive.
On July 19, Orr again reported the NTSB denials. Later that day,
the safety board finally revealed that the radar did indicate a
nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stark said the Kennedy accident was ``one of those
skip-and-jump stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone had the one thing they broke,'' she said. ``But we
broke that story.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr defended his reporting. ``This was such a highly competitive
atmosphere that I think everybody was out there trying to be first
and trying to get it right,'' he said. ``The only thing I would say
is that we were aggressive in what we knew and when we knew it. The
thing that made me most gratified was that in the high-pressured
environment we had over the course of several days, we didn't make
any major mistakes and that's as important as reporting those
smaller incremental developments.''

   A Well-Known Face Is Taking to the Streets
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who was that familiar-looking dark-maned man standing
on West 88th Street in Manhattan a few weeks ago, wielding a
microphone and smiling into the camera? It looked like George
Stephanopoulos, but when he does television, he does it in the
precisely lighted, air-conditioned safety of an ABC studio.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to do new things,'' Stephanopoulos said,
confirming that a few weeks ago he began going out with camera
crews, acquiring new skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a commentator in the studio; now I'm learning how to
put together reported pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular sidewalk-pounding ABC News correspondents need not worry
that he will be taking one of their jobs just yet. For the
foreseeable future, Stephanopoulos will report only on political
topics, given his background as a campaign organizer, White House
aide and commentator for ABC's political coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, he will still be a political analyst, but he will
not necessarily remain in the studio. (He occasionally fills in as
a substitute host on ``Good Morning America.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be the first reporter to start out in another
profession,'' said David Westin, president of ABC News, citing
several network news correspondents who previously worked in other
professions, usually as lawyers. ``It makes sense to have him do
politics; that's his area of expertise. We wouldn't ask him to
cover legal issues or the medical beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said the two men had discussed expanding Stephanopoulos'
reporting career, in general terms only. Stephanopoulos said, ``I
don't have any hard and fast goals, but if the opportunity came up,
I'd love to broaden out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he has reported a piece about the use of the Internet
in campaigning, and another on how and why politicians use
late-night comedy shows. ``We came up with some great old footage
of Nixon on `Laugh-In,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That piece taught Stephanopoulos a standard Reporting 101
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to run today,'' he said Friday, ``but it got
pre-empted because of the shootings in Atlanta. I'm learning those
kinds of frustrations, too.''

   Fallows Joins the Growing Staff of an Internet Business Magazine
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in journalism has nine lives, James Fallows does.
Fallows, a former editor of U.S. News and World Report, outspoken
press critic, author of ``Breaking the News: How the Media
Undermine American Democracy'' and _ most recently _ Microsoft
consultant, will join The Industry Standard magazine as a
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Weber, the editor in chief of the Standard, a weekly
Internet-business magazine published by International Data Group,
is expected to announce the appointment Tuesday. And Fallows will
have plenty of company: within the last month, Weber has lured
reporters and editors away from several news organizations,
including Thomas Goetz from The Wall Street Journal, Kenneth Li
from The New York Daily News, and staff members from Inc. magazine,
Wired and The San Jose Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Weber hired Amy Bernstein, the editorial director
of Brill's Content magazine. He said the editorial staff, which
last month had 27 members, would grow to 45 by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   Weber said that he had begun to think of the San Francisco-based
Standard as the Rolling Stone of the Internet business economy, and
of Fallows as a columnist who will help attract a broader
readership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on the phenomenon of Internet business,'' Weber
said. ``But it is such a big and influential phenomenon with so
many different dimensions that there's an enormous amount of
interest from people who are not in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Standard's unaudited circulation base is 115,000. (By
contrast, Wired's is 425,000.) It says its advertising pages grew
140 percent from June 1998 to June 1999, with gains averaging 30
percent every quarter since the magazine was founded in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows said that in joining the staff, he was ``trying to
create some version of my pre-U.S. News life, which is writing
books, magazine articles and writing a frequent column.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My plan is basically to write about the outside
world and the Internet. What should the outside world make of these
castles being made of sand or of steel girders every day? How
should people building these castles think of themselves
historically and in the eyes of their citizens? Think of me as an
interested amateur observer.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUEBLO, Colo. _ Amtrak's first new train in a generation, the
fastest on the continent, is scheduled to be zipping passengers
past crowded streets, highways and runways from Washington to
Boston by the end of the year. But its first trials are being held
here on a desert track that runs amid the cholla cactus and the
rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   Tests are going well, engineers say, but there are still
technical questions to work out. Not to mention what happened to
the antelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding enough for the barbecue tonight?'' joked Wayne
Stadler, a test controller, as he and Real Sylvain, an engineer,
peered at the undercarriage of the train in search of identifiable
remains of an antelope it hit on the most recent lap.
</P>
<P>
   Antelope are plentiful this year at the railroad industry's test
track, where the train, the Acela, has been running for up to 16
hours a day. It barely seems to strain in 6-minute laps around a
test track 13.5 miles long. Sometimes it reaches 160 mph, although
its top speed will be only 150 when it carries passengers in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its speed, the Acela (the name is meant to convey both
acceleration and excellence) is unlikely to encounter antelope when
it begins service in the urban corridors from New York to Boston
and Washington. It is supposed to shave nearly two hours from the
Boston-to-New York run and 15 minutes from Washington to New York,
where current track equipment prohibits faster travel.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem is how the train will handle curves.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers, Bombardier Inc. of Quebec and the
French-British venture GEC Alsthom, have designed the coaches to
tilt in as they go around corners, a little like a bicyclist
leaning into a turn.
</P>
<P>
   The tilt, which moves the upper portion of the passenger car
while the undercarriage hugs the rails, is controlled by one of 21
computers in the locomotive of the Acela.
</P>
<P>
   The computer decides how far to tilt the cars after reading the
train's speed, the angle at which the tracks are banked, the
sideways forces as the locomotive goes around a corner and the turn
angle of the trucks, the structures that hold the wheels, relative
to the body of the locomotive itself.
</P>
<P>
   The computer tells each of the eight passenger cars how far to
tilt _ up to 4.2 degrees in either direction, which translates to a
six-inch movement at the top of the car. The signals are sent in
sequence, so that each car tilts at a different moment as it passes
through the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we said, `Oh, that's just a detail,''' said Philippe
Moslener, a design engineer with Bombardier. But tests showed
passengers would be more comfortable if the cars tilted in
sequence, rather than in unison. ``It's not a detail at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tilt partly compensates for the sideways forces in a turn.
If it compensates completely, Moslener said, it somehow induces
motion sickness in passengers; designers are now experimenting with
compensating for 60 to 70 percent of the sideways forces.
</P>
<P>
   When the system was run as a test when the train stood still,
the cars rocked like an ocean liner in a steady swell. But when the
train is moving, the tilt will reduce the sensation of going around
a curve, making for a more comfortable ride.
</P>
<P>
   Within sight of Pike's Peak, with signs in the parking lot
warning of rattlesnakes, engineers are testing the train's
acceleration (about a mile per hour each second, roughly 20 percent
better than the Metroliner), stopping distance and other
characteristics. At 140 mph, a new Acela engine pulling six
old-style cars to simulate the weight of the new ones ran smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   With no reference point but the occasional cactus, speed was
hard for a passenger to judge. But when the train slowed down to 60
mph, it seemed to be crawling.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a second Acela locomotive, outfitted with the new cars,
was undergoing tests while parked. The passenger cars were still
bare of seats. But for every row there was a surge-protected power
outlet for laptop computers. And overhead were airline-style
luggage bins that were twice the size of those on most passenger
jets, and positioned higher to make it easier for passengers to
stand.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor were coffinlike plywood boxes filled with lead
bars, to simulate the weight of seats and passengers. Technicians
prowled the cars with standard tools like wrenches and screwdrivers
as well as laptop computers that talked to computerized components
of the train.
</P>
<P>
   When the cars enter service, sharp-eyed passengers may notice
changes designed to make the train safer in a crash. For example,
at the end of each car, in the four corners, are four steel
structures, each the size of a large flowerpot. In a collision,
these would match up end to end, absorbing some of the impact. And
the vestibule area, around the doors, is designed as a crumple
zone, so the passenger seating area would stay intact.
</P>
<P>
   The main innovation, though, is the way the locomotives use
electronic tricks that were not practical 20 years ago to get more
horsepower at higher reliability than the older technology allowed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's Metroliners take alternating current from the overhead
lines and convert it to direct current for the motors that drive
the train. But these DC motors produce less horsepower than AC
motors for each unit of electricity, and they wear out faster.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the single overhead wire supplies AC current
in which the electrons dance back and forth 60 times per second,
all to a single beat. Big motors that run on such single-phase AC
do not operate reliably.
</P>
<P>
   So the Acela converts the AC to DC and then back into three
different AC circuits, each on a different, linked beat, like a
chorus singing ``Row, row, row your boat'' as a round. That allows
Amtrak to use the kind of modern motors in wide use in other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The innovations are worthwhile, railroad officials said, because
after years of work new overhead electric lines have been installed
from New Haven all the way to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is being tested, including the pantographs, the
armlike structures that rise from the top of the locomotives to
contact the overhead power lines. At more than 100 mph, they tend
to develop lift, like a hand extended from a moving car, and that
interferes with keeping a constant pressure of about 22.5 pounds on
the power line. So the Acela's pantographs carry little winglike
structures, which the railroad calls ailerons, that can be adjusted
to maintain the correct pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have been sweating the details _ quite literally.
Temperatures here rose over 95 degrees one afternoon, forcing the
train to slow down to a mere 80 mph, as required by a national
regulation because welded steel rail begins to change shape at that
temperature.

IN MAGAZINE INTERVIEW, HILLARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT PRESIDENT'S
AFFAIR
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By CRAGG HINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a new interview, says
she believed President Clinton's marital infidelities had been
``conquered'' a decade ago and, even though that was not true, she
views his affair with Monica Lewinsky as ``a sin of weakness''
rather than one of malice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enormous pain, enormous anger, but I have been
with him half my life, and he is a very, very good man,'' the first
lady said. ``We just have a deep connection that transcends
whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   She appears to blame her husband's sexual affairs on childhood
``abuse,'' but that seemed to be a reference to disputes between
his mother and grandmother rather than physical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's comments come in an interview in the inaugural
issue of Talk magazine to be published this week. The magazine
issued a press release with bits of the interview, and more
extensive excerpts appeared in the Sunday Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   The White House _ neither the president's press operation nor
the first lady's separate staff _ had immediate substantive comment
on the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The article will speak for itself,'' said Marsha Berry, the
first lady's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not answer a reporter's questions about the
interview as he attended church Sunday near the White House. The
first lady remained at the executive mansion.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, a former top Clinton adviser and now an
ABC News commentator, said on the network's This Week program that
the first lady's political advisers were ``a bit blindsided'' by
her comments, which came to public light late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The interview is likely to throw the president's extra-marital
affairs _ and especially the one with Lewinsky, which took place in
the White House _ into the center of the first lady's expected
campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's responsible for his own behavior whether I'm there or 100
miles away,'' Hillary Clinton said in the interview when asked if
their marriage could survive the strains of a campaign that will
separate the first couple geographically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the confrontation with the person, and then it's
their responsibility, whether it's gambling, drinking or whatever.
Nobody can do it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Talk article was written by Lucinda Franks, an author who
shared a Pulitzer Prize with Thomas Powers for national reporting
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   A Hillary Clinton staff member quoted in the article said the
first lady had ``barely spoken'' to the president for eight months
after the semen stain on one of Lewinsky's dresses was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Melanne Verveer, the first lady's chief of staff, said that as
the president had attempted to make up she had seen ``physical
passion'' come back into the couple's lives.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the interview appears to be the frankest that
either Clinton or his wife have given about what he has earlier
described as rocky patches in their almost 25-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos pointed out that it was interview of the type
that for months ``Ms. Clinton swore she would not give.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of surprise in the White House and even
among Hillary's top team,'' Stephanopoulos. He said a meeting of
the first lady's team was planned for later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The former presidential aide noted ``a pattern'' of expansive
interviews by Hillary Clinton. He said she had become comfortable
with an interviewer during the 1992 campaign and suggested that
then-President Bush also should be challenged about affairs _ an
insinuation she quickly withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady acknowledged her familiarity with extramarital
affairs by her husband and her belief that they ended as he began
to campaign for the White House in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be alert to it, vigilant in helping,'' Hillary
Clinton said. ``I thought this was resolved 10 years ago. I thought
he conquered it. I thought he understood it, but he didn't go deep
enough or work hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   She expressed certainty that there had been times in their
marriage when Clinton had not strayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we did have a very good stretch, years and years of
nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the possible causes of her husband's affairs and his
``abuse'' as a child, Hillary Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he has weaknesses. Yes, he needs to be more responsible,
more disciplined. But it is remarkable given his background that he
turned out to be the kind of person he is, capable of such
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so young, barely four, when he was scarred by abuse.
There was terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother. A
psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle of a
conflict between two women is the worst possible situation. There
is always a desire to please each one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpts, at least, the first lady did not detail the
incidents to which she referred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been working on himself very hard in the past year,''
she said. ``He has become more aware of his past and what was
causing his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in Christian theology there are sins of weakness and
sins of malice, and this was a sin of weakness,'' the first lady
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady referred to her own mother, Dorothy Rodham, as
being the child of a broken marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has some dysfunction in their families,'' she said.
``They have to deal with it. You don't walk away if you love
someone. You help the person.''
</P>
<P>
   When author Franks suggested the biblical analogy from
Corinthians, the first lady said: ``Love endures all things? No, I
love that, but I was thinking of when Peter betrayed Jesus three
times, and Jesus knew it but loved him anyway. Life is not a linear
progression. It has many paths and challenges, and we need to help
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said she and the president ``have love'' but
added: ``I don't believe in denying things. I believe in working
through it. Is he ashamed? Yes. Is he sorry? Yes. But does this
negate everything he has done as a husband, a father, a
president?''

EDITORIAL: A TIME OF TRANSITION FOR ARABS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Aug. 2:
</P>
<P>
   As Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, moves toward
intensified negotiations with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians,
encouraging trends in the wider Arab world may be working in his
favor, helping to create a more conducive climate for regional
peace. These changes include generational passages of power in
several countries, a strengthening Egyptian economy and a reversal
of attitudes in Algeria, whose president met last week with Barak
and praised his peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   None of these supportive developments will conjure away tough
issues like the future of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and the
Golan Heights. But the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and
Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, may find it easier to make their
share of compromises if they do not have to worry about accusations
of betrayal from other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak is again acting as a crucial
intermediary with Arafat. At Barak's behest, he is now trying to
persuade the Palestinian leader to consider postponing some Israeli
withdrawals promised under the Wye River agreement and moving
straight to negotiations on major issues like Jerusalem. Mubarak's
position has been strengthened by four years of successful economic
reforms that have broadened his political support at home.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, King Abdullah took over earlier this year after the
death of his father, King Hussein, a committed peacemaker. Abdullah
is already trying to arrange a meeting between Barak and Assad,
suggesting that he means to be as active as his father.
</P>
<P>
   A new king has also taken the throne in Morocco, following the
death last month of King Hassan II. It is too early to judge King
Mohammed VI, the new monarch. But at his father's funeral last week
he impressed Israelis by welcoming Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of leaders who seized power in Qatar in 1995
moved quickly to take a more positive attitude toward Israel. That
opening did not lead very far. But the diplomatic courtship is now
likely to resume. It could encourage younger leaders in other gulf
emirates to play a more constructive role.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria also has a new leader, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Although
his election earlier this year was stained by charges of fraud and
a withdrawal of opposition candidates, he has since taken tentative
steps toward ending a murderous civil war with Islamic
fundamentalists. Now, he appears to be trying out a more
conciliatory role internationally as well. Continued support for
peace negotiations by a country with Algeria's radical pedigree
could license others to speak out favorably as well.
</P>
<P>
   Other powers will help shape Middle East politics, especially
Saudi Arabia, which is now playing a cautious, aloof role as it
faces its own transition to a new leader. Iraq is likely to cause
trouble as long as Saddam Hussein remains in power. But with help
from Mubarak, Abdullah and others willing to speak out for peace,
Barak, Arafat and Assad may make some progress.

XEROX DUSTS OFF ITS USED COPIERS  
 THE NAME GAME AT HEWLETT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xerox Corp. is not satisfied with just being the world's biggest
seller of new copiers. Now it is using warehouse sales and Internet
auctions to attack the $1 billion-plus market for used copiers, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   More is at stake than added revenue. While Xerox dominates the
corporate market, it has never had more than a toehold among small
businesses, the prime customers for used machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want that segment of the market to see that Xerox has
affordable options for them,'' said Andrei Hall, vice president for
Xerox's nine-month-old Certified Pre-Owned Business Unit.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it wants those companies to think of Xerox when
they can afford more. Xerox's research shows that one of every four
small businesses buying a used copier is buying its first copier.
If that copier is a Xerox, its next purchase might be an expensive
Xerox digital copier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more small businesses out there than large
corporations, and they are the ones that are growing and hiring,''
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's group has already trucked refurbished copiers to 40
cities, where it held two-day sales in rented hotel or showroom
spaces. He insists he has not trucked unsold equipment away, and
plans to hold at least 60 more such sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Xerox began selling used equipment on www.xerox.com,
its Web site. In July, its lower-priced used equipment began
appearing on two auction sites, www.ubid.com and www.onsale.com.
Today, Xerox and Ubid Inc. will formally announce their alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warehouse sales just hit a few cities, but the Internet
can help us reach people all over the U.S.,'' Hall said.

   Spinoff Is Christened With Care by Hewlett
</P>
<P>
   What takes four months of secretive work and requires the brain
power of dozens of highly paid professionals? The answer: coining
the word ``Agilent,'' the name adopted last week by a
Hewlett-Packard corporate spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Barnholt, chief executive of the new company, announced
the name at a news briefing after a meeting with several hundred
employees and a live video feed to the roughly 43,000 others who
will be joining Agilent. Employees, Barnholt said, gave the new
name a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because they were expecting something else, such
as any of the several dozen possible names that Hewlett officials
had sought trademarks for with the help of Landor Associates, a San
Francisco-based corporate-naming division of Young &AMP; Rubicam that
Hewlett hired in March. Among those names were Tessant, an amalgam
of ``test'' and ``measurement,'' the company's primary activities
as a maker of test and measurement equipment. Or perhaps they were
just happy to have a name, having toiled for four months as
``Newco.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming up with Agilent Technologies, Hewlett and Landor
followed what appears to be a time-worn practice in high technology
of combining an adjective, or part of one, with the letters
``ent.'' David Redhill, an executive director at Landor, insists
there was no connection between the naming of Agilent (pronounced
agile-ent) and that of Lucent, which Landor helped coin for AT&AMP;T's
celebrated spinoff. The ``nt'' simply adds weight to the end of the
word, Redhill said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with the name, and the several dozen others the
company considered, involved more than 40 naming specialists at
Landor, half a dozen committee members at Hewlett and a few
thousand employees who chimed in with their opinions via a company
Web site set up for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the work has to do with the story you want to tell
about the brand,'' Barnholt said. And that story? To Barnholt and
others who selected it, the word signifies speed, focus,
accountability and, of course, agility.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently Hewlett and Landor weren't quite agile enough:
The Web address www.agilent.com was grabbed several years ago by
Agile Enterprises, a publishing-software maker in Nashua, N.H. So
Agilent can be found at www.agilent-tech.com.

IN A PHOTO FINISH, VICTORY GALLOP WINS WHITNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ In the kind of finish that creates
legends at Saratoga, they roared down the homestretch stride for
stride Sunday, Victory Gallop and Behrens, the top candidates for
Horse of the Year, locked in a furious duel in the 72nd Whitney
Handicap. And by a bob of his head and the length of his nose,
Victory Gallop prevailed in a photo finish and staked his claim to
be recognized as the best race horse in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The two stars of racing's handicap division staged their battle
before a roaring crowd of 49,137 spectators on a torrid afternoon,
and neither the tumult of the crowd nor the burden of the heat kept
them from giving maximum efforts. They hooked up when Victory
Gallop flew from sixth place into contention in the stretch, and
then in the final eighth of a mile they left behind the six other
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan was to run right by Behrens, not creep up beside
him,'' said Jerry Bailey, who was riding Victory Gallop. ``Behrens
is a fighter, and I didn't want to give him the chance to see us.
When Behrens saw him, he dug in. Like I said, that horse is a
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Chavez, the jockey aboard Behrens, who came into the Grade
I Whitney with a four-race winning streak in stakes races, put it
bluntly: ``These two horses are the best in the world. I can't say
who is better because both of them are tough. I asked Jerry if he
knew who won the race, and he said he didn't know, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said that when he reached the turn for home, horses were
``stopping'' in front of him, so he took Behrens five horses wide.
Then Victory Gallop came streaking up on the outside and went wide,
too. For a moment, it looked as though he would shoot right past
Behrens. But Behrens refused to yield, and they mounted their duel
to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who trains Victory Gallop for Prestonwood Farm,
said it was ``a fantastic race'' that was decided when his horse
went from last place after the first half-mile and made the
bounding move that is his signature. He won the Stephen Foster at
Churchill Downs in June with a dramatic rally generated by a huge
move, too. But Walden wondered if Victory Gallop might have waited
too long in the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he makes that run, it's really scintillating to watch,''
he said. ``It's an awesome move, and he showed it again today. But
when he gets that far back in a race, it makes me nervous. And
Behrens showed guts and class. I started getting a little shaky
three jumps before the wire. But they made a tremendous move.''
</P>
<P>
   James Bond, who trains Behrens for William Clifton and the
Rudlein Stable, called it ``racing at its best,'' and added:
``Behrens has won two Grade I races, two Grade II's and lost by a
nose here. It looks to me like Horse of the Year will be settled in
the Breeders' Cup Classic this November.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop ran the mile and an eighth in 1:48 3/5, paid
$3.80 for a $2 bet to win and went home with $360,000, bringing his
career earnings to $3.5 million. Catienus finished third, 12
lengths back, and Sir Bear ran three lengths farther back in
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop and Behrens have come a long way since each ran
the Travers at Saratoga and each lost by a nose. Two years ago,
Behrens, with Jerry Bailey riding, lost that classic for
3-year-olds to Deputy Commander. Last year, Victory Gallop lost the
Travers to Coronado's Quest. In the Whitney, their noses were the
only ones that counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two champions,'' Walden said, ``showed up today.''

YANKEES ARE HAPPY TO ALLOW PETTITTE A TWO-MONTH REPRIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ George Steinbrenner was in a good mood Sunday night,
which was notable in itself because the day after the July 31 trade
deadline there is reason to reconsider what your team and your
rivals did or did not do.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not do a lot. They did not trade the left-hander
Andy Pettitte, who was given at least a two-month respite to
reprove himself to the organization. They did not trade for a
relief pitcher; rather, the organization figures it has as much or
more pitching depth to plug holes and figures that Jeff Nelson and
Mike Stanton will pitch better in the post-season, as they have
always done.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did add Jim Leyritz, the perpetually grinning
slugger who arrived here Sunday pining for another post-season
experience in pinstripes. Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, told
Steinbrenner in the hours leading to the trade deadline that he
believed this team is good enough to win. ``The manager is happy,''
said Steinbrenner, the principal owner. ``That's good by me.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for the Yankees to augment their roster
with players from outside the organization in the final two months
of the season. Before any team can trade a player, it must first
pass that player through waivers. For example: if the Yankees
decided to deal Pettitte, they would first have to expose him to
all teams through waivers. If any team claimed him _say the Anaheim
Angels placed a claim _ the Yankees then could only deal Pettitte
to the Angels or withdraw him, and then they would not be able to
trade him until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees do have some options developing within their
organization. Nelson, recovering from elbow surgery, is scheduled
to begin a rehabilitation assignment in Tampa, Fla., on Monday. He
will make four appearances, and if he comes through those without a
setback, he most likely will join the club during its West Coast
trip that begins Thursday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And both Steinbrenner and Torre spoke hopefully about the
possible return of Darryl Strawberry, currently suspended from
baseball for violating his drug after-care program. Bud Selig, the
commissioner, will most likely speak to Strawberry soon and then
reinstate him; in any event, Strawberry's 120-day suspension is
scheduled to end Aug. 11. According to Torre and Steinbrenner,
Strawberry has looked good in his workouts at the club's minor
league facility in Tampa, and, the owner said, Strawberry is
attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings every day with his wife,
Charisse. Strawberry is waiting anxiously for Selig to reinstate
him, Steinbrenner said. ``I told Darryl, `You have to wait,'''
Steinbrenner said. `` `Wait your turn, pal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once he is reinstated, Strawberry will probably be assigned to a
minor league team, and he will attempt to prove he can play left
field on a part-time basis. ``It'll be my guess he can play some
left field,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Maybe not day-in, day-out, but
he'll play some.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz ducked into the clubhouse to grab a bat for batting
practice Sunday, without noticing Steinbrenner standing nearby. But
Steinbrenner yelled at Leyritz to catch his attention, and they
hugged. Leyritz is a big-game hitter, Steinbrenner said _ ``Look at
what he hit,'' he said, referring to Leyritz's game-tying home run
in the fourth game of the 1996 World Series, the pivotal moment in
that championship. ``Talk about a big pressure moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, acquired from San Diego for Geraldo Padua, a minor
league pitcher, was among the first players to arrive at the
clubhouse before Sunday night's game against the Red Sox, and Chili
Davis and David Cone were among the first players he saw _ a big
thrill, Leyritz said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his first stint with the Yankees _ playing for
Torre in 1996 _ the manager viewed Leyritz as a guy who was tough
to deal with. ``But that doesn't necessarily mean he was a pain,''
said Torre, smiling. Leyritz wanted to play more, while Torre used
him as a role player. After the '96 season, Leyritz was traded to
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   But in speaking with Torre after the trade, Leyritz told the
manager he has a greater understanding of why the Yankees are so
successful; everything is done to help the team, he said,
everything is done for the sake of winning ball games. Leyritz is
going to be a role player in the final two months and the
post-season, as an occasional designated hitter or first baseman or
pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with him. ``Whatever they need,'' Leyritz said, ``if
it's first base, if it's third base, coming off the bench,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz had once said he would return to the Yankees one day.
``I always wanted to retire here,'' said Leyritz, 35. ``Maybe in
the next year or two, I'll have a chance to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz's dreams for the future were the only mention of
anything beyond the 1999 post-season. Steinbrenner acknowledged
that in keeping Pettitte, the Yankees now have all but assured
themselves of a difficult off season of tough financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   But they'll think about that later. With their roster mostly
intact, the Yankees have two months to prepare for the championship
chase.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: FIGHTING FOR SPACE AT THE JEFFERSON FAMILY
TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (js) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Thomas Jefferson died at Monticello, the servant who
fluffed his pillows for the final time was Burwell Colbert, the
nephew of Jefferson's slave mistress, Sally Hemings. Sally's half
brother, John Hemings, made Jefferson's coffin, and another of
Sally's nephews _ the head gardener, Wormley Hughes _ dug the
grave. Sally Hemings probably played a role as well, exercising at
least some influence over how the master of Monticello was laid out
and put away.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Jefferson's virtue argued for nearly 200 years that
this was just platonic affection between loyal slaves and a caring
master. But genetic tests last year showed that Jefferson almost
certainly fathered Sally's final son, Eston, born in 1808 _ and
that the Jeffersons and the Hemings were a family joined by common
blood. Historians who once disbelieved this connection now find it
impossible to believe that Jefferson ignored ``Dashing Sally''
while the two were young and vital and took her to his bed only in
old age. The emerging consensus is that the two became lovers
earlier and carried on longer than we yet know _ and that Jefferson
probably fathered several of the Hemings children.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is buried beneath an imposing monument in the family
graveyard at Monticello, surrounded by the graves of his white
descendants only. The question of whether to admit the black ones
to the cemetery _ and of how to verify the family lineage _ has
grown into an explosive issue for the Monticello Association, the
family group that controls the graveyard. Members of that group
seem to be treating this like a family squabble that is nobody
else's business. But this debate reverberates well beyond the
Jefferson and Hemings descendants.
</P>
<P>
   The issue spilled into public view earlier this summer, when the
novelist and Jefferson descendant Lucian K. Truscott IV invited 35
Hemings cousins to the Jefferson family reunion at Monticello. This
would have been an emotional gathering in any case, but it proved
more so after a reporter for USA Today, Dennis Cauchon, used
ancient property records to track down a possible burial place for
Sally Hemings _ beneath a newly constructed hotel or its adjacent
parking lot in downtown Charlottesville. The juxtaposition of
Jefferson's lover in an unmarked grave and the lushly appointed
cemetery where Jefferson lies at Monticello crystallized the issue
at hand. At the reunion, a descendant gave a touching but yet to be
authenticated account of how Sally regularly walked several miles
from Charlottesville to Monticello to tend Thomas Jefferson's
grave.
</P>
<P>
   The association decided not to admit the Hemings group as
members, at least not for the moment, calling for a special
committee to study the matter. Some white members seemed to make up
their minds in advance, by suggesting that the Hemings descendants
needed ``a paper trail,'' or to find a letter from Jefferson
himself acknowledging Sally's children. Truscott says that older
family members have threatened to quit the group _ and to decline
burial at Monticello _ if the Hemings group is allowed allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott is a longtime burr under the family saddle. He accused
the association of ``denying rights to our black cousins'' and
conspiring to prevent them from being buried at Monticello. He
dismissed the need for more genetic testing and said that whites
are admitted into the organization on little more than the say-so
of their friends and parents. He argues that the association was
subjecting Hemings oral history to strict scrutiny while accepting
white oral history at face value. Having invited 35 Hemingses this
year, Truscott has threatened to bring 100 to the next reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticists have said that DNA tests announced in 1998 clinched
the case that Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings' final son, Eston.
However, genetic material linked to her first child, Thomas
Woodson, did not produce a DNA match. The white Jefferson
descendants might indeed stand pat and insist on a higher threshold
of evidence. But the scholarly world is moving quickly to
accommodate what already seems clear _ that some of Sally Hemings'
children were descended from Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which oversees
Monticello, has already recognized that the plantation was built
and sustained not just by a few whites, but by 200 people, the vast
majority of whom were black. Insiders also say that the foundation
may soon officially acknowledge that Jefferson and Hemings had a
long-term relationship, bringing its position into line with
current knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson family needs to get to the same place and get
there quickly, whatever the route. What the family does will have
symbolic importance that extends well beyond the Virginia
countryside. If white Jeffersons cannot reach out to the black
people whose ancestors built Monticello _ and especially to those
who share the founder's blood _ then the prospects for harmony in
this Jeffersonian Republic seem dimmer for all of us.

4 BIRDIES ON LAST 5 HOLES LIFT WEBB TO HER FIRST MAJOR TITLE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIDDIS, Canada _ It was a great finish by a great player, and
it ended any doubt about Karrie Webb's readiness to win a major
championship. Making four birdies on her final five holes, and
erasing a late three-stroke deficit in dramatic fashion, Webb won
the du Maurier Classic by two strokes over Laura Davies for the
first major title of her young but stellar career.
</P>
<P>
   Webb finished at 11 under par for the tournament
(73-72-66-66-277), two strokes ahead of Davies (279), who shot a 72
Sunday, and three strokes ahead of Juli Inkster (280), who shot a
final-round 69, but was denied her third major title this year.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's finish was so magical, even she had trouble believing it.
She reached the 14th tee trailing Davies by three strokes, knowing
that the window of opportunity was closing rapidly. It was a
now-or-never situation, and Webb seized the moment, hitting
brilliant approach shots and making pressure putts. She birdied No.
14 after hitting an 8-iron approach shot to seven feet. She birdied
No. 15, hitting another 8-iron to eight feet, then making the putt.
She birdied No. 16, hitting a sand wedge to within eight feet, then
making still another putt.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she reached No. 18, the enthusiastic gallery, the
worried Davies and the hard-charging Webb knew something special
was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I do those things,'' said Webb, a native of
Australia who, at the age of 24 has already won 15 LPGA
tournaments, including six this year. ``If I watched it on TV, I
would have been in awe of the person doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb finished her remarkable run with another birdie at the par
5, 473-yard No. 18, reaching the back fringe in two shots, chipping
to five feet, then making her birdie putt. That gave Webb a
one-stroke lead over Davies, who had yet to play the 18th hole. Now
Webb had to wait. If Davies eagled No. 18, she would still win. If
Davies birdied, there would be a playoff. But if Davies made par or
worse, Webb's improbable comeback would be complete.
</P>
<P>
   After a solid 3-iron drive into the fairway at No. 18, Davies
hit her 4-iron approach shot into the right rough near the green,
and the ball settled in a terrible lie, nearly 40 feet from the
hole. Davies did well to chip the ball 15 feet past the hole,
leaving her with a birdie putt that could force a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   When Davies' putt slid inches past the left edge of the hole,
the realization hit Webb that she had won. Standing by the 18th
green, Webb immediately burst into tears of joy. She was hugged by
her mother, Evelyn, who had traveled from Australia to witness the
highlight of her daughter's career, while several players and
caddies who had remained for the finish surrounded Webb to
congratulate her.
</P>
<P>
   It was a well-deserved moment for Webb, who has become a
dominant player at a young age, but who has been burdened with
heavy expectations. Until Sunday, no matter how often Webb won, she
was regularly asked when she would win a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a set of questions that I don't get asked anymore,''
said Webb, who won $180,000, and leads the LPGA money list with
$1.25 million, already the most ever won by an LPGA player in one
year. ``I have only been out here three and a half years. For
things to have happened so quickly, it's hard to set goals, but I
love playing golf, and I love having a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what was going through my mind out there.
I know that there was a lot of adrenaline. I was nervous. But I
have so much confidence in myself, I just step up and do it. The
last six holes, it was like someone else was playing for me, like I
was watching someone else do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Davies, it was a disappointing defeat, as she suddenly lost
control of a tournament that had appeared to be hers. She had
started the day with a two-stroke lead over Dawn Coe-Jones, who
finished fourth (284), and four strokes ahead of Webb. Putting, a
chronic problem for Davies, kept her from winning the fifth major
of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Davies made a costly three-putt bogey from 30 feet at No. 17,
hitting her first putt five feet past the hole, then missing the
comeback. Davies also three-putted No. 18, but it was the crucial
miss, a downhill 15-footer that would have forced a playoff, that
she will remember the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I holed the putt,'' said Davies, who needed 34 putts
Sunday after needing only 30 during each of the first three rounds.
``If Webbie hadn't been so good, level par would have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best player on tour proved it again. I must admit, I was
watching the board for Webbie all day long. I got beat by a better
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb actually started her tournament-clinching run at No. 13,
when she made a 20-foot putt to save par, keeping her three strokes
behind Davies at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putt I made on No. 13 probably won it for me,'' Webb said.
``If I had made bogey there, I really didn't have a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster never made a final-round charge, but having already won
the United States Women's Open and the LPGA McDonald's Championship
this year, Inkster refused to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished third, and I played pretty well today,'' said
Inkster, who remained just one victory shy of qualifying for the
LPGA Hall of Fame. ``The first two days, I hit it poorly and putted
well. The last two days, I hit it well and couldn't putt. Go
figure. That's golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday's back nine, Webb made playing golf look easy. The
future looks fabulous for Webb. But the present isn't too bad
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever try to think of myself as the best player in the
world,'' Webb said. ``But I played like I was.'' &QL;

WITH BUDGET NEAR, NEW YORK LEGISLATURE IS TURNING TO OTHER ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-LEGIS-BILLS) 
(rk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With the new state budget nearly completed, Gov.
George Pataki and legislative leaders are turning their attention
to other issues, including an overhaul of special education and a
bailout for Nassau County, along with criminal justice proposals,
like expanding the state's DNA database for tracking criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The 211 members of the state Legislature are to return here this
week to pass a $73 billion budget that, if it is not in place by
Thursday, will set a record as the latest budget in state history.
The budget was due on April 1, but for the 15th year in a row,
lawmakers have failed to meet that deadline. The tardiest budget
was adopted in 1997, 125 days overdue.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the stalemate over the budget has made it almost
impossible for lawmakers to do any other work. To date, the two
houses of the Legislature have passed just 607 bills jointly,
putting them at a pace to pass fewer laws than at any time in this
century. The last time that a session was this unproductive was in
1998, when the Legislature passed 671 bills, compared with 900 to
1,000 in most years.
</P>
<P>
   The relative inaction means that lawmakers will have to return
in the next few months for a special session to deal with
unfinished business. Chief among the unfinished work is determining
the fate of a state law that adds $2.6 billion a year to hospital
bills, mostly to help hospitals train doctors and care for the
poor. The law expires at the end of the year and is the focus of
intense debate between business leaders, who want the assessments
scaled back, and hospital workers and executives who say the
charges are essential to their survival.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Pataki and legislative leaders have said they plan
to address as many measures as they can over the next few days
before wrapping up the 1999 legislative session. Although many
proposals are being negotiated by Pataki, the Assembly speaker,
Sheldon Silver, and the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno,
the ones that are considered most likely to produce compromises
center on criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   One of those measures would give law enforcement officials
greater authority to collect DNA samples from felons and to log
them into state computers, as is now done with fingerprints. The
state already collects such DNA information _ usually from a saliva
sample _ but only from people convicted of sex crimes and some
other violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, has been pushing to have DNA samples
collected from all felons, saying it would allow law enforcement
officials to use evidence gathered at crime scenes, like a strand
of hair, to catch people whose DNA samples are in the database.
</P>
<P>
   But his proposal has been opposed by civil liberties groups that
have influence with the Democratic leaders of the Assembly. In the
end, though, Democrats have signaled that they are ready to accept
a compromise to make the collection of DNA samples mandatory for
some crimes that are not covered under the current law.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of possible agreement involves a proposal to make
it a state crime to block access to abortion clinics. Although it
is already a federal crime , federal law enforcement officials say
they do not have the manpower to enforce the law. As a result,
Democrats have repeatedly proposed a state law that could be
enforced by local authorities _ only to see their efforts blocked
by Republicans who control the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republicans passed a clinic access bill, but only
after tying it to additional penalties that they have been seeking
for stalking. Initially, Democrats voiced grave concerns about the
stalking proposal, saying it was so broadly worded that it could
lead people to be prosecuted for loitering or for ordinary
disagreements. But Democrats now say they are open to adopting a
more precisely worded stalking law, in exchange for the Senate's
support for their clinic access legislation. The two sides are
negotiating the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislative leaders are also close to agreement
on a plan to give the courts new powers to force the mentally ill
into treatment against their will. The plan would allow judges to
hospitalize people temporarily if they had a history of violence or
had been hospitalized before for mental illness and refused to
follow their prescribed treatment, aides involved in the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has come under intense attacks from some advocates
for the mentally ill, but Pataki and legislative leaders have
removed just about every major obstacle that had held up a final
agreement. The one hurdle left is the question of whether the state
would oversee and pay for court-ordered counseling and other
treatment. Democrats want the state to assume that responsibility,
but Pataki would pass it on to local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Another focus of intense negotiations is a proposal to revamp
the state's program for educating disabled students. Aides to
Pataki and legislative leaders said they were close to a deal that
would overhaul the special education program to remove the
financial incentive to place disabled students in classes limited
to special education students.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been criticized as being a dumping ground,
particularly for black and Hispanic boys in New York City.
Lawmakers have argued for years over proposals for changing the
program but are now facing a threat by federal officials to cut off
hundreds of millions of dollars in aid if they do not end what are
seen as discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   All sides also say they expect a deal to reinstate a law that
protects about 10,000 loft residents, most of them living in lower
Manhattan. The law expired in June, leaving loft dwellers
vulnerable to eviction proceedings from landlords who have long
lobbied for a repeal.

`CRONACA DEL LUOGO': PARADE OF IMAGES WITH A CHOICE OF MEANINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ Site-specific is a term more for architects
than musicians, but here at the Salzburg Festival, Luciano Berio
has carved an opera out of a particular space much as a Frank Lloyd
Wright might have shaped a house to the context of a hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Carved is also the word for the theater itself: the
Felsenreitschule, whose stage burrows into rock face and leaves us
something dark, cool, resonant and ordered with three tiers of
stone galleries. Berio's operas and especially his new one,
``Cronaca del Luogo,'' or ``Chronicle of the Place,'' have never
suffered from lack of ambition, and in this unusual place
cosmological topics are argued between a wall and a stage, or
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Theatricality and melodrama, hallmarks of the Italian tradition,
are by no means dead, although here Berio has lifted the usual
historical struggle and domestic violence to the world of ideas.
His last opera, ``Outis,'' at La Scala in Milan three years ago,
pondered the mysteries of being a non-being with the story of
Ulysses as backdrop. In ``Cronaca,'' which played here on Sunday
night, the Old Testament becomes a receptacle for memory.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that is what I think it does. Linear  &UR;  &LR; argument is
out; plot is out. If there is explication to be had, it is left to
the accompanying written commentaries. To the operagoer's customary
tools of eyes and ears add a pair of reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the story line is a supermarket of metaphor. A general
discourses with an angel and takes off his shoes; a construction
foreman propounds in gibberish; a klezmer trio wanders &UR;  &LR; the stage;
a girl plays hopscotch; doctors measure huddled choristers with
Auschwitz-like menace.
</P>
<P>
   We the consumers are left to make our way along Berio's shelves
full of goods, read the labels and pick the meanings we want. We
read in our program books that the wall represents permanence and,
for better or worse, authority, and that the plaza in front of it
stands for flux and uncertainty. The wall tells us what was and
remains, the plaza what is and might be.
</P>
<P>
   The wall is also God, unknowable and unnameable as Jewish belief
dictates. Repeated is the old Aristotelian distinction between
being and becoming. It is a long way from Donizetti's boy meets
girl, but maybe the best procedure is to listen first, look second
and think if you must.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As we work to decipher the images of ``Cronaca del Luogo,'' we
gradually notice that extraordinary music is being played. A huge,
brass-heavy orchestra has been dispatched piecemeal throughout the
galleries, intermittently visible from behind dark scrims. Singers
were in the wall as well, and whistling electronic effects emanate
from it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the music moves in long, unbroken breaths: drones and
sustained chords with busy  &UR;  &LR; decoration played around them. The
colors are alternately exquisite and shattering. Another set of
commentators might have sent us in search of wholly different
meanings, but the music is incontrovertible. Indeed, the strongest
argument for the wall as fixed and permanent is the immovable
beauty of the sounds coming from it. The symbols and images played
out in front of them seem ephemeral in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing we have to a narrative glue is Hildegard
Behrens as the character R. (Is she Rahab, biblical prostitute of
Jericho? Who knows?) R wanders through the five scenes, more
moderator and editorialist than narrator. Berio's opera is
people-specific too. He intended the role for Miss Behrens, and her
obsessive intensity and slightly wasted soprano give R a ravaged
and desperate air.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the part of Nino seems fitted precisely to the
flamboyant vocalises of David Moss. Frode Olsen is the General and
Matthias Klink is Phanuel, but this is a piece more for ensembles
than individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Claus Guth's direction moves choristers across a wide stage with
ritual gravity and spastic gestures. Christian Schmidt's set is a
tree, a pile of rocks, many trap doors and not much else. His
costumes are casual street dress and only occasionally costumes at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra, if scattered, is huge. Anchors here are
Klangforum Wien and the Arnold Schoenberg Choir. Organizing all
this multiplicity and space makes the conductor's podium a command
post, and Sylvain Cambreling, after more than 250 hours of
rehearsal going back to the spring, achieves feats of organization.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's performance may have been more representative
than the one a few days ago, when Berio, without informing
Cambreling and much to his dismay, entered the control room and did
some impromptu adjusting of electronic levels.
</P>
<P>
   After a reportedly stiff confrontation, composer apparently
conceded to conductor. Perhaps compositions, like children, are to
be raised, nurtured and then let go. Parents, on the other hand,
find that hard to do.

CUSTOMERS AND FRIENDS MOURN A VICTIM OF THE ATLANTA MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Inside the neighborhood grocery, one of those few
places left in the South where neck bones and collard greens are
not considered especially exotic, the air-conditioning created a
cool oasis Sunday on Ashby Street, in Atlanta's West End.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the heat radiating off the black tar of the
parking lot, people at Great Savings grocery chose to linger
outside, looking at a tribute to a dead man scrawled on white
butcher paper and taped to the storefront window.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes someone would walk up with a pen and add words
of praise to Allen Tenenbaum, a 48-year-old son of an old Atlanta
Jewish family who had owned this store in a black neighborhood and
made lifelong friends here.
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum, a day trader who was president of his synagogue, was
one of the nine people shot to death in Atlanta's Buckhead
neighborhood on Thursday by Mark Barton, who later took his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the West End, Tenenbaum won his employees' and his
customers' respect over the decades by treating them with kindness
and mopping up messes himself when someone would break a jelly jar
in the grocery aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's rampage, which had begun earlier in the week with the
slayings of his wife and two children, robbed this neighborhood of
one of its oldest friends, and as the neighbors here lined up to
sign their names to the giant sympathy card, people shook and bowed
their heads, and wondered, like everyone else in Atlanta, why such
insanity had enveloped them.
</P>
<P>
   Fanny Lyons, 65, just signed ``Fanny.'' She thought about it for
a few moments and then added, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew him since he was a little boy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people just signed their name, as ``Slick'' did, and others
wrote long passages. Almost all of them mentioned God, and asked
God to look over him. It did not matter that Tenenbaum was Jewish.
In the West End, it was the African Methodist Episcopal God that
people begged to welcome him. The people who knew him the longest
here said he would not mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny,'' said John Norwood, 59, who used to be a boxer before
age took his right, and his left. ``You'd expect it here. It
happens here, in a poor neighborhood.'' But the man everyone in the
neighborhood just calls Allen had never been afraid here, even with
the crime and the poverty, even though his skin was not the same
color as the people who worked for him, as the people who shopped
in his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work here,'' wrote one mourner. ``He was a fair and
caring man.'' It was signed ``Dayna.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as mourners honored him in their own way at his small
grocery, Tenenbaum's Jewish friends prayed for him and remembered
him in their own way in a special memorial service; he had been
buried on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The killing brought soul-searching to churches across Georgia
Sunday, and at the Lizella Baptist Church, near Macon, there was a
special anguish. A funeral was held there Sunday for the first of
Barton's victims, his wife, Leigh Ann, who grew up in Macon and was
killed with a hammer last Tuesday in her home in Stockbridge, a
suburb south of Atlanta. The Associated Press quoted the Rev. Doug
Davis as telling about 400 mourners at Mrs. Barton's funeral that
they should not allow ``her murder to cloud our memory of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, in this Atlanta neighborhood where money is tight, the
memory of Allen Tenenbaum was not clouded at all Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors on Ashby Street here were angry that Tenenbaum,
who had given food away when people were without money, had been
taken by a man to whom money seemed so important. Police have
speculated that Barton's rampage may have been brought on by his
anger and despondency over losing money in the stock market. Barton
had lost roughly $105,000 in 15 days of securities day trading that
began on June 9, said James Lee, the president of Momentum
Securities Inc., where Barton killed four people, in a letter to
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The people who worked for Tenenbaum, who lived in Atlanta's
Crestwood Point neighborhood, said they were always impressed that
even though he came from a well-off family, he worked in the
grocery that had been in his family for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stocked the shelves, he picked paper up off the floors,''
said Roy Lango, 32, the market manager. ``If the floor needed
mopping, he would get up and do it himself. Every morning when he
came in, he spoke to me by name and every evening before he went
home he spoke to me by name. It meant a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't nothing about race here. We don't do that here.
Now, we're just trying to grieve,'' Lango said.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery, a neighborhood gathering place, would not have been
unique 30 years ago. But now, as mom-and-pop stores have given way
to supermarkets, pushing the door open into its cool interior is
like opening a window in time.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women with shopping carts ask each other how they are,
not out of obligatory politeness, but because they seem to really
want to know. ``How you doin','' said one middle-age woman to a man
passing time with the store's manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blessed,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The meat counter is stocked with the staples for backyard
barbecues _ chicken wings, big pork spare ribs, not in little
one-pound packages, but enough for a serious barbecue, enough for a
family. Tenenbaum had been just as much a fixture as the staples in
the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen grew up here,'' said Joseph Sutton, 45, a retired police
officer. ``He was real. He was the face you expected to see when
you walked in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the words of tribute on the butcher paper taped to the
window kept growing. ``We love you always,'' wrote ``Sara &AMP; Rick.''
Under that, someone had just signed ``Joe.''

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEES PUT PETTITTE ON THE PLANK FOR MOTIVATION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Can you imagine what the last month has been like for
Andy Pettitte? Three seasons ago he was a runner-up for a Cy Young
Award; 10 months ago he was helping to shut out the San Diego
Padres and complete a World Series sweep for the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Pettitte is a Yankee by the slender thread of Joe Torre's
faith that his 27-year-old pitcher will pull out of a deepening
funk.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with Andy Pettitte? That question has resonated for
weeks before Saturday night's trading deadline, and everyone has an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   All Pettitte knows for sure is that he found himself walking the
Boss' plank, and it wasn't a great feeling. I happen to think the
Yankees sent him down the plank with no real intention of pushing
him over _ trading him _ but rather with the idea of giving
Pettitte something to think about. The Boss' idea of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees gave the serious, perfectionist left-hander the
opportunity to agonize, fret and beat himself up. He obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte is making $5.95 million this season and could make more
next year when he is eligible for salary arbitration. When the
subject of money came up earlier this week, George Steinbrenner
scoffed and said, ``How can he look at that after the type of year
he's having now?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Boss has it all wrong; maybe Pettitte figured out
as much when he was out there on the plank. You can argue that the
Yankees are still paying Pettitte for what he did in 1996, when he
nearly won the Cy Young Award and won Game 5 of the World Series
with a shut out against Atlanta's John Smoltz. The Yankees are
still paying Pettitte for last October, when he outdueled Kevin
Brown in Game 4 to complete the World Series sweep. The Yankees
aren't really paying Pettitte for this season, which still has 60
games to go.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said as much when he came to Pettitte's defense. Torre
said he could not defend what Pettitte has done so far this season,
``I can only defend what he's done in the past, and what he can do
to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the heat of trade talk, Steinbrenner said that
Pettitte had had ``plenty of opportunities to show us he's getting
better'' and added, ``I've been saying all along they've got to get
him straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the Boss said: ``He should be very relieved that certain
people have put faith in him. Our manager seems to think things are
all right. I have great confidence in my manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, the Yankees' principal owner, asked again
about Pettitte said, ``He should be very relieved that certain
people have put faith in him.''
</P>
<P>
   The sensitive Pettitte was not encouraged by the Boss'
ambivalence. He lamented, ``You want your owner to want you
around.'' But if they didn't want him around, they would have
pushed him overboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Pettitte issue has caused an internal debate. Last week
against Chicago, he allowed eight hits and three runs in three and
a third innings against the Chicago White Sox. ``The other day I
wasn't pleased with what he did,'' Torre said, ``but it doesn't
mean I want to trade him.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the sudden infatuation with Hideki Irabu this season,
these are the facts: Pettitte is a powerful 27-year-old left-hander
with 75 victories in less than five full seasons with the Yankees.
He was a crucial piece of two Yankee championship teams. Right now
he's an emotional adjustment from getting back on track. Don't be
fooled: a lot of teams will be willing to take Pettitte off the
Yankees hands eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the carefree Jim Leyritz is back in town for his second
tour of duty, the Yankees hope that he can remind Pettitte of the
good times in 1996 when they were teammates and Leyritz was
Pettitte's personal catcher. Leyritz probably won't catch Pettitte
much this season, but his loose personality might help Pettitte
unwind, loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, in 1996 Leyritz tied Game 4 of the World Series with a
home run; the Yankees went on to win 8-6 in 10 innings and Leyritz
was hailed as the Yankee hero. Two months later he an Anaheim
Angel, having been traded.
</P>
<P>
   Before Leyritz back to New York he was in Boston for a brief
spell last year. The cumulative effects of the trades and movement
has made Leyritz become a lot looser about the business of baseball
than Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Leyritz said he was happy to be a Yankee again. But
last year he was happy to be with San Diego, and three seasons ago
he was happy to be with Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte has to loosen up, stop banging his head against the
wall. ``He just has to get comfortable,'' catcher Jorge Posada
said. ``Don't try to strike out every hitter, when you're not a
strikeout pitcher. He's a perfectionist. He tries hard every time
out there. Sometimes you just have to lay back a little and
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a difficult order when you're standing on the edge of the
plank and the sharks are waiting. But Andy Pettitte's not on the
plank anymore, and he won't be again. &QL;

WITH BAT AND ARM, METS' MAHOMES ENDS LONG WILD GAME WITH AUTHORITY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Pat Mahomes has resurrected his career with the New
York Mets this season as a long reliever, and he looked like an
improbable hero Sunday when his run-scoring single in the top of
the 13th inning gave the Mets their third lead of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be one more twist in this 4-hour-25-minute
roller coaster of a game at Wrigley Field. In the bottom of the
inning, the Cubs reliever Scott Sanders, batting because his team
had run out of position players, lined a double off the wall in
left field with two outs. The Mets appealed, claiming Sanders had
missed first base _ it would have been an appropriate way for the
game to end _ but were overruled.
</P>
<P>
   So Mahomes, who turns 29 next week, struck out Jeff Reed on a
2-2 pitch. And then Mahomes, who spent last season exiled in Japan,
let out a loud whoop to let everyone know that his once-promising
career was back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked so hard to get back and it seems like it's all paying
off,'' Mahomes said after the 5-4 victory. ``The 5-0 record and the
hitting, all that's a plus. I'm just trying to re-establish
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes, who pitched four and two-thirds innings on Friday to
earn a victory, is batting four for 10 with three runs batted in in
his first season in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, I haven't hit in nine years, but I've always been
able to hit pretty well,'' he said. ``I knew I wasn't going to
strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Mets a half-game behind the Atlanta Braves
in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   The early candidate for Mets hero was Al Leiter, who had a
career-high 15 strikeouts and gave up just two hits in his seven
innings. He left with a 3-2 lead. But on Armando Benitez's first
pitch in the bottom of the ninth, Henry Rodriguez drilled a
game-tying home run into the wind blowing in from center field. It
was the struggling Benitez's fifth blown save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets regained the lead in the top of the 10th on Edgardo
Alfonzo's sacrifice fly. But after Chicago loaded the bases in the
bottom of the inning _ with the help of two walks by Benitez _
first baseman John Olerud made a rare error that allowed another
tying run to score and made the afternoon even longer.
</P>
<P>
   For Benitez, who cost Leiter a victory for the second time this
month, it was a third consecutive perplexing performance. In those
three appearances he has allowed four runs, five hits and six walks
in two and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just has a little thing,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said of
Benitez. ``Hopefully, Armando will get it out of the way and regain
his dominating form of all season, except for these last three
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Leiter's dominance Sunday _ his 15 strikeouts were the
most by a Mets pitcher since David Cone struck out 19 at
Philadelphia on Oct. 6, 1991 _ he did not get the Mets' first
complete game of the season. He threw 135 pitches before being
removed, 31 pitches in the fifth inning when the Cubs pieced
together three consecutive two-out hits for two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had a lot of strikeouts, so my pitch count would be
up,'' said Leiter, whose previous strikeout high was 11, which he
had accomplished five times. ``Fifteen strikeouts, a couple of
walks and a lot of 3-2 counts, it's kind of hard to pitch a
complete game.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of the game allowed three of the Mets' new players,
picked up in trading-deadline deals Saturday night, to contribute
right away. Darryl Hamilton, acquired in the trade that sent Brian
McRae to Colorado, started in center field, and his run-scoring
single in the sixth gave the Mets their 3-2 lead. Billy Taylor,
acquired from Oakland, retired Sammy Sosa on a meek grounder to
first with runners on first and second in the 10th. And reliever
Chuck McElroy, also newly arrived from Colorado, began the 11th and
retired all five batters he faced before Mahomes came on in the
12th.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes gave up just Sanders's double in his one and a third
innings, and his own bloop hit off Sanders (4-5) just evaded a
diving Rodriguez's grasp in short left center. It drove in Roger
Cedeno, who had doubled into the left-field corner to lead off the
Mets' 13th, and made the Mets 57-1 this season when leading after
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really tired,'' Valentine said after the Mets escaped
Wrigley Field with two victories in three games _ the shortest of
which was 3 hours 29 minutes. ``Two real hot days, and one real
long one.'' &QL;

ANITA CARTER, COUNTRY SINGER, IS DEAD AT 66
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Texas, Va.)  (rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anita Carter, a member of country music's pioneering Carter
Family and a star in her own right, died in her home in
Goodlettsville, Tenn., near Nashville, on Thursday. She was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was not yet known, Lou Robin, her manager, told the
Associated Press. Ms. Carter had rheumatoid arthritis for the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter was one of three daughters of Ezra and Maybelle
Carter, who formed the country singing group the Carter Family
along with her cousin, Sara, and A.P. Carter (Sara's husband and
Ezra's brother).
</P>
<P>
   In 1927 the Carter Family drove from their Virginia mountain
home to Tennessee and during the next 16 years recorded some 250
songs, one of the most important and influential bodies of work in
country and folk music.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Anita (born Ina Anita Carter in Maces Springs, Va.)
hated to be separated from her mother when the Carter Family left
to perform at radio stations, so she was brought along. When she
was 4, she made her radio debut with a singsong child's rhyme. The
performance was such a success that soon she and her sisters were
regularly singing with the Carter Family on Texas station XERA, a
powerful radio broadcast set up mainly so that a quack doctor could
advertise his unusual remedies for impotence.
</P>
<P>
   When the Carter Family split up in 1943, Maybelle and her three
daughters _ June, Helen and Anita _ formed Mother Maybelle and the
Carter Singers, performing such Carter Family standards as
``Wildwood Flower,'' ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' and ``Keep on
the Sunny Side.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late '40s, Chet Atkins played guitar with them before
establishing himself in Nashville. In the '50s and early '60s, the
group joined the Grand Ole Opry and performed on bills with Elvis
Presley and Johnny Cash, recording the hit ``Busted'' with Cash.
Presley was said to have had an unrequited crush on Anita.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished stand-up bassist with a beautiful soprano voice,
Anita Carter also appeared on television shows like ``The Kate
Smith Evening Hour,'' where she could be seen singing with (and
being wooed by) Hank Williams in one of the legendary country
singer's few television appearances. Her sister June married Cash
in 1968 after the family helped bring him back to stability after a
period of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Carter's first significant work away from her family was
the 1951 single ``Bluebird,'' a duet with Hank Snow that topped the
country charts along with its B-side, ``Down the Trail of Achin'
Hearts.'' She also sang with another group on the side, a trio
called 'Nita, Rita and Ruby. In the '60s, she recorded a hit duet
with Waylon Jennings, ``I Got on You,'' and recorded singles and
albums for labels RCA, United Artists and, in the '70s, Capitol.
She also appeared on records by Merle Haggard, Porter Wagoner and
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, who renamed themselves
the Carter Family after A.P. died in 1960, broke up officially in
1969, though they continued to record together until near the time
of Maybelle's death in 1978. Anita's sister Helen died last summer,
and June recently released an intimate, homemade solo album,
``Press On.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to June Carter Cash, of Hendersonville, Tenn., Ms.
Carter is survived by a daughter, Lorrie Bennett, and a son, Jay,
both of Goodlettsville.

LASORDA FAMILIAR WITH SHORTCOMINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Have you heard about the guide in the Galapagos
Islands with a fastball so wicked it causes batters to retreat like
a turtle? How about the outfielder in the South Orkney Islands with
a whale of an arm?
</P>
<P>
   No? Well neither have we, actually.
</P>
<P>
   However, that shouldn't sway the Dodgers. They ought to put
their emissary Tom Lasorda on the next plane bound for Quito,
Ecuador, or the Kirkwall Airport in Orkney by way of Aberdeen,
Scotland. After all, you never know where you'll uncover the next
Pedro Martinez or Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   It could be anywhere from Antarctica to Zimbabwe and if it's
not, well, at least Lasorda will be out of sight and way out of his
cell phone's roaming range.
</P>
<P>
   Silence, like his retirement years, apparently isn't golden for
Lasorda, a Dodgers lifer whose recent history suggests he'd sooner
be duplicitous than forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   For Lasorda, a senior vice president with the Dodgers, there's
no such thing as riding quietly into the sunset. Every so often he
just has to get up on his high horse and kick up a little dirt, the
better to beckon the spotlight he craves even more than his next
plate of linguine.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad but true; Lasorda has managed to make goodwill
ambassador an oxymoron in the three years since health concerns
compelled him to step down as the Dodgers manager.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly was not goodwill he was spreading _ it smelled
more like fertilizer _ when he accused Dodgers players of acting in
their own best interests instead of the best interests of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been an embarrassment because they're not focusing on
the team, they're focusing on themselves,'' Lasorda was quoted as
saying Sunday in another Los Angeles newspaper. ``It's embarrassing
because of what the Dodgers have always represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah? If we were Lasorda, the franchise's fading image
wouldn't upset us nearly as much as the emerging truth.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi retreating to the bullpen after making a fielding
error rather than owning up to his mistake in the dugout is no more
embarrassing than a Dodger using the occasion of his Hall of Fame
induction to lobby for another Dodger's job.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was guilty of that two Augusts ago, much to the dismay
of reigning general manager, Fred Claire, whose job Lasorda clearly
coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Claire would lose his job the following spring and as,
 &UR; !ital! &LR; ahem, coincidence would have it, Lasorda was named to
replace him on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Valdes' preoccupation with his own performance is no more
embarrassing than Lasorda mortgaging the Dodgers' future last
summer to improve his immediate standing.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was the one who ransacked the Dodgers' farm system to
obtain players who would bring the team _ and, by extension,
himself _ instant glory.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way, of course. The Dodgers do have
Lasorda to thank for Jeff Shaw. But it took all the powers of
persuasion of his successor, Kevin Malone, to get the closer not to
act on the trade clause in his contract that had escaped Lasorda's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Carlos Perez, he's a Lasorda acquisition, too. And
speaking of minor-leaguers, Paul Konerko, one of the prospects
Lasorda unloaded for Shaw, is having a breakout season with the
White Sox, batting more than .300 with 15 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, if the Dodgers on the field aren't advancing
runners because their mindset is to wait for a pitch to send out of
the park, well, there's precedence for that kind of selfishness in
the front office.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would have a better chance of changing their
self-centered ways if someone _ anyone _ would step up and say,
``Mistakes? I've made a few.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Lasorda, in his accounting of things, consistently
falls a few debits short of a balance.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see how his latest diatribe, however on the mark it
might be, is going to set anybody in the Dodgers clubhouse
straight.
</P>
<P>
   You have to set the record straight, first. It's doesn't take a
world-class schmoozer to know it's counter-productive to call out
others unless you own up to your own failings.
</P>
<P>
   Self-deception is a shortcut to disaster. But we don't need to
tell anyone in the Dodgers organization that.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was right when he pointed out there's no ``i'' in team.
However _ and we didn't hear this from Lasorda _ there is one in
hypocrite.

BERTRAM SMYTHIES, 86, A WRITER ON BIRDS OF BURMA AND BORNEO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England)  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bertram E. Smythies, a versatile British naturalist who wrote
about birds and trees in southeast Asia and flowers in southwestern
Europe, died on Tuesday in the county of Kent in England. He was 86
and had settled in Estepona in the south of Spain in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Smythies' 1960 book, ``The Birds of Borneo'' was called
remarkable, magisterial and ``a treatise on the entire relationship
between man and birds on the island'' in his obituary in Saturday's
Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow British naturalist, Gathorne Cranbrook, wrote in The
Independent's obituary of Smythies, that ``The Birds of Borneo''
and his 1941 book ``The Birds of Burma'' (State Mutual), ``are
towering landmarks in the development of the regional
ornithology.''
</P>
<P>
   Smythies was born in India, where his father was a
forest-conservation official. He returned to Britain for schooling,
studied botany and forestry at Oxford and became an official of the
Burmese Forest Service in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Work in Burma with another naturalist, H.C. Smith, led Smythies
to write ``The Birds of Burma,'' working part-time on it for nine
months in 1940. It was illustrated by a British Navy officer,
Lieut. Comdr. A. M. Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the first 1,000-copy edition of the work was
printed in Burma, many of those copies were abandoned there when
Japanese forces invaded the country. The Japanese paid the book the
compliment of sending numerous copies to Tokyo, but an air raid
there destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, pictures and picture-plates for the book were spirited
out of Burma by H.C. Smith's wife and by Smythies. He went on to
serve with the British army behind the Japanese lines in Burma. A
second, 1953 edition of the book has become prized by bibliophiles.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II ended, he worked in Burma, now Myanmar, and
Brunei and became conservator of forests in Sarawak _ an enclave on
the island of Borneo _ which became a British crown colony after
the war. There he wrote ``Sarawak Forest Trees'' in 1965. It was a
technical guide for foresters and the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Spain, Smythies became a co-author, with Oleg
Polunin, a botanist, of the book ``Flowers of South-West Europe: A
Field Guide'' (1973, Oxford), with illustrations by Smythies' wife,
the former Jill Rogers, whom he had married in 1964. She died in
1994.

AMARYLLIS FLEMING, 73, CELLIST DEVOTED TO BAROQUE MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amaryllis Fleming, a British cellist who was particularly
devoted to chamber music and the Baroque literature, died on
Tuesday at a hospital in Nettlebed, near Oxford, England, where she
lived. She was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming lived a colorful life, partly because she was born
into a family with both pronounced creative abilities and strong
social connections, but also because of her own musical abilities,
which drew her into the orbits of the pianist Artur Schnabel, the
violinist Joseph Szigeti, the cellists Pierre Fournier and Pablo
Casals, the conductor Sir John Barbirolli and the guitarists Julian
Bream and John Williams.
</P>
<P>
   She made her public debut playing the Elgar Cello Concerto when
she was 19, and went on to win several important prizes and
competitions. She also appeared _ or at least, her arms and hands
did _ in ``Connecting Rooms'' (1969), as the screen fingers of
Bette Davis, who played a cellist in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming was born in 1925, the daughter of the painter
Augustus John and of Eve Fleming, the wife of a Maj. Valentine
Fleming, Member of Parliament. Ms. Fleming had four half-brothers,
the most famous of whom was Ian Fleming, the author of the James
Bond spy novels. Until she was 24, Ms. Fleming believed that she
was Eve Fleming's adopted daughter. Her discovery of the truth
caused a rift with her mother but brought her closer to John, whose
home in Wiltshire became a retreat for her.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken up the cello at the age of 9, Ms. Fleming
determined early that she would become a professional musician. In
1943 she enrolled at the Royal College of Music, where she studied
with Ivor James. By the end of the following year she had performed
on the BBC and made her concert debut. When she auditioned for
Fournier at that time, he was so impressed that he offered to teach
her at no charge. They soon began a romance that mellowed into a
long-standing friendship. Ms. Fleming's mother, determined to
separate her from Fournier, arranged for her to study first in
Portugal and later with Casals in Prades, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming never married, and left no immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Ms. Fleming won the Queen's Prize, in
England, as well as the Munich International Competition. She gave
the German premiere of the Elgar Concerto in Hamburg, with
Barbirolli conducting, and performed as a member of the Loveday
Trio, the Fidelio Ensemble and the Paganini Trio. Later she formed
the Fleming Trio, which went through many personnel changes in the
1970s, but was one of her most highly regarded chamber music
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   The most decisive influence on her career, though, was her
meeting in the 1950s with E.M.W. Paul, a musicologist who
introduced her to Baroque music played on period instruments. Under
Paul's influence, she became one of the first cellists to become
interested in incorporating musicological research into her
performances of Baroque works. She began playing on both restored
Stradivarius and Guarneri cellos, and on an Amati with a
five-string layout that allowed her to play certain works _
including Bach's Sonatas for Viola da Gamba, and the Sixth Suite
for Unaccompanied Cello _ without making the transpositions
necessary on a four-string instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming continued to perform until 1993, when a stroke left
her unable to play. But she continued to teach, an occupation to
which she had devoted herself increasingly, starting in the 1970s,
when she joined the faculty of the Royal College of Music. Her
best-known student is the cellist Raphael Wallfisch.

WORKPLACE STARS AREN'T BORN _ THEY'RE MADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not hard to spot the stars at work.
</P>
<P>
   They're the people who get the coveted assignments, the biggest
bonuses, the fastest promotions. They're the 10 percent to 15
percent of workers known as the ``10-for-oners'' _ people who
outshine and outproduce their peers by a factor of 10 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying what makes those people star performers, however, is
trickier, and it turns out it's not what most people think.
</P>
<P>
   Stars are not generally smarter than average performers. They
don't necessarily work harder, and they're not better at
schmoozing. They aren't more creative, bigger risk-takers or born
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to believe that star performers are somehow better
in some fundamental sense than average performers, said Robert
Kelley, author of ``How to be a Star at Work'' (Times Business,
1999, $12). And by extension, they believe that average workers
lack the necessary qualities to turn themselves into exceptional
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But stars are made, not born,'' Kelley said. The difference
between an average performer and an exceptional one doesn't boil
down to talent as much as how people use their talents.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, a professor in the graduate school of Industrial
Administration at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, first
got interested in what makes some people shine at work when Bell
Labs asked him for help improving the productivity of its workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had all these really smart, really talented people,''
Kelley said. And they were facing deregulation of their industry.
They knew they were going to have to get exceptional work out of
their workers to compete, but they didn't know how.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley started by gathering data about what people believed made
a star performer. He came up with 45 qualities believed to be
associated with stars, including higher IQs, improved logic and
reasoning skills, high self-confidence, ambition and enhanced
interpersonal skills. Then he subjected 200 star and average
performers to a two-day battery of tests to figure out how they
rated in the 45 traits. He eagerly analyzed the data, expecting a
profile of star qualities to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Zippo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found none of those things separated the stars from average
performers,'' he said. ``In terms of unlocking productivity
secrets, our data showed no appreciable cognitive,
personal-psychological, social or environmental differences between
stars and average performers.''
</P>
<P>
   So what makes the difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``Average performers are not lacking in talent, motivation,
effort,'' he said. But they tend to use trial-and-error to try to
get ahead, and they often apply their talents in self-limiting
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star performers do their work very differently than the solid,
average-performing pack,'' he said. They apply a different set of
strategies to their work.
</P>
<P>
   Star-making strategies include taking initiative, networking,
gaining multiple perspectives on problems, being both good
followers and good leaders, knowing how to work on teams and being
savvy about organizational politics.
</P>
<P>
   Star-building initiative, for example, means taking charge of
tasks that fall in the ``white space'' between people's
responsibilities _ those opportunities that are critical to the
organization but aren't any one person's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Average performers take initiative, too, but they tend to
volunteer for non-critical extras, such as planning corporate
events or recruiting for the company blood drive.
</P>
<P>
   Star performers approach networking differently as well.
</P>
<P>
   An average performer thinks of networking as building a
communications grapevine to keep abreast of office gossip. Star
producers develop a network of ``knowledge experts'' who can help
them troubleshoot problems or do their jobs better.
</P>
<P>
   Another star strategy involves building multiple viewpoints.
Average performers tend to have tunnel vision, concentrating on
developing their own points of view and trying to get them across
to others in the organization. Star producers see projects or
problems through the eyes of others, including customers,
competitors, co-workers and bosses. That depth of perspective leads
to better solutions to problems.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, stars take charge of their own work life, what
Kelley refers to as ``self-management.''
</P>
<P>
   Average performers think of self-management as techniques to
help them better manage their time and projects. But star producers
view self-management as creating new opportunities for themselves.
They're constantly asking how to make themselves more valuable and
looking for ways to get the experiences and skills they need to get
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   By applying these strategies, Kelley said, workers can double
their productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can be a star.

MANY WOMEN, AND DOCTORS, UNAWARE OF HEART DISEASE RISK IN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Carolyn Day thought she had a sinus infection. The
pressure around her eyes and ears throbbed all day. Close to
midnight, a sudden pressure in her chest grabbed her attention.
</P>
<P>
   Day had experienced only limited health problems during her 65
years. But she instinctively knew something was wrong, and told her
son to take her to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Wash., a suburb of Seattle,
she found out the blood vessels that serve as pathways to and from
her heart were seriously blocked. The doctors performed a
triple-bypass surgery at 7:30 the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking it was heart problems because my symptoms
didn't seem right,'' Day said. ``I didn't have the pain going to
the shoulder and I didn't have the gripping chest pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Day is one of millions of women who suffer from problems with
heart disease in the United States. Like Day, many are unaware of
their risks, and unaware that their symptoms can vary from those of
men.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association lists heart disease as the No. 1
cause of death for both men and women in America. Yet heart attack,
stroke and other cardiovascular diseases have killed more women
than men every year since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, however, heart disease was considered a male
problem. Even many medical professionals remained unaware of the
high risk for women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Hammond of The Hope Heart Institute, a
cardiovascular disease research center in Seattle, attributes the
lack of awareness to training and research oversights.
</P>
<P>
   Reports such as the Framingham Study, a commonly cited report on
heart disease, focused primarily on early onset of heart attacks
and heart disease. That almost eliminates women, since the majority
of heart problems occur in women after menopause.
</P>
<P>
   In the 45-to-64 age range, 1 in 10 women has some form of heart
disease. These odds increase to 1 in 5 women 65 and older,
according to the national Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said awareness of women's risks for heart disease is
increasing among medical professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the past five to eight years, doctors are becoming
drastically much more aware,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sarah Speck, chief of cardiology at Seattle's Swedish
Medical Center and director of the Dean Ornish Program for
Reversing Heart Disease, said one reason women's risks have been
overlooked is that their conditions may differ from men's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think physicians and providers now know that the risk
factors are equivalent in men and women,'' Speck said. ``However,
women's symptoms are different and that's where the level of
awareness needs to be raised in the public and the medical
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical signs of a heart attack include: repetitive pressure or
squeezing in the chest; shooting pain to shoulder, arms and neck;
sweating; shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   Women, however, may experience additional symptoms, including:
stomach pain or nausea, unexplained fatigue, racing heart rate and
jaw pain.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, most women do not seek help until two to six hours
after the first symptoms, according to Speck. This cuts into
valuable time when a patient could be saved or serious damage to
the heart prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Men seek help more quickly because they are more aware of
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women don't complain about their health ailments often
and they don't seek medical attention as often as they need to,''
Speck said. ``If you have the risks ... you need to think of heart
disease first.''
</P>
<P>
   Those risks include a family history of heart disease, diabetes,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and use of oral
contraceptives, tobacco and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Women who do suffer from heart attacks are also more likely to
die than men. According to a recent study conducted by Yale
researchers, 17 percent of female heart attack victims die while
still in the hospital; only 12 percent of men do.
</P>
<P>
   For women younger than 50, the odds are even more skewed. Only 3
percent of men die and 6 percent of women do.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks among young women are especially rare _ one reason
they may be misdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Corrine DeJong, 28, was watching a high-school basketball game
in 1988 at Ferndale High School in Ferndale, Wash., when chest
pains grabbed her attention.
</P>
<P>
   The pains grew sharper. She was having difficulty breathing. The
17-year-old DeJong ran outside. It was raining and cold, but she
felt fiery hot. Sweat poured from her skin. A friend saw DeJong
leave and followed her.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gym, DeJong blacked out and fell to the ground, but
she could hear someone say she was going to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, the medical staff told her she was fine. DeJong
said one doctor told her she had heartburn and sent her home with
Maalox. He suggested the reason she passed out was because she was
flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed because the doctor made me feel like I was
an idiot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeJong's episodes continued with varying frequency and intensity
for two years. She went from being outgoing and athletic to
becoming a social recluse who couldn't jog to the mailbox without
her heart racing uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   At times she would experience chest pains or shortness of breath
several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of what she calls ``living hell,'' Dr. James
Brodie of Seattle's Providence Medical Center examined her and
correctly diagnosed her heart problem in just 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Several tests confirmed DeJong suffered from a heart murmur, an
arrhythmia and a condition called vasovagal syncope, which causes
veins to constrict and make her pass out.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are not immediately life-threatening, but life as a
``normal'' person will never be in DeJong's future. Her heart beats
faster than most and she cannot pursue many athletic hobbies she
used to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   DeJong, is small-framed, 5-foot-7 and 125 pounds. Her curly
brown hair and bright hazel eyes complement a glowing complexion _
hardly the typical picture of someone with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not your classic heart patient,'' said DeJong. ``I've
never smoked, I'm not male, I'm young, I'm not overweight, I look
fairly healthy, but I am not.''
</P>
<P>
   She attends massage school and volunteers for the American Heart
Association to help raise awareness of heart disease. She said her
experience can help others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what was going on inside me was not right and I want to
reach the women whose doctor or boyfriend or family, whoever, is
telling them they are all right when they know they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the women that stop going to the doctor and those
are the women who end up dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Awareness is key to women at risk of heart disease. They can
reduce the chance of disease by analyzing personal risk factors,
avoiding high-risk behavior and being conscious of danger signs.
This can mean everything from eating a healthy diet to asking the
doctor the right questions.
</P>
<P>
   One person who wishes she had asked more questions is Carolyn
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize now I should have been more aware,'' she said.`` I
was at risk and I didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Day paid the price. For six weeks after her surgery, she could
sleep only on her back. Simple movements were difficult and
painful. Even sitting down or getting up from a chair was
excruciating. The pain in her chest from the massive surgery was
numbed by medication that left her in a daze much of the time.
However, by recognizing that something was wrong, she avoided what
could have been a serious heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the behaviors that lead to her problem, Day has set
out to regain control of her life. Since her surgery in April, she
has quit smoking and started exercising. As a patient of a cardiac
rehabilitation program at Evergreen Hospital Medical Center in
Kirkland, she walks on a treadmill and rides a bike machine.
</P>
<P>
   She is starting to forfeit some of the meats and cheeses she
loves and is eating more vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of lifestyle changes, Day said she is feeling better
than she did before the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tips on lowering risk
</P>
<P>
   One in 5 women in the United States has some sort of heart
disease. Women can lower their risks by:
</P>
<P>
   _Exercising. Physical activity can strengthen the cardiovascular
system and help control weight, blood pressure, diabetes, and
cholesterol levels. While regular vigorous activity is encouraged,
even low levels can be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   _Eating right. Eat a well-rounded, moderate, healthy diet. Find
information from heart-disease institutes, doctors or dietitians on
heart-healthy eating.
</P>
<P>
   _Stop smoking. Regardless of how long you have smoked, quitting
will still drastically reduce your risks.
</P>
<P>
   _Limit drinking. Limit alcohol intake to a moderate level.
</P>
<P>
   _Take hormones. Use hormone replacement therapy if your
physician finds it a suitable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _Limit stress. Find healthy ways to cope with stress.
</P>

VIDEO VALLEY BLOOMS IN THE GARDEN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
PRINCETON, N.J. _ The future of television technology is springing
from labs in New Jersey's Video Valley.
<P>
   In the Garden State, where television itself was born and then
given color, engineers are toiling to develop equipment for the
coming age of digital high-definition television.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: Don't think of New Jersey as a place 3,000 miles
from Silicon Valley innovation, the burial ground of mobsters and
industrial waste, the butt of bad jokes on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, think of it as the state where Edison and Einstein
promulgated their greatest achievements, where Bell Labs invented
the transistor, and where proximity to TV network headquarters in
Manhattan has drawn many of the leading TV hardware-makers to set
up elite research labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge research-and-development and industrial
tradition in New Jersey,'' said Alex Magoun, curator at Sarnoff
Corp.'s museum. ``This is the birthplace of America's second
industrial revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside of Princeton, Sarnoff Corp. occupies the same
sprawling headquarters it has had since 1942.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Sarnoff, originally founded as RCA
Laboratories, invented the color television tube, the liquid
crystal display (or LCD) and technology that made video cameras
possible.
</P>
<P>
   And it's there that Sarnoff is now working on a host of new
technologies, including the HDTV sets that promise sharper, more
detailed images than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV will bring cinema-quality pictures to television, with
broadcasts twice the quality of conventional TV and CD-quality
sound. The federal government is requiring all broadcasts by 2006
to be in HDTV, and the phase-in has already begun in San Francisco
and other cities, albeit slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The people at Sarnoff who work on HDTV are drawing on a
tradition of 18-hour days, where the mandate was results and the
employees were driven to invent new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain cultures that permeate organizations, and
that's the special thing about Sarnoff as it exists today,'' said
Glenn Reitmeier, a Sarnoff vice president and one of the country's
leading advocates of HDTV. ``It still astounds me what the
inventors of (the original television standards) were able to do
with a handful of tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Their innovation lasted 50 years, Reitmeier said, crossing from
vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits. Now, Reitmeier
and others in the HDTV business have finally come up with a new
standard. ``I hope it lasts 50 years, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With such companies as Sarnoff in New Jersey, other firms _ most
notably Japanese consumer electronics conglomerates _ have
established similar laboratories devoted to the changing nature of
television.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics Corp. has its U.S. headquarters in Mahwah,
N.J. NEC, a $40 billion Japanese company, has a research lab near
Princeton. Panasonic, Sony, Siemens, Toshiba, Hitachi America,
Samsung Electronics _ all maintain a significant presence in New
Jersey's so-called ``Video Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Having so many big players in one region ``really helped speed
things in the early stages of this digital television era,'' said
Chris Pfaff, spokesperson for Lucent Digital Video, a division of
Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, N.J. Lucent still maintains
Bell Labs, which conducts some video research, although it's mostly
focused on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic, a division of the Japanese giant Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., has its New Jersey headquarters in the oft-maligned
city of Secaucus, at the edge of the Meadowlands. But in Burlington
on the other side of the state, near where George Washington
crossed the Delaware River, Panasonic established a small lab for
advanced video research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is exploding,'' said Jukka Hamalainen, president of
the lab. ``We are growing like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lab, Panasonic is working on plasma screens, sleek thin
televisions that now cost a small fortune but look great in a
living room. Other engineers are midwifing the convergence between
televisions and personal computers, trying to bring HDTV broadcasts
to the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, HDTV will make the picture better, but some argue
that's not really what's wrong with television. Almost proving the
point, the Panasonic engineers work by day, testing TVs
broadcasting couples smooching on soap operas and a Jerry Springer
episode titled ``Guess What ... I'm Really a Woman!''
</P>
<P>
   But programming isn't Panasonic's forte. Instead, Hamalainen,
68, talks about his beginnings in television as a college student
in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Hamalainen and his brother-in-law pioneered the first television
broadcasts in Finland in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia had started the first television transmissions in
Estonia,'' only 60 miles from Helsinki, Hamalainen said. ``We
wanted to be sure Russian-type televisions were not sold in
Finland. We felt part of the Western world. It was totally
political.''
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately went to work for RCA, first in Europe, and later
in New Jersey. But in 1985, with RCA's best days behind it,
Hamalainen retired _ and took over a Panasonic lab with a mere
three people in it.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the chance for innovation like in the early days.
``Everything I wanted to do was digital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is mandating
the adoption of digital high-definition television, Hamalainen is
once again at the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a renaissance of sorts for Sarnoff Corp., which keeps
itself out of the limelight but has placed its technology in many
common appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Sarnoff bears the name of ``General'' David Sarnoff _ he earned
the honorific after helping the Army establish a communications
system in World War II, and forever after insisted on being called
``General.'' He was a Russian immigrant who clawed his way up
through the American Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co., largely by
pushing the idea of using the radio as a broadcast medium.
</P>
<P>
   Although the General died in 1971 and the labs foundered in the
years that followed, the emergence of HDTV has spurred a
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has 630 people busily working in labs along the
corridors of its Princeton campus, with a range of video
innovations in the works: boxes to convert HDTV broadcasts for
existing analog television sets, videoscopes that analyze
mammograms and help in the treatment of breast cancer, controls of
movement in handheld video cameras that create dazzling freeze
frames and isolated video scenes, and technology that warplanes use
to monitor their targets, which was most recently on display in the
Predator plane used in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But for Glenn Reitmeier and his team _ and for the millions of
television-watching Americans _ HDTV is the thing.
</P>
<P>
   And for those skeptics who doubt whether it will happen, noting
HDTV sets that now cost about $6,000 and an extreme shortage of
high-definition programming, Reitmeier is willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the industry is off to a pretty good start,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's already moving on to newer technologies: ``It's so
revolutionary, there are so many possibilities,'' he said. ``We now
have to figure out what's the best way to take advantage of it.''

THE FATHER OF NEW JERSEY'S TV CONNECTION &HT;    By DAN FOST
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ This state owes its standing as the
headquarters of the digital television revolution to a Russian
immigrant who died nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wasn't a technologist himself, David Sarnoff had the
vision and ambition to pull off some of technology's greatest
achievements of the 20th century: radio, television, color
television, fax machines. And along the way he spawned today's No.
1 television network, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Sarnoff arrived in the United States at age 9, knowing no
English, and ``he didn't have a head for math,'' said Alex Magoun,
the curator of the museum at Sarnoff Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But he did talk his way into a job sweeping floors at the
American Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co., according to Joel Brinkley
in the book ``Defining Vision,'' and he never looked back. In 1912,
he received the first radio distress signals from the doomed ship
Titanic. By the time he was 24, Sarnoff persuaded Marconi that
radio could be more than just communication between two people _
that it could send music and information to hundreds of thousands
of people, thus sparking radio's golden age.
</P>
<P>
   Marconi Wireless eventually became RCA, which launched NBC as a
radio broadcasting network in 1926, Magoun said. By 1930, Sarnoff
was running the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he built his crown jewel: the research labs outside
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's greatest concentration of tech work is now done
along Route 1, a crowded highway that connects Rutgers and
Princeton universities.
</P>
<P>
   The RCA labs _ now known as Sarnoff Corp. _ occupy the same huge
building that went up in 1942, on a grassy 300-acre campus.
</P>
<P>
   From the inside, it resembles a high school: long corridors
lined with brown linoleum. But behind the orange doors are
whiteboards chock full of algorithms and flow charts, and labs full
of the latest technology equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In those labs, color television was developed, as well as
technology that allowed wire services to transmit photos to
newspapers _ the genesis of the modern fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   Sarnoff had already debuted television at the New York World's
Fair in 1939, and in the following years, he transformed his NBC
radio network into a TV network. ``He literally invented the
concept of network broadcasting,'' said Sarnoff spokesman Tom
Lento.
</P>
<P>
   The lab was Sarnoff's love, much to Wall Street's consternation.
``RCA never declared very big dividends,'' Magoun said. ``They
poured a lot of money into the labs. Sarnoff would say, `We have
sound, let's make it better. Let's add light to sound.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sarnoff had enough of an ego that he insisted people call him
``General,'' even though he earned the title more for technological
contributions than for moving up the ranks of the military.
</P>
<P>
   But his ego also meant that he never groomed a successor. Magoun
said that in 1971, when Sarnoff died and his son took over the
company, ``that's when people say RCA fell off the technology
map.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, General Electric acquired RCA, but split the company
up. It sold the consumer electronics business to Thomson, which
still makes products under the RCA brand. It kept the appliance
business and the NBC television network. And it donated the labs to
a Silicon Valley nonprofit: SRI of Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sarnoff remains the for-profit division of SRI,
developing technology and licensing it to others without really
caring whether its brand reaches the public.
</P>
<P>
   And in the ground floor of its headquarters, Sarnoff's monument
survives, with old picture tubes, plaques and portraits, and a bust
of the man they called ``General.''

HUNDLEY'S HOMER ELBOWS ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hundley knows the season is a long shot, but
for one at-bat Sunday he found the odds in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley had gone deep on Andy Benes before. A lot in fact. The
switch-hitting catcher saw left-hander Greg Swindell getting loose
in the Arizona bullpen with two on in the sixth inning but was
hoping to face Benes just one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Benes stayed in the game and Hundley won it with a three-run
homer that gave the Los Angeles Dodgers a 4-2 victory over the
first-place Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   It gave Hundley six homers in 48 career at-bats against Benes.
It also gave the last-place Dodgers a quick smile before leaving
town for 10 games, including the next seven against two of the
hottest teams in baseball, Houston and the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good to finally get one,'' Hundley said after the Dodgers had
dropped the first two games of the series. ``Especially heading out
on the road and with as good as the Diamondbacks are. It is good to
finally beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Hundley ever got the chance to bat in the sixth was curious.
Against left-handers, Hundley has just four hits in 33 at-bats.
When he faced Swindell the next inning, he struck out on three weak
swings.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona manager Buck Showalter claims he was more concerned
with the Dodgers lifting Hundley for pinch-hitter Gary Sheffield, a
.309 hitter who did not start Sunday. Hundley was batting just .224
and seemed like a good bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had Sheffield, (Adrian) Beltre and (Angel) Pena on their
bench and I just as soon not put Sheffield in the game,'' Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy whose team came in with five consecutive victories and
10 in their last 12 games, it seemed like the kind of strategy that
works for winning teams. For the Dodgers, who had dropped 10 of 12,
it was a situation that has blown up all season.
</P>
<P>
   But after losing the first two games of the series, the Dodgers
showed surprising resiliency. Besides Hundley's homer, the play of
the day was a sliding catch by Dave Hansen near the Dodgers dugout.
Todd Hollandsworth also made a running catch at the railing in left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White, who has raised his average 40 points since July 1,
had two more hits and glided to the center-field wall in the ninth
inning to take away extra bases from Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Onan Masaoka (2-2) picked up for a struggling Chan
Ho Park in the sixth and pitched two scoreless innings. Jeff Shaw,
who had blown consecutive save opportunities, pitched a perfect
ninth for his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   And even Raul Mondesi, who has come under fire for two awful
months, returned after a day off to contribute two hits and a
stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   But for a team that has anxiously waited for Hundley to
contribute, this was his day.
</P>
<P>
   His 16th homer came on a 3-1 changeup by Benes (6-10) and
traveled 445 feet to dead center. To illustrate how desperately the
Dodgers need him, Hundley now has more home runs than any Dodgers
left-handed hitter since Darryl Strawberry hit 28 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see someone like Todd win a game like that,''
said Dave Hansen, who started for Beltre at third. ``He has worked
so hard to get back to where he is. This is good for him and the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's slow recovery from reconstructive elbow surgery has
been one of the factors in the Dodgers' miserable season. He
couldn't throw out baserunners, couldn't hit right-handed pitchers,
couldn't keep fans from wondering about last winter's three-way
trade with the Mets and Orioles that cost the Dodgers catcher
Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Hundley lost his job to rookie Angel Pena and spent
nearly two weeks working solely with coach Rick Dempsey on his
throwing mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   His daily regimen still includes extensive weight training to
strengthen the elbow. Hundley did not emerge from the weight room
for nearly an hour after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock on wood, my elbow has felt the best it has since I've
been 21 years old,'' Hundley said. ``We're over the hump and now
I've got to take care of it and protect it. I would like to wipe
out the first half of the season and mentally I have.''

AUDIT REPORTS GROWTH OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS BY GAMBLING
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Contributions from the gambling industry to federal
election campaigns grew by 400 percent from 1992 to 1998, a rate 10
times that of political contributions overall, a new congressional
audit says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said donations grew from $1.1
million to $5.7 million during a time of rapid gambling expansion
and deepening concern that Congress would further regulate and tax
the industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In that same six-year period, contributions to federal campaigns
from all sources rose 38 percent, to $851 million, according to
data the General Accounting Office collected from the Center for
Responsive Politics. Thereport on gambling contributions was
requested by Rep. Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very troubling,'' Wolf said. ``You can see they are
trying to heavily influence Congress and both political parties. We
should be concerned when any industry does this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The head of the leading lobbying group in Washington for
gambling said the industry is drawing unfair attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We make no apologies whatsoever for participating in the
political process,'' said Frank Fahrenkopf, president of the
American Gaming Association. ``We are going to do all we can to
make sure our employees and shareholders are heard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf said the jump in donations is no surprise, because
the industry has grown so rapidly. In 1991, for example, Iowa had
the country's only riverboat casino and now there are dozens in six
states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf noted that the General Accounting Office report said
the gambling industry ranked 37th among industries giving money to
political campaigns in 1998. The top sources of funds were lawyers,
at $59 million, and real estate companies, at $37 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The gambling industry is still not going to hold a candle to
real estate, insurance, etc.'' said Elizabeth Schwefler, researcher
for the Center for Responsive Politics. ``But they are climbing the
ladder, bit by bit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the gambling employees and political action committees
accounted for the highest contribution rate growth _ 83 percent _
among any private industry when compared with 1994, according to
the data. Similar comparisons are not yet available for 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The contributions in the General Accounting Office report were
made to candidates or political party committees from employees or
political action committees of gambling interests. Of the $5.7
million given for the 1998 election cycle, $3.8 million was
so-called soft money, given to political parties to indirectly
benefit candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soft money contributions included almost $1.4 million to
Republican campaign committees at the national level and $850,000
to national committees for the Democrats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's Entertainment accounted for the most money overall from
gambling interests, at $533,090. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some gambling opponents in Missouri and elsewhere said
gambling's greater presence in politics shows that the industry is
concerned about the public putting more pressure on lawmakers to
rein in the industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this as a compliment,'' said Bernie Horn,
communications director of the National Coalition Against Gambling
Expansion. ``It means they are substantially more worried we are
going to be successful in Washington.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Taylor, executive director of Casino Watch Inc. in
Missouri, agreed with Horn and said the report should raise public
concern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the growth that is taking place; it's just nice
to see the GAO put some numbers to it,'' Taylor said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State governments are primarily responsible for regulating
casinos, but Wolf and others have suggested Congress consider extra
taxes on gambling revenues, a ban on Internet gambling, a ban on
amateur sports betting and removal of some automated teller
machines from casinos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always watchful (of legislation) but we're no different
than any other industry,'' Fahrenkopf said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf said gambling is different in that it leads to
addiction and can be corrupting because so much money is involved.
In addition, casinos can put restaurants, bowling alleys, theaters
and other ``good companies'' out of business, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission
released a three-year study recommending a pause in the rapid
growth of gambling, even though it was described as a boon to local
economies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended tighter restrictions on
casino-related campaign donations at the state and local level
because that is where casinos are regulated. Horn said that
gambling interests poured much more money into state and local
campaigns last year than into federal campaigns. &QL;

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LA CROSSE, Wis. _ New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson stands under
a shade tree trying to get some relief from the hellacious heat and
humidity. Although the temperature pushes the century mark, Benson
smiles like a proud father gazing at his newborn son for the first
time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Just look at him,'' Benson says, nodding in the direction of
Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back from the
University of Texas. ``He's already such a great asset for us and
the city of New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, outside the cafeteria on the University of
Wisconsin-La Crosse campus, Williams is signing autographs for fans
of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love him,'' Benson says. ``He's great with kids. The
day he came to us after the draft, he sat in the sun for 1{ hours
signing autographs. He's a superstar, but he's so natural about
everything, so down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams signs until a member of the Saints' media relations
department pulls him away and almost has to push him through the
cafeteria doors. Benson breaks into a satisfied smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really enjoyed Ricky's company,'' Benson says. ``He's
such a sincere guy. He's almost bashful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he's very unusual. He thinks things out. He
doesn't make rash decisions. I just know he's going to be
everything we thought he would be.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, unless his name were Jordan, Payton, Ruth or Gretzky,
it might be difficult for any athlete to live up to the Williams
hype in New Orleans. After all, there had never been a team with a
one-player draft until the Saints traded six picks in this year's
draft plus two more in 2000 to swap first-round positions with
Washington this past April.
</P>
<P>
   ``My obligation to the Saints is to play the best football I
can,'' Williams said to about 30 reporters a few minutes later.
``The only ones I want to prove anything to is my team. I want to
prove I'm worthy of what they gave up for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Once coach Mike Ditka and general manager Bill Kuharich made the
decision to go after Williams, it was full speed ahead in trade
negotiations with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saints haven't had a marquee name like Ricky since Archie
Manning (drafted in 1971),'' Kuharich said. ``People can make their
judgments now. The facts are we gave up eight for one, but it
depends on what those players do over time and what Ricky gives us
over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams wheel began to spin in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike came to me in January before the college all-star games
and asked who the best player in the draft was,'' Kuharich said.
``I said Ricky Williams. He asked what it would take to get him. I
said probably our whole draft and more. He was very receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   When they pulled the trigger, the Saints received a lot of
criticism around the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think the second-day draft board was as strong as
years past,'' Kuharich said. ``We thought we could supplement the
second day with college free agents in place of rounds four through
seven. In essence, we gave up a No. 1 and a No. 3 and a No. 1 and a
No. 3 to get the most prolific rusher in college history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were coming from the 12th spot. We thought we'd have to
give up a lot of picks to move up seven spots or higher. Precedent
was set last year when San Diego gave up two No. 1s, a No. 2 and
two players (to Arizona) to move up one spot (to select quarterback
Ryan Leaf). We don't think we overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draft picks are still precious, because they give you young
players to develop and low balance in your cap situation, but
there's still another avenue to acquire players (free agency). We
signed 17 or 18 college free agents, which is high for us. And we
got 10 exemptions from NFL Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuharich talked with a number of teams about moving up from the
12th pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually offered more to Philadelphia, Cincinnati and
Indianapolis _ much, much more _ another No. 1 (2001) and two
players (cornerback Alex Molden and running back Lamar Smith),''
Kuharich said. ``From what we were willing to give up to Philly to
what we actually gave up to Washington (in the fifth spot), we
didn't give up nearly as much as we were willing to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a hard thing to do. It never entered my mind that
this is going to be the first time in NFL history that there's been
a one-player draft or the first time you've given up eight picks
for one player.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Saints drafted Williams, they wanted to make sure
they had a good idea they could sign him. He dumped his first agent
and signed with No Limit Sports, the entertainment conglomerate
owned by Percy Miller, the music impresario known as Master P.
Negotiating Williams' contract would be Leland Hardy, the chief
financial officer of No Limit Sports. It would be Hardy's first
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis shied away from Williams and took Miami running
back Edgerrin James because Colts general manager Bill Polian
thought he would be easier to sign. James has still not signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of research on Ricky,'' Kuharich said. ``We
talked to a lot of people who had coached him and been associated
with him. We thought he was a unique individual, that he was going
to call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many players say the agent works for them, but it's the other
way around. The agent tells them when to sign. It was clear Ricky's
deal would be up to him. His agent would recommend things, but he
(Williams) would make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it a risk? Sure. They all are. But signability wasn't as
much of a risk to us as some other clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' contract was heavily criticized by many because so
much of what he will earn over the eight-year deal depends on
incentive bonuses for a variety of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people saying that are agents,'' Kuharich said. ``They're
worried that this could become another type of contract in the NFL,
and it doesn't work in the agents' favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky's a throwback. He's said many times that he believes
that you get a certain amount of money _ remember, he got the
largest signing bonus in Saints history _ and the rest of it he
should earn. That's a unique approach, but he's atypical of today's
athlete. As long as Ricky's happy, that's all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing that kind of contract has endeared him to the New
Orleans fans.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that won't endear him to New Orleans fans is fumbling.
He lost two fumbles in his first practice, but one wasn't his
fault. Afterward, he was asked about the fumbles 20 times by
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I count them, too, so it doesn't matter,'' he said about
reporters counting his fumbles. ``I dropped a pen, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be my toughest critic. I have to ask myself the same
thing (about why he fumbles).''
</P>
<P>
   After his exploits at Texas and his experiences of breaking Tony
Dorsett's Division I-A rushing record and winning the Heisman
Trophy, Williams has been ready for anything the Saints, including
Ditka, throw at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I don't like about him yet,'' Williams said of
Ditka. ``The fact that he shoots from the hip, you'll know where
you stand, like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Williams knows where he stands _ at the front of the
class. He tries to blend in and just be one of the guys. He has
limited interviews with the media to every other day so he can
``bond with my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   The only things that set him apart are his dreadlocks and the
crowd of adoring fans who besiege him every chance they get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous about this,'' he said. ``I didn't know what to
expect before I got here. Now I realize the tempo is full speed
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot of hard work to find out where I need
to be and then to get there. Being in better condition helps my
adjustment. If you're stronger and in better condition, you'll have
more confidence, and you'll be better prepared to do what you want
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a hazing incident last year that led to a lawsuit
being filed by a former player, Ditka lectured his players and told
them no hazing will be tolerated this year. He said if any rookies
are involved in such incidents, they should fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he won't fight back and resist, then I want him out of
here,'' Ditka said. ``If we'd had guys to stand up last year and
say, `Hey, I don't want any part of this,' that would have ended it
right there. If somebody tried to do that to me, I know one thing:
They might be able to do it, but I'd take some skin with me.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Williams ``would be out of here'' if he didn't
fight back, Ditka said, ``Ricky's part of this team like everyone
else, and he wouldn't want it any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka can't say enough good things about Williams, who is the
ideal player because he keeps his mouth shut, does what his coach
tells him and works extremely hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a very good attitude,'' Ditka said. ``He's not hung
up on who he is. He's just a kid trying to prove he's a good
player.''

ON KANSAS PRAIRIE, ROCKETEERS GIVE FLIGHT TO THEIR DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARGONIA, Kan. _ About the time most people are clocking in at
work or finishing up the newspaper at home this morning, Bruce Lee
will help escort a rocket he built to a specially made launch pad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He'll be among the last of at least 300 adults since Thursday
who have made the trek from as far away as Australia to this patch
of Kansas about 30 miles south of Wichita. They came to take part
in a shoot of ``Large and Dangerous Rocket Ships,'' otherwise known
as the annual Tripoli International High-Power Rocket Launch, the
largest and most prestigious annual event of its kind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Lee has brought the main event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the pad, the 47-year-old Omaha, Neb., resident and 10
technicians will prepare to launch the rocket, which, though scaled
down to one-third the size, is an exact reproduction of the Mercury
Redstone that launched Alan B. Shepard Jr. into space in 1961. And
as he prepares, Lee will pause to marvel at what he has made. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His rocket stands 30 feet high. If everything goes as planned,
the engine _ with its fuel supply equal to about 75,000 bottle
rockets _ will ignite properly. Then the exhaust cloud will first
spill across the Kansas prairie, then follow the rocket about a
mile or so skyward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lee says he will marvel again as it tumbles toward Earth and
parachutes _ on cue _ explode from within and gently land the
craft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps what he doesn't marvel at is exactly what is most
puzzling to outsiders: This is a hobby, a lark, what he does to
relax. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they said repeatedly over the loudspeakers this weekend:
``Welcome to the world of high power.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a world where grown men and women spend thousands of
dollars and hundreds of hours fine-tuning big toys. A world where
five days standing outside in hot pasture land was eagerly
anticipated. A world where limitations are set only by
imaginations, and everyone seems to have the imagination of a kid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday soon, probably this year, one of us is going to send a
rocket into outer space,'' Lee says, speaking about rockets made of
paperboard but powered by some of the same stuff that propels the
space shuttle. ``I mean, we count outer space as 50 miles up, and
we're getting pretty close to figuring out how to get there.
Imagine, being the first nongovernmental body to leave the
atmosphere.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. This is a hobby with its roots in the space race of
the late 1950s and '60s, when the orbit of the Soviet Sputnik
satellite scared the dickens out of Americans. Recently, that time
was captured in the movie ``October Sky,'' about four West Virginia
boys who took to making rockets. One of those boys, Quentin Wilson,
was in Argonia this weekend. It's the first such shoot he has
attended. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For years and years, I didn't have any playmates, so I didn't
shoot rockets. It's no fun by yourself, but this is great,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, this was a hobby for children. They made
little rockets, usually about a foot tall or so, then sneaked out
to a vacant lot and sent them a couple hundred feet into the air
with little engines they lighted by match. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And kids did shoot off rockets like those in Argonia this
weekend. But those involved in the hobby note that much has
changed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, more adults have gotten involved.
Consequently, backyard liftoffs weren't always enough. Little
rockets weren't always enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Dozens of official launch pads were set up for the event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Launch officials from a central post controlled the remote
electronic ignition of all rockets, meaning rockets were ``lit''
from at least a dozen yards and up to a quarter mile away, and only
when the launch official determined spectators and rocket owners
were in safe positions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Announcers counted down each launch over a loudspeaker system:
``On launch pad 53, ten, nine, eight ....'' Then they described
each flight, ``She's straight,'' ``We've got chute deployment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Rocketeers spoke in their own jargon: Strippers were rockets
whose speed sheared off their parachutes; streamers fell with
parachutes accidentally twisted into a single string; lawn darts
are those from which the chutes had failed to pop out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Rocket launchers were registered from most states and from
four countries, event officials said. This in a farming community
of 550 people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Emergency crews waited nearby, and official safety officers
added to the notion that Large and Dangerous Rocket Ships were just
what they sound like. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And they were. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bryant came from New York state to launch a rocket he'd
spent more than $1,000 and one year building. Upon ignition, the
engine malfunctioned. Flames shooting out the back sent the rocket
spiraling just high enough to twist the body when it crashed back
to Earth, where it caused a short-lived prairie fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a monumental disappointment, but it happens,'' he said
stoically, loading the wreckage into a van and preparing to go
home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time and time again, probably more than 1,000 times in all,
usually men but sometimes women would load rockets up to 20 feet
high onto launch rods or pads. After each ignition, hundreds of
spectators craned their necks to watch them race away and then
float back to Earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As one man noted, shading his eyes from the sun as he watched a
rocket fall: ``Only hobby on Earth where you sunburn the palms of
your hands.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hobby distinguishes itself from most others. Just ask
46-year-old Steve Swagerty of Overland Park, Kan., about who takes
note of his hobby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there were the people at the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. He needs two separate licenses from
that agency to store and use the materials needed to send his
rockets screaming into the sky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the folks at the Federal Communications
Commission. Without their permission, he wouldn't be allowed to
open up the signal that connects him to his toy rocket ship while
it's in flight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Federal Aviation Administration had to approve
all launch times. For this meet, the FAA approved a 25,000-foot
ceiling, though individuals could apply for more space. That's
needed because nobody wants to see these models hit or scare
passing airplanes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, quite frankly, the regulatory list is just getting started.
At various times, the Secret Service, FBI and CIA have all paid
attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why do it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Swagerty, it's obvious. Most days, he's a teacher in the
Shawnee Mission School District, a man who describes a full 51
weeks a year of his life as ``very normal, very predictable.'' But
that 52nd week is given to flying rockets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, every time one of my rockets lifts off, I'm 12 years
old again,'' he said. ``It's pure magic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As part of a Kansas City-based group of five that calls itself
the Rocket-Heads, Swagerty spent two years building his rocket.
It's 15 feet tall and contains three computers, a video camera, a
transmitter, a battery pack, an altitude counter and two
parachutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love is the process,'' he said. ``You visualize what it
is you want to do, then get your hands dirty in each stage of
actually doing it, and then it flies, and you can see the
results.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rocket partner James Murphy of Kansas City said there were many
challenges in that process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to learn or improve in areas from computers to
aeronautics to pyrotechnics to cameras,'' he said. ``We've had to
design our own rockets, then figure out what materials to make them
from. There's always something new to figure out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fins on their rocket, for example, are made from blue-foam
insulation, then painted with a fiberglass coating. Before they
could cut the foam to their own specifications, they had to make a
special tool. The cutting alone took a month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even these challenges are not always enough. &QL;

POOR HITTING SENDS PENA TO ALBUQUERQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Angel Pena, the rookie catcher who platooned with
Todd Hundley much of this season, was sent to Triple-A Albuquerque
after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, considered the Los Angeles Dodgers' top prospect, was
demoted after going 1 for 11 on the seven-game homestand. He will
be replaced by Paul LoDuca, who opened the season with the Dodgers
but batted just .056 in 14 games before he was sent back to the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, 27, struggled so much at the plate it appeared he might
never make it back to the big leagues. His situation wasn't helped
when he missed seven weeks at Albuquerque with a broken right hand.
But he returned to action July 20 and hit .459 (17 for 37) with two
doubles, a home run and four RBI in the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, 24, batted .208 with the Dodgers, but the club was excited
with his throwing arm and occasional power. He threw out a
respectable 28 percent of baserunners but upset the Dodgers with
his habit of throwing to second from his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Pena's conditioning also concerns the Dodgers. He is 5-foot-10
and weighs 228 pounds. In Saturday's loss to the Diamondbacks, Pena
had trouble getting to a pitch in the dirt by Alan Mills. Mills was
charged with a wild pitch, but the play illustrated Pena's lack of
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a quality big-league catcher and he'll be back one
day,'' said Hundley. ``He just needs to play.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shaw returns: On top of all the Dodgers problems, Jeff Shaw
has been struggling. He had dropped consecutive save opportunities
for the first time since April 1996 and both were painful losses to
the Reds and Diamondbacks on this homestand.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw rebounded Sunday with a scoreless ninth inning in the
Dodgers 4-2 victory over Arizona for his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the life of a closer,'' said Shaw, who had recorded 13
consecutive saves before blowing up earlier this week. ``You go
through little stretches like this, but you have stay confident in
your ability and it will turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park remains winless at
Dodger Stadium this season after lasting just five innings and
allowing two runs and five hits. He made some mistakes that
concerned manager Davey Johnson, who took him out after 104
pitches. ``I wouldn't call it a quality start, but he kept us in
the game and gave us a chance to win,'' Johnson said. ``He showed
good command and that pleased me; he just missed a few pitches, so
I got him out of there.'' Park, 9-4 with a 2.75 ERA last year at
Dodger Stadium, is 0-6 with a 6.25 ERA this season. . . . The
Dodgers leave this morning for a 10-game trip that begins with
three games in Houston, continues with four in New York against the
Mets and concludes with three in Montreal.

RETIRING FDA INSPECTOR LAMENTS AGENCY'S EASING UP ON AD CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After investing nearly two-thirds of his life
safeguarding foods and drugs for the American public, Roger Lowell
plans to bicycle across the nation, celebrate his successes and
perhaps forget about what still troubles him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a good job protecting your health and safety, but
we're not protecting your pocketbook anymore,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   A straight-shooter equally respected within the agency and by
many in the industries he has regulated, the FDA's top local
watchdog retired from his post Friday with a few words of advice
for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't eat raw fish ... and don't expect the FDA to protect you
from false advertising,'' said Lowell, the outgoing director of the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration's region 10 office and
laboratories in Bothell, Wash., north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the FDA's mission when Lowell first joined the
agency in 1963 was protecting consumers from fraud. As a food
inspector, he would routinely assess the accuracy of advertising
and packaging claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency simply doesn't pay any attention to that today,''
Lowell said. Despite an FDA mission statement that still claims
responsibility for assuring ``that the public has access to
truthful and non-misleading product information,'' he says the
agency can no longer give such assurance.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes this to congressional restraints on the agency's
resources that, over time, have forced the FDA to abandon
regulating market claims in many areas and to instead focus its
efforts on public health and safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore this point, the main entrance of the Bothell
campus of the FDA features one of the agency's public art projects
_ a crosswalk marking designed to look like a merchandise bar code
with the words ``Caveat Emptor'' (Latin for ``let the buyer
beware'') written on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the staff here hate that because it implies we're not
doing our job,'' Lowell said. ``I think it's OK. It emphasizes that
in some areas, such as in the marketing of products, consumers need
to protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, he said, that people today seem more concerned
about the safety of the food supply than they do about being
cheated. As far as he's concerned, food is much safer than it's
ever been while more people than ever are being defrauded by false
claims and misleading marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are way too paranoid about their food today,'' Lowell
said. There are risks out there _ raw seafood, unpasteurized juices
or other vehicles for foodborne bacterial illness _ but he
considers the food supply exceptionally safe.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's Bothell branch, which has regulatory responsibility
for Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska, is the agency's
lead facility for monitoring seafood safety and quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northwest seafood industry has a close relationship with
the FDA stretching back to the 1920s,'' said Roger DeCamp, director
of the Seattle office of the National Food Processors Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger has continued and improved on that cooperative
relationship by doing his job in a cooperative way, by friendly
persuasion,'' DeCamp said. ``He's very highly respected by industry
for being fair and even-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell once got fired briefly by the head of the FDA for being
too fair to the industry. In 1993, a hypodermic syringe was found
in a can of Diet Pepsi in Seattle, prompting an alert to the FDA
and local media of possible product tampering. This was on the
heels of the 1991 cyanide-tainted Sudafed tampering case in Tacoma
and Olympia that killed two people.
</P>
<P>
   What the public doesn't know, Lowell said, is that his agency
gets about 100 such product-tampering reports every year and most
turn out to be mistakes or deliberate hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 Pepsi case, Lowell said his investigators were
fairly certain the syringe came from a diabetic family member of
the elderly couple who reported finding it in their can. The family
member admitted disposing of needles in empty cans but claimed not
to have done it in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this was the case still isn't clear, he said, but it was
clear that all of the other such alleged tamperings prompted by
media attention to this scare were hoaxes or even attempts to
extort money from Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, correctly it turned out, didn't believe this was a
product-tampering case and didn't alert then-FDA commissioner Dr.
David Kessler to the event. When Kessler woke up the next morning
to learn of the episode on television, Lowell said he was promptly
fired by Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fired for about two hours, until later when he had
calmed down and learned what had happened,'' Lowell said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger's very level-headed and able to manage stressful
situations well,'' said Joe Baca, FDA district director in Dallas
and a former investigator for Lowell in Seattle. ``He's always very
positive and constructive no matter what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, 60, is an avid bicyclist who commuted 30 miles on two
wheels every day between work and home and sometimes started his
workday in his biking gear before changing into his slacks and
dress shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Baca, who will join Lowell and others Aug. 18 on their
cross-country cycling trek, said his staff took advantage one day
of his tendency to keep his bike gear on. They sewed the pant legs
of his slacks together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a big kick out of that,'' Baca said.

BURBS (Phoenix) _ Syringes in park sandboxes. Naked men in public
bathrooms. Drunks snoring in the bushes. Residents say they're sick
of it. Thousands of homeless people are migrating to the suburbs
from downtown Phoenix, but few services have followed them. As a
result, the homeless _ especially older, single men _ are gathering
in the streets and parks of Phoenix, Glendale, Mesa, Scottsdale and
Tempe. But doing something about the problem is a lot more
complicated than it sounds, officials say. Coping with the Phoenix
area's migrating homeless is hampered by the clash between every
resident's desire to enjoy his or her neighborhood and every
citizen's right to move freely about public places. By BILL
HERMANN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

HOHOKAM (Coolidge, Ariz.) Five hundred years after their

Wal-Mart store in Coolidge, Ariz., scheduled to begin in May, has
been put on hold while company officials sort out claims by
archaeologists that the land contains valuable Hohokam artifacts.
Wal-Mart's 35-acre plot lies across a highway from the Casa Grande

RED SOX NIP YANKEES, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Orlando Hernandez complained of a tired arm and took
himself out of a game after six innings last week, and in the days
that followed he grew exasperated whenever reporters asked him
about his arm. Don't make a big deal out of this, he said through
an interpreter. It's not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But with Roger Clemens pitching erratically, it is a big deal
when Hernandez, the de facto No. 2 starter, gets hit as hard as the
Red Sox hit him on Sunday night, in his first outing since
mentioning his tired arm.
</P>
<P>
   Boston blistered six extra-base hits over five-plus innings
against Hernandez, beating the Yankees, 5-4. Bret Saberhagen
retired the last 14 batters he faced in his seven innings as the
Red Sox took two of three in this three-game series. Derek Jeter
went 0 for 5, extending his streak of hitless at-bats to 14 when he
grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (62-41) declined to trade Andy Pettitte for minor
leaguers mostly because they did not want to surrender an
experienced and proven pitcher during a pennant race _ and although
the Yankees seemed destined for the playoffs, something of a
pennant race is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, ignited by the hitting of Shawn Green and bolstered by
the addition of David Segui, swept Detroit in a weekend series to
draw within five games of the Yankees in the American League East,
one game ahead of Boston. The Blue Jays begin a three-game series
in Yankee Stadium on Monday, with David Wells (11-6) pitching
against Pettitte (7-8).
</P>
<P>
   The league has studied and adjusted to Hernandez. When he drops
his arm and throws his sweeping slider from the side, right-handed
batters don't always swing, as they did in 1998. Hernandez likes to
throw curveballs to left-handed batters, a pitch the hitters often
ignored; now there are times when they seem to be looking for it.
The convergence of Hernandez's knee and chin at the beginning of
his delivery is no longer a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has adjusted, too, using his fastball more, jamming
hitters. Earlier this season, Hernandez began to ask teammates more
about certain opposing batters; he began checking scouting reports,
something he never really did in 1998, when Hernandez stubbornly
insisted that he need only pitch to his strengths, rather adapt to
the weaknesses of the batters. Like David Cone, Hernandez usually
navigates his way through trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday night, he seemed to have nothing with which he
could combat the Red Sox; it was if he was going through the Amazon
jungle without a compass. Hernandez's breaking pitches did not
appeared fine, and his fastball was mediocre. He was in trouble
constantly; the first Boston batter reached base in every inning _
a five-pitch walk in the first inning, a four-pitch walk in the
second inning, doubles by Damon Buford in the third and fifth, and
a home run and a double by Brian Daubach in the fourth and sixth
innings, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was hanging on, nonetheless, the score 2-2 after five
innings. Bernie Williams tripled home the Yankees' first run,
lining the ball to the warning track in the deepest part of center
field, and in the third inning, Williams' sacrifice fly allowed
Scott Brosius to score. Tino Martinez ended both rallies, however,
by popping out with a runner in scoring position. Martinez is
batting .268 with a respectable 62 runs batted in, but by his own
standards, he is not having a good season. Martinez went into this
game 67 at-bats removed from his last home run; his next home run
will be the 200th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Everything caved in on Hernandez in the bottom of the sixth.
After Daubach slammed his double into the right field corner, Nomar
Garciaparra laced a run-scoring single to right, and on the very
next pitch, Troy O'Leary slammed a home run to right-center field,
a monster blow; Hernandez stood on the mound, arms folded loosely
across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Watson began throwing in the bullpen and Mel Stottlemyre,
the Yankees' pitching coach, chose that moment to walk very slowly
to the mound. Hernandez, knowing he was close to being taken out,
moved his hands demonstratively while responding to Stottlemyre,
pleading his case.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jefferson ripped a double, Hernandez threw a ball high
and outside to Jason Varitek, and Torre moved out of the dugout to
pull Hernandez. Once Hernandez saw Torre, he went to the back of
the mound, classic self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen (7-4) threw mostly fastballs, with mixed results
early; the Yankees had the bases loaded with one out in the third
inning, scored on Williams' fly ball _ and would not place another
runner against Saberhagen. Over seven innings, he allowed five
hits, no walks and two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored two runs in the top of the eighth against
Boston's Tim Wakefield, with Williams tripling again to score one
run. They loaded the bases with two out in the ninth, but Jeter
grounded into a game-ending forceout.

REVIEW OF NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS

 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic

   Here are Anne Stevenson's New &AMP; Notable books:
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the Oval Office'' &QL; 
By William Doyle (Kodansha, $28) &QL; 
What were they ``thinking,''``'' these powerful men who recorded
conversations that should have been left to our imaginations?
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a microphone hidden in his desk lamp, and
it preserved, among other things, his embarrassing responses to
civil-rights leaders A. Philip Randolph and Walter White, who in
1940 went to the Oval Office to push for integration of the U.S.
military. The tape of the meeting reveals the visitors to be
eloquent and firm, while Roosevelt is condescending and vaguely
racist. At one point, he addresses the issue of putting Black men
aboard Navy ships with this suggestion: ``Another thing (that) I
forgot to mention . . . is this. We are training a certain number
of musicians on board ship. The ship's ``band.'' There's no reason
why we shouldn't have a colored band on some of these ships,
because they're ``darn good at it.'' That's something we should
look into. You know, if it'll increase the ``opportunity,'' that's
what we're after. They may develop a ``leader'' of the band.'' And
consider this exchange as John and Robert Kennedy and their aides
deal with riots after James Meredith's attempts to register as the
first Black student at the University of Mississippi. JFK: ``It's
going to be a long fall in Oxford. I think we oughta get the
National Guard within, you know, shouting distance.'' RFK: ``Yeah.
We have control over the air. If you have gas, you got a pretty
good operation going. They got 500 marshals. You see, they're
sitting there, and they're throwing iron.'' JFK: ``Spikes?'' RFK:
``. . . spikes and they're throwing Coke bottles and they're
throwing rocks.'' JFK: What's Barnett (Mississippi Gov. Ross
Barnett) doing?'' RFK: ``I suppose laughing at us.'' (Laughter in
room.) VOICE: ``This reminds me a little bit of the Bay of Pigs.''
RFK: ``Yech!'' (Laughter in room.) Doyle looks at the bugging
habits of the past 11 presidents. The transcripts are brief but
fascinating, although they are faulty history. Less interesting is
the analysis Doyle offers as he explores the 20th-century tradition
of presidential eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weight of Dreams''By Jonis Agee (Viking, $24.95) &QL; 
Agee's new novel is so packed with stories that it's not easy to
describe. The central character is Ty Bonte, who has grown up on a
Nebraska ranch with an abusive father and a mother grown distant
after the death of Ty's younger brother, Ronnie. Ty is 17 when the
book begins and about to take part in an event that will govern the
rest of his life: One night, he and his friend, Harney Rivers,
brutally beat two Indians from a nearby reservation, and Tyruns off
before he can be arrested. He ends up in Kansas, where he builds a
life for himself as a horse trader. Now, 20 years have passed, and
although he is haunted by both Ronnie's death and that horrible
night with Harney, he has managed to reinvent himself enough to
begin a comfortable relationship with a woman who has secrets of
her own. It all goes well until Harney reappears and commits acts
so vicious that they make his previous sins seem like child's play.
All of this, astonishingly enough, takes place in the first 100
pages, leaving nearly 300 to resolve everything. This novel offers
violence, romance, ranch life, lots of horses, parental blame,
parental forgiveness, courtroom drama, a hate crime, lots of
remorse and even more redemption. And Agee's fans will be happy to
see Latta Jaboy and Cody Kidwell, characters from her novel,
``Strange Angels,'' who play supporting roles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go for the Goal''By Mia Hamm (HarperCollins, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She can do anything he can do and better. Even Michael Jordan
must believe it by now. This book was released in April, but its
publisher is sending it around again for those of you who woke up
with the World Cup. Part autobiography, part soccer primer, part
paean to the joys of team play, it is earnest to the point of
stodginess, which just makes Hamm more admirable than she already
was. There are photos of skill and rough play, a glossary of soccer
terms, diagrams of maneuvers and even a page from Hamm's training
log, which we read but did not understand (New &AMP; Notable is not
intense). There are also words of wisdom, as when Hamm talks about
soccer's way of humbling its players. In any match, she says, there
are two opponents _ the other team and soccer itself. Sometimes,
you can outplay the different-color shirts. But you never beat the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Queen Mother's Century''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lacey &QL; 
(Little Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   She was awfully cute when she was little, and she's awfully cute
now. In between, there was a long succession of bad hats. And bad
jewelry, bad parasols, bad photo opportunities, as when she posed,
smiling sweetly, in a bombed-out London neighborhood after a Nazi
air raid. But if anyone could pull it off, it was the Queen Mother,
who was born in 1900 and whose plump, serene presence is certainly
a hook upon which to hang another century book. Lacey makes a lame
effort to mention news events over the years, but this is really
just an excuse to look at royal photos. Our favorite shows Princess
Margaret, Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother dressed in plaid
skirts and standing in a barnyard, frumpy women all. Queen Mum has
a Band-Aid on her shin and is gamely balancing a milk bucket on her
head. It's an improvement over those hats.

 CHIRON CORP. BELIEVES A SLOW AND STEADY PACE WILL WIN THE RACE  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When studying stock charts, investors like to see lines that
rise up and to the right. Judged by this criteria, Chiron Corp. is
a flat-liner.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three years, regardless of market trends or its
internal rumblings, shares in the Emeryville biotech have lingered
around the low 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The stock stood at $18.63 in January 1997, when Chief Executive
and co-founder Ed Penhoet announced he would resign and return to
academia. The stock rose slightly, to $21.44, over the next 14
months as Chiron searched the world over for a new leader before
appointing British drug industry veteran Sean Lance as Penhoet's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with Lance long settled in his post, sitting
comfortably on $1.4 billion in cash earned by selling off bits of
the business, its shares have barely blipped. Chiron did have a
good day Friday (July 30), when it won approval to sell its flu
vaccine in Europe. That sent the stock up 8.4 percent to $25.06.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly analysts, like Jim McCamant of the Medical Technology
Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif., think Chiron has remain stalled
so long that the momentum players who rule Wall Street have
overlooked the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this is not false optimism, but I have a sense this is
going to change,'' McCamant said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analyst Alex To of Credit Suisse First Boston has a
``strong buy'' recommendation out on Chiron. He recently issued a
report touting Chiron's new blood-screening system for HIV and
Hepatitis C (see May 31 article in the San Francisco Chronicle) as
a huge potential earnings boost.
</P>
<P>
   But McCamant and To are in a minority. Most analysts have a hold
on Chiron.
</P>
<P>
   The company will have another chance to wake up Wall Street when
it reports its second-quarter earnings after the close of trading
August 3 One consensus estimate predicts quarterly earnings of 14
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   In an 80-minute briefing last week, Lance and his key managers,
including Chief Financial Officer Jim Sulat, had to steer clear of
talking about finances, while trying to counter the impression that
Chiron is slow, slumbering or darn near dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, nothing appears to be happening, but a hell
of a lot is going on,'' Lance said.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to Chiron, he found a company going off in too many
directions. He has tried to focus on establishing the
blood-screening business, developing a handful of promising new
drugs, and expanding the markets for current drugs, like
cancer-fighting Proleukin, and Betaseron for multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   In word and deed, Lance comes across as a man who takes his
time. Seated at the head of a polished conference table, with
managers arrayed at intervals, Lance explained why Chiron has not
sold the European subsidiary that distributes flu shots and other
vaccines _ something that seemed likely when he addressed biotech
investors at the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist conference in San Francisco in
January. ``I am slowly moving to the belief that if we can manage
and consolidate (the European business), we should keep it,'' Lance
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance has followed the same tortoise timetable for investing the
cash Chiron earned from the sale of its diagnostics business last
year. With small and mid-size biotech companies enduring the worst
cash crunch in industry history, Chiron has an opportunity to
cherry-pick promising technologies at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Chiron execs whether they had done any deals, a
moment of silence occurred as heads turned around the table.
Someone recalled a single licensing deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Lance has moved slowly, he gets an understanding nod from
longtime biotech observer Cynthia Robbins-Roth of BioVenture
Consulting in San Mateo, Calif..
</P>
<P>
   ``Chiron has been run since its inception by the same crew of
guys at the top,'' she said. ``It's a tough place to come in to.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lance only consolidated his hold on the company in May,
when he became chairman as well as CEO, replacing co-founder Bill
Rutter, who remained on the board in an advisory capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Lance learned the importance of boardroom chess the hard way
from his former employer, Sir Richard Sykes, imperious chief
executive of Glaxo Wellcome, the British drug giant. Lance had
risen through Glaxo's ranks for 12 years to become second in
command. He had been Sir Richard's anointed successor _ right up
until the latter abruptly dumped Lance in a dispute over merger
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Now undisputed master of Chiron, Lance extols a Churchillian
philosophy. ``We've got to hold our nerve and do what we're doing,
and more of it, and the Street will come around,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street isn't his only audience. Novartis, the Swiss
pharmaceutical firm, holds about 44 percent of Chiron shares and
three of 11 seats on its board. Anytime after January 15, 2000,
Novartis has the right to increase its stake to 55 percent, at
Chiron's market price.
</P>
<P>
   The year after that, Novartis is free to make an offer to buy
all of Chiron. But it must negotiate such a deal with Chiron's
outside board members, who can demand a premium over the stock's
market price before surrendering control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiron-Novartis situation is reminiscent of the relationship
between Genentech Inc. and Roche Holdings. Roche, which is
headquartered down the street from Novartis in Basel, Switzerland,
recently exercised an option to take over Genentech _ then reissued
about 17 percent of Genentech's stock to give the company a Wall
Street presence.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel isn't lost on Lance, who can only guess what
Novartis will do when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could end up as a subsidiary, with some sort of
Genentech-like independence, that could be something we could live
with,'' Lance said.

 NET SCREENING TOOLS HELP TARGET FUNDS  &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent column, I described how to evaluate mutual funds,
but I didn't tell you how to find funds worth analyzing.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  You can find those funds by screening _ a method of
searching through the entire mutual funds universe to find those
that meet certain predetermined criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites offer mutual fund screening. My favorite is
Quicken (www.quicken.com) because: 1. Its screening tools are easy
to use, 2. You can screen using Morningstar's Star Ratings and 3.
It's free and doesn't require registration.
</P>
<P>
   From Quicken's home page, click on ``Pick Top Funds'' to display
the Fund Finder. You can use predefined screens or create your own
custom searches.
</P>
<P>
   Start with Quicken's predefined screens by clicking on ``Popular
Searches.'' Quicken has come up with 10 equity fund searches for
five categories: Morningstar's Best, Best of the No-Load, Low
Expense Funds, Best Small Funds, Best of the Market Cap Segments
and Best Getting Started Funds.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite category is Morningstar's Best, which consists of
two searches: rankings by five- and 10-year performances. Both
select funds with Five-Star Morningstar ratings. Five-star funds
have the best combination of historical return and risk ratings,
according to Morningstar. A five-star rating doesn't guarantee that
the fund will do well in the future, but it's a good place to start
your selection process.
</P>
<P>
   I like the five-year performance search. I find five-year
returns as good a predictor of future performance as 10-year
returns _ especially because many funds haven't been around for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   By clicking on the five-year search, you will bring up a list of
the 25 Morningstar five-star funds with the best five-year average
annual returns, sorted with the best-performing funds at the top.
</P>
<P>
   When I ran the screen last week, the Firsthand Technology Value
fund topped the list, with an astonishing 50.6 percent average
annual return. There were four other funds listed with annual
returns in excess of 40 percent. All of the top 25 funds showed
returns of 32 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 funds appeared on one screen. All told, 695 five-star
rated funds were listed if one went through all the screens.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fund name, ticker symbol and star rating, the report
lists the front-load, expense ratio, manager tenure and net assets.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get your search results, you can select other display
options to see returns ranging from three months to 10 years, fees,
valuation ratios and purchase requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The eight additional predefined screens also are powerful. You
can search for the best no-load funds with low expense ratios; the
best large-cap, midcap or small-cap funds; small funds, tiny funds
or funds with low minimum initial-investment requirements. If these
choices don't satisfy you, you can define your own screens.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken gives you two ways to build custom searches: EasyStep
Search and Full Search. EasyStep leads you through the
search-definition process step by step. I find it tedious and more
trouble than it's worth. Full Search is intuitive, versatile and
much faster to use. Here's a rundown of your screening choices
using Full Search. You don't have to use all of them. If you don't
care about a particular characteristic, simply set the drop-down
selection to ``any.''
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Information.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first of five major sections of the Full Search. You
can limit your search to such Morningstar categories as emerging
markets, high-yield bond, large growth, small value, etc. This is
important to investors who want to allocate their investments
according to asset categories. I don't, so I leave it set to ``All
Categories.''
</P>
<P>
   You also can specify the Star Rating you want in this section
with choices ranging from ``any'' to ``five stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Performance Data.
</P>
<P>
   You can set minimum acceptable returns for periods ranging from
three months to 10 years. Either enter a specific minimum return or
simply require that the funds beat the S&AMP;P 500 index for the
period. (The other drop-down selections, MSCI World and LB
Aggregate, refer to international and bond indices.)
</P>
<P>
   Except for three months and year-to-date, all returns are
expressed as average annual returns. For me, short-term returns
aren't significant and 10 years is too long, so I only specify
three- and five-year returns.
</P>
<P>
   Expenses.
</P>
<P>
   You can select loads, expense ratio and other fees. If you want
a no-load fund, select ``none'' for front-end load and deferred
sales charge. The expense ratio includes the 12b-1 fee, so there is
no point in specifying it separately.
</P>
<P>
   Operations Data.
</P>
<P>
   This includes miscellaneous items such as minimum initial
investment, fund size and manager tenure. Unfortunately, the
maximum choice for initial investment size is ``$2,000 or less.''
That's too small for many funds, so I usually select ``any.''
</P>
<P>
   Return.
</P>
<P>
   This section would more accurately be titled ``risk factors.''
It includes average price/earnings and price/book ratios and the
average size of companies making up the funds' portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   After filling in the values for the five sections in the search,
hit a button called ``show results.''
</P>
<P>
   You will see a list of funds that meet your selection criteria.
You may end with too many or too few funds. If you do, readjust
your screening criteria. If you found too few funds, consider
loosening requirements in these areas first: 10-year total return,
expense ratio, price/earnings and price/book ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced investors consider screening results just the
beginning of the evaluation process.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to look at the details of each fund's
performance records and current portfolio. The best place to find
this information is on Morningstar (www.morningstar.net). If you
missed our columns describing how we evaluate funds, you can find
them in the Basic Training section of our Web site
(www.winninginvesting.com). Look for Mutual Fund Evaluation _ the
Basics.

WHY TWO TITANS ARE BATTLING OVER INSTANT MESSAGING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM STEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Instant messaging has made me a happier, more adjusted
person,'' said 33-year-old Randy Weston.
</P>
<P>
   Though there's a slight hint of sarcasm in his voice, he really
means it. After all, when Weston departed San Francisco three years
ago to start a new career as an editor in Boston, he left behind
many close friends and relatives with whom he gradually lost touch.
</P>
<P>
   But then he discovered America Online's instant messaging
software, which can be downloaded for free off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who slipped off my radar screen are now back on,'' he
said. ``With instant messaging, I can see which of my friends are
online and I can talk with them in real-time as if we were on the
phone. I'm real bad about letter writing and e-mailing, but not
instant messaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston is just one of the approximately 100 million rabid users
of instant messaging around the world. For the most part, these
users are glued to their computer screens. Users of America
Online's product alone exchange 750 million messages a day. Those
are the kind of habits big Internet players covet.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of instant messaging is so significant that
Microsoft and America Online are now locked in a bitter war over
what is today a free piece of software.
</P>
<P>
   The two Internet giants are battling over who will control
standards for how the software works _ specifically, how various
messaging products will exchange messages with one another.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the industry leader, boasting 40 million and 38 million
users, respectively, on its AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) and ICQ
(short for I Seek You) products. Microsoft just entered the fray
with its MSN Messenger, but says 700,000 people downloaded the
software in its first week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly every major company in the high-tech industry is
choosing sides. AOL has recruited the chief technologists and CEOs
from some of Silicon Valley's biggest names _ Sun, Apple, Novell _
to create a standard, while Microsoft is rallying such allies as
Yahoo (which has its own instant-message product), AT&AMP;T and
Infoseek to support a separate standards body.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging software typically allows you to create a list
of friends and colleagues _ what AOL calls its ``buddy list'' _ who
use the same flavor of instant messaging you do. It then notifies
you when a person on your list logs onto the Internet. Then you can
type messages back and forth in a little pop-up window on your
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging software could provide an ideal platform for
sending targeted advertisements directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, for instance, asks its users to provide demographic
information before downloading the software. Some software is also
able to track the habits and behavioral patterns of users, and take
some actions in response. Yahoo's instant messenger product, for
example, can notify a user when the price of a particular stock
goes up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic information is valuable to advertisers, who will
gladly pay an premium to ensure their ads are directed at the
appropriate audience.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say it's only a matter of time before instant-message
vendors transform some of their prime real estate into virtual
billboards for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web today is already generating billions of dollars in
advertising revenue,'' said Richard Dym, vice president of
marketing at Tribal Voice Inc., a Scotts Valley maker of instant
messaging software with a user base 5 million strong. ``We will see
a shift of those dollars to our side because ads displayed on our
software will be more targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although instant messaging has largely been a social phenomenon
for staying in touch with friends, it has some potential business
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Say you have an urgent question for a co-worker across the
country. You could try the phone or e-mail, but you have no idea if
that person is at her desk and available to respond. With instant
messaging, however, you know who is online and can direct your
question to the person best able to respond the quickest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important story here is the corporate world will move from
e-mail to interactive communication because it works as fast as
businesspeople,'' says Dym.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are a host of drawbacks to instant messaging. The
biggest problem is a lack of common standards and protocols.
</P>
<P>
   None of the existing products can communicate with one another.
This means that if you use Yahoo's software, you can't chat online
with a friend who prefers Microsoft's product. Even users of the
two different AOL offerings cannot exchange chat messages.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers have noted the impracticality of this
arrangement, likening it to a phone system that wouldn't allow
someone who uses Sprint for long-distance to call a friend who uses
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a problem with only being able to chat with
friends on AOL, and not with people on other systems,'' said
Weston. ``AOL kind of forced me to become an evangelist for them to
get my friends on the same platform. I was never really comfortable
with that. I don't think there is any way AOL can continue to keep
this proprietary.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Yahoo agree. In fact, Microsoft tried to force the
issue a little over a week ago when it introduced its entry into
the market, MSN Messenger. Unlike other messaging products, it
boasted interoperability features that allowed users to communicate
with friends on AOL's offering.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL cried foul and said Microsoft was gaining unauthorized
access to its servers by asking people who downloaded MSN Messenger
to first provide their AOL passwords. AOL attempted to block the
connection, but Microsoft continued to one-up AOL by releasing new
versions of its software that circumvent attempts to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has joined forces with Yahoo, Prodigy and others in an
attempt to establish a common standard for instant messaging. These
companies said they are all willing to work with the Internet
Engineering Task Force, an independent standards agency. So far,
AOL has not committed itself to the group.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, for its part, does not like the idea of being pushed around
in a market it now dominates. The company has enlisted the help of
Apple, Sun and Novell to form its own standards group.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group, expects to
see some kind of standard by the end of next year. ``Whoever
chooses not to adopt a common standard will lose their installed
base,'' he said. ``If I have a communications product that doesn't
communicate with others, then it's not worth very much.''

PRODUCT DEVELOPERS FEUD WITH PALM COMPUTING  &HT;     BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Tom Hazzard had a vision while using his Palm
organizer: Why not create a device that functioned as both a
stylus, which could enter data into the handheld electronic device,
and a pen?
</P>
<P>
   The former furniture designer and his wife decided to join the
growing community of developers who craft companion products for
the popular device, and began courting Palm's endorsement of a
``dual-action stylus.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of becoming the latest must-have gadget for the
Palm, Hazzard's Rhode Island company is on the verge of suing
3Com's Palm Computing division for patent infringement. Ttools
wants the company to stop selling its own Palm-branded dual-action
stylus.
</P>
<P>
   It's a precarious situation for Ttools, &LR;   &LR; which is essentially
biting the hand that feeds it. But the company's concerns are not
unique. Some developers say Palm's treatment of Ttools is
indicative of a larger problem between Palm and the developer
community. Third-party vendors complain that Palm has hurt
developers by keeping information about upcoming products so secret
that companies cannot design products before the latest Palm hits
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Palm officials would not comment on the patent dispute, but
acknowledged that Ttools has a patent on a dual-action stylus
similar to one Palm sells. Gabriel Acosta-Lopez, director of
platform development services for Palm, said there is no friction
with the third-party community and said Palm is trying to come to
an agreement with Ttools.
</P>
<P>
   But Tracy Leigh, president of Ttools, said the two companies
have been in discussions for months and there is no agreement in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Ttools approached Palm about a year and half ago and showed Palm
officials _ under a nondisclosure agreement _ its dual-action
stylus, whose patent was then pending.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies initially discussed featuring the Ttools
dual-action stylus in Palm's coveted catalog of Palm accessories,
but those talks fell off. Then, Palm approached Ttools about
licensing its technology to develop its own Palm-branded stylus.
Those talks also ended.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, four months after Ttools filed its patent
application, Palm filed its own patent request for a dual-action
stylus. Ttools got its patent in June 1999; Palm's application is
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after their talks collapsed, Leigh saw a
Palm-branded dual action stylus featured in Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The product is a complete overlap,'' Leigh said. ``Third-party
developers seem to be completely disrespected by Palm.''
</P>
<P>
   Other developers agree, saying they fear Palm is trying to
cannibalize its development community by giving itself a head start
so its own Palm-branded accessories hit shelves before any
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   While anyone can develop a product for the Palm, only a few
products are Palm-branded and included in the company's accessory
catalog. They include luxury items like leather cases made by Coach
or Dooney and Bourke.
</P>
<P>
   Developers said their experience with the Palm V, which is much
thinner than previous versions, has soured them on Palm. Most
developers said they did not get the specifications of the Palm V
product until it hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``My frustration is that they have been very protective of their
pre-launch information,'' said a third-party vendor, who did not
want to be named for fear of ruining the company's relationship
with Palm. The developer, who makes a case for the PalmPilot, said
Palm's failure to release information on the Palm V set his
company's production back months.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh said her company's product was too big for the Palm V
because the PDA had a smaller port for the stylus to rest in. After
the Palm V hit the market, the company raced to make a proper-sized
stylus, but lost out on three months of business. Palm, on the
other hand, was able to offer its pen/stylus products the day the
Palm V was released.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta-Lopez said the complaints of Leigh and other developers
are unfounded. He said Palm works closely with developers to make
sure they get the support they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great relationship with our development community,''
he said. ``We're growing at a rate of 500 developers per week.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently more than 17,000 third-party developers who
make both software and hardware for Palm products.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta-Lopez said Palm does not release advance information
about Palm products to most vendors because specifications can
change before the device is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't preannounce products,'' he said. ``For certain
developers we do, but it takes us about two months before shipping
until we're final on what the product looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   One developer, who did not want to be identified, said that
policy cost him five months of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were given zero lead time on the Palm V,'' said the
developer, who makes a popular accessory. He also said he's heard
that Palm plans to make a product similar to his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm is going to shut out innovation this way because
third-party developers are going to be hesitant to put time into
developing solutions if they feel that 3Com is going to just turn
around and do it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm started cultivating a third-party community about three or
four years ago and has seen an explosion in vendors wanting to
piggyback on the PDA's success.
</P>
<P>
   3Com hosts Palm development conferences each year and has a
resource guide in which third-party vendors can pay to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dubinsky, who founded Palm and now heads a Palo Alto
company called Handspring, said there are bound to be a few
disgruntled developers but that, in general, the third-party
community is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ecstatic developer community. They're thrilled with
the tools they get and the ability to quickly develop things,''
Dubinsky said. As for the complaints, Dubinsky said, ``There's
always a built-in tension between the platform supplier and
developers. Developers all want to be bundled on every unit and the
platform supplier has to make choices. It's always hard and it
wouldn't surprise me to end up with a couple of unhappy
developers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``I meet with developers pretty regularly and I
have absolutely no sense of broad dissatisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh of Ttools said while some developers may be happy, her
company has lost more than $3 million in potential sales because of
its fight with Palm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we been in their catalog from the start, we would probably
have made $3.8 million,'' Leigh said. ``We haven't even hit $1
million in sales in our first year.'' The Ttools products are for
sale on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh said she realizes that taking legal action against Palm
will alienate the company, but said it's her company's only
recourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conceived of the product first, it's been notarized and
Palm refuses to acknowledge this,'' Leigh said. ``If I didn't think
we had a winning argument, I wouldn't be risking my company.''

SAMPRAS: `LET PEOPLE KNOW I'M ENJOYING IT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pete Sampras, comedian?
</P>
<P>
   Sampras long has been known as unexciting, bland, even ``dull,''
as he called himself Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the tennis community might be seeing a new Sampras on the
tour, if this week's stop at UCLA and the Mercedes-Benz Cup is any
indication.
</P>
<P>
   In giving chase to a ball in Saturday's semifinal over James
Sekulov, Sampras climbed a backstop to try and get a ball and
appeared to play peek-a-boo with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, against Andre Agassi, he reached for a shot and ran
up the stairs 10 rows. When the chair umpire asked late-arrivers to
find a seat, Sampras lobbed a tennis ball at the offending fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. brings that out,'' Sampras said. ``I'm to the point where
I've achieved so many goals. Now, it's time to go out and let
people know I'm enjoying it. People want to see me smile. It can
help me out and loosen me up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ And in doubles: Byron Black and Wayne Ferreira beat Brian
MacPhie and Goran Ivanisevic, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), to win the doubles
title.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tournament discovery: Everyone knew about Sampras and Andre
Agassi. Fewer knew about Andrew Ilie, but they do now.
</P>
<P>
   It started when Ilie ripped his shirts off after winning
hard-fought, three-set matches over Byron Black and Anthony Dupuis.
</P>
<P>
   When Ilie served a 134 mph ace in the first game of Saturday's
semifinal against Agassi, the crowed oohed and aaahed. One man
remarked, ``Oh God! Where does he come from?''
</P>
<P>
   When Ilie won the first game, the man said, ``This is not a
given.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Ilie is unknown. The Romanian-born Aussie is
ranked 61st, having reached the semifinals here and in Dubai this
year, as well as the fourth round of the Australian Open and third
round of the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   He also made the crowd laugh when he mimicked the numerous young
girls who were screaming somewhere on the UCLA campus but close
enough for Ilie to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the shot of the tournament, Ilie running down an
Agassi drop volley, leaping up and hitting the winner through his
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes went haywire,'' Agassi said. ``All I saw were legs,
and then I was thinking, `Wow! What has to go through your mind to
take a shot like that? You certainly have to lose perspective.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ilie has tried and failed to convert that shot four other times.
``I do it because I enjoy it,'' he explained. ``I don't do it to
entertain the crowd. I'm selfish. I like to entertain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ranking jump: Sampras moved from 2 to 1 by reaching Sunday's
final. By reaching Saturday's semifinal, Sekulov's ranking leaped
from 236 to the 160s.
</P>
<P>
   __ Attendance: The tournament drew 81,433 fans for the week, a
three-year high. Officials cited several factors, not the least of
which was the quality of the 32-team tournament that included
Agassi and Sampras, who won the French Open and Wimbledon this
year.

ANCIENT HO HOKAM HALT WAL-MART PLAN: ARIZONA SITE MAY HOLD RELICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH GREENSPAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOLIDGE, Ariz. _ Five hundred years after their disappearance,
the Hohokam Indians are involved in a 20th century land battle _
this time against economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of a Wal-Mart store in Coolidge, scheduled to begin
in May, has been put on hold while company officials sort out
claims by archaeologists that the land contains valuable Hohokam
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's 35-acre plot lies across a highway from the Casa
Grande Ruins National Monument, the oldest archaeological reserve
in the country and the only national monument of the Hohokam Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an archaeological standpoint, it would be hard to pick a
worse spot to build on in Arizona,'' said Keith Kintigh, an
anthropology professor at Arizona State University who also is
president of the Society for American Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins date back to A.D. 1250 and are part of a critical
Hohokam period, Kintigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers across the Southwest are hitting historical
roadblocks these days as they make room for highways and housing
complexes.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California recently, archaeologists discovered an
unprecedented number of ice age animal fossils while building a
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago in Chandler, archaeologists saved the bones of two
Colombian mammoths found on a housing construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists point out that it is rare to save remains
however. The state does not protect fossils or artifacts on private
land, and high excavations costs often lead developers to build
through ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a year ago in Apache Junction, Ariz., a bulldozer
made quick work of an ancient Hohokam Indian pyramid to clear land
for a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Howard, curator of anthropology at the Mesa (Ariz.)
Southwest Museum, says that much of our heritage has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we destroy it, we're not going to get any Hohokam to do
it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Coolidge have a different take. They are upset that
the artifacts issue has held up a store project they say would help
their struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Gregory, of Coolidge, now has to drive 25 minutes to Casa
Grande to do most of his shopping, a trip he'd rather not make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather spend money in our town, not someone else's,''
Gregory said from his stool at a local diner.
</P>
<P>
   Spending money in Coolidge isn't easy now.
</P>
<P>
   Vacant, shabby storefronts just about equal the number of
diners, small shops and gas stations lining Coolidge's main road.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge City Manager John Baudek said the delay in building the
Wal-Mart has hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important piece to our growth as a city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more upsetting to Baudek is that city officials believed
they had an OK from archaeologists to build the store.
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVANCY MADE A DEAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Archaeological Conservancy, a non-profit group
that establishes archaeological preserves across the country, told
Baudek that it would not oppose development on Wal-Mart's site.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the Conservancy's lack of opposition was part
of a deal it had struck with the landowner, Dalton Coles.
</P>
<P>
   In December, before he sold Wal-Mart its site, Coles sold the
Conservancy an adjacent 30-acre plot, with the agreement that the
Conservancy wouldn't oppose development of the Wal-Mart site.
</P>
<P>
   The group figured it was better to preserve a piece of the land
even if that meant agreeing to see the other site developed, said
Jim Walker, Southwest Regional Director of the Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Conservancy's silence, other archaeological groups
and Native American communities have come forward to stand in
Wal-Mart's way. These other communities, including the Salt-River
Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, Hopi Nation and Tohono O'odham
Nation, want Wal-Mart to build elsewhere in Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart put the store project on hold as soon as company
officials learned there might be artifacts on the site, said Daphne
Davis, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which purchased the plot for $285,000, is ``meeting
with involved parties to determine the next step,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who oppose building on the site, Wal-Mart
should have known about the contents of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prehistoric man didn't stop at the road,'' state preservation
officer Jim Garrison said. ``This has been known to be an important
site for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bohnee, spokesman for the Gila River Indian Community, who
claim to be descendents of the Hohokams, said his tribe wants to
make sure Wal-Mart ``protects burial sites, and other traditional
objects potentially there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull stepped into the controversy in May.
</P>
<P>
   She alerted the State Historic Preservation Office of the affair
after Roger Lidman, chairman of the Arizona Archaeology Advisory
Commission, asked for her assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But the preservation office has no power to resolve the issue
because the land is private, Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL LEGAL OBSTACLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only legal obstacle preventing Wal-Mart from building is a
1990 state burial law requiring company officials to return to
local tribes any burial remains they find.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists say it's very likely remains are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability approaches 100 percent for burials on the
site,'' said Lynn Teague, curator of archaeology for the Arizona
State Museum and coordinator of the state repatriation laws.
</P>
<P>
   If Wal-Mart chose to do so, it could dig up the site before
starting construction, pinpointing the burial sites and giving
archaeologists a chance to study other artifacts, Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be less of a hassle for Wal-Mart, since the builders
wouldn't have to stop in the middle of construction each time they
found remains, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 16 meeting between Wal-Mart, Teague and Native
American communities, Wal-Mart said it would hire Northland
Research to make a test dig to sample the extent of the remains,
Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   Teague says she will meet with Wal-Mart after the test, which
she expects to occur in August, to discuss what the company will do
next: completely excavate the site or start construction. &QL;

ANCIENT HOHOKAM HALT WAL-MART PLAN: ARIZONA SITE MAY HOLD RELICS

   COOLIDGE, Ariz. _ Five hundred years after their disappearance,
the Hohokam Indians are involved in a 20th century land battle _
this time against economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of a Wal-Mart store in Coolidge, scheduled to begin
in May, has been put on hold while company officials sort out
claims by archaeologists that the land contains valuable Hohokam
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's 35-acre plot lies across a highway from the Casa
Grande Ruins National Monument, the oldest archaeological reserve
in the country and the only national monument of the Hohokam Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an archaeological standpoint, it would be hard to pick a
worse spot to build on in Arizona,'' said Keith Kintigh, an
anthropology professor at Arizona State University who also is
president of the Society for American Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins date back to A.D. 1250 and are part of a critical
Hohokam period, Kintigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers across the Southwest are hitting historical
roadblocks these days as they make room for highways and housing
complexes.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California recently, archaeologists discovered an
unprecedented number of ice age animal fossils while building a
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago in Chandler, archaeologists saved the bones of two
Colombian mammoths found on a housing construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists point out that it is rare to save remains
however. The state does not protect fossils or artifacts on private
land, and high excavations costs often lead developers to build
through ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A little over a year ago in Apache Junction, Ariz., a bulldozer
made quick work of an ancient Hohokam Indian pyramid to clear land
for a housing development.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Howard, curator of anthropology at the Mesa (Ariz.)
Southwest Museum, says that much of our heritage has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we destroy it, we're not going to get any Hohokam to do
it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Coolidge have a different take. They are upset that
the artifacts issue has held up a store project they say would help
their struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Gregory, of Coolidge, now has to drive 25 minutes to Casa
Grande to do most of his shopping, a trip he'd rather not make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather spend money in our town, not someone else's,''
Gregory said from his stool at a local diner.
</P>
<P>
   Spending money in Coolidge isn't easy now.
</P>
<P>
   Vacant, shabby storefronts just about equal the number of
diners, small shops and gas stations lining Coolidge's main road.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge City Manager John Baudek said the delay in building the
Wal-Mart has hurt.
