<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Clinton's Africa Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
Friday suffered a setback when the Senate rejected its proposal to
prompt trade with Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 46-45 against the bill, which would grant
countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean expanded
duty-free access to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
The vote was a setback for President Bill Clinton's trade
agenda ahead of the Nov. 30-Dec. 3 meeting of World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministers in Seattle, and could weaken the U.S.
government's hand in a new round of global trade negotiations
expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
The vote also came one day after President Olusegun Obasanjo of
Nigeria, the most popular country in Africa, appealed for help for
the continent during his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders and other free-trade advocates said after
the vote that they still held out hope of reviving the trade bill
this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a delay, not a defeat," said New York Representative
Charles Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the U.S. House Ways and
Means Committee.

<P>
ABU DHABI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Oman is hopeful of joining
the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of this year, said
Omani Minister of Commerce and Industry Maqbool Bin Ali Bin Sultan
in Muscat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Oman News Agency, the minister said he
expects the Gulf country to sign WTO membership agreement during
the WTO ministerial meeting to be held in Seattle, the United
States, in November.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Oman has settled all issues related to WTO
membership with European and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Differences remain with the U.S., he said. But "a number of
meetings were held between the Omani and American sides and most
differences were settled, " he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the Omani economy is an open economy
and most of the preconditions for joining the WTO have been met by
the country.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Saudi Arabia are the only two non-WTO members in the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which also includes Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Probes Crash of Blue Angels Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Investigators have
started to examine the wreckage of a Navy Blue Angels jet to
determine why its landing approach ended in a stand of pines,
military officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both pilots were killed as the F/A-18 Hornet jet from the U.S.
Navy's Blue Angels precision flying team crashed in a wooden area
in southern Georgia State of the United States Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said Friday the Navy would
search aggressively for any procedural or maintenance problems
that could have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
"This is its premier flying team, a team that performs to the
amazement and pleasure of crowds all over the United States,"
Bacon said. "You can be sure the Navy will do whatever it can to
make sure that this team is at the very top of its ability to
fly."
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crash, the jets were not in formation and
were circling to practice arrival procedures as the pilots
familiarized themselves with the terrain, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The jet that crashed was in the vicinity of another, but not as
close as the aircraft usually fly during performances.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton mourned the two pilots, saying
their deaths are "a loss that we all share."
</P>
<P>
The Blue Angels have performed in air shows since 1946. An
estimated 10 to 15 million people watch the spectacle team each
year. The aircraft typically are piloted by one Navy pilot and one
Marine corps pilot.
</P>
<P>
Each of the plane costs about 28 million U.S. dollars, plus the
cost of weapons-related equipment, which can significantly
increase its total price.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's fatalities brought to 23 the number of pilots killed
in air shows or training since the group was formed in 1946. The
last fatality was on July 13, 1985, when a pilot died after a
mid-air collision.

<P>
ANKARA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Eight members of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) on Friday surrendered to Turkish
police in Istanbul, the semi-official Anatolia news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the eight PKK members from European countries
arrived in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, Friday afternoon
aboard a passenger plane of the Austrian Airlines from Vienna,
capital of Austria.
</P>
<P>
They surrendered to the Turkish police in Istanbul Ataturk
Airport and were detained later, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts between the
Turkish government troops and the PKK rebels have claimed over
37,000 lives since then.
</P>
<P>
Since his capture in February, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has
called on his followers to lay down arms as a show of goodwill to
the Turkish government.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Witnesses to Appear at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 witnesses of the
Lockerbie bombing were listed to appear at the trial of the two
Libyans accused of the blast, it was disclosed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came as the two Libyans were served with the
indictment accusing them of conspiracy and murder following the
1988 bombing, over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, of a Pan Am
Boeing 747 airliner, which claimed 270 lives.
</P>
<P>
The indictment, running to more 5,800 words, was served on the
two accused Libyan agents, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al
Amin Khalifah Fhimah, by prison officers at the Camp Zeist
temporary detention center in the Netherlands where the men are
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
It stated that the two men were members of the Libyan
Intelligence Services and conspired to destroy Pan Am flight 103
and murder those people, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the court has proposed to call more than 1,000
witnesses and that there would be almost 1,500 documents and 550
other articles of evidence.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the trial, which is due to start on 2
February 2000, could last up to a year and will be heard by three
judges, sitting without a jury, under Scots law.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1988, Pan Am flight 103 was bombed over the
Lockerbie, killing all the 259 people on board and 11 residents of
the town on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were formally extradited into Scottish custody
on 5 March this year and remanded in custody at a special hearing
in the Netherlands on 6 March.
</P>
<P>
Their trial will make legal history by being the first time a
Scottish court has sat abroad and without a jury.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides $70M for Zambia's Road Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has provided
Zambia with a loan of 70 million U.S. dollars in support of the
Road Sector Investment Program, the Zambian National Roads Board
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 Annual Review released by the board, the
10-year program was aimed at facilitating economic growth in all
social and economic sectors particularly agriculture through
appropriate investment in the road infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The first five-year phase, launched in 1998, is expected to
cost more than 500 million dollars, and will be finished in the
year 2002.
</P>
<P>
For the first phase of the program, the proportion of main
roads in good condition of the road network will increase to about
45 percent by 2002, and that of feeder roads in good condition to
about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The road sector policy and institutional framework will be
reformed and road sector financing will be strengthened to ensure
the sustainability of the road maintenance effort.
</P>
<P>
As the local construction and consulting industry are
gradually strengthened, 14,000 new jobs are expected to be
created.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes a component for the training of
labor-based road rehabilitation contractors and labor-based road
maintenance contractors.
</P>
<P>
There are currently more than 14 on-going contracts for
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance funded by the program.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the components under the 1999 work plan have been
commissioned and the program is on course, the review said.
</P>
<P>
The road network in Zambia is estimated at 64,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The government's strategy is to, through the program, formalize
classes and renumber the roads and to assign responsibility for
all primary and secondary feeder roads to all the rural district
councils.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Cut Petrol Taxes to Hold Down Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Friday
decided to reduce tax duties on petrol in a bid to hold down
inflation which this month rose to its highest level in a year.
</P>
<P>
Rising petrol prices were blamed for Thursday's news that
prices rose 0.4 percent in October, the biggest monthly increase
since November 1995. The yearly rate, 2.0 percent, was the highest
since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting Friday morning, Italian
Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani said petrol pump prices would
be cut by 30 lire (about 0.02 U.S. dollars) during November and
December.
</P>
<P>
Bersani added that while inflation was not alarming at present,
it needed to be kept under close watch.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato promised 10 days ago
that if Italian inflation should rise too far away from the
European Union average, the government would step in.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's price data from the national statistics bureau Istat
confirmed that the present rate of inflation was about 0.8 percent
higher than the EU average, 1.2 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The cost of petrol is widely accepted as a key factor in the
rising cost of living. In the first nine months of 1999 crude
prices rose by 47 percent, peaking at 25 U.S. dollars a barrel
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
They have fallen back however recently and crude is now back to
about 22 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mauritania Urged to Reconsider Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Friday urged
Mauritania to reconsider its decision to forge diplomatic ties
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit held in Cairo in l996 called on the Arab
countries not to normalize relations with Israel before
substantial progress is achieved in the Middle East peace process,
Ahmed Ben Hely, the league's assistant secretary general, said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League also adopted a resolution last March, further
calling for suspension of the normalization process, Hely was
quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania and Israel signed an agreement in Washington on
Thursday to set up full diplomatic relations. One of the 22
members of the pan-Arab forum, Mauritania became the third Arab
country to take the step after Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania's move prior to significant progress in the
Arab-Israeli peace talks will encourage Israeli intransigence in
the peace march, Hely said.
</P>
<P>
"The battle for Jerusalem is still going on and we need to
mobilize all our efforts," including the support of Mauritania in
the diplomatic battle, Hely said. He expressed the hope that the
North African country will reconsider its move.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest site. Moreover, the
Palestinians want the Arab-populated East Jerusalem as the capital
of their future independent state. But Israel has claimed
Jerusalem as its "undivided and eternal" capital. The two sides
will, among other things, negotiate the future of the holy city in
the final status talks due to start on November 7.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's EU Course Should Depend on Cyprus Issue: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Friday insisted that
Turkey's possible status as a European Union (EU) candidate
country should depend on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou noted that this
position was also repeatedly stressed by the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou was commenting on recent statements made by German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer at the German parliament. Fischer
strongly supported Turkey's EU course.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the discussion at the German parliament shows
the fact that there is a lot to be done before December's Helsinki
EU summit.
</P>
<P>
"There is concern at various levels within EU member states,"
the spokesman said regarding Turkey's possible EU candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on recent statements made by British
Prime Minister Tony Blair that the political solution of the
Cyprus issue is not a precondition for Cyprus' accession to the
EU, Papapetrou expressed the Cyprus government's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
"It is a repetition of the British position that the EU and,
surely, Britain support that Cyprus' accession course is not
connected to the pending situation of the island's political
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey is responsible for the fact that there
has not been a solution to the Cyprus issue and that "Cyprus
should not be invited to pay the price."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started
substantive accession talks with the EU in November 1998.

LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Friday it was
delighted with the European Commission's ruling that British beef
was safe and it would now work to ensure that exports could
resume.
</P>
<P>
"It is exactly what we hoped for and worked hard to achieve,"
Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We will now keep up the work to make sure this decision is

disaster of BSE," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
After two days of deliberation, the EC's top scientific panel
unanimously rejected French evidence to back a continuing ban on
British beef exports on health risk grounds.
</P>
<P>
"We said throughout that we had law on our side, science on our
side," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
By playing by the rules and putting its case calmly but
forcefully, his government had proved it could get the right

<P>
Israel is one of the countries which gave most assistance to
the Angolan government during the recent all-out offensive against
the rebel UNITA forces in the central plateau, according to
Angolan newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government had reportedly acquired advanced
military techniques and equipments from four countries, namely
Israel, Russia, Brazil and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Markets Tourist Attractions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said Friday that his country has necessary infrastructure and
exceptional sites for the booming of the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Moi made these remarks in Berlin when addressing the German
Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry, according to a
news release by Kenya Presidential Press Service.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said that Kenya combines attractions of
beaches and plenty of high class lodges with modern facilities to
provide tourists accommodation and leisure.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the support from the European Union, the
Kenya Tourist Board could do a commendable job of promoting the
country's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that through effective marketing and promotional
programs, the board can make Kenya succeed in tourism contrary to
negative media reports.
</P>
<P>
The president said that over the last two years, the tourism
sector had experienced a tremendous increase in arrivals of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a pillar industry and major foreign currency earner
in the east African country. Kenya is considered the fifth
tourist-hosting country in Africa, but suffered a depression in
recent years due to a tarnished image portrayed by international
media.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat in
Nairobi said Friday that China and Kenya enjoyed good relations
both politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaochuan, Economic and Commercial Counsellor at the
Chinese embassy, was speaking at the opening ceremony of China
Shandong Machinery Trade Seminar which was organized by the
government of China's Shandong Province and participated by over
100 Chinese and Kenyan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the trade volume between the two countries in
1998 recorded over 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the machinery trade mission from Shangdong Province
would surely tap business potential and promote the trade between
Shangdong Province and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Julius Kirima, a senior official at Kenya's Tourism, Trade and
Industry Ministry, said the seminar provided a good opportunity
for the business communities of the two nations to boost their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said Kenya welcomed more Chinese companies to invest in
those areas which they are interested.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, 19 Chinese companies and enterprises introduced
over 100 projects for cooperation with their Kenyan counterparts,
covering the fields of chemicals, energy, electronics,
construction machinery, food processing, medicine and
transportation.

<HEADLINE> Transition in Macao Smooth, Good: Chinese Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The general situation of the
transition in Macao is fine and will continue to proceed in a
smooth way, a top Chinese official in Macao said here today.
</P>
<P>
The smooth transition and transfer of power will surely be
achieved in Macao, Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency
Macao Branch, said in an interview with a group of reporters from
the Chinese mainland upon the approaching of the 50-day countdown
of Macao's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that the transfer of power will be well
completed through concerted efforts, as China will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the 50-day countdown, Wang said that various
return-related preparations are proceeding in an orderly way and
venues for transfer of power, establishment of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and celebrations are being constructed
in an accelerated pace.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Macao return as a major event of historical
importance, Wang said that following the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration, a series of transition-related issues have been
solved under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's principle of "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
In this course, he went on to say, people of the whole county
have offered positive support, the Macao people have taken an
active part and both sides of China and Portugal have cooperated
well.
</P>
<P>
Just as what President Jiang Zemin said in his just-ended
Portugal visit, China is fully confident of realizing a smooth
transition and transfer of power in Macao, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> FM Says Unaware of U.N. Request on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov told journalists Friday that he was unaware of any official
appeal from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that a U.N. mission
be sent to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We are working with a number of international organizations"
to provide aid to people temporarily displaced from Chechnya,
Ivanov said. "If such aid is offered (by Annan), we will welcome
it."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's comment came after a statement by Annan's spokesperson
that a U.N. mission will be sent into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement was later revised in an apparent attempt
to avoid interfering into Russia's internal affairs. It said a
mission would be sent to Russia's North Caucasus region where
Chechen refugees fleeing the fighting are concentrated. About
190,000 refugees have fled since fighting broke out a month ago
</P>
<P>
Ivanov stressed that a permanent settlement in the breakaway
republic "must and will be political," but the conditions must be
right for it, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The elimination of terrorist gangs" that have been sabotaging
every kind of understanding between Moscow and Grozny for years is
one of these conditions, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops launched fierce attacks on Chechen
rebels following two waves of armed incursions into neighboring
Daghestan and a spate of apartment bombings that killed some 300
people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. Chechen warlords
Shamil Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his
last name, have been accused of masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
The world community largely "understands Russia's actions aimed
at neutralizing the source of terrorism in Chechnya and creating
normal conditions for the people living in Chechnya and in the
whole of the North Caucasus," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the minister said, there were
"well-orchestrated" attempts to misinterpret the picture of
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Much misinformation is spread from Grozny itself, on the
Internet for example, in particular about Russian missile and
artillery attacks on residential areas in the Chechen capital, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leaders have tasked the army with operating "with a
minimum of civilian casualties," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Moscow office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said Friday that it "has received the
general consent of the Russian authorities" for a U.N. mission to
the North Caucasus to assess the humanitarian situation there,
said Vera Soboleva, the office's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
Soboleva said the mission does not intend to visit Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"From the first day of the talks between the U.N. and the
Russian authorities, there has been no talk of a mission to
Chechnya, in as much as what interests us is the condition of the
people who have left the republic," Interfax quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soboleva said that understanding of the mission, which "does
not have any political goals," was reached following lengthy talks
between the UNHCR office and the leadership of several Russian
agencies, including the Emergency Situations Ministry, the
Nationalities Ministry and the Federal Migration Service.
</P>
<P>
She said that the mission, consisting of representatives of
several specialized U.N. agencies such as the UNHCR and the
UNICEF, plans to visit Ingushetia and Daghestan "to pinpoint the
needs of the displaced persons who arrived there from neighboring
Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the mission's report, a decision will be made
as to the scale and forms of U.N. humanitarian aid, Soboleva said.

<HEADLINE> Two Foreign Reporters Detained for Trying to Enter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian authorities said Friday
that two foreign reporters were detained on the Chechen-Ingush
border for the lack of proper visas, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said Tyler Hicks of The New York
Times and Anthony Lloyd of Britain's Times were detained several
days ago as they tried to enter Chechnya from Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
There is no politics behind the detention, Interfax quoted the
unidentified official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two reporters did not have proper accreditation for news
coverage in Russia and Chechnya was not on their itinerary, the
official said
</P>
<P>
Their visas specified commercial talks as the goal of their
stay in Russia. Hicks was supposed to travel from Paris to Moscow
to St. Petersburg and Lloyd, from Edinburgh to Moscow to Saratov.
</P>
<P>
The two men are now in Ingushetia where the incident is being
investigated, Interfax said, citing a Russian law enforcement
source.

<HEADLINE>   China, S.Korea Play to 1-1 Draw (Updated with Quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's already slim chance of
qualifying for next year's Sydney Olympics receded even further
when it was held to a 1-1 home draw by arch-rivals South Korea on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The result leaves South Korea, who has notched up seven points
from three matches with a home fixture against winless Bahrain
remaining, well-poised to make the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while
China, on four points with a 1-1-1 record, only had mathematical
chances.
</P>
<P>
"I would be quite surprised if we would still qualify, " China
head coach Bobby Houghton said at the post-match press conference.
</P>
<P>
The home players opened strongly with clear intentions to break
a South Korean jinx cursing them for over a decade, with striker
Li Jinyu managing a raking header when the match was just three-
minute old and midfielder Zhao Junzhe's 30-meter screamer rattling
the bar on 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But a schoolboy blunder by the goalkeeper Chen Dong in the
first half injury time cost China dearly, of which South Korean
star striker Lee Dong Gook took full advantage and headed the
visiting side to 1-0 lead against the run of play.
</P>
<P>
Englishman Houghton re-shuffled his attacking line-up at the
interval in what proved to be a right move, throwing on injury-
troubled striker Zhang Yuning and stylish midfielder Zhang Xiaorui.
</P>
<P>
Zhang salvaged a well-deserved draw for the home side 10
minutes into the second half, wriggling past three South Korean
defenders before lashing a shot which took a wicked deflection off
another opposite defender to land in the net.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese defence short of an injury-hit Sun Jihai, former
English first division side Crystal Palace player, was ripped
through again by South Korea eight minutes from time, but
substitute Lee Kwan Woo's shot was smothered by Chen Dong.
</P>
<P>
"It was a well-balanced game and both sides were outstanding.
But we're regretful we didn't win and take all three points,"
South Korean head coach Huh Jung-Moon said.
</P>
<P>
Said Houghton: "It was a very close, very good game. It could
be won by either side. It's the question of whether you take the
chances or not.
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed with the result but not the performances or
our players."

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Ends Visit to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami ended his three-day visit to France and left here for home
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Khatami gave a press conference and made a speech at the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
Friday before quitting Paris.
</P>
<P>
Khatami held talks with President Jacques Chirac Wednesday on a
wide range of issues including bilateral relations, the situation
in the northern Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said that France expects an
upgrading of cultural and economic relations with Iran with the
visit of the president.
</P>
<P>
France seeks to cooperate with Iran in the fields of energy,
transport and telecommunications, in which French companies remain
competitive, said the assistant spokesman of the Foreign Ministry,
Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
French companies are eager to return to Iran which is rich in
oil resources. The French oil group Total-Fina plans to develop an
offshore oil field and a gas field in Iran despite the U.S. threat
of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iran ordered several train locomotives from the French
train-maker Alstom, four Airbus passenger planes and some
telecommunications equipment during Khatami's visit.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for an Iranian head of state to visit
France since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference winding up his visit, Khatami said that
he hopes for a new "elan" in relations with France and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations are cordial and I hope to give a new elan to our
relations with France," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Middle East, Khatami said that the
peace process must be built on a real justice for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"How can we expect a lasting peace when millions of
Palestinians wander about the world, live and die without home, or
in the refugee camps, while their ancestor's land is occupied?" he
said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at UNESCO, Khatami called on the United States to
abandon "the logic of power and dominance" and engage in dialogue
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
"If the 20th century was centered on the power of sword with
winners and losers, we should know that the principal theme of the
coming century should be that of dialogue, otherwise the sword
will spare nobody," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also met with French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin and some French business leaders and visited the
Pantheon museum, where the ashes of some prominent Frenchmen,
including Voltaire, Hugo, Zola and the Curie's, were kept.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Setting Law-making Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua)-- The adoption of the Criminal
Procedure Law in 1996 has led to some awkward moments for the
Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the
Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Justice, because
the four have had different interpretations of the law.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, China'
s highest legislature, today discussed the draft Legislation Law,
designed to standardize the country's law-making process.
</P>
<P>
The draft says that only the NPC Standing Committee and the
Supreme People's Court have the authority to interpret the
specific enforcement of the law; the procuratorial and
governmental departments have no such authority.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the NPC and its Standing Committee passed
350 laws and regulations and the State Council drew up more than
700 administrative regulations over the past two decades. And in
the past five years, China's local legislatures and governments
issued over 4,200 regulations.
</P>
<P>
Following the principle of the rule of law, China sped up its
pace of creating legislation, but also witnessed an increase of
problems in law enforcement resulting from different
interpretations of the newly-passed laws.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, deputy chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
said that when drafting laws, the overall interests of the state
and society should be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The draft also provides that the NPC and its Standing Committee
have the exclusive legislative rights over the compulsory measures
and punishments relating to the political rights and personal
freedoms of Chinese citizens, and also over civil codes on
intellectual property rights, marriage and inheritance.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has
introduced a draft resolution on the illicit traffic in small arms
on behalf of 74 co-sponsors in the United Nations, South African
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was introduced Thursday night at the UN General
Assembly' s First Committee on Disarmament in New York, the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The resolution emphasized the need for a coordinated approach
to address the global scourge of illicit trafficking in small
arms.
</P>
<P>
It also underlined the importance of regional initiatives to
deal with such trafficking in ways most suitable to each affected
region of the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also welcomed the practical measures undertaken by
member states to destroy surplus weapons. It encouraged member
states who had not yet done so, to take appropriate national
measures to destroy such weapons and to make the information
available to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> 21 Injured in Tanker Truck Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOKYO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- 21 people were injured as a
tanker truck exploded on Route 2 of Tokyo's Metropolitan
Expressway on Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion in the Minami-Azabu district of Minato Ward at
about 6:30 p.m. (local time), blew a large chunk of the soundproof
wall onto a road below, and broke windows in nearby houses and
office buildings, they said.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the tanker truck was seriously injured and taken
to hospital, as were several others who suffered burns from
poisonous hydrogen peroxide which leaked from the truck or cuts
from flying glass and concrete, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, owned by a Tokyo-based chemical producer, was
carrying 400 liters of hydrogen peroxide to its plant in Chiba
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Drivers trailing the truck reportedly said the explosion
occurred immediately after smoke started coming out of the tanker.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Fire Department ordered people away from the area
and attempted to dispose of the leaked substance.
</P>
<P>
Hydrogen peroxide with a concentration of 6 percent or higher
is designated as an unstable substance. The chemical carried by
the tanker had a concentration of 30 to 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Discuss Chechnya, Karabakh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met here Friday
to discuss the situation in Russia's Chechnya and joint efforts to
solve the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held inside the Russian Foreign Ministry
behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Talbott told reporters after the meeting that he had conveyed
Washington's concerns over Chechnya, where Russian federal troops
are fighting Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The federal assault on the breakaway republic came after
Chechen rebels twice infiltrated neighboring Daghestan and a
series of terrorist bombings in Moscow and two other Russian
cities that killed some 300 people. Chechen warlords Shamil
Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last
name, have been accused of masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said the U.S. realizes that Russia faces a very
dangerous threat in the form of extremism and terrorism and that
it has the right and duty to protect the state and its citizens,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Talbott said, Washington hopes that Russia will
find a way to overcome the serious challenge that keeps civilian
casualties to a minimum, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Moscow will use political levers in
its strategy as soon as possible to guarantee stability in the
North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
On Nagorno-Karabakh, Talbott said the shootout Wednesday
inside the Armenian parliament building that killed the country's
prime minister, parliament speaker and several others might harm
the talks on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, has
strained relations between the two former Soviet republics for
about a decade.
</P>
<P>
Both Washington and Moscow agreed that the Karabakh settlement
process must continue, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Chechnya and Karabakh, Ivanov and Talbott, who arrived
in Moscow Thursday evening, also discussed arms control issues
such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is scheduled to fly to Yerevan later Friday to mourn
the deaths of Armenian Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan, Parliament
Speaker Karen Demirchyan and other senior officials, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov did not meet with the press following his talks with
Talbott, but he told a seminar later that Russia is deeply
concerned by some countries' attempts to alter the basic elements
of international law.
</P>
<P>
He said that suggestions about limited sovereignty and
interventions on humanitarian grounds would result in power
politics in international affairs.

<HEADLINE> No Deal Struck on Gusmao's Bodyguards: SAfrican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A South African security
company Friday confirmed it was approached to provide bodyguards
to protect East Timorese independence leader Xanana Gusmao, but
no deal had been concluded, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Director of Durban-based Pentagon Executive Protection
Services, Shadrack Dludlu, told SAPA the request came from
concerned people in Mozambique who had telephoned him.
</P>
<P>
Dludlu said he was merely asked whether his company could
supply bodyguards for Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
"Our response was as a private company we could do that," he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, nothing had been confirmed and no contract had been
concluded, Dludlu said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that he had told the Mail and Guardian newspaper that
 negotiations were at an advanced stage and that Gusmao had
approached friends in the African National Congress (ANC) for
help.
</P>
<P>
"I did not say anything about the ANC."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported on Friday that within days a team of 40
South African bodyguards would set off for the East Timorese
capital, Dili, to protect Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
It said Gusmao had taken the unusual step of approaching his
ANC comrades for help because he felt he could not trust
bodyguards the Indonesians might provide and his own guerrillas
lacked the necessary specialist training in VIP protection
techniques.
</P>
<P>
The team had been assembled by two Durban-based security
companies, Empower Loss Control Services and KZN Security, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Dludlu, who is also a director of KZN Security, told SAPA the
approach was in fact made to Pentagon Executive Protection
Services. Quoting a senior unnamed source in President Mbeki's
office, the newspaper said Gusmao's Fretelin guerrilla movement
had approached the ANC, as a fraternal liberation movement, for
help.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's secretary-general, Kgalema Motlanthe, told SAPA on
Friday that his party had not been approached.
</P>
<P>
"No one contacted us. There is nothing like that."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was not
aware of any initiative involving South African protection for
Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former colony of Portugal, voted for independence
from Indonesia in a referendum in September.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Minister Leaves for Iraq for Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Public
Business Sector Mokhtar Khatab said on Friday that he is to
discuss with Iraqi officials ways of promoting cooperation in the
economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Baghdad for a week-long visit, Khatab said
he will co-chair with Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah
meetings of the Egyptian-Iraqi Trade Committee on the economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss issues related to a number of trade
agreements for the seventh stage of the United Nations-Iraqi
oil-for-food program, which starts to be implemented in December,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will also hold talks with Iraqi Minister of
Health Umid Medhat Mubarak on Iraq's need of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the U.N. deal in December 1996,
Egypt has exported some 600 million U.S. dollars worth of goods to
Iraq, making it the largest exporter to Iraq among the Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deal allows Iraq, which has been under U.N. trade
sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, to export a
limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Baghdad, Khatab will take part in the
opening ceremony of the Baghdad International Fair on November 1,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two Egyptian companies, representing the food medical,
electronic and engineering sectors, will display products in the
fair.

<HEADLINE> Armenian President Assumes Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Armenian President Robert
Kocharian announced Friday that he will head the government until
a new prime minister is appointed, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the killing of Prime Minister Vazgen
Sarkisian, parliament speaker Karen Demirchian and six other
government and parliament members in a shoot-out Wednesday inside
the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Kocharian accepted Interior Minister Suren Abramian's notice of
resignation but refused to endorse the resignation of Security
Minister Serzh Sarkisian, Interfax said, quoting Armenian law
enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers tendered their resignations amid criticism
from the military that the country's security is paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
Kocharian said the top priority is the formation of a new
parliament leadership and Cabinet of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
He said the work would begin after the burial of Sarkisian,
Demirchian and other victims of the shooting. The ceremony is
scheduled for October 31, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"Armenia must demonstrate that it can promptly pull out of the
political crisis," Kocharian said. "We must try and resolve this
situation. We must find solutions which would quickly restore
national stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attack dealt "a huge blow to us personally, to
the country's authority. We will feel its consequences for a long
time," the president said.

<P>
LUSAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African President
Thabo Mbeki called for regional cooperation in various fields in
order to realize the bright future of the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba in
Lusaka Friday, Mbeki said that the southern African region has
"actually a bright future in many aspects".
</P>
<P>
But he said in reality the bright future cannot be realized
without the regional cooperation in the fields such as economy,
security and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told Mbeki that his visit to Zambia is restructuring
"stronger and healthier relations" between the two countries. He
described Zambia's relations with South Africa as "very very
warm".
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian president also urged South Africa to
continue working to reduce the trade imbalance between his country
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed a declaration of intent on promotion
of the bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy, social,
science and culture.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba promised to continue to consolidate what they have
already gained and to strengthen the close relations for the
benefit of the two countries and two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He called for creation of a joint permanent commission to
discuss "a lot outstanding issues" and help remove "areas of
misunderstanding and suspicions" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba spoke highly of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), saying that they facilitate dialog,
consultation, decision-making and collective bargaining.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls For Protection Of Medical Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday proposed regulations for protection of electronic medical
records and urged Congress to take further steps to safeguard
patients' most sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
"Please help protect American families from new abuses of their
privacy," Clinton said during an Oval Office ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Every American has a right to know his or her medical records
are protected at all times from falling into the wrong hands."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposal would apply to all electronic medical
records and to all health plans.
</P>
<P>
"Americans should never have to worry that their employers are
looking at the medicines they take, or the ailments they've had,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulations would restrict the use and release of
private health information transmitted or maintained by computers.
</P>
<P>
Congress, though discussed the issue for years, failed to meet
a self-imposed August 21 deadline for legislating new protections.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said lawmakers should still seek to pass legislation, in
order to cover records kept on paper.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Congress should act," Clinton said. "There are still
protections, some of them, we can give our families only if
there's an act of Congress passed."
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are no federal guarantees that private
information won't be passed to employers, sold to pharmaceutical
companies or talked about in insurance company offices.

WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will discuss terrorism next week with a
visiting Saudi delegation headed by Defense Minister Prince
Sultan, the State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that was a kind
of "counter-terrorism cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Washington would try to get some information through the
meeting about how Saudi-born millionaire Osama bin Laden had

widespread terrorism network.

<P>
The United States has accused bin Laden of masterminding the
bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa last August.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in an April report that bin Laden
used inherited wealth and contributions from sympathizers in
various countries to support terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
And the USA Today newspaper said on Friday that five top
Saudi businessmen had ordered the Saudi Arabia's biggest bank to
transfer tens of millions of U.S. dollars to accounts for
Islamic charities that serve as fronts for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said he got "no information on that detail."

<HEADLINE> Five Candidates Vie for Uruguay Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Five candidates will vie on
Sunday to succeed President Julio Maria Sanguinetti in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth time that the South Atlantic nation votes
for president since 1985.
</P>
<P>
There are over 2.4 million persons legally capable to vote. The
43.8 percent of the legally able voters will cast their ballots in
Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
If none of the five presidential candidates gets more than 50
percent of the votes casts this Sunday, October 31, the winner
will be chosen in a by-election to be held on November 28 between
the two who obtain the most voters this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This Sunday will also see electing new occupants of 129
congressional seats (30 senators and 99 deputies). There are 28
lists of candidates for the Senate and 423 lists of candidates for
the Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
According to the new Constitution, the department intendants
(governors of provinces) and the members of the Departmental
Juntas will be elected in May of next year.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls show that the candidate of the Progressive
Encounter, Tabare Vazquez, is the frontrunner in Sunday elections,
with 38 percent of the preferences, while the Colorado party
candidate, Jorge Batlle, has 26 percent and the National Party
candidate, Luis Lacalle, has 23 percent of the preferences.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said whoever takes power in the cattle-and-wool
producing nation of 3.2 million will inherit an economy expected
to contract 2 percent this year, with rising unemployment.

<HEADLINE> China, Mongolia Launch AIDS/STDs Prevention Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and Mongolian
governments today jointly launched a public awareness campaign to
inform people of prevention measures against AIDS and sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs).
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Health and Ministry of Railways hosted the
opening ceremony of the campaign, which is supported by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), in the busy Beijing West
Railway Station this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has been paying great attention to the
AIDS/STDs prevention and control program," said Yin Dakui, deputy
minister of health.
</P>
<P>
"To disseminate the knowledge of AIDS/STDs prevention and
control among the masses as soon as possible is our main task," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case was reported in the United States in
1981, the deadly disease has spread throughout the world.
Statistics show that the world now has 33.4 million HIV carriers,
with about seven million in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Health Ministry statistics released today, by the
end of September, 31 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities had reported a total of 15,088 HIV cases, 477 of
which are AIDS cases, and 240 deaths from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, UNDP Beijing resident representative, said, "
The nature of AIDS and STDs transmission needs cross-country
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The one-week campaign, which is scheduled to be carried out in
railway stations in big cities along the railway line from Beijing
to Ulan Bator, capital of Mongolia, will offer to the public
information pamphlets, video broadcasts and consultation services
with medical professionals.

<HEADLINE> Pak Muslim League Condemns Dismissal of Sharif Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League
(Nawaz Group) Saturday strongly condemned the dismissal of the
government by the army on October 12 and demanded "immediate
restoration of the constitution, the parliament and provincial
assemblies."
</P>
<P>
The Central Working Committee of the Pakistan Muslim League
(PML) adopted a resolution, condemning in the strongest term the
dismissal of the government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
This was the first strong reaction by the PLM since the
takeover by the country's army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the PML had been mild in its reaction, criticizing the
military action, but cautiously saying it did not want any
confrontation with the army nor did it plan to agitate.
</P>
<P>
The meeting Saturday was presided over by PML Vice President
Raja Zafarul Haq. The meeting came in the wake of reports that the
PML was on the verge of a split and was about to divide into two
factions.
</P>
<P>
Describing the government dismissal as regrettable, the meeting
demanded that a delegation of the PML be allowed to meet deposed
prime minister Sharif who is now under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
"The allegation against Nawaz Sharif should be brought to the
fore," said the PML resolution.
</P>
<P>
It also called for immediate release of Sharif and other PML
leaders who are in detention since the military takeover on
October 12.
</P>
<P>
"All the arrested leaders of the party should be given rights
guaranteed by law and the constitution," said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided that all office bearers, central
council, working committee and other provincial bodies of the PML
would retain their offices and stay intact.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded a parliamentary party meeting, and decided to
constitute committees for the implementation of the resolutions
adopted by the PML Central Working Committee.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to form a committee for considering various
options to challenge in the Supreme Court the dismissal of the
Sharif government.

<HEADLINE> Nef Grabs Her First Win in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Sonja Nef scored
her first Alpine skiing World Cup victory in three years on
Saturday in the season-opening giant slalom competition in Tignes,
France.
</P>
<P>
Nef overcame changeable conditions to ski a fastest time in the
first leg and held her nerve to increase her lead in the second
run down the windswept Grande Motte glacier high in the French
Alps, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Swiss won in a combined time of two minutes 31.
39 seconds, more than 1.5 seconds ahead of Sweden's Anna Ottosson
in 2:33.00 and remarkable Austrian veteran Anita Wachter in 2:33.
51.
</P>
<P>
It was Nef's second World Cup win in a long career marked by
misfortune, injury and nerves.
</P>
<P>
"After six knee operations, always alone and always training,
it was not always easy," she said of her troubles over past
seasons. "But today it's all worthwhile."
</P>
<P>
Her only previous victory was a World Cup slalom in Sestriere,
Italy, in 1996 and since then she has led several races only to be
overcome by the pressure on the second run and miss out on victory.
</P>
<P>
Overall World Cup winner and giant slalom world champion
Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria missed a gate and skidded to a
halt midway through her first run in a disastrous start for the
woman who dominated last season.

<HEADLINE> Enqvist Beats Agassi to Meet Krajicek in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Thomas Enqvist upset the top-
ranked Andre Agassi in three sets Saturday and will meet defending
champion Richard Krajicek in the Suanday's final of the Eurocard
Open in Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek edged Greg Rusedski 6-4, 6-4 in another semifinal
which was a battle of big servers.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist, a 13th-seeded Swede, beat Agassi 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 and now
holds 4-2 career record against the American.
</P>
<P>
"I played one my best matches of the year," Enqvist, who is
ranked No. 18 in the world, was quoted as saying. "I knew I had to
play 100 percent today and I did."
</P>
<P>
Krajicek broke Rusedski's serve once in each set and that was
enough to earn him his fifth _ and third straight _ final in
Stuttgart, where he has won the title twice.
</P>
<P>
The eighth-seeded Dutchman thrives on fast indoor surfaces.
</P>
<P>
"I play good tennis here. Even If I'm not playing great tennis
sometimes, I win my matches here," he said. "Some events somehow
have a magic thing for you.''
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, the fifth-seeded Briton, also is a proficient indoor
player. He had won two big indoor events within the month, the
Grand Slam Cup and the tournament in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
But Krajicek had no lapses on his serve and Rusedski was unable
to break serve.
</P>
<P>
The victory also brought Krajicek closer to clinching a place
in the eight-man, season-ending ATP Tour World Championship
November 23-28 in Hanover, Germany. Krajicek is now in ninth place.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Regrets UN Perception on Its Human Rights Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
misunderstands human rights situation in Myanmar to some extent
and Myanmar regrets the UN misperception, according to a Myanmar
official statement issued here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
It is regretful to learn that United Nations has issued a
report Saturday saying that the ethnic human rights situation in
Myanmar is worsening, the Information Sheet said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stated that the alleged human rights violation of
ethnic minorities especially in Shan and Kayin States are the
stories created by the armed separatist group, the breakaway
faction of Mong Tai Army and various other anti-government
quarters.
</P>
<P>
The government of Myanmar is keeping the door to peace wide
open for these few misguided groups to walk in and make their
contribution to the reconstruction of the nation. But like any
government anywhere in the world, the government of Myanmar has a
fundamental obligation to protect and ensure the rights of all its
citizens to a safe, secure and stable environment, the statement
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that "there are times when the
government has to take appropriate military action against these
armed terrorist groups to safeguard national security and protect
its citizens from harm."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian Leaders Contact in Sign of Warming-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of warming-up of the
bilateral relations, Egyptian and Syrian leaders recently
discussed the latest developments of the Middle East peace
process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad dealt with the current
conditions related to the possible resumption of the peace talks
between Syria and Israel, MENA said, without mentioning when the
contact was held.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders underlined the need to continue efforts aimed
at advancing the peace negotiations in a bid to seek solutions to
the Arab-Israeli conflict and realize a comprehensive, just and
durable peace in the Middle East based on the land-for-peace
principle, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-Damascus ties plunged to a low point after Egypt and
Israel, which occupies Syria's Golan Heights, rapidly improved
their relations following Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
election in May.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad snubbed Mubarak's call for an Arab summit on the
Mideast peace process and ways of restoring Arab solidarity, and
cut off contacts which used to be held frequently between the two
countries on all levels.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt has repeatedly expressed support for Syria's stance
on the resumption of its talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to intensify the revival of contacts, Egypt and
Syria have decided to engage in a series of consultations and
coordination at all levels in both capitals, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Within this context, Bashar al-Assad, son of the Syrian
president, is expected to visit Egypt in the coming period, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks came to a halt in early 1996 due
to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights that Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War. After Barak's
election, both al-Assad and Baraa d p

some important issues in Sino-U.S. relationship, Foreign Ministry

</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada's Pay Equity Dispute to Be Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian federal government has
agreed to pay 3.6 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S.
dollars) to settle a time honored pay equity dispute.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Board President Lucienne Robillard Friday promised to
pay the money to about 230,000 current and retired federal
employees, most of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Robillard struck the deal with the Public Service Alliance
of Canada (PSAC) after one week of talks. She also pledged that
the federal government would never face such a dispute again.
</P>
<P>
About 1 billion of the settlement will go toward paying
interest on the money, which has been owed to some of the workers
for up to 14 years.
</P>
<P>
PSAC filed the dispute in 1983, alleging systemic wage
discrimination against employees in female dominated jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Court ruled in July 1998 that those employees
deserve an average of about 25,000 Canadian dollars (about 16,993
dollars) each in raises and back pay.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Relieve Overburdened Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Agriculture Minister
Chen Yaobang today pledged to relieve farmers from the burden of
irrational governmental fees.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Standing Committee of the National People'
s Congress (NPC), the national legislature, Chen described illegal
overcharging as a major problem, and sometimes a tinderbox of
conflict in the vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Although the central government has repeatedly ordered the
unauthorized fees to stop, farmers in many areas are still
harassed by "arbitrary activities," including unreasonable
charging and forced collections, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The minister promised that a massive clean-up campaign will be
held nationwide before next year in order to stop all illegal fee-
collection activities.
</P>
<P>
He also gave a report on this year's agricultural production
and farmers' incomes to the committee, which is convening a seven-
day session here.
</P>
<P>
Yields of grain, cotton, sugar and tobacco are expected to drop
due to shrinking planting acreage, while sectors of animal
husbandry, fishery and township enterprise are reporting more
profits than last year.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita income of farmers was 1,460 yuan in the January-
September period this year, and the Agriculture Ministry predicted
the annual income will increase by four percent over last year's
level.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed the rise in farmers' income mainly to more
earnings from infrastructure construction and township enterprises,
from sales of farming products, and because of the decline of
investment in agriculture production.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian Leaders Contact in Sign of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of warming-upprocess, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad dealt with the current
conditions related to the possible resumption of the peace talks
between Syria and Israel, MENA said, without mentioning when the
contact was held.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders underlined the need to continue efforts aimed
at advancing the peace negotiations in a bid to seek solutions to
the Arab-Israeli conflict and realize a comprehensive, just and
durable peace in the Middle East based on the land-for-peace
principle, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-Damascus ties plunged to a low point after Egypt and
Israel, which occupies Syria's Golan Heights, rapidly improved
their relations following Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
election in May.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad snubbed Mubarak's call for an Arab summit on the
Mideast peace process and ways of restoring Arab solidarity, and
cut off contacts which used to be held frequently between the two
countries on all levels.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt has repeatedly expressed support for Syria's stance
on the resumption of its talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to intensify the revival of contacts, Egypt and
Syria have decided to engage in a series of consultations and
coordination at all levels in both capitals, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Within this context, Bashar al-Assad, son of the Syrian
president, is expected to visit Egypt in the coming period, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks came to a halt in early 1996 due
to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights that Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War. After Barak's
election, both al-Assad and Barak said they were interested in
re-starting the negotiations, but have yet to translate the words
into actions.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton, whose capacity for helping or
hurting the campaigns of his wife, Vice President Al Gore and
other Democrats is much debated in political circles, conceded
Friday that his powers are limited as an endorser and surrogate
speaker.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain won a key battle in the Great Beef War Friday as a
European Union committee decided unanimously that there is no

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Resettlement of Rural Residents in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said
here today that more should be done to resettle rural people
living in the Three Gorges Dam area so that the second-phase
resettlement project goes smoothly and social order is maintained.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark in a closing speech for a two-day meeting of
the relocation project, held in Chongqing Municipality, in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relocation of the dam area's residents has
gone well so far. By June 30, some 178,000 residents had been
resettled, including 90,000 rural people.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier pointed out that the central government has
mapped out favorable policies to support the resettlement, and the
eleven provinces and municipalities scheduled to take in 70,000
migrants from Chongqing should take advantage of the chance to
promote local economy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the eleven provinces and municipalities,
mostly in economically developed eastern and southern regions,
should guide them to develop the farming industry and make sure
that the new migrants could contract enough land for their crops.

<HEADLINE> Highlight Rule of Law and Punish Cult: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Rule of law should be
highlighted and the Falun Gong cult should be severely punished, a
commentary to be published in Sunday's People's Daily says.
</P>
<P>
China's top legislature, the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, adopted a decision here Saturday on banning and
punishing cults such as Falun Gong, the leading newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
Courts, prosecutors, police and administrative judicial organs
must be on full alert against cult activities and deal with them
rigorously in accordance with the law, the paper urges.
</P>
<P>
According to judicial explanations released by the Supreme
People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate Saturday,
cult leaders may also be prosecuted for murder, intentional bodily
harm, rape, rape of the under-aged, fraud or endangering national
security if such atrocities are found to have been perpetrated.
</P>
<P>
The decision and the explanations are of vital importance to
the country's stability and the ongoing reform and opening up, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
Cults are a global problem faced by many governments in the
world. Falun Gong, headed by Li Hongzhi, is by nature a cult which
has caused injuries and deaths.
</P>
<P>
The central government stressed that it would follow rule of
law when it started the campaign against Falun Gong last July. The
two new documents fully reflect that idea.
</P>
<P>
It should be ensured that the laws are strictly observed,
enforcement of laws is strict and violations of the law must be
investigated and dealt with accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also stresses that practitioners who were
unaware of the cult's true purpose should be handled differently
from organizers and leaders, to ensure that only a handful of
criminals are punished.
</P>
<P>
The key to guaranteeing rule of law is to improve all citizens'
understanding of the law and knowledge of science, so that they
are aware cults are not religions.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide campaign against Falun Gong should be continued
until the cult is eliminated, the paper urges.

<HEADLINE> China to Draft Estate Tax Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Taxation is promoting the drafting of an estate tax law, which has
already been listed in the legislation plan of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The estate tax law will play an important role in adjusting the
redistribution of people's income, and narrow the gap between the
rich and the poor, thus there is increasing demand for the law
from society, said Zeng Xianlin, deputy-director of the Financial
and Economic Committee of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Estate taxes will be another important step to reform China's
tax system, following the collection of tax on the interest of
savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the individual income tax, which
includes interest, estate and donation taxes, will become one of
the major types of tax in China, and will balance the
redistribution of income under a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the importance of the estate tax law, our committee
will try to speed up the legislation of it," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China still cannot issue a complete and unified
set of social security laws, but individual laws including the
social insurance law, regulations on the minimum living standards
for urban residents, and social relief law are in the drafting
process.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has also urged relevant
organizations to complete a group of laws and regulations which
will have a strong impact on the national economy such as the
government procurement law, anti-monopoly law, the law for
promoting medium-sized and small enterprises and regulations on
the management of the telecommunications sector.

<HEADLINE> Loyal to SAR, Motherland: Macao SAR Judicial Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Heads of the judicial organs of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Saturday vowed to be
loyal to both the SAR and the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Sam Hou Fai, president of the SAR Court of Final Appeal, and
Ho Chio Meng, the SAR procurator-general, made the same remarks
during an interview with a group of Chinese mainland reporters on
the eve of the 50-day countdown of Macao's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Sam said according to the SAR Basic Law, Macao will become a
region of high autonomy after it returns to the motherland on
December 20, thus establishment of the Court of Final Appeal
demonstrates the legal arrangement of the "one country, two
systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
He noted that stipulations in the basic law conform with the
interests of the SAR and those of the motherland, which will by no
means contradict with each other.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the Court of Final Appeal and its future work
will strictly observe the basic law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The power of final appeal is an important part of the state
sovereignty, he said, adding as the court's president, he will be
both loyal to the SAR government and the central government of
China.
</P>
<P>
He stated that preparations for the Court of Final Appeal has
started and the future courts in the SAR will include a court of
final appeal, intermediate courts and primary courts.
</P>
<P>
He said he will consults judges in lower courts on the
arrangements of the future SAR courts to ensure the smooth
operation of the court of final .
</P>
<P>
Ho Chio Meng also vowed to make the procuratorates the legal
guard for the SAR in a bid to play their due role in safeguarding
the SAR prosperity and stability after Macao returns to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Although he is taking tough tasks, he said he will do his best,
as the procurator-general, in combating crimes, in protecting the
legal system and rights, and in law enforcement and supervision.
</P>
<P>
On some problems relating to the public security, he said the
SAR procuratorates will classify the cases that so far have not
yet been handled and pay great attention to deal with those crimes
that do great harm to public security.
</P>
<P>
The procurators will also strengthen their contacts and
publicity and offer more legal services and aid to serve the local
residents better.

<HEADLINE> Product Quality Problem Still Serious: Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature
today warned manufacturers to watch product quality, saying that
overall quality of goods made here is far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
A report made by the Standing Committee of the National People'
s Congress (NPC) suggested that poor quality goods and shoddy
products are still mass produced despite repeated battles against
them, while the quality control system in many enterprises remains
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee
of the NPC Standing Committee, delivered the report at a meeting
here today.
</P>
<P>
Citing surveys made in five provinces and cities including
Zhejiang and Chongqing since May this year, he said the ratio of
products up-to-standard has been floating between 75 percent and
78 percent in recent years, and the quality of consumer goods,
materials for agricultural production, and products made by small
and private businesses "particularly deserves concern."
</P>
<P>
"The most serious issue is the production and selling of poor
quality and fake commodities, which has become rampant despite
unceasing bans and crackdowns," Chen acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted statistics from the China National Consumers'
Association which showed that food, materials for agricultural
production and tobacco products are most vulnerable to the illegal
practice.
</P>
<P>
Complaints against inferior foodstuffs increased from 650,000
in 1997 to 750,000 in 1998, and those against fake capital good
for agricultural production rose from 25,600 to 33,500 in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration said 10 million
cartons of fake cigarettes have occupied the domestic market this
year, two times the 1997 figure, which may cause the loss of six
billion yuan (722 million U.S. dollars) in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Chen admitted that fake goods, which pose a danger to people's
health, have been routinely produced and sold in some areas,
making the areas production bases or wholesale centers of inferior
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the strike against fraudulent activities is becoming
more difficult because many of them have gone underground.
</P>
<P>
Chinese lawmakers are discussing a revision draft of the
existing law on quality control, aiming to fight more fiercely
against the manufacture and selling of shoddy goods.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Urged to Maintain Output Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has called on major oil producers to maintain the agreed-upon
output cuts to preserve the stability of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Preserving the stability of oil prices is still the major task
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said
UAE Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid Bin Saif Al
Nasir Saturday while addressing the opening session of an energy
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Despite of an improvement in oil prices in the past six
months, the average oil price in 1999 has not gone beyond 16
U.S. dollars per barrel, which is still below the required level,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Oil stockpiles are still high despite of some decline over the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
This "requires stricter adherence to agreements by OPEC and
non-OPEC producers to reduce their output in order to maintain the
stock at acceptable levels," Al Nasir added.
</P>
<P>
Since OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed in March to reduce
output, the prices of oil and other energy sources began to
increase. In September, OPEC oil prices exceeded 22 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if annual inflation rates are taken into
consideration, the current prices can be seen as equivalent to
prices in the seventies, that is, around four dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
"This makes oil one of the cheapest raw materials, despite its
significance in the world economy," Al Nasir noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of natural gas in the future energy
markets, which is the theme of the two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
World demand for natural gas is expected to grow from a level
of 1.9 billion tons in oil equivalent by 2000 to a level of 2.5
billion tons in oil equivalent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"These figures undoubtedly indicate that natural gas will play
a major and significant role in the world energy markets in the
future, despite the fact that it constitutes only 20 percent of
the overall world consumption of commercial energy," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said environmental concerns and other considerations now
make natural gas the pioneering fuel for the future.
</P>
<P>
The Arab region enjoys natural gas reserves of around 33.5
trillion cubic meters, or 22 percent of the world's total
reserves. Arab natural gas production is currently estimated at
200 billion cubic meters, which is 9 percent of the overall world
production.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate a disparity between production levels and
available gas reserves and there is a need to expand the natural
gas industry to enable it to play a more effective role in the
region's economy, Al Nasir stressed.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Foreign EPZ Starts in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the groundbreaking
ceremony of the country's first foreign export processing zone
(EPZ), the Korean EPZ (KEPZ), in the southeastern district of
Chittagong on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The KEPZ, to be developed on an area of approximately 2,600
acres on the left bank of the Karnaphuli river, about 15
kilometers southeast of the port city Chittagong, was the
country's first foreign EPZ that received permission from the
government in October 1996 soon after the enactment of The Private
Export Processing Zone Act 1996.
</P>
<P>
The KEPZ, sponsored by Korea's Youngone Corporation, will be
developed, managed and operated by the Korean EPZ (BD) Ltd. which
was set up in the country in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
A brief introduction from the KEPZ said the expected investment
to flow into the zone was about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, and the
KEPZ would employ 100,000 people directly and 50,000 people
indirectly when the project is completed in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony, the prime minister
said the establishment of the KEPZ would provide positive
contribution to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The KEPZ "will keep valuable contribution in transfer of
technology, upgrade of skills, foreign exchange earning, value
addition, improvement of professional management and encouragement
of backward linkages," she said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on the occasion, Kihak Sung, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Youngone Corporation and the Korean EPZ
Corporation (BD) Ltd., raised some issues "of vital importance for
success of the project."
</P>
<P>
Sung urged the government to take measures to improve the
transport facilities between the EPZ and Chittagong city, such as
widening and upgrading the access road and repairing the Shah
Amanat bridge linking the two places.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the Chittagong port created difficulties for
investors due to "frequent operational problems," apparently
referring to the frequently strikes enforced by port workers.
</P>
<P>
He said investors in EPZs were very concerned about the
government's recent decision to allow trade unions in the zones,
which he said would "lead Bangladesh industries to certain
disastrous consequence... considering unfortunate violent labor
practices this country inherited."
</P>
<P>
There are two EPZs in the country at present, one in the
capital city, Dhaka, and the other in the seaport city of
Chittagong and they are employing more than 81,000 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The 12th Session of Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) today adopted a
resolution concerning the banning of heretic cult organizations,
prevention measures against them and punishment for cult
activities.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the NPC resolution:
</P>
<P>
To maintain social stability, protect the interest of people,
safeguard reform and opening up and the construction of a modern
socialist country, it is necessary to ban heretic cult
organizations, and prevent and punish cult activities.
</P>
<P>
Based on the Constitution and other related laws, the following
decision is hereby made:
</P>
<P>
1. Heretic cult organizations shall be resolutely banned
according to law and all of their criminal activities shall be
dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
Heretic cults, operating under the guise of religion, Qigong or
other illicit forms, which disturb social order and jeopardize
people's life and property, must be banned according to law and
punished resolutely.
</P>
<P>
People's courts, people's procuratorates, public security,
national security and judicial administrative agencies shall
fulfill their duties in carrying out these tasks.
</P>
<P>
To be severely dealt with according to law are those who
manipulate members of cult organizations to violate national laws
and administrative regulations, organize mass gatherings to
disrupt social order, and fool others, cause deaths, rape women,
swindle people out their money and property or commit other crimes
with superstition and heresy.

<HEADLINE> Full Text: Legislative Resolution on Banning Heretic Cults (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
2. The principle of combining education with punishment should
be followed in order to unify and instruct the majority of the
deceived public and to mete out severe punishment to the handful
of criminals.
</P>
<P>
During the course of handling cult groups according to law,
people who joined cult organizations but were unaware of the lies
being spread by the group shall be differentiated from criminal
elements who organize and take advantage of cult groups for
illegal activities and/or to intentionally destroy social
stability.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the deceived members shall not be prosecuted,
while those organizers, leaders and core members who committed
crimes shall be investigated for criminal conduct; those who
surrender to the authorities or contribute to the investigations
shall be given lesser punishments in accordance with the law, or
be exempt from punishment.
</P>
<P>
3. Long-term, comprehensive instruction on the Constitution and
the law should be carried out among all citizens, knowledge of
science and technology should be popularized and the national
literacy level raised.
</P>
<P>
Banning cult organizations and punishing cult activities
according to law goes hand in hand with protecting normal
religious activities and people's freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
The public should be exposed to the inhumane and anti-social
nature of heretic cults, so they can knowingly resist influences
of cult organizations, enhance their awareness of the law and
abide by it.
</P>
<P>
4. All corners of society shall be mobilized in preventing and
fighting against cult activities, and a comprehensive management
system should be put in place. People's governments and judicial
bodies at all levels should be held responsible for guarding
against the creation and spread of cult organizations and
combating cult activities. This is an important, long-term task
that will ensure social stability.

<HEADLINE> Taliban not Forcing Bin Laden to Leave: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Afghan Taliban
militia Saturday said they are not asking Saudi dissident Osama
Bin Laden to leave Afghanistan, according to news reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Taliban have not forced him to go to other country but he is
free to decide whether to stay in Afghanistan or move to other
country," Syed Tayyeb Agha, a spokesman in Taliban supreme leader
Mulla Omar's office said in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Tayyeb said Bin Laden might have realized the difficulties
faced by the Taliban and the people of the war-ravaged country
because of his presence.
</P>
<P>
"Consensus has emerged among the Taliban leadership that Bin
Laden will not be stopped if he wants to leave Afghanistan," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, who has been accused by Washington of masterminding
bomb blasts at U.S. embassies in East Africa last year, Friday
wrote to Omar saying that he wanted to leave Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have been under tremendous pressure after the
United Nations Security Council set November 14 as the deadline
for the handover of the alleged terrorist for trial.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Bin Laden asked Taliban to provide him security
while he moves to other country and keep his next destination a
top secret, Tayyed said.
</P>
<P>
"Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan for a long time
despite pressure by the United States. We are ready to provide him
security in the days to come but it is for him to decide whether
to stay here or leave," the Taliban spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Taliban announced that Bin Laden was
missing, but late the militia admitted that the Saudi national in
fact had never left Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday downplayed speculations of a coup attempt
against his administration, saying it will not get any support
from the people.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program, Estrada said that the people
have seen the ill effects on the economy and their lives of the
series of coup attempts against the Aquino administration, and
thus will not allow a repeat of these events.
</P>
<P>
"During the Aquino administration, the economy was going up
when the coup attempts took place. The economy dived and the
people faced rough times. That's why I am confident the people
won't support any coup attempt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Estrada said, he believes in the professionalism of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National
Police.
</P>
<P>
These two institutions have assured him that they will fulfill
their sworn duty to defend the constitution at all times, he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he received an assurance from Army Chief of
Staff Gen. Angelo T. Reyes that there would never be coup attempt
against his administration.
</P>
<P>
Recent Local press reports said that the army could stage a
coup against the government because of the lower popularity of the
president. But the reports were repeatedly denied by both the
president and the military.

CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Support for an Australian
republic has surged, with nearly half of all voters quizzed in a
poll now saying they will vote "Yes" in the November 6 referendum
on republic.
</P>
<P>
However, The Sunday Telegraph/Quadrant survey conducted last
week showed the republic may still be sunk, with less than four of
the country's six states backing the republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
The poll predicted that the states of New South Wales, Victoria
and South Australia will vote "yes" while Queensland, Western
Australia and Tasmania will say "no."
</P>
<P>
Of the 881 voters polled throughout Australia last week, 49
percent said they would back a republic while 47 percent said no
and four percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that voters discontent with the mode of
electing an Australian president are bolstering the no campaign.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent wanted the opportunity to directly elect any
future president while just 27 percent backed the current model of
a two thirds majority of parliament doing it for them.

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants Able to Perform Well in Macao SAR: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the future
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) government said here on
Saturday that the majority of civil servants in the Portuguese
Macao government can do their work well in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Florinda da Rosa Silva Chan, secretary for administration and
justice of the Macao SAR government, expressed her confidence in
the civil service throughout Macao's power transfer from Portugal
to China in 51 days.
</P>
<P>
All senior and mid-ranking official posts of the current Macao
government used to be occupied by Portuguese, although Chinese
account for 97 percent of the local population. Most of the posts
have been shifted to residents of Chinese origin over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
However, a popular concern is that a large part of the newly
appointed officials are viewed as fairly young and inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
"Younger age itself is not a bad thing, on the other hand it
can be regarded as an advantage to some extent," Chan said, adding
that the civil servants can raise their competence through
professional training.
</P>
<P>
The most important matter is that civil servants become fully
aware of the "Macao people governing Macao" concept, said 45-year-
old Chan. "They should bear an active spirit of participating in
the affairs of the SAR and cement the contacts between the SAR
government and the residents."

<TEXT>
<P>
Another key matter is the optimum arrangement of work among the
civil servants, so that each one of them is clear about their own
responsibility, she said, explaining that in some government
departments at present, a few people are busy doing quite a large
amount of work, while many people in other departments may have
little work to do.
</P>
<P>
She said she has been cooperating well with the Portuguese
Macao government. Most of the staff in her new office are
concurrently civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Chan entered the Financial Department of the Portuguese Macao
government in 1974 working as a typist. She has been working at
the Economic Department since 1977 and acts as the department's
director till December 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-designate of the Macao SAR,
made Chan take charge of the administrative and judicial affairs
of the SAR government. The State Council of China announced the
appointment of Chan and some other principal SAR officials in mid-
August.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the chief executive's nomination was unexpected,
for her future responsibility is far from her work in the economic
field. In fact, Chan is regarded as a decisive and determined
person and the chief executive has enough reason in making such a
decision.
</P>
<P>
"I feel rather honored to be nominated and appointed. It is a
good chance for me to serve the place where I was born," she said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, Chan has been busy overseeing the
drafting of more than 20 laws which will ensure the sound
operation of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The drafts will be submitted to the First Legislative Council
of the Macao SAR for deliberation, and the legislature is expected
to approve them on December 20 as soon as the SAR is founded.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Says Courts Have Last Say on Marcos Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that the courts will have the last say
on any negotiation between the government and the heirs of the
late president Ferdinand Marcos for recovery of his hidden wealth.
</P>
<P>
"Any result of negotiations will be made known to the public.
The court will have the final decision," Estrada said in a radio
program.
</P>
<P>
He also said all talks would be above board, with the
Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), the high court
and the Supreme Court doing their respective jobs.
</P>
<P>
This, however, would not deter the government from conducting
talks with the concerned parties to recover the wealth more
quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While the courts will have the last say, this will not deter
us from conducting negotiations. We will submit these to the
courts for their approval," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he has made this clear to members of
the Marcos family.
</P>
<P>
"If there will be negotiations, it will be open. We won't hide
anything from the public. My administration will remain
transparent, especially on something as sensitive as this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada said that businessman Enrique Zobel should
first produce evidence to back his claims that the late president
gave gold bars to some personalities.
</P>
<P>
He said these tales have been circulating since the
administration of former President Corazon Aquino, but there has
been no concrete evidence to back them up.

<P>
PARIS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The public prosecutor's office of Paris Thursday opened a
lawsuit for "forgery and use of forgery" against French Minister
of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn. This indictment
originated from a letter justifying a 600,000-franc (about 97,000
U.S. dollar) payment received by Strauss-Kahn when he was a lawyer
for Mutuelle Nationale d'Etudiants of MNEF, which was said to be a
fake.
</P>
<P>
-- The 16-nation European Union scientific steering committee
ruled on Friday with unanimity that the argument by the French
food safety agency to maintain embargo on British beef was
deprived of any ground. The committee, chaired by Frenchman Gerard
Pascal, said that conditions imposed by EU on Britain for
exporting its beef products are already very strict. France will
have no choice but obey the rule.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-
Khan has been put under an indictment since Thursday for allegedly
receiving payment of a fictitious job in the early half of 1990s,
as was accused by one former official of the students' health
insurance fund MNEF. Strauss-Khan denied the accusation and said
that he had done an effective job for MNEF.
</P>
<P>
-- The excellent health situation of the French economy has
helped the stock exchange market and the employment market. The
number of jobless people dropped by 3 percent in September in
France and its unemployment rate stood at 11.1 percent which,
however, remains the third highest in the European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> Last Remaining Indonesian Military Members Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The last 1,000 personnel of the
Indonesian Military (TNI) in East Timor left the territory on
Saturday, according to television reports.
</P>
<P>
The TNI members have been moving their belongings to Indonesian
Navy's "KRI Teluk Penyu" ship at Dili harbor since Friday morning.
The ship had been standing by for the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the International Force for East Timor
(Interfet) Col. Mark Kelly said Indonesian troops had been very
cooperative in allowing Interfet troops to assume responsibility
for the security of key infrastructure assets around Dili, capital
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Indonesian troops and police were pulled out of
East Timor after the ballot on the territory's future in August
resulted in an overwhelming vote against the offer of autonomy
within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Multinational forces started to trickle into the former
Portuguese colony to restore security in the territory in place of
the Indonesian soldiers from September 20.
</P>
<P>
Less than 1,000 Indonesian police and troops, which also
included dozens of the Air Force's special force, were left in
Dili even when the deployment of the international peacekeeping
force was completed.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly, the country's
highest decision-making body, earlier this month ratified East
Timor's secession. A United Nations transitional administration
will govern the territory for the foreseeable future, ushering
East Timor into full independence and self-government.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's oil giant
Petronas and the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) Saturday
signed a gas sales agreement under which the developers in the
Malaysia-Thai Joint Development Area (JDA) will jointly purchase
natural gas from the offshore Block A-18 in the area.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement in Malaysia's northern state of
Kedah was witnessed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and his Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai, according to Bernama news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, sellers (Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority
and production sharing contractors) are required to deliver the
gas at an initial daily contractual rate of 390 million standard

Gas would be delivered to the joint buyers via 34 inch of the
270 kilometers of offshore pipeline from JDA to Songkhla,
Thailand, and 36 inch of the 90 kilometers onshore pipeline from
Songkhla to Kedah.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cakerawala Gas Field, one of the gas fields in
Block A-18, would be developed as Phase One Gas Project with a
planned start-up date in the second quarter of 2002 with a total
investment estimated at 800 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President to Visit Egypt in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed al-Bashir is expected to visit Egypt before the end of
December, the visiting Sudanese foreign minister has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir's visit is aimed at seeking ways of further
improving the bilateral relations, Mustafa Osman Ismail was quoted
by Egypt's national newspaper Akhbar al Yom on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ismail arrived in Cairo a week ago and has held talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and President Hosni Mubarak on
bilateral ties and Egypt's efforts to help reach national
reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors' relations soured in early 1990s due to
Sudan's alleged support for Egypt's Islamic militants who
attempted to topple the secular government.
</P>
<P>
The two Arab states have succeeded in improving their ties in
the past two years and are considering al-Bashir's visit in recent
months. The Sudanese prhat Mubarak has
asked him to convey a verbal message on the bilateral relations
and a proposed dialog on national reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had expressed Egypt's readiness to host a peace
conference to be attended by representatives of the Sudanese
government, the opposition and other concerned parties, the
Arabic-language paper quoted the Suy, for fear that the possible
disintegration of Sudan may endanger its major water source, the
Nile.
</P>
<P>
It proposed with Libya in early August a five-point peace plan
calling for a permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a preparatory
meeting for the peace conference aimed at seeking ways of ending
the country's civil war and reaching comprehensive and durable
peace there.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting since 1983
for greater autonomy from the Muslim-controlled government for the
mostly Christian south. And some Muslim opposition parties also
want to share power with the government.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Starts Trial on Reformist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Special
Cleric Court on Saturday started the controversial trial on the
famous Iranian reformist Abdollah Nouri, a close ally of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The court prepared a 44-page charge against Nouri, who is the
managing director of the moderate favorite daily Khordad, which
marks the Iranian month when President Khatami was elected in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The charges leveled against Nouri include attempts to prepare
the grounds for the recognition of Israel, distorting Islamic
teachings, disturbing public opinion and publvi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The trial on Nouri, who was also former interior minister
impeached by the conservative Majlis (parliament) in June last
year, triggered a new wave of tensions between the hardline
conservatives and the moderate supporters of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Moderates claimed that the trial on Nouri was aimed at
paving the way for the victory ofy 18, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion here also believes that the trial or possible
conviction against Nouri will provide the grounds for his
disqualification from the Majlis election.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a top vote-winner in the first local council pol.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that Nouri might be elected the Majlis
speaker if the reformist moderates win the parliamentary
polling.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Asks Arab League to Probe His Top Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has asked the Arab League to probe a death sentence
imposed by a Lebanese military court on his top commander in
Lebanon, the Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"President Arafat decided that this court decision was an
attack on the Palestinian people and telephoned to inform me that
he had submitted it to the Arab League," Sultan Abul-Ainayn,
Arafat's top representative in Lebanon, said at his office in the
Rashidieh Palestinian camp, near Lebanon's southern-most p
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn was sentenced to death Wednesday night in absentia
on charges of forming and leading an armed gang with the purpose
of committing crimes against Lebanese people and their properties
and defying the authority of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
He was also convicted of possessing and trafficking illegal
weapons for which he was given an extra one-year jail term.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn is the secretary general of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization in Lebanon and also head of the Lebanon
branch of Arafat's mainstream faction Fatah Movement.
</P>
<P>
Beirut press reports said that the surprise move against
Abul-Ainayn might have been motivated by the recent re-emergence
of Fatah at the Ein El-Hilweh camp which are opposed to Arafat's
peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria, an undisputed power broker in Lebanon, has been a staunch
foe of Arafat since he concluded the unilateral Oslo peace accords
with the Jewish state in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn decried the ruling by saying that "it is not a
judicial verdict but with political motives that target the
entire Palestinian people and their cause."

<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia's annual state budget deficit in the
sixth five-year development plan (1995-2000) is estimated at about
28 billion U.S. dollars, down by 74.8 percent from 111 billion
dollars registered in the fifth plan, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The deficit drop was attributed to the big rise in revenues to
about 250 billion dollars in the sixth five-year plan from 167
billion dollars under the previous plan, and to the cutting of
expenditures to 222 billion dollars from 278 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is seeking to curb deficit by cutting public
expenditures and promoting non-petroleum revenues particularly in
the field of industry which has undergone remarkable development
during the past decade by pumping huge investments in it.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil exports account for about two-thirds of the total
income of Saudi Arabia which produces about 10 percent of the
total petroleum in the world and possesses about one fourth of the
world's proven oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Transport Ibrahim el-Demiri said
that his ministry plans to build river ports in each governorate
because river transport is the least expensive and is conducive to
environmental protection and alleviating road traffic.

The projected development of the Ismailia canal will be offered
to specialized companies to be implemented within three years at a
total cost of 200 million pounds (57.97 million U.S. dollars), the

The agreement was reached Thursday during a meeting between
Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Ali el-Saeedi and
Indian Ambassador to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Intensify Crackdown on Employment of Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it will intensify its crackdown on employment of
child labor.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, Labor Secretary Bienvenido
Laguesma said that the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)
is serious in its program to eliminate child labor.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE would seek better and more effective ways of pushing
the program, particularly in saving more children forced to work
under oppressive and hazardous conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Child labor refers to the employment of children below 15 years
of age, and those below 18 if they work in hazardous occupations,
according to the DOLE's Bureau of Women and Young Workers (BWYW).
</P>
<P>
But official figures show that there are 3.7 million working
children in the country, about 2.2 million of whom perceived that
they were exposed to hazardous work environment.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said the growing incidence of child labor requires
immediate national attention.
</P>
<P>
He said the DOLE, through its national program, is closely
coordinating with other government institutions, trade unions,
employees, international welfare institutions and non-government
organizations to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The overall objective is eliminating exploitative and worst
forms of child labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, Laguesma said, the DOLE has strengthened the
national and local policy guidelines, especially on employment of
minors and inspection of establishment.
</P>
<P>
He also said the DOLE has intensified the enforcement of law,
standards and regulations for the prevention, rescue and
rehabilitation of the most abused and exploited children.

<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's national legislature,
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, adopted
a deicision here today on banning and punishing cults like the
Falun Gong sect.
</P>
<P>
The decision on banning cults, preventing and punishing
their activities was passed with 114 approvals, two abstentions
and no objection.
</P>
<P>
The decision says that courts, prosecutors, police and
administrative judicial organs must be on full alert of cult
activities and smash them rigorously in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
It also stresses that deceived practitioners should be
differentiated from plotters and culprits, to ensure that only a
handful of criminals be punished.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of local governments are told to be responsible for
the propagation and spread of cults, and take actions to educate
people to be more aware of superstition and cults, it orders.
</P>
<P>
Cults are a worldwide problem faced by many governments in
the world. The notorious Branch Davidian cult in the United State
and the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan, for instance, caused mass
suicide and mass killings.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some forms of cults have also appeared in
China, including the sects of "Shouters", "the Installed King",
"the Principal God" and the most influential Falun Gong.

unprecedented" in the 50-year history of the People's Republic in
terms of its size of organization, influence, number of illegal
publications as well as the damages it brought to the society.
</P>
<P>
 "China has made a decisive success in the fight agaisnt the
Falun Gong cult, but combating cults will remain a long-term and
complicated task, and a legislation against them is both in time
and necessary," said Pang Xianzhi, a member of the NPC Standing
Committee and a renowned historian.

which prevents its adherents from going to hospitals, has led to
deaths of more than 1,400 practitioners in the country.

Jiaguo was found to have raped 11 women, including two girls under
age 14, and swindled 220,000 yuan from his followers.
</P>
<P>
Liu was executed in Xiangtan city of south China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to judicial explanations released by the Supreme
People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate today, cult
leaders may also be prosecuted in the names of murder, intentional
bodily harm, rape, rape of the under-aged, fraud or endangering
national security if such atrocities are found to have been
perpetrated.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a nationwide compaign to expose the
crimes of and combat the Falun Gong sect, and the three-month

<HEADLINE> South Korean Jinx Lingers on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Once again China failed in its
attempt to sweep away a South Korean jinx which has been
tormenting the country's soccer programme for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
Englishman Bobby Houghton's Olympic eleven came behind from a
first-half injury goal to salvage a 1-1 home draw with the
regional powerhouse South Korea Friday night, which could not be
good enough to save them from spinning out of the race in the
Asian Olympic qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, now on seven points from three games, will only
need to take one point from a still winless Bahrain in their last
fixture on home soil to make sure of their fourth consecutive
Olympic soccer tournament entry.
</P>
<P>
While for Houghton and his charges, who just managed four
points in the bag in a tournament which only qualify group top
finishers, next week's last leg trip to Bahrain only has an
academic meaning.
</P>
<P>
But what mattered more for a full house of 80,000 vocal fans
last night seemed to be the bitter truth left unchanged that China
still keeps a shameful 13-year winless record against its long
time arch-rival.
</P>
<P>
The last time the Chinese side tasted victory was as far and
away as in January 1986, when they edged a largely depleted South
Korean squad 2-1 in an invitational tournament in India.
</P>
<P>
Since then a triumph over South Korea became such a national
obsession that every encounter between two sides was a huge matter
for which millions of fans were turned on, the police were
jittering and the ultra-critical soccer press were getting even
more furious.
</P>
<P>
Last night the local police had a strong presence around the
Shanghai Stadium, but some angry fans still became irresistible
throwing rockets and fireworks and shouting curses to the country'
s soccer officials.
</P>
<P>
Houghton warned at the post-game press conference against "too
much reaction" towards the players, whom he said are still very
young and learning their trade.
</P>
<P>
The Englishman argued that though they failed to bring out a
historic victory, it otherwise was one of the two closest matchest
contested by China and South Korea for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The other one was their first meeting 26 days ago in Seoul,
which China, apparently on top for much of the time, lost 0-1 by a
controversial goal.
</P>
<P>
"We could win both games," Houghton said. " That we didn't win
didn't mean they are not good players. We're still probably one
of the three best sides in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"it was an extremely close game which could be won by either
side."
</P>
<P>
Houghton has seen his under-23 squad clashing with their South
Korean peers four times up to now, including two Dunhill Cup
losses earlier this year in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
But the most scandalous defeat during the China-South Korea
feudal history came from an Olympic preliminary in Kuala Lumpur in
1992, when the Chinese, leading 1-0 and needing a draw to qualify,
were buried under a South Korean goal blitz which saw a hat-trick
in a spate of nine minutes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Offers to Buy 1.5 Million Tons of Tapioca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has agreed
to buy 1.5 million tons of tapioca pellet to shore up the price,
as the protest by tapioca planters in front of the Government
House continued, a source said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreed 1.5 million ton purchase, the government and
the protesting planters failed to reach an agreement on the price.
</P>
<P>
The government offered to buy the tapioca pellet at 0.85 baht
(2.18 U.S. cents) a kilogram instead of a 1.2 baht (3.08 cents)
guarantee requested by the planters.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are in "smooth" negotiation about the price. The
stance of the farmers has been softened, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives agreed to increase a special loan
portfolio of 3.2 billion baht (82 million dollars) for tapioca
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The financial scheme is designed to delay the harvest by three
months in order to boost prices.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said the tapioca prices
would improve after the rainy season was over.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced criticism of some exporters for using
conflicting tapioca production estimates in order to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry predicted that tapioca production will
increase to 18 million tons from 16 million tons. However,
exporters insist that actual production is much higher, using the
alleged oversupply as a pretext to push down the prices.

MANILA -- The Philippines could achieve a more robust economic
growth in the last quarter of this year despite the recent hikes
in oil prices, wages and transport fares that have brought in
inflationary pressures, said a senior official.

From at least 3.5 percent growth expected in the third quarter,
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to post
around 4.5 percent expansion in the fourth quarter, Socio-economic

<HEADLINE> Tyson to Get His $8.7 Million Purse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Nevada boxing regulators
released Mike Tyson's the $8.7 million purse but warned him to
find another place to fight when his boxing license expired on
December 31.
</P>
<P>
This was the decision made from the hearing today in Las Vegas
on Tyson's hitting Orlin Norris after the bell in the first round
of their aborted fight last Saturday. The regulators voted
unanimously to release the purse they had been holding since the
bout.
</P>
<P>
"My advice is to pack Mike Tyson's bags up and take this act on
the road," commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta said. "I'm not so sure we
need him in the state of Nevada any longer."
</P>
<P>
Tyson did not appear at the hearing. Promoter Goossen told
commissioners that he thought it was a good idea for Tyson to
fight elsewhere, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
"We were looking to take Mike out of the state of Nevada and go
other places including out of the country," Goossen said. "Those
plans are still on the table."
</P>
<P>
At today's hearing, the commission upheld referee Richard
Steele's action of deducting two points from Tyson as the sole
punishment for the hitting.
</P>
<P>
Norris fell, dislocated his knee and was unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
Tyson said after the fight that he did not hear the bell even
though it rang five times as Steele moved in to separate the
fighters.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Center Ilgauskas to Miss Eight Weeks with Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers
again will be without talented center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who will
begin the season on the injured list with problems stemming from a
broken left foot suffered last season.
</P>
<P>
Cavaliers general manager Jim Paxson said today that Ilgauskas--
who has played just five games since signing a six-year, $71
million contract extension last January -- will begin the season
on the injured list and miss at least the first eight weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
That is not good news for Cleveland, which needs the Lithuanian
to take some of the defensive pressure of star forward Shawn Kemp.
Ilgauskas missed 45 games after breaking his left foot early last
season and the Cavs missed the postseason with a 22-28 mark.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas was believed to be recovered from a broken navicular
bone in his left foot but experienced soreness through training
camp and did not play in any preseason games.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas, 24, was a 1996 first-round pick of the Cavaliers but
sat out the entire 1996-97 season with a broken right foot. He
debuted the following season and averaged 13.9 points, 8.8
rebounds and 1.64 blocks while playing all 82 games.

<HEADLINE> CHINA ISSUES ANTI-CULT LAW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) issued an anti-cult law today to
prevent and combat cults such as the now banned Falun Gong sect.
</P>
<P>
The decision to outlaw and punish Falun Gong and other cults
is passed at the 12 session of the 9th NPC Standing Committee,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
It calls on courts, prosecutors, police and administrative
judicial organs to be on full alerts of cult activities and smash
them rigorously in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Cult organizations that have destroyed normal social orders
and stability through illegal gathering, led to the deaths of
practitioners and rapes of women and swindled money should be
dealt with severely, the decision says.
</P>
<P>
It also stresses that deceived followers and practitioners
should be differentiated from cult leaders. Local governments are
asked to take necessary measures to educate those deceived while
punishing a small number of cult leaders and those who have
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
Religious cult is a problem faced by many governments in the
world. Over the past few years, a number of cult organizations,
such as Falun Gong and Zhu Shen Jiao (or the principal god),
appeared in China, damaging social orders and stability.
</P>
<P>
China has made great success in combating the Falun Gong cult
in the past three months.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Capital Flight Reaches 32 Bln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The capital flight from
Indonesia has reached around 32 billion U.S. dollars due to
political uncertainty and the deteriorating economic meltdown over
the last two years, an economist said.
</P>
<P>
"The capital represents one of the obstacles to economic
recovery," the Indonesian Observer newspaper Saturday quoted Raden
Pardede, economist at PT Danareksa, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pardede said the capital has not returned to Indonesia because
the business sector remains ailing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investors have not yet resumed their
investment activities in Indonesia because they are awaiting
positive signs from the working performance of Indonesia's new
cabinet which was formed on October 26, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the private off-shore debts and real sector problems
have placed a burden on national economic recovery. "The key to
eliminating hindrances for economic recovery will rest on
Indonesia's economic development program approved by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)," he added.
</P>
<P>
If the new cabinet can achieve an economic growth of between 2
and 3 percent next year, then it will be a good achievement in the
light of the remaining hindrances, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was the hardest hit by the regional monetary crisis
which struck in mid-1997, with the rupiah losing up to 70 percent
to the U.S. dollar at one point. In 1998, Indonesia's economic
growth contracted around 14 percent. Officials had predicted that
the country's economic growth in 1999 could be between zero and 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance
and Industry Kwik Kian Gie Friday unveiled his strategy, focusing
on an in-depth review of Indonesia's economic agreement with the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
In late 1997, Indonesia turned to the IMF which then
orchestrated a 45 billion U.S. dollars bailout package for
Indonesia. However, the IMF stopped its assistance to Indonesia on
September 15 this year.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Oil Revenue Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's crude oil exports
are expected to yield 8.5 billion U.S. dollars this year thanks to
price increases on the world market, Adrian Lajous, Director of
the state oil company Pemex, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lajous said during a tour of the Cadereyta refinery, in the
north of the Nuevo Leon state, that the average price of Mexican
crude is expected to be 15.25 dollars per barrel, six dollars more
than the level established in the budget for this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that this income will make it possible for
Pemex to invest in several projects in the next year that had been
postponed because of the drop in revenue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the oil prices in 1998 caused the Mexican crude
price to drop from some 16 dollars per barrel to less than eight
dollars, which reduced the company's income by some 4 billion
dollars, and forced the government to cut budget expenditures for
that year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the concerted action of the oil producing countries,
mainly Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, oil supply was reduced
by some 3.1 million barrels a day, which boosted the oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Reports Increases in Oil Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's oil exports have
reached 774 million U.S. dollars during the first nine months of
this year, an increase of 26 percent over the same period of last
year, according to statistics released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Mines and Energy Ministry showed the growth
was not a result of increases in the sales volume, but in price
hikes.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador exported 58.4 million barrels of crude from January to
September, 9.8 percent less than in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the average price of a barrel rose by 39.7 U.S.
percent from 9.49 to 13.26 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said if the oil prices are maintained at 19
dollars per barrel, Ecuador's oil revenue will increase by 40
percent this year.

BELGRADE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's high
representative for foreign and security policy, Javier Solana,
Friday promised in the Kosovo capital of Pristina that Western
countries will help Kosovo rebuild facilities destroyed during
NATO's 78-day bombardment earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
News reports reaching here quoted the former NATO chief as
saying at a press conference that the EU will extend an aid of 500
million U.S. dollars to Kosovo next year for postwar
reconstruction.

officials, the electric power failed and he had to answer the
questions in darkness, according to Yugoslavia's Tanjug news
agency. Blackout has been a commonplace since the NATO
bombardment.

Solana, referring to continued ethnic Albanians' violence
against other ethnic groups in Kosovo, also called on the ethnic

renounce violence and work together to build a society based on
ethnic tolerance.

<HEADLINE> FIS to Introduce New Team Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Ski Federation
announced plans on Friday to introduce a new team competition at
the end of the 2001 season for a prize money of one million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the annual congress at the season-opening giant slalom races
this weekend, FIS president Gian-Franco Kasper said in Tignes that
"this is not part of the World Cup, at least not in the first year.
But television is extremely interested and our results show that a
team competition is wanted and would be a success."
</P>
<P>
Though the project is still in the planning stages, FIS said
the top eight countries from the World Cup would qualify for the
event along with the host nation.
</P>
<P>
Four skiers from each country with two men and two women would
compete in each discipline and accumulate as many points possible
for their country.
</P>
<P>
The competition would be staged at the end of the season but
would not conflict with national championships, FIS director Sarah
Lewis said.

<HEADLINE> More Robust Growth Expected in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines could achieve a
more robust economic growth in the last quarter of this year
despite the recent hikes in oil prices, wages and transport fares
that have brought in inflationary pressures, said a senior
official.
</P>
<P>
From at least 3.5 percent growth expected in the third quarter,
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to post
around 4.5 percent expansion in the fourth quarter, Socio-economic
Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said in an interview published
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting positive growth in the industrial sector
beginning in the third quarter, with a bigger positive growth in
manufacturing," he said, adding that this would complement the
expected growth in agriculture and the service sector.
</P>
<P>
While the third quarter's economic growth was largely due to a
strong agricultural performance, the sectoral output in the third
quarter would be lower than the 11 percent increase seen in the
second quarter, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year, Medalla said, the agriculture sector is
expected to post a growth of between 5 percent and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Expectations of a positive growth in the industrial sector
beginning in the third quarter have been boosted by the central
bank's announcement that banks would increase lending in the
business sector, including the manufacturing, which registered a
negative growth in the last five quarters.
</P>
<P>
The government is targeting a GDP growth rate of 3 percent to
3.5 percent for 1999.

<P>
NANNING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A decision to improve
protection of mangrove forests in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has been passed by the Standing Committee of the
People's Congress of Beihai, a coastal city in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mangrove is a general term for tropical and subtropical plants
grown along the south China coast. The powerful roots of mangrove
protect the coast as well as embankments built to hold back tidal
waves. A mangrove forest nature reserve was built in the city in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The Beihai city government will lead the move to manage and
investigate any damage done to mangrove forests. Serious cases of
destruction will be handled according to law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, teams of expert will be organized to study the eco-
system of mangrove forests and build protection zones in places
where mangroves are concentrated, said the decision.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,333 hectares of mangrove forests mainly along
the coast and tidal zones of this southern Chinese region, which
sits on the northern bank of the Beibu Gulf.

</P>
<P>
Flores recommended the region to redouble its efforts for

</P>
<P>
Flores said in a speech delivered to the one-day meeting of the

The Salvadoran president said that it is indispensable to
increase the flow of foreign capitals to achieve a sustainable
development in the region, with 33 million people.
</P>
<P>
Flores said that the harmonization of natural resources and
other economic achievements would mean social benefits for the
region, including the reduction of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The president said about the armed conflicts that affected the
region that Central America has shown that it is capable of
surmounting Serious political crises.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Texas Governor George

A poll conducted jointly by CNN, USA Today and Gallup said
Friday that Bush's support among Republican-leaning women, 55
percent before Dole dropped out October 20, jumped to 68 percent

</P>
<P>
Bush's overall support increased by 6 percentage points, even
though his support among men likely to vote in the Republican
race, now 67 percent, remained about the same.
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats say Bush's strategy to attract women is a
threat, even though they believe they have a better track record
on women's issues. Women is considered to be a traditional source
of Democratic strength.
</P>
<P>
"Republicans have a candidate who uniquely understands
targeting the women's vote," said Celinda Lake, who specializes in
the women's vote and informally advises the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
His campaign slogan of compassionate conservatism goes over
well with suburban white women, Lake said. "He's careful on the
choice (abortion) issue, aggressive on the education issue, he's
careful with the diversity of his team."

NEW YORK, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks shot higher
Friday for the second straight session as investors remained
optimism about the strong U.S. economy without signs of the
