<HEADLINE> Myanmar Gunman Gets Death Sentence for Embassy Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar gunman, who was involved
in the Myanmar embassy siege incident in Bangkok last October, was
sentenced to death by a Myanmar district court Thursday, state-run
Radio Myanmar reported Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Saw Tin Oo, who was among the six gunmen storming the Myanmar
embassy in Bangkok on October 1 last year, was captured on March 1
this year when he returned to the Myanmar border town of Myawaddy.
</P>
<P>
During the incident, he was late to enter the embassy compound
for launching the attack while the five others had moved in.
</P>
<P>
He was then arrested outside the embassy compound by the Thai
police and had been detained by the Thai immigration authorities
up to February 29 this year when he was released by the Thai side.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with high treason and unlawful association.
</P>
<P>
Saw Tin Oo joined in 1997 the Thai-based "God's Army" of the
Kayin National Union, a major anti-government ethnic armed group
operating on the Myanmar-Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Five armed men with AK (47) rifles, who are all Myanmar
students living in Thailand, stormed the Myanmar embassy in
Bangkok at 10:50 a.m. local time on October 1, 1999 and held the
embassy staff and their families together with a number of
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully on the next day with all the 89
hostages freed before the five gunmen were flown by the Thai side
to the Thai-Myanmar border and allowed to go free.

<HEADLINE> CACCI Council Meeting Concludes in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the national
chambers of commerce and industry of Asia-Pacific countries on
Friday called on the governments in the region to take measures
and help Asia's economies to meet the challenges of the
globalization in the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the 60th Council
Meeting of the Confederation of Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce
and Industry (CACCI) the delegates also urged governments and
businesses in the region to cooperate in dealing with the economic
and social problems brought about by globalization.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting which concluded here Friday had discussed
safety-net measures to cushion the pains of policy adjustments the
countries in the region face as a result of their participation in
the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Globalization has not brought prosperity and development to the
same degree to all Asian countries, or to all sectors within these
countries, the delegates pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, it is important (for governments) during this
transition to support the process of liberalization by putting in
place measures that will enhance its benefits, while facilitating
adjustment, especially for the most vulnerable sectors," the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The communique urged Asian countries' governments to lay more
emphasis on human resources development, especially providing the
work force with skills that correspond to the direction of
structural changes in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The CACCI meeting also called on developed countries to help
developing countries build fundamental capacities for self-
sustained economic growth and development, including widening and
deepening efforts to liberalize domestic and international markets
for trade and investment by emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
Hosted by the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, the meeting was participated by 60 delegates from 18
Asia-Pacific countries including Australia, Bangladesh, India,
Japan, Indonesia Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Vietnam and others.
</P>
<P>
The next council meeting of the CACCI, as well as its 18th
conference, will be held in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in November
30,2000.

<HEADLINE> Reigning Champions Indonesia to Meet China in Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Marleve Mainaky
proved to be of more mental toughness when he sealed a 3-2 semi-
final victory over Denmark on Friday for the reigning champions to
set up a Thomas Cup championship meeting with China.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, who won their fourth consecutive tie in the
tournament, are seeking for their fourth straight title and 12th
overall in the Thomas Cup, the men's team badminton championships.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan almost turned the most dramatic tie of the
tournament into another easy sweep of Indonesia before his first
singles rival Peter Gade Christensen saved a match point to put
Denmark 1-0 with a 12-15, 17-16, 15-11 victory.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old veteran served for the match on 16-15 at the
second set, but his world number one opponent Christensen saved
the match point with a smash on the net to turn the table around.
</P>
<P>
The Dane, who won the world championship in 1999, was
apparently on the upper hand in the third set after building up an
early lead before Hendrawan saved two match points at 14-9.
</P>
<P>
But Christensen, 23, who was more powerful and faster due to
his youth, held off the final resistance to win the game on the
third match point. The first doulbes game was not a matchup as
expected with Tony Gunawan and Rexy Mainaky leveled the tie score
1-1, beating Martin Lundgaard/Lars Paaske, 15-7, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
When the 19-year-old Taufik Hidayat took on the Olympic
champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, it was completely the other way
around of the first singles face-off. The younger Hidayat lobbed
Hoyer-Larsen around of the court and stretched the 34-year-old
veteran to the utmost before taking the critical third game, 15-11,
15-9.
</P>
<P>
But the game was concluded in an embarrassing way when the
Indonesian celebrated his victory by throwing his racket to the
air. The racket fell under the feet of Hoyer-Larsen, who kicked
it away in anger. Hoyer-Larsen did not picked the racket back to
Hidayat, who starred in unbelief for the unprofessional behaviour,
before he left the court among the boos of the audiences.
</P>
<P>
As the Malaysian police were taking away illegal Indonesian
immigrates on the stands, their second doubles players were
suffering the biggest upset of the competition on the court.
</P>
<P>
Candra Wijaya paired with Sigit Budiarto first time in the
competition after seperated for two years, but they failed to
prove their strength when Jesper Larsen and Jens Eriksen snatched
a successful comeback win, 8-15, 17-15, 17-16 to extend the tie to
the fifth game.  Re-unioned first time after Budiarto was
banned for a year following a failure of a doping test in 1998,
the former world champions and world No.1 doubles players seemed
to cruise for a conclusion when Budiarto made an unusual save
under between his legs for a 15-8 win of the first set and led 10-
5 in the second.
</P>
<P>
But the consistent Danes gave the honour to the European
champions by a 17-15 second-set win after the Indonesians wasted
three matches points and two services at 14-11. Larsen and
Eriksen rocketed to a 9-1 lead in the decisive set of the tie
before the Indonesians came up.
</P>
<P>
Wijaya and Budiarto employed their fast paces and quick
touches on the net, mixed with straight backhanders from baseline,
to catch up the Danes everywhere on the court. The rivalry was
tied on every points since 11-11 before Larsen and Eriksen saved
two match points again at 16 to all, to draw a dramatic a 2-2 tie
on their first serve.
</P>
<P>
Danish coach Kenneth Larsen said, "It's an incredible match. I
'm proud and excited for what my players had put into the game.
</P>
<P>
"We were close to win the semifinal on the third singles, but
I'm satiesfied with my players as they had done anything they
could. It's an extremely brilliant game.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with my players because our goal of the competition
was to get into the semi-finals in both Cups."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian coach Sumaryono Hadi Nasri said: "We're lucky to
win the semifinal because my players did not deliver the best they
have. We'll be a better team in the finals on Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Both coaches agreed that the chance to win the tie was 50-50
to both sides when it was leveled at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
"Both players (of the third singles) played much below to
their normal levels in the match, because they were too nervous,"
said Larsen.
</P>
<P>
Nasri delinced to give any clues for their finals lineup. "It
depends on our strategy (whether we will change the doubles
pairings in the finals)," said Nasri.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said Hoyer-Larsen would retire after the Sydney Olympic
Games. "He will retire after the Olympics, but you cannot count
him out now because he played very tough in the tournament,"
Larsen added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss on
Saturday called for U.N. interference to stop Israel's attempt to
destroy a Lebanese historic castle, Lebanese National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In his letters to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
Director General Matsuura Koichiro, Hoss said that Israel is
transporting tons of explosive into the castle of Shegeef, in a bid
to blast it after its withdrawal from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Hoss asked the U.N. officials to exert influence and take urgent
steps to impede Israel's damage on Lebanese cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also briefed United States and French ambassadors in
Lebanon on the situation, asking them to deliver the message to U.
S. President Bill Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac to
exert pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Shegeef castle, built in the 12th century, has been occupied
by Israel since 1982. The strategic castle, located along the
Israeli-Lebanese border, is 716 meters above the sea level.

<HEADLINE> Qatari FM in Cairo for Talks on Regional Issues, Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad
Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani arrived in Cairo Saturday on a two-
day visit for talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Hamad will discuss with Moussa a number of issues related to the
Arab world and the Middle East region, especially the Arab-Israeli
peace talks which are undergoing a critical stage, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two officials will mainly deal with the topics tabled on the
agenda of a proposed foreign ministers meeting of the Damascus
Declaration signatories, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Syria and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates signed the Damascus Declaration on regional
security, political and economic issues in March, 1991 following
the Gulf War which ousted Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Syria on May 3-4, the foreign ministers of
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria decided to convene a meeting of the
foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration signatories in Cairo
in June.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Hamad will also discuss means of boosting bilateral
relations in various fields, the Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Qatar soured in November 1997 after
Cairo joined other countries in boycotting the Middle East and
North Africa Economic Conference hosted by Doha.
</P>
<P>
The ties have returned to normal after the two Arab countries
exerted joint efforts to heal their rifts. Both Moussa and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak visited Qatar last December.

<P>
"The Peruvian elections legitimacy is sustained on the people's
vote to be held on the date determined by the National Elections
Jury (JNE) on May 28," he said.
</P>
<P>
This date was questioned by opposition candidate Alejandro
Toledo, who said that there was not enough time to straighten the
irregularities in the Electoral Processes National Office (ONPE),
and he left the elections asking for a new date.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian president called on Toledo to abide by the will of
the people and take part in the elections on the date established
by the electoral authorities.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that the withdrawal of the opposition candidate
from the electoral contest puts the country in a delicate
political situation that could have serious political
repercussions at an international level.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the confidence of the citizens, of the investors,
and of the international community to reestablish after the
electoral process," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian president also said that a polarization does exist,
but this is natural whenever there are only two candidates in an
electoral contest.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President on Presidential Candidate Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has emphasized that no ruling party member is prevented from
collecting forms for seeking candidate nomination to run for the
president's position in the general elections to be held in
October this year.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, also national chairman of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi
(CCM), returned his nomination forms Saturday to the CCM
Secretary-General Philip Mangula at its headquarters in the
central city of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
He is so far the sole contender for the Tanzanian Union
presidency on the CCM ticket.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a grand ceremony, Mkapa said he believed the
would-be aspirants "smelled" the atmosphere and found it against
their favor.
</P>
<P>
He said he thanked the would-be contenders for their decision
to quit the race, saying it has further strengthened the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
CCM announced last month that filing of nomination forms in the
party began on April 20 and they must be returned to the party's
secretary- general by May 21.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa collected nomination forms on May 3, officially starting
running for another five-year term in the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Flanked on Saturday's ceremony by CCM vice-chairmen for the
Mainland and Zanzibar John Malecela and Salmin Amour respectively,
Mkapa appealed to the electorate throughout the country to ensure
CCM would win by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed the belief that he has successfully attempted
to implement the 1995 election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
"If I had not registered some success, more than 7,000 CCM
members who endorsed my presidential forms as trustees would not
have done so," he added.
</P>
<P>
The forms are required to be endorsed by a maximum of 250
trustees. According to Tanzanian Constitution, each registered

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said Saturday that it
has destroyed an Eritrean anti-aircraft missile site in the
vicinity of Mendefera, an Eritrean border town near the central
war front.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ethiopian warplanes also repeatedly bombed the
Sawa Military Training Center in western Eritrea, 420 kilometers
from the Eritrean capital of Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ethiopian ground forces captured the town of Mohajer
in western Eritrea and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy
troops, the Ethiopian Government Office said, adding that the
eight-day fighting has subsided on the other fronts.

<P>
Abdullah made the decision while meeting Crown Prince Hamza Bin
Hussein, Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, Royal Court Chief
Fayez Tarawneh, Senate President Zeid Rifai and House Speaker Abdu
Hadi Majali.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh had revealed that the 38-year-old king suffers from a
muscular stiffness accompanied by pain in his back which called for
rest according to the king's private physician.
</P>
<P>
The monarch was just back home on Friday after a week-long visit
to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of his tight
diplomatic schedule to rally support for his cash-strapped kingdom
and for talks over developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, as the second Arab state after Egypt that has signed
a peace treaty with Israel, has been playing an active role in
mediating in the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's ties with Arab nations soured due to its
sympathy with Iraq which invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to years of fence-mending efforts by the Jordanian
government to heal the wounds of the 1990 Gulf crisis, Jordanian
workers are coming back to the lucrative labor markets in the Gulf
states.  The reopening of the Gulf labor markets to Jordanians
will also help bring down the soaring unemployment rate in Jordan,
which was put at 27 percent by independent estimates as against 14
percent by the government.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Maltese FMs Discuss Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
held talks on Saturday with his Maltese counterpart Joe Borg on
regional issues of mutual concern, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks mainly dealt with the Middle East peace process and
the obstacles hampering its progress, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli peace talks are now undergoing a critical
stage. No breakthrough has been made in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations for a final settlement of the thorniest issues
including Jerusalem, refugees, Jewish settlements and the final
borders.
</P>
<P>
And Syria and Israel have yet to resume their talks on Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which the Jewish state captured
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, since they broke off the talks
in January.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Borg, who arrived in Cairo on Friday for a three-day
visit, also took up issues related to political, security and
economic cooperation in the Mediterranean region, the news agency
added.
</P>
<P>
Both officials emphasized the need to coordinate stances prior
to a foreign ministers meeting among the countries joining the
Barcelona process, slated for May 25-26 in Portugal's capital of
Lisbon, it said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union and 12 Mediterranean countries
kicked off the process in 1995 during a meeting held in Barcelona,
Spain. The participants have a vision to forge close cooperation in
the political, economic, trade, social and security fields, and to
create a free trade area in 2010.

<HEADLINE> Over 6,700 Iraqi Children, Elderly Die Under Sanctions in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 6,700 children and elderly
people died last month as a direct result of the decade-long U.N.
sanctions imposed on Iraq, according to a report released by the
Iraqi Health Ministry on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 5,486 children, under the age of five, died
of diarrhea, pneumonia, respiratory infections and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
As to the elderly people, 847 died of heart disease and
hypertension, 410 died of diabetes and an unspecified number of
people died of malignant neoplasms.
</P>
<P>
Such a high mortality rate, due to malnutrition and medicine
shortage caused by the sanctions, was in sharp contrast with the
same month in 1989, when some 200 children and 250 elderly people
died.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly called on the United Nations to end the
stringent sanctions, which have claimed the lives of nearly 1.3
million people ever since its imposition in 1990 to punish the
country for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq has long accused the United States and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the
implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program by deliberately
putting on hold contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies, which worsened the
humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal, launched in late 1996 and now in its
seventh phase, allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil every six
months to buy basic necessities to help offset the effects of the
crippling U.N. sanctions.

ABU DHABI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Three Pakistani naval ships
arrived Saturday at Mina Zayed port of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) on a four-day goodwill visit, reported the official news
agency (WAM).
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi is the last leg of the ships' visit to members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Commodore Mohammed Asad Qureshi, commander of the visiting
destroyer squadrons, said in the evening that the visit was aimed
at further bolstering cooperation with UAE Naval Forces.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE Naval Forces have seen a tremendous progress. It is a
matter of pride of us to have taken part in this by providing
training for its officers," said the commander, stressing the need
to further extend cooperation between the GCC and Pakistani naval
forces.
</P>
<P>
The commander also noted that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had
recently concluded joint military exercises in the Arabian Sea,
dubbed "Naseem Al-bahr" (the Oceanic Zephyr).

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Opposition Labor Party Suspended for Internal Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian authorities suspended on
Saturday the activities of the country's only Islamist party until
it resolves an internal power struggle, just months ahead of
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The suspension also included the opposition Labor Party's
newspaper
Al-Shaab, which the government press has accused of inciting
violent demonstrations against an allegedly blasphemous novel,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Parties Committee under Egypt's Shura (Consultative) Council
was ruling on a power struggle between breakaway factions within
the party which have ousted the party leader, Ibrahim Shukri, but
elected two different chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The Parties Committee said in a statement it had decided not to
recognize any of the Labor Party factions until the rift is
resolved by courts or via reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came just months ahead of parliamentary elections
which are expected to take place in October or November.
</P>
<P>
The party split followed accusations in Egypt's government press
that it was using the bi-weekly Al-Shaab to incite students at
Cairo's Al-Azhar University to demonstrate against the recent
republication of an allegedly blasphemous novel by Syrian writer
Haidar Haidar.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 students were injured in clashes with police when
protests on May 8-10 against the book turned violent and more than
100 were arrested, though they were released later.
</P>
<P>
In late April, Al-Shaab published an article inciting Muslims to
kill the author of the controversial novel, which it accused of
defaming Islam, along with Egyptian officials responsible for
republishing it.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt's top Muslim cleric, Sheikh Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi of
Al-Azhar, denounced Al-Shaab's campaign as "provocative," in an
interview published Saturday in the weekly Rose al-Youssef
magazine.
</P>
<P>
"Those who provoked the unrest and the students who threw rocks
at the police should be held accountable," he said, despite
branding Haidar's novel as blasphemous, immoral and a danger to
society on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party started out as a socialist-orientated movement
when it was founded in 1978, but allied itself with the Muslim
Brotherhood for the 1987 parliamentary elections and formally
adopted an Islamist line at its general congress in 1989.
</P>
<P>
It has no members in the parliament, the People's Assembly, but
uses Al-Shaab newspaper to voice its opinions. The paper's
journalists have been sentenced to prison terms and fined in two
separate libel cases within the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Parties Committee is chaired by Speaker of the Shura Council
Mustapha Kamal Helmi and includes the ministers of the interior,
justice and parliamentary affairs as members as well as three
judges appointed by the state.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Calls for Peaceful Solution to Eritrean- Ethiopian Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Saturday urged Eritrea
and Ethiopia to settle their border conflicts through just, legal
and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"Neighboring countries should solve their conflicts through
peaceful means as there is no victor in wars," said Kuwaiti State
Minister for Foreign Affairs Sulaiman Majid Al-Shaheen, after
receiving a letter from Eritrean Foreign Minister addressed to
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen urged the warring parties to exercise self-restraint and
go to the negotiation table, the official Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kuwait supports all efforts employed by African,
Asian and European organizations to find a peaceful solution to the
Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia recently launched a huge land and air offensive against
Eritrea, saying it wanted to "recover territory which has been
under Eritrean occupation for the past two years."
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here on Saturday said that Ethiopian air force
continued its attacks on different targets in Eritrea while ground
troops pushed deep into Eritrea's territory in the past week.
</P>
<P>
But Eritrea had denied reports on attacks on its main port on
the Red Sea as was claimed by the Ethiopian government two days
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) on Friday appealed for
an immediate ceasefire to hold new talks.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Trade Surplus Rebounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's trade surplus rebounded to
the level of nearly 4 billion Canadian dollars (about 2.7 billion
U.S.dollars) in March as automotive exports increased from
production cutbacks in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly trade report released Friday, Statistics Canada
said Canada's merchandise trade surplus climbed to 3.9 billion
Canadian dollars (about 2.6 billion U.S. dollars) in March,
compared with the previous month's 3.5 billion Canadian dollars (
about 2.3 billion U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 4.5 percent from February to 33.5 billion
Canadian dollars (about 22.4 billion U.S. dollars), while imports
rose 3.7 percent to 29.6 billion Canadian dollars (about 19.9
billion U.S.dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
This was in line with Canadian economists' expectations of a
monthly trade surplus of 4 billion Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest favorable balance pushed Canada's total trade
surplus in the first quarter to 11.7 billion Canadian dollars (
about 7.8 billion U.S. dollars), a highest quarterly surplus
second only to 12.1 billion Canadian dollars (about 8.1 billion U.
S. dollars) recorded in the second quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The largest volume of trade was between Canada and its southern
neighbor, the United States. The countries' two-way trade reached
about 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 668 million U.S. dollars)
each day, according to the official statistical agency.

<HEADLINE> NPT Conference Runs Into Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The 200 Review Conference of
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) ran into Saturday
morning, rather than end late on Friday as scheduled, sources
close to the meeting said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by 187 NPT signatories, was deadlocked
as Iraq counterattacked the U.S. insistence on the inclusion of
Iraq's difficulties with inspectors as a condition for naming
Israel in the final document by threatening to block the entire
meeting, which kicked off at the U.N. Headquarters in New York on
April 24.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 5 a.m. EST, and still without an agreement, the
conference president, Algerian U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Baali,
sent delegates from 187 state signatories home to get some sleep.
He said a new attempt to reach agreement would begin later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
The NPT conference works by consensus, which means one country
can block agreement. It is to set goals for the all signatories to
the 30-year NPT, the cornerstone of arms reduction treaties.
</P>
<P>
Central at issue was language in a side document on the Middle
East reviewing Iraq's difficulties with inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), responsible for
scraping any nuclear weapons material.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the sources said, insisted this as a
condition for naming Israel in the document, the only Middle East
country which remains outside NPT. The conference would appoint an
envoy to discuss with Israel in order to secure Israel's early
accession to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq rejected any reference to its difficulties with
the inspectors. Instead, it wanted language limited to the IAEA's
January inspections of its nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Delegates will meet again on Saturday morning to work hard on
the final document, which is expected to give a stronger pledge on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The commitment toward a total nuclear disarmament has survived
in the draft agreement after France withdrew a proposal to soften
the draft language.
</P>
<P>
The 187 countries representing the NPT review conference are
expected to agree on the document, which is also expected to
include "further reduction of nonstrategic nuclear weapons," with
Russia having withdrawn its objection, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The NPT conference is the first since the Treaty was extended
indefinitely in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Claim FA Cup Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A blunder by Aston Villa keeper
David James handed Chelsea victory in the last FA Cup final to be
played under Wembley's Twin Towers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gianfranco Zola's free-kick from deep on the left was fumbled
by James as he went up to meet it, gifting the Blues' Roberto di
Matteo after 73 minutes - in the 72nd Wembley FA Cup clash.
</P>
<P>
This was the last final to be played at Wembley before it is
torn down to make way for a new redeveloped national stadium.
</P>
<P>
And the historic match was also of great significance for
Chelsea, guaranteeing them a place in the UEFA Cup next season and
elevating boss Gianluca Vialli to the status of the most
successful Blues manager in history.
</P>
<P>
After finishing a disappointing fifth in the league and getting
knocked out of the quarter-finals of the Champions League by
Barcelona, the London club needed the trophy to earn a place in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased because the reason we were up for this game was
that we want to win things. It hasn't been a good premier league
season for us but we did marvelously well in the Champions League,
" Vialli said.
</P>
<P>
"I've no regrets by getting knocked out by Barcelona. It's been
a long and hard season and we've taken a lot of stick.That's
definitely an extra reason to do well."
</P>
<P>
He added: "This is the best possible way to finish the season.
It has been a long season but at the end we have
finished with something. Now we can go on holiday and get ready
for next season."

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes World Bank Decision to Grant Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- An informed source at the Iranian
Foreign Ministry on Saturday welcomed the new decision of the World
Bank to grant two loans to Iran in defiance of the U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source said the objection of the United States
to the two loans of 232 million U.S. dollars allocated for Iranian
health and development projects deserves to be condemned, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank announced on Thursday it approved two loans to
Iran to improve health care and sewerage systems. The credit, which
has been postponed several times, will be the first to Iran since
1994.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank President James Wolfensohn said that any future
lending programs to Iran would be discussed only after a review of
concrete results of the reform programs of President Mohammad
Khatami in six to nine months time.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily Tehran Times on Saturday also hailed the
World Bank decision, terming the approval of the two loans to Iran
as a slap in the face for Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Washington is going to face more humiliations and
disappointments if it does not correct its hostile attitude towards
Iran," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the World Bank
approval was "inappropriate" because of the Islamic Republic's
support for terrorism and the controversial ongoing "show trial" of
13 Jews on espionage charges.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Launches Anti-Counterfeit Currency Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people from banks,
security departments, and industrial and commercial
administrations in Shanghai were handing out materials to
passersby telling them how to tell a real Renminbi (RMB) note,
China's currency, from a fake one.
</P>
<P>
This was part of the local government's month-long effort to
publicize China's Renminbi Administration Regulations, which took
effect on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The regulations define the legal status, unit, design, printing
and circulation of RMB, and further standardize the issuing and
management of the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
They also address problems such as counterfeiting and illegal
trade in RMB.
</P>
<P>
China has been plagued by rampant and increasing fake bank
notes over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Shanghai Higher People's Court show that
courts in the city handled 497 cases related to the selling,
purchasing, transporting or use of counterfeit RMB, an increase of
50 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the number of cases related to counterfeit
currency handled by courts throughout China increased by 40
percent, and fake money valued 340 million yuan was seized.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese authorities have launched a six-month long
nationwide campaign against criminals engaged in producing phony
Chinese currency.

<HEADLINE> Australian Parliament Leader Praises Progress in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- An Australian parliament leader today
praised the progress made in the Tibet Autonomous Region in many
areas, saying the amazing change in Tibet since the late 1950s are
unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
Garry Nehl, vice speaker of the Australian House of
Representatives, told Xinhua that each time he comes to Tibet he
finds new changes here, and that he has become familiar with the
region.
</P>
<P>
People in Tibet are living far better off than they were under
serfdom, he said. Nehl visited Tibet in 1992 and 1999, and is now
in Lhasa to present a donation of two million Australian dollars
from the Australian government to the Tibet Autonomous Region to
help solve the problem of iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his 1992 visit to Tibet, he saw that
pedicabs were the main means of transportation around town, but
now there are many taxi, demonstrating greater job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
On the way from Lhasa to Shigatse, he said he saw that some
small villages now have electric lighting, and many new buildings
have appeared in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
He said that human rights here have also been improved, noting
that it is unfair for some people who do not have a deep
understanding of Tibet, or have never been to Tibet, to talk about
Tibet from a biased perspective.
</P>
<P>
Nehl said he believes that the basic human right of all people
is the right to a healthy mind in a healthy body, and pointed to
the fact that the average life expectancy of the local people has
risen from 36 years in the late 1950s to 65 today.
</P>
<P>
He said that each time he comes here, he sees many religious
services in temples, refuting some reports that there is no
freedom of religion in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Moroccan Finance and Economy Ministry said the value of
the country's import of oil rose in the first quarter of this year
by about 50 percent to 4.9 billion dirhams (about 470 million U.S.
dollars), due to the rising oil prices in the world markets, and
despite the drop in the quantity of the import by around 1.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Morocco imports 98 percent of its oil needs from Saudi Arabia,
Iraq, Iran and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in the country's balance of foreign trade increased
by some 55 percent from the same period.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen's Saba Company for Trading and General
Contracting said the company carried out a project of constructing
the Sabr mountain road in Taez province at a cost of 12.3 million
dollars, provided by Saudi Prince Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
A statements by the company's chairman of board of directors,
Abdul Haq Saeed, said the new road is 16 kilometers long, starting
from Taez to the top of Sabr mountain, 3,060 meters above the sea
level.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's state-owned aluminium company Eti Aluminyum
A.S., based in Seydisehir of Central Konya Province, plans to raise
300 million dollars on modernization and capacity expansion.
</P>
<P>
Eti, Turkey's only aluminium producer, has an annual output of
60,000 tons, said General Manager Ibrahim Uz Friday. With the
investment, the output will increase to 110,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year the factory surpassed its capacity, producing 61,000
tons with 14,500 tons exported abroad.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey imports 800,000 tons of corn each year to cover
its supply deficit, researchers in Selcuk University of Konya,
central Turkey, said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Corn now comes in third, just after wheat and barley, in terms
of hectares used for crop cultivation domestically.
</P>
<P>
The report said that currently Turkey has a corn-supply deficit
of 800,000 tons and projections show that each year 50,000-100,000
tons of additional demand will be added to this deficit.

<HEADLINE> hke052031--Regional Experts Urge Nepal to Set Up Copyright Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Experts on intellectual property
rights from Asia-Pacific countries gathered here Saturday to
deliberate on ways to establish a copyright regime in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
An effective legislation and its strict enforcement are
indispensable in Nepal to check the rampant infringement of
copyrights and to build up a framework for the compliance of the
Agreement of TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights), said the experts at a seminar on copyright and related
rights.
</P>
<P>
"At the request of the Nepali government, WIPO (World
Intellectual Property Organization) colleagues are examining a new
draft law on copyright and related rights law in Nepal," said
Ranjana Abeysekera, senior counselor of WIPO, at the two-day
seminar co-organized by WIPO and Nepal's Ministry of Tourism,
Culture and Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
The participants also stressed the need to establish an
efficient administration of a society for the collective
management of copyright and related rights in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of such a society in Nepal will assist the
enforcement of copyright law," said Abeysekera, adding that strong
copyright laws will help to stimulate the development of local
cultural industries.
</P>
<P>
At a time when Nepal is engaged in the process of the WTO (
World Trade Organization) accession, there is a need for efforts
to comply with the TRIPS agreement with a well-spelt out plan.
</P>
<P>
A bill on the new Copyrights Act designed to create an
effective copyrights-protection regime in Nepal is still awaiting
final consent.
</P>
<P>
All the least developed countries including Nepal are required
to fully implement -- by January 1, 2006 at the latest -- the
provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The TRIPS Agreement deals with the intellectual property that
includes copyright and related rights, trademarks, geographical
indications, industrial designs, patents and layout designs of
integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Japan, Singapore and Sweden presented working
papers on different aspects of copyright at the seminar, attended
by about 30 copyright experts from Nepal as well as other Asia-
Pacific countries including Japan, Singapore, Bangladesh and
Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Impact of Rate Hike on Asia's Strong Growth Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The immediate defensive increase
in interest rates by central banks in Asia triggered by the U.S.
rate hike will inevitably slow the region's strong economic growth,
but the impact is limited, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) decided to
raise the saving deposit rate by 50 basic points in line with the
U.S. rate hike on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in many countries and regions in Asia, including
Hong Kong, New Zealand and the Philippines, have immediately
followed the U.S. Federal Reserve's move to increase their rates
to support their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that these rate hikes may put the brakes on
consumption and investment and eventually choke Asia's strong
economic growth recorded in the first few months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"But the impact is limited," HKAB Chairman Raymond Or Ching-fai
told a media briefing Friday. Hong Kong's economic performance in
the first quarter was very strong and the economy has already
reflected rising interest rates, Or explained.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark three-month interbank offered rate averaged seven
percent last week as against 6.5 percent the previous week, and
therefore the impact of the rate hike in the interbank market is
minimal, the HKAB chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's first quarter economic growth was faster than most
economists had expected and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation had no plans to adjust downward its forecast on the
gross domestic product (GDP), Or said.
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates would also inflict little harm on small
and medium-sized enterprises (SME) as they are very conscious
about reducing their operating costs and try to reduce bank loans
to the lowest level, Or added.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter economist Andy Xie who had forecast
5.7 percent GDP growth for Hong Kong this year followed by four
percent next year stuck to his view. With China trade driving the
Hong Kong economy, the rate hike may not have such a big effect,
Xie said.
</P>
<P>
However, Xie cautioned that since 40 percent of the mainland's
exports went to the U.S., any further rate increases and a sharp
fall in the U.S. consumer demand would feed into slower economic
growth on the mainland and in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Denise Yam, also economist with Morgan Stanley, explained that
the rate hike would not slow Hong Kong's economic growth, since
Hong Kong's main source of income is exports and about 20 percent
of the growth would be value-added, which would contribute about
two to three percent to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also warned that as Hong Kong's consumers count
property as their biggest asset, the rate increases are likely to
aggravate an already weak property market.
</P>
<P>
But Dao Heng Securities believed that excess bank liquidity was
keeping borrowing costs low, offsetting the impact of rising
interest rates on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition in the housing market had led to lower
mortgage payments while higher rates had only caused a mild
adjustment in property prices, instead of a sharper correction,
the brokerage house said. All this meant the adverse multiplier
effect of higher interest rates on the local economy had weakened,
it said.
</P>
<P>
There is a concern that the U.S. economy will slow down after
successive rate hikes and it will definitely affect Hong Kong and
Asia. Analysts here believed that the U.S. Federal Reserve would
likely make another hike of 50 basic points in August.
</P>
<P>
"But this would not happen this year," Yam concluded. "The
earliest time we will see a slowdown in the U.S. economy is early
next year and its impact on Asia will come even later."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Interior Minister Visits Egypt to Cement Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Interior Minister Saadettin
Tantan left for Egypt Saturday for a three-day official visit to
boost bilateral cooperation against organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Interior Ministry said in a statement issued Friday
that Turkey and Egypt signed an "Agreement For Cooperation in
Struggle Against Illicit Drug Trafficking" on March 26, 1978.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that six commission meetings were held
pending February 4, 1994 in accordance with Article 11 of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Tantan's visit to Egypt is aimed at restarting the commission
meetings, said the statement. His contacts with Egyptian officials
are expected to focus on putting into practice the "Cooperation in
Struggle Against Crimes Agreement" which was signed by Turkey and
Egypt on July 26, 1999, and "Cooperation in Struggle Against
Organized Crimes, Terrorism, Illicit Drug Trafficking, Weapon and
Historical Works Smuggling and Security Agreement."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that issues of what it called Egyptian
officials' negative attitude towards Turkish citizens in airports
in Egypt, and Turkish convicts in Egyptian prisons who need urgent
medical treatment, are also expected to be discussed during the
visit.

ANKARA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces killed three
Hezbollah rebels and injured another in an operation in the
country's southern Adana province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials told the Anatolia News Agency that anti-terrorism
teams had mounted a raid on a Hezbollah hide-out, killing and
injuring the terrorists after they refused to surrender and opened
fire on the security forces.
</P>
<P>
A police superintendent was wounded in the arm in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Security forces seized a Kalashnikov weapon, two handguns, a
number of bullets and illegal and banned documents in the hide-out.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Hezbollah, which has no connection with the Lebanese
Hezbollah organization fighting guerrilla war against Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon, was reportedly founded some 20 years
ago with the aim to overthrow the secular government and set up an
Islamic fundamentalist regime in the overwhelmingly Muslim-
populated Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Canberra Denies Military Operation Against Fiji Coup Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for Australian Defense
Minister John Moore Saturday night denied any knowledge of a
military operation against leaders of the attempted coup in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the news website fijilive site reported the Fiji coup
leader Giorge Speight asked journalists to leave the Fijian
Parliament House for their "own safety" and speculated about
military intervention Saturday night, including an attack from
elite troops of the Australian Defense Force (ADF).
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press reported that the spokesman
said Moore had no knowledge of what the coup leaders were talking
about in relation to ADF intervention.
</P>
<P>
The order for journalists to leave came after bullets had been
fired outside the site of the sieged parliamentary complex in the
evening. Later they found that a gun had been accidentally fired.
</P>
<P>
Speight Saturday night declared he was the only legal authority
in the land.
</P>
<P>
Family members of some of the hostages were allowed to bring
food and clothes to them.
</P>
<P>
The Fijian union movement Saturday announced that workers will
stage an indefinite nationwide strike to battle for the freedom of
their prime minister. Earlier in the day, the military and police
forces announced their royalty to the elected government.
</P>
<P>
Fijian Journalists at Suva's parliament house reported through
the fijilive site that the hostage takers seemed to be losing
their cool and appeared very nervous.

<HEADLINE> Negotiator: Talks on Hostage Release to Start Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Formal talks between the Philippine
government and the Abu Sayyaf extremists over the release of 21
hostages would start Tuesday, chief government negotiator Robert
Aventajado said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado was quoted by the Philippine News Agency as
reporting that he and former Libyan Ambassador Abdurajak Azzarouq,
and Farouk Hussein, member of the government panel, went earlier
in the day to the hinterlands of Patikul town, Jolo Islan, where
the 21 hostages are being kept by the Abu Sayyaf terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"We sat and mingled with the hostages and the Abu Sayyafs and
talked about the arrangement of the meeting; to include the venue,
demands and other issues," Azzarouq said.
</P>
<P>
However, the negotiators said they will not reveal the rebels'
main demands until a written document by the rebels shall be
submitted to them.
</P>
<P>
"It is too premature to divulge their demands," Azzarouq said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators said the hostages are in "good shape" and were
able to talk to their respective families about their condition
through a satellite phone provided for them.
</P>
<P>
Hussein was quoted as saying that they were able to talk to the
hostages and Abu Sayyafs for about six hours earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"It was a serious negotiation in a relax but serious atmosphere.
The Abu Sayyaf terrorists would soon answer our queries," Hussein
said.
</P>
<P>
Azzarouq said the hostages were no longer sleeping in the
jungle but in houses of the Abu Sayyaf commanders.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf rebels abducted the 21 hostages, 19 of them
foreigners, from a Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and brought
them to Jolo, Sulu Province.

BERLIN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Briton David Coulthard on Saturday
won the pole position for Sunday's European Grand Prix after
outpacing everyone in a rain-hit opening qualifying session in
Nurburgring.
</P>
<P>
This was the first starting position in two years for the
McLaren driver and the ninth in his career.
</P>
<P>
The Scot, in his Mercedes-Benz-powered car, wound up one-tenth

Schumacher in a Ferrari after a mid-session rainstorm curtailed
the action, leaving everyone to make a vain effort to overturn
Coulthard's best time in the final 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard's McLaren team mate Finn Mika Hakkinen, the defending
world champion, was third fastest ahead of Brazilian Rubens
Barrichello in the second Ferrari with Ralf Schumacher fifth in a
Williams and Italian Jarno Trulli sixth for Jordan.

<HEADLINE> China's Red Tide Situation Worsening: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanic experts said here
today that the red tide phenomenon in the country's sea areas is
worsening.
</P>
<P>
They said the Donghai (East China Sea) Branch under the State
Oceanic Administration found large areas of red tide near the
mouth of the Yangtze River and in the East China Sea area earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The branch has sent warnings to concerned departments in the
coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian, Shanghai
Municipality, as well as the coastal cities of Ningbo and Zhoushan.
</P>
<P>
The Donghai Branch first discovered more than 200 square
kilometers of red tide in the East China Sea on May 3.
</P>
<P>
On May 18, the branch discovered a 4,560-square-kilometer red
tide belt near the Zhongjieshan Islands belonging to the Zhoushan
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
According to the Donghai Monitoring Center, this red tide is
two to six meters thick and mainly contains primary dinoflagellate
and dinoflagellate, both heavily poisonous.
</P>
<P>
Oceanic experts said that the red tide is likely to expand if
current oceanic and climatic patterns persist.
</P>
<P>
They also warned of the great harm the red tide may bring to
the maritime ecological environment and to the life and health of
people leaving near the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Donghai Branch is continuing to monitor the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a group of Chinese oceanic experts have
called on concerned departments to develop a research program on
the red tide, focusing on the development of technologies for
analyzing poisonous elements, as well as aerospace and remote-
sensing technologies to monitor the red tide.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leader Lacks Sincerity: Statement (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has already pointed out in his eight-
point proposition that as the first step, the two sides can first
hold talks and reach an agreement on ending the hostile situation
across the Straits under the One-China principle.
</P>
<P>
"At present, so long as the Taiwan authorities make a clear
commitment that it will not accept the 'two-states remarks,' and
that it will adhere to the consensus reached between the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and
Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation in 1992 that the two sides
will express in their own way that 'the two sides of the Straits
both adhere to the One-China principle,' we would like to
authorize the ARATS to contact and hold dialogues with
organizations or persons authorized by the Taiwan side," the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
The statement stresses that Taiwan's new leader should consider
the situation and conform to the historical trend of the times.
It also urges Taiwan's new leader to abandon his separatist
proposition and take the bright road that leads to the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The statement points out that this is the only way to realize
peaceful and stable development and improve relations across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
It also stresses that the Taiwan issue can not be dragged on
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
The statement concludes that all attempts to split the
motherland and all efforts for "Taiwan independence" are doomed to
failure, and are absolutely refuted by all the Chinese people,
including Taiwan compatriots.

<HEADLINE> Interview: China to Build Up Strength for Long-Term High Growth By Li Nuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has shown rebound
since the beginning of the year 2000, and the strength for a long-
time high growth is going to be built up in the coming years, a
senior economist said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The current strong economic recovery in Asia will bring up a
new period of high rise in China's exports, Zhang Yunling,
director of the APEC Policy Research Center under the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told Xinhua in an exclusive
interview.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was here attending the Asian Vision 21 Conference, which
was held by the Harvard University Asia Center in Hong Kong from
May 18 to 20.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to restructuring policies taken by the Chinese central
government in the past two years to stimulate demand and curb
deflation, the country's economic efficiency has been improved
with a sharp increase in profit and decline in loss in the first
quarter this year, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
For the future vision, he said that the high growth of the
sectors relating to New Economy, China's future accession into the
World Trade Organization, fast urbanization and new effort in
developing the country's western parts are all built-in positive
factors for China's future economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of China's gross domestic product (GDP) has
been downward since the central government introduced a
continuously tightened policy aiming at controlling inflation in
1993, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the slowdown to a long-lasted, tightened policy
to control inflation, long-time over production rooted in the
structural problems, and weakness in domestic demand caused by
urban reforms and income decline in rural areas, as well as
impacts of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, also director of the Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies
of the CASS, stressed the important role of China in the future
development of Asia's economy. "China has shown its strong
interest in participating in regional cooperation though it still
has reservations in real institutional establishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the share of foreign trade in GDP as high as 40 percent,
China has become more and more integrated into the world market,
Zhang said, adding that the real progress is expected in trade and
investment liberalization, monetary cooperation, as well as
cooperation in energy, environment, human resources and e-commerce.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Better International Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Vice President John Evans
Atta Mills has called on the international community to address
the frustrations of developing countries over unfair international
trade conditions, saying it was time the world listened to the
concerns of developing nations and helped them to develop.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the visiting Deputy Thai Premier, Supachai
Panitchpakdi, in the capital Accra on Friday, Mills said the
global economic order, as it is now, only benefits a section of
the world particularly industrialized countries at the expense of
developing nations, whose difficulties continue to deepen,
reported the Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We have a situation where we are running but we are not
getting far. We do not have control over the price of our
commodities, there is continuing unemployment, and yet we are not
expected to react," said Mills.
</P>
<P>
Panitchpakdi, who is also Director-General in-waiting of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), said developing nations including
Ghana have suffered for too long and must now be given the
deserved attention.
</P>
<P>
Panitchpakdi arrived in Ghana on Thursday as the head of a
nine-member delegation to, among others, express appreciation for
Ghana's support for his successful bid for the position. He will
take over as head of WTO in two years.
</P>
<P>
What is more frustrating, said Panitchpakdi, "is that after
creating barriers to frustrate developing nations leading to
non-performance, the industrialized countries turn round to blame
the people for mismanagement of resources. This is not fair."
</P>
<P>
Mills said he expected that developing countries would be given
a better deal, though the progress would not be made overnight
without sacrifices.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Kieren Perkins qualified for his
third Olympic Games after he finished second in the 1,500 meters
freestyle final at the Australian national championships in Sydney
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Perkins' time of 15 minutes 01.14 seconds was well outside his
world record of 14:41.66 set at the 1994 Commonwealth Games but
still enough to seal a place in the Australian team for the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The reigning world champion won the 1,500 at Barcelona and
Atlanta to secure his place in history as one of the sport's
finest long-distance swimmers.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leader Lacks Sincerity: Statement (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At present, compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits,
overseas Chinese, and the international community, all hope that
cross-Straits relations be developed peacefully and steadily, the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the basic policies of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems," and the eight-point
proposition made by President Jiang Zemin, "we strive most
sincerely for peaceful reunification, and we are determined and
fully prepared to stop all activities involving 'Taiwan
independence' and separation of the motherland," it says.
</P>
<P>
The statement says the mainland will continue to vigorously
enhance cross-Straits economic cooperation, personnel exchanges,
and exchanges in various fields, as well as promote the
realization of direct exchanges of mail service, trade, and air
and shipping service between the two sides in the manner of "one
China, across-Straits negotiations."
</P>
<P>
It says all of Taiwan's parties, social institutions, and
people of all walks of life are welcome to come to the mainland to
exchange views and promote common understanding in the fight
against "Taiwan independence," and for the development of cross-
Straits relations and promotion of the peaceful reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterates that dialogues, negotiations, and high-
level visits between the two sides be conducted on the basis of
the One-China principle, and that under this principle, all issues
can be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leader Lacks Sincerity: Statement (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement says that all the facts and legal evidence proves
that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1895, Japan occupied Taiwan through an aggressive war
against China. In 1943, the Cairo Declaration proclaimed that all
the Japanese-occupied territories including Taiwan should be
returned to China. The statement was latter reiterated in the
Potsdam Proclamation. In 1945, the Chinese government took back
Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and resumed the exercise of
sovereignty there after winning the War of Resistance against
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's status as part of China has never changed under any
circumstances, and is widely admitted by the international
community, where the One-China policy is upheld.
</P>
<P>
China will not change this firm stance, the statement stresses.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the One-China principle also can be found in the
Taiwan authorities' provisions and documents, and is not imposed
unilaterally by the mainland.  For a long period of time,
adherence to the One-China principle has been the stance of both
sides of the Straits, and the basis for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The statement says the mainland has clearly told the Taiwan
authorities that in dealing with cross-Straits affairs before
reunification, especially during negotiations by the two sides,
the One-China principle must be adhered to. That is, there is but
one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China, and China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity can not be divided.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should negotiate and discuss reunification on
this basis in an equal manner, it says.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leader Lacks Sincerity: Statement (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement points out that some people in Taiwan are still
stubbornly sticking to the stance that "Taiwan is a sovereignty
independent country" and attempting to separate Taiwan from China,
which is the serious crime of splitting the motherland and harming
the people, and will inevitably damage Taiwan's social stability
and economic development, cause conflicts between compatriots
across the Straits, jeopardize the peace in the Taiwan Straits and
the Pacific-Asian region, and impair the fundamental interests of
the Chinese people, including the people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It says that if anyone dare trigger a civil war again by
splitting Taiwan from China, they must shoulder the historical
responsibility for this sin.
</P>
<P>
Compatriots across the Straits have the same ancestral links,
and have shared weal and woe, the statement says. The Communist
Party of China thus fully respects the Taiwan compatriots'
lifestyle and their wish to become the master of the island and to
manage their own affairs, and will try its best to protect all of
their legitimate rights. The fight against Taiwan splittists is
not a competition for carrying out democracy or which system to
adopt, but rather is a fight for either reunification or
separation.
</P>
<P>
The statement calls on the people across the Straits to unite
in opposition to "Taiwan Independence," and to realize the
reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leader Lacks Sincerity: Statement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The "goodwill reconciliation"
mentioned by the new leader of the Taiwan authorities in his
speech delivered today falls short of sincerity, says an official
statement released here.
</P>
<P>
The statement on authorization, issued jointly by the Taiwan
Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,
notes that the new leader has mentioned that he will not declare "
Taiwan Independence," nor push for "the constituionalization of
the two-states remarks," nor "a referendum on reunification vs.
independence," and that the abolition of the "National
Reunification Council" or the "National Reunification Guidelines"
will not be an issue.
</P>
<P>
However, on the key issue of accepting the One-China principle,
the new leader adopted an evasive and ambiguous attitude, the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, his 'goodwill reconciliation' lacks sincerity," the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
The One-China principle is the basis for the peaceful, steady
development of cross-Straits relations, the statement says. "Since
the new leader of the Taiwan authorities said that he would not go
in for 'Taiwan independence,' he should not have attached any
condition. Still less should he have refuted the reality that
there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China by saying one
China is something in the 'future.'"
</P>
<P>
Acceptance or rejection of the One-China principle is the
touchstone testing whether the Taiwan leader will safeguard
national sovereignty and territorial integrity or continue to
stubbornly pursue the separatist policy of "Taiwan independence,"
the statement says.

BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here this afternoon with Japanese Transport Minister Toshihiro
Nikai and President of the Japan-China Friendship Association
Hirayama Ikuo.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
were among those at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two Japanese guests, along with some 5,000 other Japanese
visitors, are here to attend activities related to cultural and
tourist exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nikai said that he was honored to be part of a Japanese
delegation visiting China, and to have this opportunity to share
ideas with Chinese leaders on promoting friendship and expanding
the vision of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to President Jiang's 1998 state visit to Japan and
former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's China visit last

smoothly since the normalization of relations in 1972, and these
two visits laid solid foundation for the development of Sino-
Japanese relations in the 21st century.

Jiang emphasized that Sino-Japanese friendship is basically the
friendship between the two peoples. While the two countries were
achieving the normalization of diplomatic ties, and in the
following years of the development of bilateral relations,
unofficial exchanges between the two countries continued to play
an important role in promoting this relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is pleased to see that by adapting to the
new situation and changes in recent years, these unofficial
friendly exchanges have been promoted in diversified forms, and
have scored positive achievements.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the future, Jiang said the development of
Sino-Japanese friendship relies on the people of the two countries,
especially the youth."We should not only maintain our traditional
friendship, but also further friendly exchanges between our youth
so as to foster successors for the cause of Sino-Japanese
friendship."

Extending his welcome to the delegation, Jiang said that this
China visit is unprecedented in the history of exchanges between
the people of the two countries in terms of number and scope,
reflecting the Japanese government's positive attitude toward
developing Sino-Japanese friendly ties, and the Japanese people's
enthusiasm about devoting themselves to the cause of Sino-Japanese

<P>
He said he believes that the visit will play an important role

Jiang said that China and Japan are neighbors linked by a strip
of waters, the people of the two countries have more than 2,000
years of friendly exchanges, and their respective cultures have a
long history.
</P>
<P>
Despite an unfortunate period in bilateral relations, good-
neighborliness between the two countries has predominated, Jiang
said. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the late Chairman Mao Zedong and late Premier Zhou Enlai, Comrade
Deng Xiaoping, as well as the current Chinese leadership paid, and
is paying, much attention to maintaining and developing Sino-
Japanese friendship and cooperation as well as promoting people-to-
people exchanges between the two countries, Jiang added.

TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The ground forces of Iran's army
launched maneuvers near the southern city of Shiraz Saturday
morning,the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The five-day maneuvers, code-named Misaq Ba Velayat' (Allegiance
to the Leader), was staged to mark the recovery of Khorramshahr in
the southwestern Khuzestan province during the 1980-88 war against
Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Units from the airborne brigade 55 and armored brigade 37 of
Shiraz as well as the artillery and army air support of the central

<HEADLINE> Iran's Guardians Council Approves Tehran Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Guardians Council
on Saturday approved the eligibility of 28 candidates out of the 30
elected in the February parliamentary elections in Tehran
constituency.
</P>
<P>
The council endorsed the election result after supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Thursday ordered to do it to prevent
possible political unrest in the country.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two seats would be determined in a runoff after
the new reformist-dominant Majlis (parliament) officially starts
its work on May 27, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The council, the country's top election watchdog, made some
changes to the final list, thus promoted former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani to 20th on the list from the previous 30th and Gholamali
Hodad Adel to 28th from the previous 33rd.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 26 winners remained unchanged in the hands of the
reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami despite of some
changes of their places on the list.
</P>
<P>
The previous result showed that the reformists had won 29 out of
the total 30 seats in Tehran constituency, but the Guardians
Council delayed the confirmation and ordered three recounts of
parts of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
Council Secretary Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati claimed on Thursday
that the council could not endorse the election result in Tehran
constituency for allegations of serious discrepancies after
recounting the polls in 868 out of the total 3,000 boxes.
</P>
<P>
In response to the claim, Khamenei ordered the council to
confirm the final result by nullifying the polls of boxes it
considered invalid for any reason.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's order removed the final obstacle for reformists to
take over the powerful Majlis from the conservatives, who suffered
a humiliating defeat in the February parliamentary elections and
runoffs on May 5.
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to accept the reformists' landslide victory in the
parliamentary elections, the conservative Guardians Council had
nullified the results of 12 constituencies, depriving nine
reformists of entering the 290-seat Majlis.
</P>
<P>
In order to choke the cry of reformers, the conservative-
dominated judiciary also ordered a wholesale closure of 17
reformist newspapers and journals, which played an important role
in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The reformists tolerated the conservatives' intensified
crackdown and urged the people to keep calm to take over the Majlis
on time in order to push forward Khatami's reform programs.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says Malaysian Envoy Did Not Talk With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that Malaysian Ambassador Mohamad Arshad Monzoor Hussain
was authorized to go on a humanitarian mission for the 21 hostages
held by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo, but did not negotiate for their
release.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said
there is thus no reason for Manila to file a diplomatic protest
against Kuala Lumpur for Hussain's gesture.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said earlier that Malaysia has already started
direct talks with the rebels for the release of the hostages and
its envoy to Manila met the Abu Sayyaf Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This was a humanitarian mission on the part of the ambassador.
There is no reason for the parties to feel that there's a breach
of diplomatic protocol," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Secretary Robert Aventajado, chairman of the
presidential committee on flagship projects, stays as the chief
government negotiator for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hussain's mission, he stressed, had no effect on the
negotiation as the Abu Sayyaf has yet to present its demands to
the government.
</P>
<P>
"This is for humanitarian purposes. It will not affect the
negotiations one way or the other," he said. "There was no damage
in terms of the negotiation process itself."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Malaysian ambassador did not get clearance
from the Philippine government to negotiate for the release of the
hostages, and neither did he ask such authority.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora reiterated the
government policy of discouraging foreign embassies from holding
separate negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf bandits now holding 21
hostages, 19 of them foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the ambassador succeeded in the first part of his
mission, which was to let the Abu Sayyaf allow a Red Crescent
medical team to attend to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine government negotiators and a Libyan envoy
have reportedly met Abu Sayyaf rebels and visited hostages, but
formal talks over the freedom of the hostages have not started yet.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Nigeria to Play Greater Role in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- France called on Nigeria Saturday to
play a greater role in making peace in neighboring Sierra Leone,
which has been plunged in chaos since the failure of the United
Nations peacekeeping mission there.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in a radio
interview that Nigeria, which is the most powerful government in
the region and has a democratically elected president should
assume more responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He said that Western countries "cannot send troops to all
corners of Africa to re-establish order."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said that more African countries
should participate in the process of restoring order in Sierra
Leone, because the conflict there, which is caused by a fight for
control of diamond production, is spilling over the country's
border.

<HEADLINE> Gong Steer China to Uber Cup Reigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Gong Zhichao put the final
beyond doubts with a straight-set win over world champion Camilla
Martin to steer the overwhelming defending champions China to
reign the Uber Cup trophy following a 3-0 thrash of Denmark on
Saturday here at the Putra Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The final game served only for the Chinese to stamp their
domination in the world women's badminton as China kept an
unbeaten record by winning 21 games straightly and surrendered
just one set in the competition.
</P>
<P>
China initiated a campaign to revitalize their record five-
consecutive-time victory of the Uber Cup from 1984-1992 as no
challengers to their dominance are expected in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"China will keep their domination in 10 years time," said
Danish coach Kenneth Larsen. "They are at the higher level than
the others. We'll go back to find the way to get closer to them."
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Li Yongbo said, "We'd like to be in the driving
seat as long as possible, but we'll be well prepared every time."
</P>
<P>
Fully awarded the title is untouchable before the final,
Denmark could not be more happy if Martin could steal a point from
Gong, winner of the All-England and Japan Open this year, on the
first singles.
</P>
<P>
Several minutes into the first game, however, Camilla, the
world champion and world No.1 player, found herself stumble on
Gong's lobs and all she could do in the remaining game was to
catch up Gong's pace.
</P>
<P>
Gong, the best defensive shuttler in the world, was never in a
hurry to smash Camilla away, keeping her opponent running around
for her 11-9, 11-6 victory. Camilla, who beat Gong only one time
at the Copenhagen Masters final in December 1997, when she won 12-
11, 12-10, was succumbed to find her attacking power before she
struck the shuttle to the net twice to lose the first set, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
The second set was more lop-sided and Gong extended her record
against Camilla to 4-1 following the win. World No.1 pair Ge Fei
and Gu Jun were unbeatable for Helene Kirkegaard and Rikke Olsen,
who lost every time in their previous 12 meetings, all in straight
sets, and it was the case again in Saturday's 13th tie.
</P>
<P>
Kirkegaar/Olsen showed no sign to upturn the winless streak as
the Danes lost 15-2, 15-9. Dai Yun, finalist of the world champion
last May by beating Mette Sorensen 2-0, succumbed Sorensen for the
third time to give the victory to China, 11-8, 11-1.
</P>
<P>
Dai wrapped up the one-sided tie with a elegant lob near the
net after Pedersen stretched out for a save but failed to touch
the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are technical better than us. There are lots of
things we could learn from them," said Larsen. But the Danes were
not too upset with their loss as both the men's and women's teams
stormed into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't expect to make the final in the Uber Cup. It's a
big success for the Danish badminton."

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Land Policy Unchanged: Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Agriculture, Food and
Fisheries Minister Suresh Desai has assured all white farmers
living in Zambia not to panic about land, saying Zambia's land
policy is unchanged, government-run newspaper Zambia Daily Mail
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Desai as saying in an interview here on Friday that
there is no need for panic and problems in Zimbabwe will not
spill over.
</P>
<P>
Desai made the assurance when he addressed white farmers saying
the country has abundant land to accommodate all sectors of
farms.
</P>
<P>
He said the events taking place in Zimbabwe were historical and
very different from Zambia, where farmers are provided with title
deeds for land they are offered.
</P>
<P>
He further said that everyone has equal opportunity to land,
the Zambian government has empowered chiefs with land and has
asked the Lands Ministry to liaise before it offers land to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
Desai revealed that to ensure ownership, the Lands Ministry was
 demarcating more land and inviting people to apply for it.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has in the last three months experienced violent
confrontation between landless black people and white farmers.
</P>
<P>
A number of deaths have been recorded in the attacks in which
blacks have claimed land from whites.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pledges to Send More Peacekeeping Troops to S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has confirmed his willingness to dispatch additional troops to
help restore peace and resume the process of disarmament,
demobilization and re- integration in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the assurance during his discussion with the
visiting Jesse Jackson, US President Bill Clinton's special envoy
for Africa, reported a leading Nigerian newspaper, The Guardian,
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was also considering to send a special envoy to his
Liberian counterpart Charles Taylor and his Burkina Faso
counterpart Blaise Compaore on the restoration of peace to that
war-torn country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference Friday in Lagos, Jackson called
on the international community to be more supportive of Nigeria in
its efforts to restore peace to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to respond faster to
ensure that democracy was not threatened in the sub-region.
"Nigeria must be supported as it carries out this mission for the
region".
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) should be held
accountable for their actions, he said, adding that the RUF rebels
chose " to step away" from the policy of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that the United States would help Obasanjo in
his efforts to keep the peace forward in Sierra Leone, noting both
Nigeria and the U.S. were in "broad agreement on the principles
that will guide our efforts as we move ahead in the days to come".
</P>
<P>
He further expressed delight at Obasanjo's commitment to
continue working with Taylor in order to secure the release of the
remaining United Nations hostages held by RUF.

NICOSIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has made new representations
to Israel over the violation of the Nicosia Flight Information
Region (FIR) by Israeli military aircraft, local media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Cyprus has asked Israel to explain why
its military aircraft violated Cyprus airspace on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time this month that Cyprus has sought an
explanation from Israel after its planes entered the Nicosia FIR.
</P>
<P>
The Nicosia FIR covers a wide area around Cyprus and aircraft
entering it should inform the authorities beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that on Wednesday around 110 flights of Israeli
fighters were recorded inside the FIR without submitting flight
plan.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou was quoted as saying
that the Cyprus government has been communicated to the Israeli
government but "no explanation has been given so far."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Israeli government had not yet replied to
similar complaints made on May 8, also cover violations of the
Nicosia FIR by Israeli fighters.
</P>
<P>
"We have reminded the Israeli government that we are waiting for
this reply," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that Israeli jets heading to Lebanon on
military missions sometimes entered the FIR and on those occasions

<HEADLINE> About 400 Zambian Peacekeepers Released in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
rebels in Sierra Leone have set free about 280 more Zambian
soldiers bringing the total number of freed Zambians to 400,
Zambian Defence Minister Chitalu Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
Sampa said on Friday that the soldiers were now being kept at
safe places in Liberia before they could be flown to Freetown in
Sierra Leone to continue with their peacekeeping mission, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I want to confirm that more troops have been released and the
total number has come to 400. The number could be slightly higher
but we are yet to confirm the actual figure although 400 have been
released," the minister was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sampa disclosed that the Zambian government would still send a
team of experts to Sierra Leone despite the latest development.
Final details were being worked out for the team to fly out.
</P>
<P>
"The situation now looks quiet. Our released troops are safe
and we expected the rest to be released soon," Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Liberian leader Charles Taylor for his instrumental
role in ensuring the soldiers were freed.
</P>
<P>
About 434 Zambian soldiers were two weeks ago taken captive by
Foday Sankoh's RUF rebels, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Initially 79 soldiers were released and another 40 set free a
few days later.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Join World AIDS Vaccine Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan scientists will participate
in a new international project to develop an inexpensive oral
AIDS vaccine for Africa, the New Vision reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Friday by scientists in the U.S.-based
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), which is funding
the research.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the U.S. Institute of Human Virology (IHV),
founded by one of the scientists who discovered HIV, are to work
with researchers from Uganda to design the vaccine, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
IAVI President Seth Berkley said Ugandan scientists would go to
the IHV and work on the vaccine from the beginning, and help
design clinical trials in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He said the vaccine, expected to cost less than a dollar per
dose, would be ready for testing in people late next year.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, based on the type of HIV found in east Africa, is
already being tested in its injectable from. But the scientists
wanted to make the oral form, which they say would be cheaper.

The deal paved the way for China's accession to the WTO, which

<HEADLINE> Mia to Represent Netherlands at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian singles star
Mia Audina would be eligible to represent the Netherlands at the
Sydney Games in September, according to the International
Badminton Federation (IBF) confirmed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The IBF said that they had received notification from the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow the 20 year-old to
play for the Netherlands, where she has lived in less than tow
years.
</P>
<P>
Audina, winner of a silver medal at the Atlanta Games when she
was only 16, moved to the Netherlands last June to join her
husband, Tylio Lobman, a Dutch gospel singer of Indonesian descent
whom she met in a church in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a troubled period in Audina's life when she
was out of the game for several months to nurse her ailing mother
who died last April after a long illness. Then in July last year
the Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI) announced that Mia had
been removed from the national squad.
</P>
<P>
After sitting out a residency and qualification period in the
Netherlands, Audina bounced back to win the Dutch Open title last
October. The 20-year-old, is currently ranked world No.7 and
proved she was back to her old self earlier this year when she
beat world champion Camilla Martin of Denmark on her way to
winning Chinese Taipei Open in January.
</P>
<P>
Martijn van Dooremalen, team manager for the Netherlands said,
"Of course we are delighted that the IOC have made this decision
and that Mia will be representing the Netherlands. There were no
objections from Indonesia and they should be very proud that Mia
will be playing in the Olympics. She is an Indonesian after all."

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Principle for Cross-Straits Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland would like to
empower a concerned organization to contact or hold dialogues with
organizations or persons entrusted by the Taiwan side so long as
the Taiwan authorities clearly state that they will not advocate
the "two states theory" and commit themselves to adhering to the "
one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a statement on the current cross-Straits
relations issued here today by the Taiwan Work Office of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs
Office under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "At present, we would like to authorize the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to
contact or hold dialogues with organizations or persons entrusted
by the Taiwan authorities, provided that the Taiwan authorities
make a clear-cut commitment that they will not advocate the 'two
states theory' and that they will adhere to the consensus reached
between the ARATS and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation in 1992
that the two sides will express in their own way orally that 'both
sides across the Straits stick to the "one China" principle'."
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated that high-level visits between the two
sides will be realized on the basis of the "one China" principle,
and that on this principle, all issues can be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan New Leader Lacks Sincerity:Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The "goodwill reconciliation"
mentioned by the new leader of the Taiwan authorities in his
speech delivered today is short of sincerity, says an official
statement released here.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued on authorization jointly by the Taiwan
Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,
points out that on the key issue of accepting the one China
principle, the new leader adopted an evasive and ambiguous
attitude.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, his 'goodwill reconciliation' lacks sincerity," the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
The one China principle is the basis for peaceful, steady
development of across-strait relations, the statement notes. "
Since the new leader of the Taiwan authorities expressed that he
would not go in for 'Taiwan independence', he should have attached
no condition to it. Still less should he have refuted the reality
that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China by saying
one China is something in 'future'."
</P>
<P>
To accept the one China principle or not is the touchstone to
test whether the Taiwan leader will safeguard national sovereignty
and territorial integrity or continue to stubbornly pursue the
separatist policy of "Taiwan independence", the statement says.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kampala disengagement plan for
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) conflict which came
into effect on April 14 is holding, Joint Military Commission
(JMC) acting chairman Timothy Kazembe has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Kazembe said here on Friday when he officially received 10
vehicles and communication equipment worth about 350,000 U.S.
dollars donated to the JMC by the Canadian government, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The disengagement process is already holding very well,"
Kazembe was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said there was need for both the JMC and the
United Nations peacekeeping mission to the DRC to be on the ground
to ensure compliance to the Kampala disengagement plan by all
concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Kazembe said the implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement signed last July had started on a slow note due to the
lack of necessary resources needed by the JMC like aircraft, motor
vehicles, boats, communications equipment and funds.
</P>
<P>
"These vehicles and radios will enhance the capacity of the JMC
and enable us to accomplish our mammoth task entrusted to us,"
Kazembe said.

LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Cherie Blair, the 45-year-old wife
of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, gave birth to a baby boy
early Saturday at central London's Chelsea and Westminster
hospital, the Downing Street said.
</P>
<P>
The baby is the first born to a serving British prime minister
in 152 years. The couple already have two sons -- Euan, 16, and
Nicky, 14 -- and a daughter, Kathryn, 12.
</P>
<P>
"Both mother and baby are doing well. The Prime Minister and
Mrs Prime Minister are delighted. The Prime Minister, Mrs Blair
and the baby returned to Downing Street soon after the birth,"
said a Downing Street spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The speed of Mrs Blair's return home has led to suggestions she
had a natural birth and not the caesarean delivery many people had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The weight of the baby and the exact time of his arrival are
still unknown and Downing Street has said they would not be
releasing any further details at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Blair was admitted to the hospital at lunchtime Friday --
five days before her due date of May 24.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has said he will not be taking parental
leave but intends to scale back his official workload.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Maintains Upward Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade rose
markedly in April, supported by sustained strong demand from Asian
economies and healthy global demand for certain electronic
products, according to figures released by the Trade Development
Board Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same month last year, Singapore's external
trade in April expanded by 20.9 percent to hit 35.06 billion
Singapore dollars (20.38 billion U.S. dollars), following a robust
23.8-percent growth in March.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports in the month went up by 11.9 percent
to 8.3 billion Singapore dollars (4.83 billion U.S. dollars) ,
reflecting strong growth in integrated circuits, telecommunication
equipment and non-electronics.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil re-export expanded further by a strong 25.7 percent to
7.6 billion Singapore dollars (4.42 billion U.S. dollars) and non-
oil imports continued to grow by 19.1 percent to 15.4 billion
Singapore dollars (8.95 billion U.S. dollars )in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
Also in the month, domestic export of electronics products
increased by 7.9 percent, largely due to healthy global demand for
key electronic products, while that of non-electronics expanded by
19.9 percent, boosted mainly by sustained demand from the region
for electrical circuit apparatus and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to the United States, Malaysia, Japan
and China's Hong Kong continued to increase in April 2000 while
those to the EU market remained weak.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to Hong Kong registered a strong
growth of 36.7 percent in April while those to Malaysia, Japan and
the United States picked up by 21.3 percent, 28.4 percent and 2.5
percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Designates to Enlarge Reserved Forest Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- First Secretary of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt said
Friday that Myanmar will enlarge the country's reserved and
protected public forest areas.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt made the remarks here Friday when he delivered an
address at a forest coordination meeting, official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said 50 percent of the area of the nation is covered with
forests, of which 18.6 percent have been designated as reserved
and protected public forests, and arrangements are to be made to
increase them to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
He stated that a total of 30,375-hectare forest plantations
including 8,100-hectare teak plantations are established annually,
and the most effective and beneficial method is to be sought and
employed in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The forest plantations in the watershed areas are the largest
after the commercial forest plantations and account for 23 percent
of the total forest plantations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has used a sustainable forest management system for
development and sustainability of forests and the country is
endowed with biological and botanical diversity, he said, pointing
out that the Ministry of Forestry is to draw a plan for the
conservation of flora and fauna as a national heritage.
</P>
<P>
Timber has become Myanmar's second largest export after
agricultural products. Foreign exchange gained from timber export
accounts for about 20 percent of Myanmar's total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, Myanmar exported a total of 823,
000 cubic meters of timber including 350,000 cubic meters of teak,
in 1999, earning 216 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Too Good For Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Forty years have passed since
Denmark last played in a Uber Cup final but it doesn't seem very
likely that they will have much time to enjoy Saturday's encounter
with the overwhelming favourites and defending champions China.
</P>
<P>
It seems the only challenge the Danish team can pose to the
Chinese is keeping them on court as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are looking forward to win the Uber Cup," said Danish
coach Kenneth Larsen on Friday after Denmark lost 3-2 to Indonesia
in the semifinals of the Thomas Cup. Waiting until the
journalists around finished laughing, Larsen grinned and continued,
"Although it is almost impossible."
</P>
<P>
Even world champion Camilla Martin will start against Gong
Zhichao with the odds heavily stacked against her, if their past
meetings are any indication. Camilla's last triumph over Gong was
in 1997 when she won the Copenghagen Masters, but the record is 3-
1 in Gong's favour after the Chinese took an easy win in their
last face-off in the group stage of the World Grand Prix Finals.
</P>
<P>
Gong has this year's All-England and Japan Open titles to her
name while Camilla won the South Korea Open in January and their
rivalry could well be a preview of the Sydney Olympic final in
September.
</P>
<P>
"The first game against Gong Zhichao will be very difficult,
because she is a very good player and played very well in the past
few months. But I beat her before, I can do it again here," said
Camilla.
</P>
<P>
If Camilla is said to have a 50-50 chance, the same can't be
said about the rest. First doubles Helene Kirkeggard and Rikke
Olsen have not only been unable to beat Chinese pair Ge Fei and Gu
Jun in 12 meetings, but have also been unsuccessful in stealing a
game off.
</P>
<P>
Second singles Mette Sorensen will be facing an even more
uphill task against Dai Yun. Their two previous meetings have
been in the Chinese girl's favour and she should seal the Uber Cup
for China on the third rubber.
</P>
<P>
Only if Denmark, and their determination is unquestionable
despite the odds being in China, do steal a point in the earlier
matches, will the second doubles and third singles be played.
</P>
<P>
But Mette Schjoldager and Majken Vange and Mette Pedersen are
unlikely to be able to save Denmark against Huang Nanyan and Yang
Wei and two-time world champion Ye Zhaoying.
</P>
<P>
China's coach Li Yongbo said, "We'd expected to play Denmark in
the final match even before the start of the competition." "
Denmark now are better than Indonesia, so it's not surprise to
meet them in the championship game." Li said the Chinese women's
players would try their best to keep the perfect record in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
"The first singles between Gong Zhichao and Camilla Martin is
the most important, but we'll go all out for a best result."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai To Develop High-tech Textiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city Shanghai plans to launch 77 projects by working
with investors from home and abroad in a bid to bring the local
textile industry up to international standards.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the city's strategy to invigorate this
traditional industry which was once a key part of the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted local textile officials as saying
that the city's textile industry is now at a critical development
phase which calls for foreign advanced technology and funds.
</P>
<P>
These planned projects will focus on the development of high-
tech textiles, said Zhu Kuangyu, chairman of the Shanghai Textile
Holding (Group) Corporation.
</P>
<P>
After eight years of restructuring, the industry has laid off
380,000 employees who have found jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The projects will help speed up the city's textile industry to
become more competitive after China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Seven projects with a total investment of more than 36.28
million U.S. dollars have been signed with investors from Hong
Kong, Germany, Britain, Australia, France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, Shanghai has set up 267 foreign-funded
textile enterprises. Now only 169 of them are still in operation
due to industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign-funded textile enterprises account for 28
percent of the group's total sales, 22 percent of its total export
and 25 percent of its profits, Zhu added.

</P>
<P>
Speight Saturday also declared himself the country's interim
prime minister after being sworn in by a man described as the
interim president, Ratu Jope Seniloli.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in ceremony took place inside the besieged
parliament in front of the local media.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said he had
visited Speight five times since the crisis began and told him to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
"They have no choice. They have to surrender," said Rabuka, who
himself staged two military coups in 1987, but has become an
unofficial mediator in the present crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka, considered the most influential man in Fiji, said he
had also visited the hostages, including 21 members of the cabinet,
and saw more than 20 civilian conspirators armed with pistols and
assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
There are also six women among the hostages, he said.
</P>
<P>
News website fijilive.com reported that the situation at the
parliament house was becoming increasingly tense.
</P>
<P>
"A few minutes ago Speight pulled out Chaudhry from the MPs
held hostage and asked him to call the president and ask him to
call off any such proposed action," fijilive reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our reporter at the scene says the situation is getting really
tense with more armed men now in Parliament compared with the
seven who were there before. Speight says dialogue has reached a
level of stress," it said.
</P>
<P>
Speight told Fiji radio station FM96 that his men would resist
any form of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has now been surrounded by police and soldiers
and military reservists and on-leave soldiers have been called up.
</P>
<P>
Police commander Isikia Savua told a press conference that his
force will only accept instructions from President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara, who Friday night declared a state of emergency and
a curfew.
</P>
<P>
The acting commander of the Fiji Military Forces, Colonel
Alfred Tuatoka, said Mara remained commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
"We are still bound by the 1997 constitution ... Our actions
will always be within the law," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Speight, in one of a number of decrees issued overnight,
declared that the new military commander would be Colonel Vosa
Vatu, but Vatu, who also attended the press conference, declared
his support for the government.
</P>
<P>
Speight called a press conference for Saturday morning to
announce a new government and issue decrees, but the briefing did
not go ahead. Sources said it had been postponed until later
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka said the gunmen appeared "confused and uncertain" and
had even asked him what they should do next.
</P>
<P>
"They don't know what they're doing," he said, adding that he
was certain the crisis would be over by the end of the day.

<HEADLINE> Number of Genes Contained in Human Genome Estimated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. research organization,
in anticipation of the completion of sequencing the human genome,
said Friday that the results of two independent estimates indicate
that the human genome contains approximately 120,000 genes.
</P>
<P>
The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) said that results of
the study conducted by its researchers, which outlines the
analysis they used to reach the estimate, will be published in the
June 2000 issue of Nature Genetics, one of the journals of the
Nature family.
</P>
<P>
Since the first human DNA sequence became available, scientists
have been asking themselves just how many genes are required to
make a human.
</P>
<P>
Early estimates tallied around 60,000 to 70,000. The recent
flood of data has allowed more detailed analysis to be conducted
and speculation has grown that the genome either contains far
fewer or far more, ranging from 35,000 to 140,000, than originally
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
As sequencing of the human genome nears completion, discussion
and debate regarding the number of genes contained in the human
genome has escalated in the science community.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to avoid speculation, TIGR said, its scientists
developed a highly refined protocol enabling them to clean,
cluster and assemble expressed sequence tags (EST) sequences.
ESTs are single-pass partial sequences of complementary DNA (cDNA)
clones that have proven invaluable for gene discovery and mapping
in humans and other organisms.
</P>
<P>
Starting with the nearly 1.6 million ESTs and nearly 50,000
gene and gene fragment sequences in the public databases, TIGR
scientists have created a database containing nearly 75,000
consensus sequences for the transcripts represented by this data --
the Human Gene Index (HGI).
</P>
<P>
By comparing the sequences within HGI with those of known genes,
as well as with the recently completed sequence of human
chromosome 21, TIGR researchers were able to arrive at two
independent estimates of the number of genes encoded in the genome.

<HEADLINE> Shoot-on-Sight Order Issued in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A shoot-on-sight order was issued
by Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela, chief of Pattimura Military Command
overseeing Indonesia's Maluku Province, on Friday to stop
continued violence in the provincial capital of Ambon.
</P>
<P>
"The strict measure is needed because many civilians and
members of the security forces have fallen victim to snipers,"
Tamaela was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Violence continued in several parts of Ambon on Friday. A
sniper attack claimed the life of an army non-commissioned officer,
Pvt. Gempur Warsito.
</P>
<P>
Following sniper attacks, an operation to confiscate weapons
was jointly conducted by the military and police in several tall
buildings located in downtown Ambon, about 2,500 kilometers
northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The downtown streets of Ambon have been the battleground for
groups of Muslims and Christians since fighting first broke out on
Tuesday. As of Friday, the clashes have claimed at least 31 lives
and injured no less than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
Tamaela, who returned to Ambon from Jakarta by plane on
Thursday night, expressed regret over the renewed conflict and
blamed the worsening situation on security troops' lack of
firmness in dealing with rioters.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Tamaela met with President Abdurrahman Wahid for
talks on Ambon and emergency steps to handle the Laskar Jihad (
Jihad Force).
</P>
<P>
"There are strong indications that they (Laskar Jihad) are
involved, but I do not want to go into details because it may only
heat things up. We want to cope with the violence first," he said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2,000 members of Laskar Jihad have streamed into
Ambon since late last month.
</P>
<P>
Despite the group's claim that they would conduct humanitarian
activities in Ambon, the Jakarta Post said, local community and
religious leaders as well as Maluku residents have been unnerved
by their presence.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Use Legislation to Fight Smog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Environment Minister David
Anderson avowed to use legislation to fight smog on Friday in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to have public and voluntary component of any
system. But if it's necessary to regulate, we obviously must," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The government will do its best to reduce toxic microscopic
particles under the recently revised Canadian Environmental
Protection Act, he stressed. The tiny particles, believed to be
an outcome of vehicles and power plants, turn into smog when mixed
with heat, sunlight and gases, especially in the summer time.
</P>
<P>
Under the environmental pact which took effect on April 1, the
government can demand coal-fired power plants and heavy industries
to install better scrubbers to remove tiny particulate from their
smokestack emissions.
</P>
<P>
The companies are required to eliminate particulate within two
years, and those failing to meet the target may face a three-year
jail term and fines up to one million Canadian dollars (about 666,
900 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government will meet with auto manufacturers in Toronto
next week to begin setting emission targets, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to discuss a national strategy to control
particulate emissions with his provincial counterparts in Quebec
City early next month.
</P>
<P>
Urban smog is reported to kill almost 5,000 Canadians each year.
Health Canada and Environment Canada also conclude that there is a
correlation between high levels of particulate matter and diseases
and deaths.

BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Police in southwest China's Yunnan
province have arrested 3,500 suspected drug dealers over the first
four months of this year, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were linked to 2,700 cases of drug smuggling.
Nearly 1,000 kilograms of heroin and opium were seized.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 82 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine, or ice",
was grabbed in 57 cases.
</P>
<P>
The seizures were significantly more -- 127 percent and 79.4
percent, respectively -- when compared with the same period last

BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing City is helping educational
programs in western China through a five-year program, said
sources from the city's education committee.
</P>
<P>
The capital's colleges and universities will recruit more
students from the western areas in the next five years, said local

</P>
<P>
This English newspaper said that Beijing-based colleges and
universities will recruit an additional 100 students from Inner
Mongolia this year. They will study such specialties as
engineering, foreign languages, law and business management,
skills that are needed in this ethnic region.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, Beijing's higher learning institutions
will work with their counterparts in the west to undertake major

<HEADLINE> Huge Grape Tree Produces 1,000 Kilograms of Grapes Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A more than 200-year-old grape tree
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region produces
more than 1,000 kilograms of grapes annually.
</P>
<P>
The tree belongs to Ayimhan, who lives in Hanggui Town, Luopu
County in southern Xinjiang. Ayimhan said that the tree has fed
his family for five generations.
</P>
<P>
This grape tree covers an area of 266 square meters. Ayimhan
said that the tree has not been buried underground during winter
since 1943. People in Xinjiang often bury grape tree vines
underground to help such trees survive the severe winter, Ayimhan
explained.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural technicians have cut some branches from the
tree and cultivated new saplings which are also resistant to the
cold.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is known as the "land of fruits" in China. The region
boasts more than 50 varieties of grapes alone.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's military and police forces
Saturday declared their loyalty to the country's elected
government, Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Police commander Isikia Savua told a press conference that his
force will only accept instructions from President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara. "Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara is the sole legal authority
of Fiji in these trying times," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acting commander of the Fiji Military Forces,
Colonel Alfred Tuatoka, said Mara remained the commander in chief.
"We are still bound by the 1997 constitution ... Our actions will
always be within the law."
</P>
<P>
Men armed with pistols and automatic rifles Friday seized Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 45 other MPs and party officials at
the parliament building in Suva, capital of Fiji, and declared
that they had seized power.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry is the first ethnic Indian prime minister of the
country. Since taking office one year ago, he was resisted by the
majority indigenous Fijians. It was reported that many underground
groups have been working on ways to oust his government.
</P>
<P>
Australia, the regional big power, Friday condemned the coup
and referred it as a terrorist action.
</P>
<P>
The United States also denounced the hostage taking. A
statement from the U.S. Embassy in Suva said: "We urge the gunmen
inside who are holding the democratically elected leaders of Fiji
hostage, to release them unharmed, immediately."
</P>
<P>
"The consequences of any unconstitutional seizure of power
would be very substantial" the statement warned.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Osman Siddique held meetings Friday with
President Mara and former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who has
been negotiating with the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Coup leader George Speight, in one of a number of decrees
issued overnight, announced that Colonel Vosa Vatu would be the
new military commander.
</P>
<P>
But Vatu, who was also present at the press conference,
declared his support for the government.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and police were manning roadblocks around Suva
Saturday morning following Friday's rioting and looting, but they
appeared to be making no direct attempt to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian Broadcast Company ABC, Speight also
held a press conference Saturday morning and warned the
international community, the United States in particular, not to
intervene. He declared that he had dismissed Mara and would
appoint his own president.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday hailed the
trade deal between China and the European Union and again urged
the U.S. Congress to approve permanent normal trade relations (
PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said the Chinese-EU agreement "
highlights the importance of congressional passage of permanent
normal trade relations with China."
</P>
<P>
"It is now clearer than ever that China will join the World
Trade Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For America to reap the broad benefits of China's historic
decision to open its markets and to strengthen the forces of
positive change in China, Congress must enact PNTR," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned that a vote against PNTR with China "will cost
America exports and jobs, cede this massive new market to our
competitors in Europe and Japan and embolden those resisting
reform in China."

<P>
The China Meteorological Administration has recently decided
to improve its watch and evaluation over the environment in China'
s western regions.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to facilitate the protection of the
fragile eco-system in the region as China has launched a massive
development program to develop its vast west.

LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Police working to identify the
football fans involved in Wednesday's violent clashes in
Copenhagen have received "an awful lot of calls" from the public.
</P>
<P>
The National Criminal Intelligence Service appealed for help to
name the English supporters who fought with Turkish fans ahead of
the UEFA Cup final between Arsenal and Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
Police are also studying photographs and video footage of the
brawls which left 19 people injured - four with stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
Officers in the UK want to identify troublemakers so they can
alert Dutch and Belgian police ahead of next month's Euro 2000
tournament.
</P>
<P>
NCIS's Football Intelligence Unit has also asked clubs and the
Football Association to see if they recognised any of those taking
part in the violence.
</P>
<P>
An NCIS spokeswoman said: "I am unable to say whether anyone
has been identified at this stage but the information is being
looked into by our experts."
</P>
<P>
The FA, police and the government are rechecking security
arrangements for Euro 2000 after NCIS reported on Thursday that
English fans were "almost guaranteed" to be in the thick of any
trouble.
</P>
<P>
There are also fears that the events in Copenhagen may have
damaged England's bid to hold the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
English and Turkish fans clashed again on Thursday night at
Copenhagen airport as they waited to board planes home. Police
intervened after fighting broke out and bottles were thrown.
</P>
<P>
Danish police arrested 64 people on Wednesday night, 19 of them
English supporters. They have since been released without charge
and escorted from the country.
</P>
<P>
Police in Britain said they were disappointed that those
arrested would not face justice. "It does act as a deterrent,"
said Mark Steels of NCIS.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leadership Denounces Israeli Oppression Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian leadership held their
regular weekly meeting Friday evening in the West Bank town of
Ramallah, denouncing Israel's oppressive policy against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian news agency WAFA, a statement
issued after the meeting held Israel responsible for the escalation
of violence in the territories over the past week, in which they
claimed seven people were killed and 560 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by members of the Palestinian National
Authority cabinet and the executive committee of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, warned Israel to bear the full
responsibility for the "serious consequences" of its oppression
policy.
</P>
<P>
It accused the Israeli side of initiating the violence, and
condemned Israel's use of live bullets against Palestinian
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police exchanged fire near a
Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip earlier Friday in what was the
most serious confrontation in a year. Dozens of people on both
sides were wounded, some seriously.
</P>
<P>
The gun battle broke out as Israeli soldiers were trying to stop
Palestinian protestors from throwing stones in the Palestinian
self-rule area on the first of two "days of rage" in support of
hunger -striking Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the PNA for its lax attitude toward the violence
and asked it to control its police force.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Friday's Palestinian leadership meeting
called Israeli cabinet and Knesset (parliament) approval to hand
over three towns near Jerusalem to full Palestinian control as "a
step forward in the right direction," despite Israel's default on
many commitments under signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Israel has agreed to transfer Abu Dis, Azariya and Swahara, the
three towns on the outskirts of Jerusalem to the Palestinians, but
the implementation was delayed by the new wave of violence across
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Palestinian leadership denounced two bills in
the Israeli Knesset, calling them a "a serious blow to the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
A majority of Knesset members approved a bill demanding any
change to Jerusalem's borders and the transfer of areas inside to
a "foreign element" require a special majority of 61 MPs and
another blocking the return of the 3.5 million Palestinian refugees
to land under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Both bills should pass a further three readings before becoming
law.

<HEADLINE> Exposition of NATO Aggression on Yugoslavia Opens in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The exposition of NATO aggression on
 Yugoslavia was opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 pictures and a multi-media-film named "Aggression on
Yugoslavia" are shown at the one-week exposition.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the exposition named "We are All
Targets", Yugoslav Charge d'Affaires Dusan Zupan said the purpose
of this exhibition is to make closer to the Zambian public what
really happened in Yugoslavia one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The biggest military force ever launched attack on a small
sovereign European state on March 24, 1999. In the operation, NATO
dropped 23,500 missiles out of 1,200 airplanes and killed 2,500
people.
</P>
<P>
Zupan said that China, Russia, India and many other countries
including African countries, raised their voice to condemn the
NATO aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We are very grateful to all these countries that defended not
only our right to preserve our territorial integrity, but also the
right of all countries to have peace, to be spared of domination
and hegemony," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 diplomats from some 25 countries, including
Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Peng Keyu, attended the opening
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Iraq Reach Agreement in NPT Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Iraq
have reached agreement on their dispute at the 200 Review
Conference of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), allowing
the key conference to end successfully.
</P>
<P>
"This means that assuming that members will approve, the last
piece of our puzzle is complete," Canadian Ambassador Chris
Wesdahl, who mediated between the two countries, told the 187
delegates to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The one-month conference ran into Saturday morning, rather
than end late on Friday as scheduled, sources close to the meeting
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by 187 NPT signatories, was deadlocked
as Iraq counterattacked the U.S. insistence on the inclusion of
Iraq's difficulties with inspectors as a condition for naming
Israel in the final document by threatening to block the entire
meeting, which kicked off at the U.N. Headquarters in New York on
April 24.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 5 a.m. EST, and still without an agreement, the
conference president, Algerian U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Baali, who
had earlier "stopped the clock" for 14 hours to give the United
States and Iraq more time to negotiate over language relating to
the bilateral dispute, sent delegates from 187 state signatories
home to get some sleep. He said a new attempt to reach agreement
began later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Most delegates pleaded with Washington and Baghdad to make a
final attempt to settle their differences, saying the issue should
not endanger the entire conference.
</P>
<P>
The NPT conference works by consensus, which means one country
can block agreement. It is to set goals for the all signatories to
the 30-year NPT, the cornerstone of arms reduction treaties.
</P>
<P>
Central at issue was language in a side document on the Middle
East reviewing Iraq's difficulties with inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), responsible for
scraping any nuclear weapons material.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the sources said, insisted this as a
condition for naming Israel in the document, the only Middle East
country which remains outside NPT. The conference would appoint an
envoy to discuss with Israel in order to secure Israel's early
accession to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq rejected any reference to its difficulties with
the inspectors. Instead, it wanted language limited to the IAEA's
January inspections of its nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Delegates will meet again on Saturday morning to work hard on
the final document, which is expected to give a stronger pledge on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The commitment toward a total nuclear disarmament has survived
in the draft agreement after France withdrew a proposal to soften
the draft language.
</P>
<P>
The 187 countries representing the NPT review conference are
expected to agree on the document, which is also expected to
include "further reduction of nonstrategic nuclear weapons," with
Russia having withdrawn its objection, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The NPT conference is the first since the Treaty was extended
indefinitely in 1995.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Cooperation Minister Visits Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wieczorek-Zeul, the first federal minister to travel to Havana
in four decades, will review the project "Support to the National
Program To Fight Desertification and Drought," according to the
Cuban press.
</P>
<P>
That plan covers a period of between 10 and 12 years, with a
financing of three million marks(1.7 million U.S. dollars) in its
three-year initial stage.
</P>
<P>
The project aims at supporting the Cubans' work against the
desertification and drought in the hydrographic basin of Rio Cauto
in the east of the island.
</P>
<P>
The German minister's trip occurs at a moment when Cuba is
involved in a sour dispute with the European Union (EU) after the
recent resolution against the island in the United Nations Human
Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which voted together with the United States against
Havana, has conditioned its cooperation to the alleged improvement
of the situation of human rights in the island.
</P>
<P>
However, the coalition of the Social Democrat-Green parties of
Germany took its distance of that position and resumed direct
cooperation with the island.

<HEADLINE> Study: Canadian Parents Too Drained to Enjoy Family Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian parents are being too
drained to enjoy the time they spend with their children,
according to the country's Vanier Institute of the Family.
</P>
<P>
In its latest study made available here Saturday, the institute
said one-third of Canadian families are now supported by two
parents working full-time, while only one in five homes relies
just on one pay-cheque.
</P>
<P>
The study, entitled Profiling Canada's Families II, said, "Most
families count on two wages to make ends meet, with the result
that they face heavy demands on their time and energy."
</P>
<P>
All that many families can share is their "tired time" or"
leftovers" of energy, time and commitment, said the study.
</P>
<P>
Canadians between 35 and 54 spend about one-third of each week
either at the job or working around the house, another third
sleeping and the last third for all the rest ranging from eating
to socializing.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Calls for Protection of Natural Resources  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's President Festus
Mogae warned on Saturday the squandering of natural resources
should be carefully husbanded to fund development as they will not
last forever, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mogae was speaking at the launch of Orapa 2000 which is
expected to double output at Botswana's Orapa diamond mines and
increase the country's output by 33 percent by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
"My heart wears a sparkling diamond tiara of pride and
patriotism," Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
Since Botswana's launch of the Orapa mine by former president
Seretse Khamaand, he said the country's diamond industry has gone
from "strength to strength".
</P>
<P>
"Debswana (the biggest diamond company in Botswana) has ensured
that with every year that passed, its operations got bigger and
bigger. But I must warn that wealth in natural resources by no
means guarantees economic success," Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there have been a litany of examples across
Africa of nations that have failed to transform such gifts into
wealth, saying: "We shall appreciate such a compliment, when
through our development programs, we have transformed our natural
resources into sustainable productive assets".
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mogae also mentioned Botswana's relationship
with De Beers (the biggest diamond producer in the world) which
shares its own high degree of dependency on the diamond industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The five nuclear powers
Saturday agreed to eliminate their nuclear arsenals in part of a
new disarmament agenda agreed to by 187 countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by the signatories to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) after all-night consultations and
tense pressure on the United States and Iraq not to derail the
conference, the first of its kind since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced at the end of the month-long
Review Conference of NPT, which opened here on April 24.
</P>
<P>
The president of the conference, Abdallah Baali of Algeria,
said, "Today is a great day for the cause of nuclear
nonproliferation and nuclear disbarment."
</P>
<P>
A final document among those with nuclear arms and the 182
nations without them was approved hours after the meeting was
nearly derailed by the United States over its dispute with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The conference agreed to further reductions of tactical
nuclear weapons, increase transparency by the nuclear powers on
reporting information about their nuclear arsenals and reduce the
number of warheads on hair-trigger alert.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a statement issued here
Saturday by his spokesman, hailed the announcement as "a historic
consensus on several issues crucial to the security of all the
peoples of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
A Chinese delegate told the conference Saturday that "This
review conference as a whole is successful."
</P>
<P>
"State parties conducted a comprehensive and profound review
on the implementation of the Treaty, and on the decisions and the
Middle East resolutions adopted in 1995," when the NPT was
extended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the different views held by State parties,
agreement has been achieved on many issues; consensus has been
reached on the need to preserve the effectiveness and universality
of the Treaty," the Chinese delegate said. "It reflects the common
desire of the States parties to safeguard the Treaty and to
promote the three principal objectives of the Treaty."
</P>
<P>
However, "first and for most, the final document has failed to
fully reflect the current international situation, nor does it
call for the removal of fundamental obstacles to nuclear
disarmament," said the Chinese delegate.
