<HEADLINE> Thai Recapitalization Excludes Commercial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's major commercial
banks have sufficient capital funds and will not have to join the
government-initiated recapitalization program, the central bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The major commercial banks include Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers
Bank, Thai Military Bank, Bank of Ayudhya and Thai Danu Bank.
</P>
<P>
The five banks have sufficient operational funds through
mid-1999, therefore they will not have to sign memoranda with the
central bank on their recapitalization plans, the central bank
said in a statement available on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four other local commercial banks, however, have to sign
commitments to their recapitalization plans by the end of this
month. They are Siam Commercial Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Bank of
Asia and Nakornthon Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The new capital will allow the banks to achieve loan growth
targets for this year and to restructure loans for clients," said
central bank Deputy Governor Kitti Patpong-pibul.
</P>
<P>
Local commercial banks facing financial crunches could raise
their capital either by obtaining new investors, or seeking
assistance from the government's 300-billion-baht (8.3 billion
U.S. dollars) recapitalization program.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- British Royal Navy aircraft
carrier HMS Invincible Tuesday arrived at the British Anrotiri
base in Cyprus en route to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued by the base said that the carrier, which
has command of other ships bound for the Gulf, will stay here for
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
It adds that frigates HMS Boxer and HMS Cumberland are already
on patrol in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
HMS Invincible, one of the Royal Navy's three 20-thousand-ton
aircraft carriers, is operated by 1,200 men and women.
</P>
<P>
The HMS Invincible is expected to arrive in the Gulf by the end
of January.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain fired nearly 500 missiles on Iraq in their
four-night air strikes on December 16-19 with a declared aim of
punishing Baghdad for its defiance of the U.N. weapons
inspections, which began in 1991 after the Gulf War, set off by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Most of the missiles were launched from the U.S.-British forces
massed in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Iraq has threatened not to recognize the
Iraqi-Kuwaiti border demarcated according to U.N. resolution 833
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have reacted with a counter-threat to
strike Iraq again if it continues to defy relevant
U.N. resolutions following its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> ARATS to Help Realize Wang-Koo Talks Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) has
said here that relations across the Taiwan Straits further eased
in 1998 and ARATS this year will push on with implementing the co
nsensus reached during the Wang-Koo talks, continue political
talks with Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and help
launch cross-straits political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Mingqing, head of the first ARATS delegation to visit
Singapore at the invitation of the East Asia Institute of the
National University of Singapore, stressed the point when his
six-member team met with the media, professors of the East Asia
Institute, and members of the Singapore-China Friendship
Association, among others, to exchange views and ideas on China's
reunification drive.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in 1998, ARATS and SEF resumed high-level
contacts and dialogue that had been suspended for three years.
ARATS President Wang Daohan and SEF counterpart Koo Chen-fu
reached a four-point consensus during Koo's trip to Shanghai and
Beijing last October and decided to conduct dialogue on
political, economic and other fields.
</P>
<P>
A down-to-earth implementation of the consensus would open
broad prospects for contact and talks between the two org
anizations, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Wang's visit to Taiwan, Chen Kongli, a member
of the delegation and professor of Xiamen University, said Wang
could not make the trip before May because of his tight schedule.
He said officials from both sides had to prepare carefully for
the trip.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Wang wants to take cross-straits relations a step
forward. It is the hope of the people on both sides as well as
his personal wish," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen criticized the Taiwan authorities for joining the U.S. Th
eater Missile Defense (TMD) system, saying it was "a pure lie"
that they made the move for the sake of the stability and
security in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the plan, a joint project between Tokyo and
Washington to develop an anti-missile defense system was clearly
directed at those countries which were not involved in it,
including China and other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities' real motive was to rely on the U.S.
strength to threaten and confront mainland China politically,
diplomatically and militarily, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States should observe the principles of the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques as the issue concerned China's
sovereignty and the 8.17 Communique signed by China and the
United States in 1982 on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Team member Lian Xisheng, professor of China University of
Political Science and Law, said sincerity was of paramount
importance to the development of the cross-straits ties.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Taiwanese who obstructed the reunification by
playing the card of the so-called democracy. He said the essence
of cross-straits relations was to safeguard China's reunification
and its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental cross-straits issue was not about
institutional democratic change, but peaceful reunification based
on "one-country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"The reunification of China means neither side imposes its
social system on the other, nor swallows the other up," Lian
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Lian also stressed that "one-country, two systems" was the
best way to bring about China's reunification and allow Taiwan to
preserve its system and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
"Everything except the 'One-China' principle can be talked
over," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Lian also dismissed the "new Taiwaneseism", saying that, with
other moves taken by the Taiwan authorities, it had a sinister
aim to sever Taiwan from China and the Taiwanese from Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly oppose any political change that steers Taiwan
from reunification," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhang argued that the Taiwan authorities' complaints about
their contracting diplomatic space were fighting an inevitable
trend, which will only grow.
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric of "zero diplomacy, zero unification" was
threatening and an expression of helplessness, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS delegation arrived from Thailand last Friday in
Singapore, the venue for the first Wang-Koo talks. The team is
scheduled to leave for home Tuesday to end its two-nation tour.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Cable Firms Sign Up More Internet Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's cable companies are
gaining ground against the telephone firms in the Internet
service market and signing up more customers, a report said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cogeco Cable Inc. of Montreal said that for the three months e
nding November 30, it added almost 75,000 customers to its
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
Shaw Communications Inc. of Calgary announced a gain of 20,000
new Internet customers during the same quarter. The firm now
boasts more than 81,000 Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts estimate that as many as 300,000 households
in Canada have access to the Internet through a cable company,
according to the National Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Canadian customers usually pay about 40 dollars (26 U.S.
dollars) for an unlimited Internet service in addition to their
monthly cable TV bills.
</P>
<P>
With cable services, customers can surf on the Internet at
peak speeds of about 1.5 million bits per second, while those who
go on-line through phone lines surf at speeds ranging from 9,600
to 50,000 bits per second.
</P>
<P>
Internet dealers say that the market for high-speed cable
services is just at the beginning of a boom. More and more
Canadians are opting for high-speed Internet service and free up
their home phone line for voice calls.
</P>
<P>
However, cable customers still account for a small proportion
of the total 3.6 million Internet-connected households in the
country.

<HEADLINE> WEF to Discuss Globalization at Annual Meeting in Davos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- International business leaders,
economists and politicians will meet in Davos, Switzerland, from
January 28 to February 2 to discuss economic globalization and
its impact on the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF) has chosen
"Responsible Globality: Managing the Impact of Globalization" as
the theme of its 29th annual meeting, WEF Managing Director
Claude Smadja announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 chief executives of the world's leading com
panies, 300 senior political leaders, hundreds of scientists,
intellectuals, academics and artists will take part in the
five-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Great changes had taken place since the last annual meeting in
Davos last year, Smadja said. The focus had shifted from the
Asian crisis to a more general concern about the overall health
of the world economy following the financial meltdown in Russia
during last summer.
</P>
<P>
Smadja said that a sense of fragility still prevailed and the
ongoing financial chaos had once again showed how quickly trouble
in one part of the world can spread.
</P>
<P>
Among the prestigious guests and participants at the annual
meeting are United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Swiss
President Ruth Dreifuss, German President Roman Herzog, United
States Vice-President Al Gore and Chief Executive of China's Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
The WEF is the foremost global partnership of business,
government, intellectual and other leaders committed to improving
the state of the world. Incorporated since 1971 as a foundation,
the WEF is independent, impartial and non-profit, and independent
of political, partisan or national interests.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Giant Copper Mine to Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The owners of the giant
Highland Valley Copper mine in British Columbia, west Canada,
have decided to suspend operations indefinitely because of the
unbearably low copper price, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown, set for May 15, is a devastating blow for the
mine's 1,046 workers as well as its joint owners -- Cominco Ltd.,
Rio Algom Ltd., Teck Corp., and Highmont Mining Co..
</P>
<P>
With annual production of about 170,000 tonnes of copper in
concentrates, or 1.5 percent of global consumption, Highland
Valley is one of the world's largest copper mines.
</P>
<P>
The sharp slump in the copper price, which traded near a
historic low at 65 U.S. cents a pound, forced the owners to make
a shutdown decision in order to avoid more economic losses.
</P>
<P>
The mine lost around eight million Canadian dollars (5.2
million U.S. dollars) in the fourth quarter of 1998 and
increasing losses are projected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Copper has averaged 1.10 U.S. dollars a pound over the past 10
years on the Canadian market.
</P>
<P>
Highland Valley officials estimated that the mine needed to
see copper trading at a minimum of 70 U.S. cents a pound, to
enable it to finance the ongoing cost of replacing equipment such
as trucks and shovels.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Waste in Cambodia Said to Contain Mercury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of environmentalists
from Cambodia and abroad said Tuesday that the industrial waste
imported from Taiwan and dumped in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, last
year contained a high content of mercury.
</P>
<P>
The international environmental organizations Greenpeace and
the Basel Action Network (BAN) and other non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) told a press conference here that a study
performed in Hong Kong has shown a sample of the waste to have a
mercury level as high as 10,971 parts per million (over 1
percent).
</P>
<P>
Tests for possible damage to the immune system, nervous system
and kidneys of those exposed to the waste have yet to be
undertaken.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary study released by the NGO Forum on
Cambodia, the toxic waste has already caused direct and indirect
impacts on people's health and life.
</P>
<P>
The study said the direct impact is that two people have died
so far and five dock workers, who handled the waste, were reported
to be seriously ill. And in the three affected villages, there are
also people who got sick and some families were forced to leave
their homes for Phnom Penh and other places.
</P>
<P>
Indirect impact is that there are few buyers and sellers in
Sihanoukville and as a result, income for the people there has
declined by 30 to 40 percent a day because people are too scared
to buy seafood, suspecting that it has been polluted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of tourists has also gone down rapidly.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 tons of so-called industrial waste was imported
from a Taiwan plastics company on November 30, 1998, and dumped
four days later in an open area in the outskirts of Sihanoukville,
230 kilometers west of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government has ordered that the waste be sent
back to Taiwan and Taiwan's environmental agency also requested
the plastics company to take responsibility for returning the
waste to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the local media, the government will remove all
officials involved in the import of the waste. So far, more than
30 customs officials are suspended, including the director of the
national customs.

planting and processing, the textile industry, sericulture, mining
and trading.

strengthening the foundation of the traditional friendship between
the two countries and for bringing their cooperation to a new
level of development.

<HEADLINE> Senior Aide: Yeltsin Remains in Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
would not delegate his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
a senior Kremlin official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev told a press
conference that the president would not transfer his powers to
Primakov "for either formal or technical reasons," Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Yeltsin was rushed to the Central Clinical
Hospital Sunday for acute gastric ulcer bleeding, the second time
to have been hospitalized since early last December when he was
struck bypneumonia.
</P>
<P>
His illness has again prompted calls for him to delegate his
power to Primakov and step down to make room for early
presidential elections. Yeltsin's term expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sysuyev said Yeltsin continues to run the country despite his
illness.
</P>
<P>
"The reins of power...remain in the hands of the president of
the Russian Federation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's chief doctor, Sergei Mironov, said Monday that the
president might have to stay hospitalized for some three weeks and
be barred from air travel in the next two and a half or three
months.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation earlier Tuesday, Yeltsin and French
President Jacques Chirac agreed to tentatively reschedule
Yeltsin's France visit to mid-March, from the original dates of
January 28-29.
</P>
<P>
Several other foreign trips might also be postponed due to
Yeltsin's poor health.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Spend Over 50 Million Dollars on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece would spend about 15
billion drachmas (about 54 million U.S. dollars) on dealing with
the millennium bug, said Greece's Interior Minister Alekos
Papadopoulos after chairing a high-ranking meeting on the problem
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Papadopoulos described the work on the millennium bug as being
proceeding "at a very satisfactory rate," saying that both the
public and private sectors had shown good progress.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Greece's ministers of Defense,
Economy, Development and Transport and Communications, as well as
officials from the sectors of industry, banking and other sectors
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Participants decided Tuesday to establish a "2000 working
group" to tackle the sensitive areas of the Greek economy, to
draft emergency contingency plans and to step up approval
processes to procure equipment that would help deal with the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
They also approved a action plan to help hundreds of
small-and-medium-sized enterprises which have little access to
ways of dealing with the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The plan would be coordinated by chambers of commerce, the
Federation of Greek Industries and other private agencies.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are held on a monthly basis to coordinate work on
the millennium bug between ministries, government services and the
private sector.

<HEADLINE> Set of Ideas not Discussed, Says Cyprus President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said on Tuesday he and U.N. resident representative Dame
Ann Hercus has not discussed the Set of Ideas on the Cyprus issue,
which was proposed by former U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Ann Hercus' statement on Monday that the
Set of Ideas is a "very substantive document", Clerides stressed
the U.N. representative had never "since the day she arrived on
the island mentioned anything on the Ghali Ideas".
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali issued a report to the Security Council on April
3, 1992, in which he included a Set of Ideas that had evolved from
the consultations between his representatives and the two sides of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council endorsed this Set of Ideas on an overall
settlement of the Cyprus issue with resolution 750 (1992) which
also reaffirmed that a settlement in Cyprus must be based on a
state of Cyprus with a single sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
Hercus began shuttle talks with the two sides last October
in a bid to reduce tension on the island and press a
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Israel's 1999 Wolf Prizes for Physics, Mathematics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Israel's 1999 Wolf Prize for
Physics went to Israeli professor Dan Shechtman, while the Prize
for Mathematics was shared by two professors from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Shechtman, 57, was awarded for his experimental discovery of
quasi-crystals, non-periodic solids having long-range order, which
inspired the exploration of a new fundamental state of matter.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the long-held belief that all crystals with
three-dimensional periodic atomic arrangement must exist in a
restricted number of symmetires, Shechtman discovered five-fold
symmetric alloys.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-born Shechtman is professor of the Department of
Materials Engineering of the Technion, Israel's institute of
technology in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian-born Laszlo Lovasz of the Yale University, 50, shared
the Prize for Mathematics for his contributions to combinatorics,
theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization.
</P>
<P>
Elias Stein of Princeton University, 68, born in Belgium,
shared the prize for his contributions to classical and Euclidean
Fourier analysis and for his impact on a new generation of
analysts through his teaching and writing.
</P>
<P>
On January 12, the Foundation announced that the 1999 Wolf
Prize for Medicine was awarded to professor Eric Kandel, Columbia
University, New York.
</P>
<P>
And the 1999 Wolf Prize for Chemistry went to Raymond Lemieux,
professor of the Alberta University, Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Wolf Prize was established in 1978 by the late German-born
Ricardo Wolf, who lived in Cuba for many years and served as Cuban
ambassador to Israel. The Israeli-based prize is awarded to
scientists and artists for outstanding achievements in the
interest of mankind and friendly relations among peoples.
</P>
<P>
The annual prize, of 100,000 U.S. dollars in each area, are
given in four out of five scientific fields, namely agriculture,
chemistry, mathematics, medicine and physics. In the arts, the
prize rotates among architecture, music, painting and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 prizes will be conferred by President Ezer Weizman in
a special ceremony to be held at Israeli parliament, on May 2,
1999.

HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of
Zimbabwe (BAZ) Tuesday supported moves by the central bank to
bring stability to the foreign exchange market by rescuing the
ailing Zimbabwean Dollar and appealed to the business community to
support the effort.
</P>
<P>
BAZ President Elisha Mushayakarara pledged in a statement the
association's continued support to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe as
it sought to stabilize the exchange rate and optimize the use of
available reserves while improving the supply of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The bankers' support would also rebuild confidence in the
market and improve transparency and accountability by availing
more information to the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar gained significantly on Monday following
a meeting between Reserve Bank officials and bankers who
recommended that the unit should trade below 40 Zimbabwean Dollars
to the U.S. Dollar, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency, which had traded at 43.75 to the greenback
on Friday, gained 9.49 percent against the U.S. Dollar on Tuesday
to trade at 39.6 Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Dollar had been on a tailspin since the new year in what
dealers said was a response to the continued delay in releasing
crucial balance of payments support by the International Monetary
Fund.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Reform Praised in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli legislators said
Tuesday the country's defense force is "on the right track"
by launching a large-scale restructure aimed at meeting the
threats facing the country in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
Reporting to a committee in charge of foreign and defense
affairs in the parliament, Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz
said the restructure plan is designed to better answer present
and future threats, including possible missile attacks against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, which was unveiled last week, the army
will reorganize some branches, set up a new unit to coordinate
military actions in battlefields, and replace outdated tanks and
artillery.
</P>
<P>
While increasing incentives to keep skilled personnel in the
military longer, the plan calls for a gradual cut-off of about
2,000 positions, including eight brigadier-generals and 20
colonels.
</P>
<P>
Legislators in the defense committee said the plan is
"crucial" for the army to provide security for the country amid
missile and even non-conventional threats.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan announced by Mofaz, who took the top military
position about six months ago, has been hailed by many Israelis as
potentially more sweeping than what has been accomplished by his
two predecessors, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak and Amnon
Lipkon-Shahak.
</P>
<P>
Both Barak and Shahak are candidates for premiership in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), founded in 1948 when the
state of Israel was proclaimed, ranks among the most
battle-trained armed forces in the world.
</P>
<P>
But during the long period after the wars with Arab countries ,
bureaucracy has developed in the army and its efficiency has
declined. Also, the threats facing the country has been changing
from conventional wars to missile or nuclear ones.
</P>
<P>
The new situation has called for restructuring in the army. But
until now, all of the IDF's multi-year plans have been aborted,
mainly due to dwindling financial resources.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet agreed late last year to increase the
defense shares in the national budget for this year, but
coalition disarray has prevented the passage of the budget,
leaving the country without a budget for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan, which covers a five-year period till 2003,
will go into effect starting on April 1. It will be carried out in
phases and subjected to changes according to military intelligence
assessment, Mofaz said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel Tuesday released 30
Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture on the day of Eid
al-Fitr, the Muslim festival marking the end of the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that most of those freed had been
detained for low-level anti-Israel crimes.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted an officer of Israel army as saying that
none of the prisoners were considered by Israel as "serious
terrorists."
</P>
<P>
According to the interim peace agreement signed by Israel and
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) last October, Israel
should release 750 Palestinian prisoners by the end of this month
in three phases.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli government suspended the implementation of the
agreement last month after 250 Palestinian prisoners were freed in
the first stage.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that
Israel would not go ahead with the fulfillment of the accord until
the PNA met Israel's demands on fighting terrorism.

<HEADLINE> B. Braun Ready to Compensate for Belgian Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The German pharmaceutist B.
Braun expressed on Tuesday its readiness to compensate for the
deaths of two Belgian premature babies caused by injection of its
mis-labelled medicine.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it would not wait until after the
investigation to compensate the parents of the deceased babies. It
previously said that it would compensate only after a link is
established between the use of the medicine and the deaths of the
babies.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the company met Belgian Public Health
Minister Marcel Colla on Tuesday to discuss the issue that caught
the limelight of the press around the country that launched an
investigation into the incident on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two prematurely-born babies, one weighing 900 grams and the
other a little more than 2 kilograms, died one after another at a
university hospital at Louvain near Brussels after receiving
injection of Braun-manufactured medicine that was labelled to
contain glucose but instead contained lethal chloride of
potassium.
</P>
<P>
The injection last Saturday caused heart arrests in the babies
and the cause of deaths was proved by autopsy.
</P>
<P>
The Melsungen affiliate of the B. Braun in Berlin, the company
that produced the medicine in question, already halted production
of the medicine.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1988, a similar case of mis-labelling of Braun medicine
caused dangerous situations in a Brussels hospital.

</P>
<P>
Ruff's opening arguments were expected to last only about two
hours, keeping him from stepping into Clinton's spotlight.
</P>

A team of 13 House prosecutors spent three days last week
making the case that Clinton is no longer fit to hold the

Ruff will try to punch holes in that case, disputing the House
prosecutors' interpretation of some events and pointing out
evidence that is favorable to Clinton that was left out of the

</P>

Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be

HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambezi River Authority
(ZRA) Tuesday said power generation at Kariba Dam in the northern
part of Zimbabwe, one of the largest man-made lake in the world,
has been increased to its maximum generation capacity due to heavy
rains in the upper and lower Zambezi catchment areas.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the above, the public is hereby warned that river
levels of the Zambezi River downstream of Kariba Dam will rise
above levels normally experienced in the past," said ZRA, a joint

statement.

"It may also become necessary to open the spillway gates in the

According to statistics released by the Department of Water
Resources on January 4, Kariba Dam was 53.8 percent full holding
34,874.2 million cubic meters of its electricity generating
capacity.

ADDIS ABABA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Private insurance companies
in Ethiopia said Tuesday that all enterprises, private and
state-owned, should be free to get services from insurance
companies of their choice, according to a report from the
Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Global, Nile and Awash insurance companies
were quoted by the report as saying that government enterprises
and offices are made to be customers of only the state-owned
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
There are one state-owned insurance company and seven private
insurance companies in the country. The seven private insurance
firms have been established since the issuance of the insurance
law in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report said some 70 percent of the manufacturing and
service rendering enterprises in Ethiopia are reportedly
state-owned.
</P>
<P>
Failure on the part of state-owned enterprises to make use of
the services of private insurance companies has impacted on the
private insurance sector, officials of the private insurance
companies were quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials said,"prohibiting government offices from making
use of the services of private insurance contravenes the free

"It's only a matter of hours before the remaining members of
other parties suspend their participation in the IPA," Malebo
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he spoke to Mosisili about the condition of detained
Lesotho soldiers, who are appearing before a court martial for
their alleged involvement in a mutiny last September. However,
the prime minister was not interested in the matter, Malebo said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that several members of the alliance had been
arrested, and more arrests could follow.
</P>
<P>
Malebo said the walk-out was also prompted by the absence of
ministers from the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD).
</P>
<P>
"LCD members have not been attending the IPA meeting for a
while. Maybe we can pardon for non-attendance during preparations
for the funeral of the late prime minister Ntsu Mokhehle. But now
that he was buried last week, we don't understand their reason for
not coming to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Their next excuse will be that... as ministers... they have
been in meetings at the government complex, but this is not
helpful to the deteriorating security situation. We cannot
conclude anything without the participation of LCD members,"
Malebo said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the walk-out, Deputy Prime Minister Kelebone
Maope said it was a ruse to scuttle progress already achieved in
normalizing the political situation.
</P>
<P>
Maope said several IPA committees had already made progress,
citing as an example the one on the new electoral system, which he
said was just about to complete the system to be followed in
elections due in 18 months' time.
</P>
<P>
On security matters, he said the LCD's view was that it should
be left to the police and defense forces. He said he was
surprised that the opposition alliance could be complaining about
the deteriorating security situation, because the alliance
leadership was inciting supporters to be unruly.
</P>
<P>
"This is very funny... because they are inflaming the
situation, and they claim the government is ignoring the problem,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Denies Angola's Accusation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba described here Tuesday as extremely sad Angola's recent
allegation that Zambia is supplying arms to Angola's rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba confirmed that he has received a letter accusing his
country of supplying arms to the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
It is extremely sad because Zambia has neither the political
will nor money to engage in such action, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is unfortunate that the allegation has come up again
even after the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United
Nations have cleared Zambia of supplying arms to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
People who continued to accuse Zambia of supplying arms to
UNITA have a motive of playing down Zambia's role as a mediator in
the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to spearhead the peace initiative in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the Angolan government may be acting
emotionally because the war in that country has taken too long.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his country is prepared should Angola decide to
take action, Chiluba said Zambia has no resources to start a war
with any of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Zambia will defend itself if something like
that happens.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio De Moura made the accusation
in his letter of January 13 to his DRC counterpart Jean Charles
Otoko Lolakome.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one year ago Angola repeatedly accused some Zambians of
supplying arms through Zambia's territory to UNITA and demanded
the Zambian government take measures to stop the territory from
being used as a springboard for the arms supplies.
</P>
<P>
Later, OAU and the United States sent their representatives to
Zambia to investigate the matter and cleared Zambia after the
investigations.

<HEADLINE> Some 5,000 ECOMOG Troops to Be Deployed in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 troops of the west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG are required to be
deployed in Guinea Bissau to ensure the implementation of a peace
agreement, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), said in Nigerian capital Abuja
that the ECOMOG force would be deployed in two phases.
</P>
<P>
He told a press briefing that the first batch of 2,000 was
expected to be deployed before elections to be held before the end
of March while the other 3,000 troops would be deployed during the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops will serve as an interposition force between
troops loyal to President Joao Bieira and sacked army chief
General Ansumane Mane who led the seven-month rebellion started
last June, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS official noted that five countries including Benin,
the Gambia, Niger and Togo had indicated they would contribute
troops for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
A technical team will be in that country to work on a status of
forces agreement and the modalities for the deployment of the
troops with officials of Guinea Bissau, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops will replace those from Senegal and Guinea
who went to that country at the request of President Vieira to
help quell the rebellion led by General Mane.
</P>
<P>
The troops requirement was determined by ECOMOG Commander
General Timothy Shelpidi who headed an ECOMOG assessment team to
visit that country late last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement reached by Vieira and rebel leader
Mane in Abuja last November, an interposition force will be sent
to that country and a 16-member government of national unity be
set up.

<HEADLINE> Famine Strikes Southern Somalia As Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation in
southern Somalia is deteriorating with more people dying of famine
and its related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the southern Bay, Bakol and Gedo regions indicated
that famine-displaced refugees are crossing back and forth the
borders which Somalia shares with Ethiopia and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 families with 2,000 displaced people reached the
town of Bardaleh of Bay region Monday. According to Ahmed Sheikh
Hamud, the district commissioner of Bardaleh town, they have
returned from Kenya after an interval of two months.
</P>
<P>
These people have returned after news spread that the World
Food Program (WFP) is distributing food to the famine victims of
Bay region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, even though the WFP and United Nations Childrens' Fund
(UNICEF) are offering limited food and other supplies, the
assistance is far from quenching down the starvation and famine in
Bay and Bakol where drought had persisted during the past season.
</P>
<P>
The authorities in Bardaleh town have collected some food alms
for the refugees who also lack shelter. However, people already
started dying. On Monday alone, eight children among the 2,000
new comers of Bardaleh town have died of famine and measles. It
is not only the food the refugees are after, but potable water as
well.
</P>
<P>
The famine and humanitarian difficulties in Bay and Bakol
regions are aggravated by the increasing insecurity as the
guerrilla war between the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) and
those of Hussein Mohamed Aidid who are fighting for the control of
the two regions.
</P>
<P>
At least three people were killed and several others were
wounded when a double barrel anti-aircraft heavy machine gun
mounted on a lorry belonging to Hussein Aidid's men was ambushed
by the RRA fighters just outside Baidoa Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Hassan Mohamed Nur known as Shargudud, who is chairman
of the RRA, told reporters via VHF radio Tuesday that Somali
businessmen and the aid agencies should all avoid trying to use
the Mogadishu-Baidoa road which he characterized as not safe for
civilian use.
</P>
<P>
He said the RRA will not be held accountable for damages,
deaths or loss of material if their orders are not met.
</P>
<P>
The insecurity resulted from the power struggle between the RRA
and Hussein Aidid in those regions is forcing the aid agencies to
use very long and complicated roads to reach the famine-stricken
people of Bay and Bakol regions. The rate of death is now said to
be getting very high in the two regions.

foundation for its economic development which is vital for the
success of Zambia's politics.
</P>
<P>
When receiving credentials from Jochen Krebs, the new head of

<HEADLINE> Russian FM against Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Tuesday that any military intervention in Kosovo would
only aggravate the crisis there.
</P>
<P>
"The problem can only be settled by political means," he said
at a news conference held at the end of talks with his Swedish
counterpart, Anna Lindh.
</P>
<P>
He said that rather than "threats, it is efforts toward
eliminating tension and settling the entire problem peacefully
that are at issue now."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov urged Belgrade to "create conditions for the OSCE
mission to go on with its tasks," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He also urged international experts to investigate thoroughly
the deaths on January 15 of over 40 Albanians in the Rachag
community in Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev had flown to
Yugoslavia to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on
January 20, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to resolving the problems that have
emerged in the region by joint efforts," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Lindh, for his part, suggested that Milosevic and Kosovo
Albanians should be persuaded to sit down at the conference table.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Kosovo is quite serious, but there is hope
that a solution can still be found," the Swedish minister said.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed the need "to ensure access to Kosovo for the
whole OSCE mission."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia on Monday declared William Walker, head of the OSCE
Kosovo Verification Mission, as a persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the Rachag victims and the expulsion of Walker
have prompted Western threats to use force against Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Elections Not to Impede Peace Process: Israeli PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said in Jerusalem Tuesday that the coming
elections should not hinder the peace process if the Palestinians
fulfill their obligations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern,
Netanyahu said Israel will move forward the peace process "with or
without elections" if the Palestinians carry out their commitments
stipulated in the Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord signed in Washinton last October, Israel
should hand over another 13 percent of the the West Bank to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in return for the PNA's
tougher action on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended the implementation of the deal in early
December, accusing the Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Denying the charges, the Palestinians said Netanyahu's holdback
of the accord is to win the support from the right-wing groups,
which oppose peace-making with the Palestinians, in the elections
slated for May 17.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, Netanyahu also asked Ahern, who is
to meet PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat Wednesday, to urge the
Palestinians to fulfill their commitments under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ahern said he can see many similarities between
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the negotiations that led
to a peace accord for Northern Ireland last April.
</P>
<P>
"I understand more than most that it is hard to stick to
deadlines and to see everything through," Ahern said.

<HEADLINE> White House Lawyers Start Defense of Clinton in Senate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The White House Tuesday
started its defense of President Bill Clinton in the U.S. Senate
impeachment trial, arguing the case outlined last week by House
prosecutors does not warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Charles Ruff opened the presentation to the
100 senators entrusted with deciding whether Clinton should be
removed from office on perjury and obstruction of justice charges
stemming from his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Ruff's opening arguments were expected to last only about two
hours, keeping him from stepping into Clinton's spotlight.
</P>
<P>
A team of 13 House prosecutors spent three days last week
making the case that Clinton is no longer fit to hold the
presidency and must be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Ruff will try to punch holes in that case, disputing the House
prosecutors' interpretation of some events and pointing out
evidence that is favorable to Clinton that was left out of the
House case.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. Sixty-seven senators
must vote to convict him to oust him from office.
</P>
<P>
Few expect the Senate to muster the votes necessary to convict
Clinton, and even Democrats acknowledged it was probably inevitable
the Senate would agree to call witnesses in the trial.
</P>
<P>
The issue of witnesses has polarized the Senate and threatened
to shatter the bipartisan spirit senators had proudly touted
earlier this month when they reached agreement on a broad outline
for the trial.
</P>
<P>
That outline deferred a decision on witnesses until next
Monday, when senators can agree by a majority vote to call
witnesses for private depositions. A second vote after the
depositions would then be required on whether to call them to
testify in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will journey to the Capitol on Tuesday night for a
nationally televised State of the Union address to a joint session
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The White House hoped that the image of a president staying
above the impeachment fray and grappling with the nation's
problems will boost Clinton's already high public approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
A survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press showed that a steady two-thirds of Americans
want it the trial to end with Clinton still in office, and that
less than one-third are paying close attention to the historic
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine percent said the trial had not changed their
opinions about whether the president should be removed from office
or resign.

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- One of world's biggest defense
firms was created Tuesday with the purchase by British Aerospace
of Gec's Marconic Electronics.
</P>
<P>
GEC said its shareholders would receive around 1.17 billion
shares in the new enlarged BAe, giving it around 36.7 percent of
the new company.
</P>
<P>
The purchase will create New British Aerospace, the world's
third-largest defense giant, behind Boeing and Lockheed Martin of
the U.S. worth 25.81 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to be the first step in lots of agreements
between Europe's leading aerospace and defense companies.
</P>
<P>
BAe chairman Richard Evans said: "This merger represents an
important step in the restructuring of the aerospace and defense
industry in Europe."
</P>
<P>
But it looks set to delay the creation of a pan-European
defense and aerospace grouping which BAe had been pursuing in
separate merger talks with Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG
(Dasa).
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Union leaders are to seek urgent talks.
They hope that the multi-billion pound link-up will not lead to
huge job losses.

<P>
LUANDA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minster Pedro
Sebastiao said here Tuesday he believes that peace will soon be
materialized in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), although
there are still some obstacles to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao made the remarks after attending the five-country
mini-summit on the crisis in DRC, held in Windhoek, capital of
Namibia. He participated on behalf of Angolan President Eduardo
Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The minister said countries directly involved in the conflicts
in the former Zaire have come to learn that Congo (K) should be
left to solve its internal issue by itself.
</P>
<P>
Countries concerned in the DRC conflicts have reached the
consensus, which will help the signing of a cease-fire agreement
expected in Lusaka, Zambia's capital soon.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila has accused Uganda and
Rwanda of supporting the rebels trying to topple his government
ever since the eruption of a Tutsi-led rebellion last August in
his country, while Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe have sent troops
to help Kabila in the name of the Southern African Development
Community.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and host country of
Namibia attended the mini-summit while Sebastiao represented the
Angolan president at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Angola and both Congos mapped out a common strategy
in politics, foreign affairs, military and economics in Luanda,
capital of Angola Monday after three-hour talks among Angolan
President Dos Santos and Congo (K) President Laurent Kabila and
Congo (B) President Denis Sassou Nguesso.

<HEADLINE> White House: Clinton Must Not Be Removed From Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Opening a three-day defense
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, White House Counsel Charles Ruff
told senators in the impeachment trial Tuesday that the president
had not committed the offenses he is charged with and "must not be
removed from office."
</P>
<P>
Ruff, an imposing figure in Washington legal circles for two
decades, challenged the evidence laid out against Clinton by 13
Republican House prosecutors last week and said the White House
welcomed the opportunity to prove Clinton's innocence.
</P>
<P>
A team of 13 House prosecutors spent three days last week
making the case that Clinton is no longer fit to hold the
presidency and must be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
"Some have suggested that we have feared to do so. We do not,"
Ruff told the senators as the trial resumed after a two-day
recess.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Clinton's defense came on an extraordinary day
in which Clinton will also deliver the State of the Union
address to a Congress that has impeached him.
</P>
<P>
Just hours before the opening, the White House made a tactical
shift and also added some congressional Democrats to the defense
team to bolster arguments that his impeachment was handled in a
"very partisan way."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Senate Republicans rejected Democratic
suggestions that calling witnesses would turn the trial into a
lurid show.

"I don't think it should lead to an unseemly spectacle. You

White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that some
Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee will join
Clinton's defense team, along with former Senator Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas, a longtime ally of the president.

Clinton is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in
two articles of impeachment approved on December 19 last year by
the House along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
He is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected to a
trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. Sixty-seven senators must
vote to convict him to oust him from office.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Set up Panel for Bitumen Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reliable source told NAN in capital Abuja that the
co-ordinating committee would be inaugurated by Minister of Solid
Minerals Development Patrick Yakowa.
</P>
<P>
The bitumen project at present is directly managed by the
office of the minister with a project team appointed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a document entitled "The Nigerian Bitumen Project
Profile", the bitumen resource extends more than 600 square
kilometers in various parts of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The 17 square kilometers currently being explored has a
potential reserve of 42.7 billion barrels of oil or double the
current reserves of crude oil in the country which is the ninth
largest oil producer in the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
The document noted that Nigeria's bitumen is at present
Africa's only known source of elemental sulphur, a vital
industrial raw material.
</P>
<P>
Experts said bitumen has physical properties that are midway
between those of coal and heavy oil, and can be mined as such.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that in the early decades of the next century,
synthetic oil produced from bitumen will supplement petroleum and
then gradually replace it worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The other major product from tar sands is asphalt used for road
building.

<HEADLINE> Romania Urges Yugoslavia Not to Expel OSCE Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
Tuesday called on the Yugoslav authorities to reverse its decision
to declare the chairman of the OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission
(KVM) persona non-grata.
</P>
<P>
"Romania is paying much attention to the dramatic evolution of
the conflict in Kosovo over the last few days," the Romanian
Foreign Ministry said in a declaration, stressing that "the
Yugoslav authorities' decision to declare William Walker, the head
of the KVM persona non-grata would compound the already tense
situation in the area."
</P>
<P>
"Romania backs up both OSCE incumbent president's and
international community's efforts to get over this critical
moment," the ministry said, adding that "It voices confidence in
KVM's head and has appreciated his activity so far."
</P>
<P>
"Romania also firmly rebukes any violent action that could lead
to a deeper deterioration of the situation in Kosovo, and supports
attempts to work out a lasting political solution as soon as
possible, with strict observance of the territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the declaration concluded.
</P>
<P>
Walker was declared persona non-grata on Monday by the Yugoslav
government and ordered to leave the country in 48 hours after he
accused Serb forces of killing 45 ethnic Albanians in the village
of Racak, 25 kilometers south of Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Walker asked the International Tribunal in the
Hague to send personnel to investigate the massacre in Racak.
Yugoslavia said that Walker's activities went far beyond the
defined limits of the OSCE mandate he is heading.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni authorities promised to
free as soon as possible the four Dutch nationals who were
kidnapped in the north of the country on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release on Tuesday, Dutch Charge D'Affaires in Sanaa
Peter Dorest added the Yemeni authorities also promised him not to
resort to forces in consideration of the safety of the hostages
who also include two British nationals.
</P>
<P>
All the hostages are in good health, according to the Dutch
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Although the Yemeni security forces are still besieging Bart in
the northern province of Al-Gouf near the Saudi borders, where the
hostages are held, the mediation of the tribal leaders will have
the final say, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other negotiators were sent to the area, to the
northeast of Sanaa, to release the hostages who were kidnapped
when driving two cars from Saada village, north Yemen, to Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers seem to have nothing to do with the militants who
held hostages 16 tourists in December. Three Britons and an
Australian were killed in the rescue operation by the Yemeni
security forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) - U.S. National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger said Tuesday the threat of force was still a
strong option in Kosovo where Serb forces are alleged to have
committed human rights atrocities.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's plans are still very much on the table and the threat
of force is very much an option," Berger said on the Cable News
Network (CNN) TV program.
</P>
<P>
NATO commander Wesley Clark, accompanied by General Klaus
Naumann of the alliance's military committee, arrived in Belgrade
on Tuesday to deliver a strong message to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic over his crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the two generals were making it very clear to
Milosevic he had to allow in Western inspectors to investigate the
atrocities and to implement a ceasefire agreement reached last
October.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that Russia, traditionally an ally of Serbia, had
been strong in condemning the atrocities in Racak and in urging
Milosevic to comply with agreements he had made.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five people were killed during the weekend in the
Kosovar village.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the United States called on the Yugoslav

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Unveils White Paper on Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A new government policy to
manage disasters more effectively was unveiled Tuesday by South
African minister for provincial affairs and constitutional
development Mohammed Moosa.
</P>
<P>
The white paper proposes that priority be given to the
prevention of disasters in line with international trends.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike previous policies that focused predominantly on relief
and recovery efforts, this white paper underscores the importance
of preventing or mitigating human, economic and property losses,
and avoiding environmental degradation," Moosa's ministry said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The white paper pays special attention to the needs of poor
communities in relation to both natural and human disasters.
</P>
<P>
Minimum building standards should, for example, be set for
low-cost housing to ensure that such structures will withstand
extreme weather.
</P>
<P>
Transportation, telecommunication and electricity networks in
all communities, including those in remote and rural areas, should
also be sound to make them less vulnerable to natural forces.
</P>
<P>
The white paper proposes that a disaster legislation be made.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes that a national center be set up to coordinate
disaster management. It should involve all spheres of government
and non-government bodies.
</P>
<P>
The center should compile a comprehensive disaster management
information system on matters such as meteorological forecasts,
hydrological data and available emergency response resources.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said the center should provide a 24-hour
service, and should be able to respond rapidly and effectively to
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The white paper proposes that the three disaster funds
currently administered by the Department of Welfare be merged into
a single disaster and emergency fund.
</P>
<P>
It says the proposed new legislation should also provide for
provincial and local disaster management structures, funded by the
government.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agencies Warn of Looming Starvation in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- International aid agencies warned
Tuesday that the sustained fighting in Sierra Leone could lead to
widespread famine in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said in a
statement issued in its headquarters in Rome that the situation is
most critical in capital Freetown, where the population "is facing
severe food shortage that could result in starvation if the
fighting continues."
</P>
<P>
The city has been deprived of regular food deliveries from the
interior since the rebels started their offensive last month.
</P>
<P>
To make situation worse, the U.N. agency said its remaining
food warehouses have been raided by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The U.N World Food Program issued the same warning Tuesday in
Geneva, with a call on the warring sides to help aid deliveries to
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"The city's population has been without water, food or
electricity for nearly two weeks, its spokeswoman Christiane
Berthiaume said.
</P>
<P>
"Everything suggests that the situation of the population and
their catastrophic humanitarian conditions are the last
preoccupation of the warring parties," she said.
</P>
<P>
The West African peace-keeping force, ECOMOG, which is
defending the government of Sierra Leone has ordered aid agencies
to hand over their communications gear, accusing some of helping
the rebels with information.
</P>
<P>
The aid agencies have denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Britain said Tuesday that it is sending
one million Pounds (1.66 million U.S. Dollars) to Sierra Leone for
humanitarian aid and logistical support of the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
A report from London quoted Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as
saying at parliament that this is the second million-pound
donation Britain has made to Freetown this Month.

<HEADLINE> Politician: Yeltsin's Illness "Destabilizing" Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the liberal
Yabloko party, Grigory Yavlinsky, said Tuesday that President
Boris Yeltsin's illness is causing "instability in the country and
gives rise to a sense of great uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot avoid paying attention to the fact that the
president's health condition constantly destabilizes the entire
country," Yavlinsky told Russia's NTV television.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was rushed to the Central Clinical Hospital Sunday for
acute gastric ulcer bleeding. Doctors have stopped the bleeding
but has yet to decide whether a surgery can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Mironov, the Kremlin chief doctor, said Monday that
Yeltsin would have to stay hospitalized for some three weeks and
be barred from air travel for two and a half or three months.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's poor health has again prompted calls for his
resignation to pave the way for early presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In the NTV program, Yavlinsky described Yeltsin as "a power
addict" who "will hardly give up his power under any
circumstances," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov "shouldn't hide, but
should tell the country what is happening to the president and
should say clearly who is making decisions today and who is
running the power structures."
</P>
<P>
"This would increase constitutional stability in the country.
It is utterly wrong that in a serious situation like this
explanations about the president's illness should be made by
(Yeltsin's) press secretary alone," Yavlinsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev told a press
conference Tuesday that the president would not transfer his
powers to Primakov "for either formal or technical reasons" and
that Yeltsin would serve out his term until the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Unveils Memorial for Late Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday unveiled a memorial to late Mozambican
President Samora Machel in Mpumalanga Province and vowed to find
the truth of the mysterious air crash that killed Machel in 1986.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is enjoying a serious investigation by a team which
is committed. If perpetrators are found to be guilty, they will be
brought before the law and severely punished," Mandela said before
unveiling the memorial.
</P>
<P>
Machel and 34 others were traveling from Zambia to Mozambique
on October 19,1986, on a peace mission when his aircraft crashed
near the South African-Mozambican border in Mpumalanga.
</P>
<P>
The memorial at the crash site was a joint project between
South Africa and Mozambique, and was designed by Mozambican
architect Jose Forjaz.
</P>
<P>
Standing on a hill, the memorial consists of 35 steel pipes
through which the wind howls at different pitches. Next to the
hill is a pit containing some wreckage from the plane.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said at the ceremony that the memorial would help
ensure that future generations would remember those who paved the
way for their freedom and the principles which inspired them.
</P>
<P>
Machel was part of a generation of Mozambicans who brought
independence to Mozambique and contributed to the independence of
Zimbabwe and to freedom in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joachim Chissano said the memorial was a
living example of a man who sacrificed himself for his people and
that the ideals he had accomplished would never die.
</P>
<P>
"Machel died like he lived, in a mission of reconciliation and
peace," Chissano said.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices in Kenya Down on Slowing Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Prices at the weekly coffee
auction in Kenya's Indian Ocean port of Mombasa went down slightly
Tuesday due to the slack of slowing demand, Nairobi Coffee
Exchange (NCE) officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials was quoted by a local media report reaching here
as saying that prices across the catalogue slid by between five-15
U.S. Dollars per 50-kg bag.
</P>
<P>
Best quality AAs grade was sold at 143-229 Dollars per bag from
146-244 Dollars. ABs were steady at 130-228 Dollars from 150-195
Dollars while PBs dropped to 143-226 Dollars from 144-232 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The NCE sold all the 21,736 bags of coffee it offered for sale.
</P>
<P>
Traders said buyers were unwilling to pay the high prices seen
in the last few auctions. Prices on average increased by up to 20
Dollars per bag in last week's auction.
</P>
<P>
They predicted lower prices in the next auctions.
</P>
<P>
"There is pressure building since there is more coffee coming in
and buyers are holding back,'' said a manager at a leading coffee

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South African and European
Union (EU) trade officials will meet in Davos, Switzerland, where
they will try to hammer out the final details of a free trade
agreement, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between South African Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin and EU commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro has been
provisionally set for January 29.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will coincide with a conference of the World
Economic Forum, which is to be attended by South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Finalization of the trade agreement has been stalled over the
EU's insistence that South African wine producers stop using the
terms "port" and "sherry" for their products.
</P>
<P>
EU officials were tight-lipped on Wednesday about the process
leading up to the Davos meeting, saying the negotiations were at a
very delicate stage, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
South African ambassador to Brussels Elias Links, who is in
South Africa for a foreign affairs conference, said outstanding
issues, other than the disagreement over port and sherry, would
take only a few days to finalize, according to SAPA.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Prices Down Due to Mixed Factors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong official said
here Wednesday that a fall in local consumer prices was not
induced entirely by the weakness in economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The positive effects from the government's relief measures and
external factors should not be ignored, Rafael Hui, secretary for
financial services of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), said Wednesday in response to inquiry by a member of the
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices in Hong Kong recorded a decline of 0.7 percent
in November 1998 over a year earlier, which was the first decline
recorded since 1975.
</P>
<P>
The fall in consumer prices, while largely due to the weak
economic activity in the recent period, was also an indication of
the expeditious cost/price readjustment in the local economy to
weather the shock from the regional financial turmoil, Hui said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet to a considerable extent, the recent decline in consumer
prices was also due to implementation of the relief measures
announced earlier by the SAR government, which include the
freezing in a number of government fees and charges as well as
the rebate of rates for one quarter," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
These measures, together with the freezing in a number of
public utility charges, are estimated to have lowered the
Composite Consumer Price Index for last November by nearly 2
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these, import prices of consumer goods have
continued to soften amidst the relative strength of the U.S.
dollar in the earlier period, a sustained fall in world commodity
prices and a low inflation in major supplier economies, Hui said.
</P>
<P>
With the high degree of dependence of Hong Kong on imported
consumer goods, consumer prices thus eased more distinctly in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
More recently, there are certain positive signs emerging in
the local economy, including improved liquidity, successive cuts
in local interest rates and a rebound in share prices and housing
prices, Hui said.
</P>
<P>
This should help improve market sentiment and lift overall
economic activity, he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Enhance Chinese Teaching in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong Wednesday stressed the importance of
teaching and learning the Chinese language in schools.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the parliament Wednesday afternoon, Lee noted that
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, in his national day rally speech in
1997, spoke of the importance of maintaining Singapore's Asian
heritage and particularly the challenge faced by the Chinese
community in maintaining its roots.
</P>
<P>
Lee quoted Goh as highlighting on that occasion the issue of
"reproducing a core group of Singaporeans who are steeped in
Chinese cultural heritage, history, literature and arts."
</P>
<P>
"We need them to be Chinese language teachers, writers,
journalists, community leaders, MPs and ministers," Lee quoted Goh
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said that while English is and will
be Singapore's common working language, the Chinese language is
"the mother tongue" that "gives us a crucial part of our values,
roots and identity."
</P>
<P>
"It gives us direct access to our cultural heritage, and a
world view that complements the perspectives of the
English-speaking world," he added.
</P>
<P>
He added that globalization and the knowledge economy require
Singaporeans to develop among them a sense of Singaporean identity
and belonging through learning the mother tongue as they have many
opportunities to live and work overseas in the process.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as China' rapid growth and opening-up will
continue and it will become a major global player in the 21st
century, command of the Chinese language will be a valuable asset
for many jobs and careers even if the person does not live or work
in China.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister announced that the government will
encourage more students to study Chinese in schools and achieve a
deeper understanding of Chinese culture.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China,
the central bank, announced today that it has almost completed
the task of shedding its unrelated business activities, as per
government regulations.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the bank reveal that 3,226 various
businesses and enterprises had been hived off from the central
bank by the end of 1998, accounting for 92 percent of the 3,511
it was involved with in total.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has imposed a strict monthly monitoring of
the process and inspection teams were dispatched by the
headquarters to some of its major provincial branches late last
year to oversee the progress on this issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, most of its other business interests
have managed to meet the criteria set by the central bank, which
involve resolution of the equity, personnel, and registration
issues as well as changing their names and settling any credit
liabilities.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Cambodian Prince Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prince Norodom
Sirivudh returned here Wednesday evening, ending his three years
of exile abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meeting him at the airport were some members of the royal
family, including Princess Norodom Buphadevi, who is also minister
of culture and fine arts, and some senior officials of the
FUNCINPEC party.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to return to my homeland after three years in
exile. I wish my country to maintain peace and political
stability," he told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The prince also said that so far he has no plan to participate
in government and political affairs. But some FUNCINPEC members
hope he can take up the post of the party's vice president.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to be a monk, devoting my effort to humanitarian
activities to help my people," he said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister,
was tried in absence in early 1996 on charges of plotting to
assassinate Hun Sen, then second prime minister, and possession of
illegal weapons. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh, also former FUNCINPEC secretary-general, received a
royal pardon on November 12, 1998, under an agreement reached
between the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and FUNCINPEC, which
also ended months of political deadlock and secured a
CPP-FUNCINPEC coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh left Cambodia for France on December 21, 1995, when
King Sihanouk helped broker a deal with Hun Sen to allow the
accused prince to go into exile.

<HEADLINE> Top Judge Calls For Promoting Open Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's top judge Xiao Yang
today called for open trials to become more widely practiced, as
a way to ensure judicial fairness and eliminate corruption.
</P>
<P>
During his fact-finding tour of southwest China's Guizhou
Province, the president of the Supreme People's Court said the
open trial procedure is stipulated in China's Constitution and is
an integral part of the judicial system. Therefore, it should be
practiced by people's courts at all levels.
</P>
<P>
All cases should be tried openly except those involving
national security, individual privacy or crimes committed by
juvenile delinquents.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said open trials will put all court activities under the
supervision of the public and media, thus effectively preventing
the friends of alleged criminals trying to sway the opinions of
judges by bribery or other methods.
</P>
<P>
The practice can also help judges to maintain their personal
integrity, in addition to encouraging prosecutors, lawyers and
people's juries to play their proper parts in court.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said TV coverage of trials, including live broadcasts, is
a good way to educate people about law and legal work and should
be encouraged.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton appeared before a joint session of Congress
last night to present an ebullient vision of a nation enjoying
vast prosperity after six years under his leadership, a newfound
abundance that he said should be used to prepare for the burden of
a rapidly aging population in the next century.
</P>
<P>
-- With a blizzard of small initiatives and one big proposal on
Social Security, President Clinton last night tried again to
prevent the Republicans from occupying the political center ground
-- and to resuscitate his damaged presidency in the process.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton proposed Tuesday night that the Federal
Government invest for the first time in the stock market to
strengthen Social Security, as he delivered a confident report on
the State of the Union to a divided Congress considering cutting
short his Presidency.
</P>
<P>
-- King Hussein of Jordan, piloting his own plane, returned to
his kingdom after six months of cancer treatment in the United
states. His arrival prompted scenes of widespread jubilation, but
also speculation about who might succeed him.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Arguing before the Senate just hours before the president's
address to Congress, White House Counsel Charles Ruff denied
Clinton had committed perjury or obstructed justice. He said
prosecutors relied on flawed readings of the Constitution and the
facts of the Lewinsky case. Some senators found the presentation
effective, but one House prosecutor said it focused on details
rather than the overall picture.
</P>
<P>
-- A draft report on the Salt Lake City Olympics
influence-peddling scandal singles out a looming U.S. Department
</P>
<P>
of Justice criminal investigation as "the biggest potential
problem" facing the International Olympic Committee.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Norwegian Telecommunication Giants to Merge in Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's TELIA and Norway's
TELENOR, both their countries' largest state-run
telecommunication companies, will finalize their long-planned
merger this spring to create a transnational giant, said Swedish
Business Minister Bjoern Rosengren on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new company, expected to enter the market this autumn,
will have its headquarters in the Swedish capital, Stockholm,
while the Oslo branch will take responsibility for international
business.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the merger, the Swedish government will
hold 60 percent of the new company's shares and the Norwegian
government 40 percent. After selling 33.2 percent of the shares
to private investors, the two governments each will hold 33.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
TELENOR chief executive Tormond Hermansen will retain his post
in the new company while Sweden's Jan Stenberg will be chairman.
</P>
<P>
The two hope to expand the company's share of the
international telecommunications market through the merger and
the move could bring annual savings of two billion Swedish kronor
(152 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
TELIA and TELENOR have 50,000 employees and their total
turnover in 1997 reached 71 billion kronor (9.2 billion dollars).
TELIA holds a considerable market share in Finland and many Ba
ltic countries, while TELENOR is well established in Germany,
Austria and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: More Efforts for Peace in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The next couple of weeks will
see intensified diplomatic efforts in the region aimed at finding
a negotiated settlement of the long-standing Afghan imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United Nations, Pakistan and Central
Asian republics are to hold extensive consultations to review ways
and means to put an end to the 20-year civil war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Pakistani Foreign Office said Turkmenistan's
Foreign Minister Sheikh Muradov will pay a two-day visit to
Pakistan on January 26 and 27 for talks on the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
Muradov's trip to Pakistan is part of Islamabad's efforts to
coordinate with the Central Asian republics in efforts to restore
peace in war-shattered Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also invited foreign ministers of Iran, Kyrgyzstan
and Kazakhstan for talks on the Afghan issue, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They also said the U.N. secretary general's special envoy on
Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, will embark on an extensive tour of
Iran, Pakistan and Central Asian republics later this month or
next month as part of the efforts to find a solution to the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
It would be the envoy's second visit to the region in three
months. He visited Iran and Pakistan in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is also expected to meet Taliban leaders during his
trip.
</P>
<P>
One of the topics of his talks with Pakistani leaders would be
the proposed meeting of a "six plus two" group (Afghanistan's six
immediate neighbors plus Russia and the United States) in
Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will review the implementation of the "Points of
Common Understanding" reached at the last meeting of the group in
New York last September.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asian states are
trying to make the Tashkent meeting a success because previous
sittings on Afghanistan have yielded no constructive results.
</P>
<P>
Consultations have been under way among regional countries on
various matters relating to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
One of the topics for deliberation is invitation to the Taliban
to the meeting. The host country, Uzbekistan, has already extended
an invitation to the Islamic militia. However, the Taliban's
senior spokesman Maulvi Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil said in Islamabad
last month that the militia would attend the meeting if invited as
a government rather than a group.
</P>
<P>
Another item on the agenda would be investigation into the
killing of Iranian diplomats by the Taliban in the northern Afghan
town of Mazar-l-Sharif last August. The Taliban are reported to
have stopped investigation into the murder.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has intensified peace efforts following last
month's strong resolution of the Security Council, which threatens
 sanctions against the Taliban if the militia did not agree to the
establishment of a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-sponsored resolution urges both warring sides to
end fighting and peacefully resolve the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Closer Ties for Sino-U.S. Express Delivery Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The leading player in China's
express delivery service, the China National Foreign Trade
Transportation Corporation (Sinotrans), announced today that it
is to expand its long-term cooperation with the United Parcel
Service of the United States, in order to sharpen both their
competitive edges in the international express delivery sector.
</P>
<P>
Sinotrans, which first established working relations with UPS
in 1988, decided to broaden the links by establishing direct
cooperation in 22 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou
and Dalian, said Zhang Bin, vice-president of Sinotrans.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently signed MOU, the two sides will conduct
exchanges in information technology, personnel training and
management expertise, explained Zhang.
</P>
<P>
UPS will make its own computer system available for its
Chinese partner in order to improve the latter's service.
</P>
<P>
The domestic network dominated by Sinotrans and UPS' overseas
network both have their own unique advantages and can boost each
other's weak spots," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the closer ties with UPS will not
affect Sinotrans' cooperation with other major express delivery
service companies throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Sinotrans, which began its express delivery service in 1979
along with its joint ventures, has captured about half of China's
international express delivery business.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in HK Rise in 2nd Half of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Although the total number of
visitors to Hong Kong fell eight percent in 1998, arrivals of
visitors have increased from many markets since June last year,
the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The total arrivals for 1998 were 9.6 million, which was eight
percent fewer than those in 1997, according to figures released
by the HKTA today.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a significant growth of 7.5 percent in the
second half of 1998 over the same period in 1997, the HKTA said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998 alone, Hong Kong welcomed 936,914 visitors,
11.1 percent more than in December 1997 and the highest monthly
total since May 1997, the HKTA said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, most source markets registered increases in
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Thailand recorded the largest growth of 63 percent, due
probably to the two-week holiday over the Asian Games which might
have encouraged Thai consumers to travel overseas.
</P>
<P>
Most other shorthaul markets also showed increases in
arrivals, with those from Indonesia rising by 47.3 percent and
visitors from India growing by 39.9 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, the
Chinese mainland and the Philippines were up by 29.3 percent, 26
percent, 13.4 percent, 11 percent, 10.9 percent and 10.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
A range of factors, from low-price packages to stabilizing
currencies, helped boost outbound travel from most of these
markets.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the only shorthaul market to register a drop in
arrivals of 3.8 percent in December, caused by a lack of desire
to travel overseas due to the gloomy domestic economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Longhaul markets also showed improving arrivals figures in
December, with the number of visitors from Britain rising by 21
percent, from South Africa by 19.6 percent, from Canada by 17.7
percent and from the United States by 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong showing by most markets in December 1998,
the overall figures for the year were affected by the decline in
arrivals over the first six months.
</P>
<P>
The markets that showed year-on-year growth were the Chinese
mainland (up 13.1 percent), Canada (up 9.2 percent), India (up
4.2 percent), New Zealand (up 2.6 percent) and Taiwan (up 1.7
percent).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's average hotel occupancy rate for 1998 was the same
as for 1997, at 76 percent. However, the rate for December 1998
alone was 81 percent, up from just 69 percent in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Canada Says U.S. Threats Won't Stop Magazine Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Heritage Minister
Sheila Copps said Tuesday that Canadian cultural policies will
not be "dictated by the Americans."
</P>
<P>
The minister refused to withdraw a contentious bill that
prevents Canadian companies from advertising in American
"split-run" magazines, despite threats of retaliation from the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Copps said the Canadian federal government plans to adopt Bill
C-55 by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
"We think the bill on split-run magazines is defensible before
all international tribunals. Our intention is to proceed as
quickly as possible," He said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has warned Canada that it will hit back at
four key industries if Ottawa proceeds with plans to protect
Canadian magazines from cross-border competition.
</P>
<P>
On January 11, a top U.S. official gave Canada's ambassador in
Washington, Raymond Chretien, oral notice of U.S. plans to
retaliate by blocking some Canadian steel products, textiles and
apparel, wood products and plastics from access to the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
The costs of the proposed retaliatory measures are estimated
by Canadian officials over 3 billion Canadian dollars (1.95
billion U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government says the U.S. would be violating
international law if it proceeded with such massive retaliation,
well out of proportion to the 600 million Canadian dollars (390
million U.S. dollars annual value of all magazine advertising in
Canada.
</P>

Minister Copps also said she was not surprised the U.S.
threatened to retaliate. "They like to play hardball. It was to
be expected....but we are not going to have our cultural policies
dictated by the Americans," Copps said.
</P>
<P>
Copps tabled the legislation on October 8 in response to a
World Trade Organization decision last year that threw out
Canada's punitive 80% customs duty and tax on U.S. split-run
magazines. The old policy had been challenged by Washington as a
violation of international trade law.

<HEADLINE> S. African, EU Trade Negotiators to Meet in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South African and European
Union (EU) trade officials will meet in Davos, Switzerland, where
they will try to hammer out the final details of a free trade
agreement, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between South African Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin and EU commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro has been
provisionally set for January 29.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will coincide with a conference of the World
Economic Forum, which is to be attended by South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Finalization of the trade agreement has been stalled over the
EU's insistence that South African wine producers stop using the
terms "port" and "sherry" for their products.
</P>
<P>
EU officials were tight-lipped on Wednesday about the process
leading up to the Davos meeting, saying the negotiations were at a
very delicate stage, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
South African ambassador to Brussels Elias Links, who is in
South Africa for a foreign affairs conference, said outstanding
issues, other than the disagreement over port and sherry, would
take only a few days to finalize, according to SAPA.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Locates Alleged DPRK Sunken Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said on Wednesday
that it had located the submarine allegedly belonging to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) which was sunk by
the South Korean Navy last month.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean navy is preparing to recover the five-ton
submarine from South Korean waters 150 meters deep, about 100
kilometers south of Koje Island.
</P>
<P>
If weather permits, it would take a week or two to raise the
wreckage of the 12-meter-long vessel discovered some 450 meters
northwest of the point where it went down, said a South Korean
navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On December 18, the South Korean navy spotted the vessel off
the coast of the South Cholla province and sank it after a
seven-hour chase and shoot-out. It also discovered the body of an
alleged DPRK spy, with a hand grenade and a poison capsule. The
submarine was reportedly capable of carrying six crew members.
</P>
<P>
The following day, Pyongyang denied ownership of the vessel,
saying it was a plot by South Korea to discredit the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Pak-India Bus Service Brightens By-Road Trade Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The successful trial run of
bus service between Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, and
the Indian capital of New Delhi has brightened the chances of
by-road trade between the two South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India already began extensive parleys on bilateral
by-road trade a few months ago and they are likely to conclude
within this calendar year, official sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan put up the proposal of by-road trade in order to
stimulate export of sugar to India and the Indian side positively
responded to this idea and agreed to hold discussions on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
This option is still under consideration and both sides are
expected to take up this matter after the launching of the bus
service, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India agreed on December 3, 1998, to introduce the
 Lahore-New Delhi bus service which is expected to commence in
February as officials of the two countries have completed the
trial run this month.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the Commerce Ministry and Export Promotion Bureau of
Pakistan argued that Pak-Indian by-road trade was vital because it
would help eliminate the smuggling of goods across the border and
benefit the business community.
</P>
<P>
They said if the smuggling was minimized, both countries would
get revenue from the customs duty.
</P>
<P>
In the case of by-road trade between the two countries, the
businessmen of both sides would be able to save time and money,
the experts added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India trade nearly 100 items and the volume of
trade is around 250 million U.S. dollars, of which Pakistan's
exports account for 85 million to 95 million dollars and imports
150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The size of bilateral trade would double in a year if the two
countries succeeded in carrying out trade by road, said the
experts.

CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. satellite company
PanAmSat would use Sydney as its base to expand operations in
Asia, the New South Wales (NSW) government announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the world's leading provider of commercial satellites, the
company plans to have 24 satellites orbiting the planet by next
year, NSW Premier Bob Carr said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is another coup for our state, it is consolidating NSW as
a major international center, targeting Asian business."
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry More Efficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned textile
enterprises reduced losses by 2.6 billion yuan last year despite
a 22 billion yuan decrease in export revenue and a 15 billion
yuan decrease in domestic sales, the State Administration of Texti
le Industry (SATI) said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, profit-making textile enterprises increased profits
by one billion yuan, or 28 percent, over 1997, while loss-making
enterprises cut losses by 1.6 billion yuan, or 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
SATI Director Du Yuzhou said that the effective measures that
the Chinese government had taken ensured smooth progress in the
reform of state-owned textile enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government wrote off debts of 12 billion yuan run up by
state-owned textile enterprises last year and helped them
relocate 660,000 laid off workers. This move helped the
enterprises cut operational and financial costs by over six
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 5.12 million spindles were destroyed,
accounting for one-eighth of the country's production capacity of
cotton yarn.
</P>
<P>
Using debt write-off and subsidy as leverages, the government
encouraged the enterprises to restructure and merge. More than
half of the large and medium-sized cotton mills that had cut
production have been restructured and merged. As a result, the
asset-liability ratio of state-owned textile enterprises dropped
to 73 percent last year from 77 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the government's stimulating economic policies and
an eight percentage points drop in the price of products, Du
said, state-owned textile enterprises increased the
sales-production ratio to close on 100 percent in the second half
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Du said that China will continue to slash cotton yarn
production capacity by 4.4 million spindles this year. It will rel
ocate another 440,000 redundant textile workers and further
reduce the losses of state-owned textile enterprises by three
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to turmoil in the world economy and a 30
percent slump in labor costs in southeast Asian countries, China
suffered a 5.87 percent decrease in textile export revenue in
1998 after seeing two-digit growth of textile export in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
The director said that China will strive to secure a rebound
in textile exports this year. It will also exploit the potential
markets of industrial textiles and decorative textiles, as well
as tackling the potential of the rural market.
</P>
<P>
China charged its textile industry with the task of making
breakthroughs in the reform of large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises in 1998. It aims to reduce the number of spindles by
ten million and relocate 1.2 million redundant workers within
three years.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Securities Regulatory Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
today that China will continue this year to carry out the reform
of its securities regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), said that efforts will be made to prevent
stock market risks, reform and improve the ratification system
for stock issuance, while ensuring a healthy and stable market
development and boosting economic development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual national securities and futures working
conference in Beijing, Zhou said that 1999 is a critical year for
reaching the reform targets of state-owned enterprises. He added
that efforts should be made to take advantage of the stock
markets to support the reform and development of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Through listing on the stock markets state-owned enterprises
will be able to raise capital, transform their management
mechanisms and then restructure totally.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the quality of listed companies is the corners
tone for the healthy development of stock markets. "Effective
efforts must be made to improve the quality of newly-listed
companies while gradually solving the existing problems of
companies which have already been listed." he went on.
</P>
<P>
The clearing and adjustment of the securities and futures
markets will be carried on this year, he said, with the focus
being put on the standardization of the trading practices of
securities companies.
</P>
<P>
Zhou warned that credit balances must be deposited in
appointed commercial banks to prevent misappropriation, as
required by the Securities Law.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the emergence of the Securities Law is an
important event in China's securities regulatory work, he also
said it marks a new development for the market.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC will carry out a comprehensive check on existing
securities rules and regulations, while drawing up and perfecting
relevant rules and regulations to coordinate the sector.
</P>
<P>
Other major items on the CSRC's regulatory agenda include
reinforced supervision of the information availability on listed
companies; drawing up relevant regulations for the supervision of
listed companies' expenditure; and reinforced supervision of
security companies and various intermediary institutions.

<HEADLINE> UK's Lords Reform Begins with Plans for People's Peers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The British public will be
asked to nominate "people's peers" to sit in a new-look House of
Lords under proposals being unveiled in a government White Paper
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
People would be able to suggest candidates to a seven-member
Appointments Commission, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to counter Tory accusations that the
upper chamber will be filled with the prime minister's
appointees, mockingly known as "Tony's cronies".
</P>
<P>
The new commission would then consider the "special qualities"
up to 20 publicly nominated peers "could bring to the law-making
process".
</P>
<P>
The government is preparing to publish details of its plans
for the "first stage" of Lords reform. This will include removing
the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the Lords.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government will announce the membership
of the long-awaited Royal Commission which will examine the
options for longer-term changes to the second chamber.
</P>
<P>
Former Tory cabinet minister Lord Wakeham has been tipped to
become chairman of the Royal Commission on further Lords reform.
The commission is to be formally appointed later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Putting Lord Wakeham at its head could blunt Conservative
opposition to the overhaul of the upper chamber, observers say.

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
today called for the country's concerted effort to enable 10
million impoverished people have access to adequate food and
clothing by the year end and said fulfilling the task is crucial
to achieve the country's overall plan of eliminating poverty by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said China faces grave challenges in
achieving those goals in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters and other factors dragged down the income of
farmers last year and plunged those who had already become
better-off back into poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wen criticized some localities for lax efforts in tackling
this and urged earnest and determined implementation of the
responsibility system that holds local leading Party and
government officials accountable for the work.
</P>
<P>
While continuing increasing financial input to support the
campaign to eliminate poverty, attention must be paid to ensure
that poor areas in central and western regions get more major
capital construction projects, including infrastructure involving
transport and water conservancy, said Wen.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of funds for poverty relief should be tightened
and those who divert or misuse these special funds must be
severely disciplined, the vice-premier said.

HANGZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province, which has the longest coastline in the country, has
pushed forward smoothly with a massive effort to strengthen its
sea-walls, safeguarding more than 16 million people and 400,000
hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has finished reinforcing some 300
kilometers, greatly improving its ability to withstand strong
typhoons.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang borders on the East China Sea and has suffered from
typhoons and other climatic and oceanic disasters throughout
history. One of the worst typhoons happened in 1994, claiming
over 1,200 lives and causing 12.4 billion yuan of direct
financial losses.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the provincial government mapped out an ambitious
plan, pledging to rebuild or reinforce all the sea-walls, a total
of 1,732 km., along the eastern coast before the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province allocated more than one billion yuan
into this effort.
</P>
<P>
Systems of public bidding and supervision have been
established to ensure the quality and efficiency of the projects.
</P>
<P>
This year, another 370 km. is scheduled to be completed.

director of the Institute of Transitional Economy and a key
figure in the center-right coalition, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Primakov government had already made
several mistakes, the worst one being its soft position on tax
collection.
</P>
<P>
He believed that by agreeing to restructure or swap debts and
to repay part of the debts "in kind," the government had issued a
strong signal that "payments may be evaded altogether."
</P>
<P>
Gaidar's bleak prediction was a far cry from that of First
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who said Tuesday that the
ruble's rate, now at 22.39 to the dollar, should be 18-19 to the
dollar.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Exchange Turnover Hits 51.96 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China had a total turnover of
51.96 billion U.S. dollars at its foreign exchange market last
year, according to official statistics of the Shanghai-based
China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
</P>
<P>
The total value included 48.84 billion U.S. dollars, 19.6
billion Hong Kong dollars, and 75.56 billion Japanese yen.
Currently, only the above three currencies are traded on China's
national foreign exchange market in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The US dollar closed the last trading day of 1998 at 8.2789
yuan, and the Hong Kong dollar ended at 1.0861 yuan, both falling
slightly from a year earlier. The Japanese currency finished at
7.2053 yuan per 100 yen, compared at 6.3525 one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the yuan's stable value, amid a turbulent
international financial market, to China's foreign trade surplus,
rational foreign exchange system, strict exchange control under
the capital account, reasonable foreign debt size and structure,
and effective macro control of the central bank, the People's
Bank of China.

<HEADLINE> Premier Pledges Continued Anti-smuggling Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today
cautioned customs and anti-smuggling forces against complacency
and said that it is a protracted and arduous task that allows no
slackening off in vigilance.
</P>
<P>
Talking to customs officers in the city of Xiamen in southeast
China's province of Fujian, Zhu said the national crackdown on
smuggling activities has achieved significant successes, which
have had substantial deterrent effects on the culprits.
</P>
<P>
But they are still very active, using increasingly more
sophisticated methods and once we drop our vigilance they will
stage a come-back, said the premier. "There will no ultimate
victory over smuggling."
</P>
<P>
The customs and police involved in combating smuggling must be
armed with most advanced equipment, but more important is to
ensure the quality and high standards of staff.
</P>
<P>
Severe punishment must be meted out to those involved in
corruption to guarantee that customs forces are the "iron wall"
safeguarding the country's economic safety, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The premier is on a fact finding tour in eastern Fujian
Province which began on January 15. He has talked to customs
officials, made inquiries about the re-employment of laid-off
workers and called on poor farmers, the disabled and teachers
and pupils.
</P>
<P>
He said introducing the strategy to reduce redundant
work-force in the state sector to raise efficiency and help
laid-off workers find new jobs is to build an important mechanism
for China's socialist market economy. Only when the new
mechanism is established and maintained, can the state
enterprises be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
Local financial departments should allocate adequate funding
in their budgets to guarantee the basic living standards of the
layoffs, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He also passed on president Jiang Zemin's New Year greetings
to the local officials and people.

<HEADLINE> Meeting with International Advisers Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa said here today he had "stimulating and encouraging
discussions" with members of his Council of International
Advisers.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural meeting of the council discussed Asia's
adjustment to the financial turmoil and the long-term development
strategy of Hong Kong, the chief executive told a press briefing
shortly after the seven-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tung said members of the council gave detailed analysis of the
economic situation and outlook in the United States, Europe and
Japan, and remained "cautious" about these economies.
</P>
<P>
He said the members agreed that there are no quick fixes for
the economies hit by the Asian financial turmoil, including Hong
Kong. The members pointed out the "urgent need for a new
international financial architecture" and the relevance of Hong
Kong's experience in its design.
</P>
<P>
The members noted the vast opportunities open to Hong Kong as
a result of the economic growth in the Chinese mainland and Hong
Kong's determination to enhance its role as a regional financial
center, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The members are "acutely conscious of the need to uphold the
free market and a level playing field for both local and overseas
investors," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Tung, the members advised the government of the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) on the improvement of
education, English language standards, environment and the
quality of life in Hong Kong in an effort to attract foreign
investors and talents.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he has confidence that Hong Kong will realize its
vision to become a premier international city in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong should further improve its
competitiveness by lowering cost, maintaining monetary and
banking stability and other measures.
</P>
<P>
The council, chaired by Tung, comprises such distinguished
international business leaders as Rupert Murdoch, as well as
several senior officials of the SAR government. The meeting will
be convened at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive announced the setting-up of the council in
his policy address last October.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Bug May Help Boost Australian Economy in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian economists have
said that the looming Year 2000 millennium (Y2K) bug may have a
positive spin-off, as the billions of dollars spent to fix the
computer problem will boost the country's economy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Amid a gloomy assessment of Australia's economic outlook,
independent forecaster Access Economics said the so-called Y2K
bug, expected to cause chaos among confused computer systems when
the year 2000 arrives, could offer a bright spot, the Australian
Associated Press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that up to 10 billion Australian dollars (6.4
billion U.S. dollars) will have to be spent in Australia to deal
with the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Expenditure to try to fix the problem will boost activity in
1999," Access Economics' January Economics Monitor said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem arises because most computer software uses only
two digits to specify the year.
</P>
<P>
This means that 2000 will appear as 00, which may be
interpreted as 1900, throwing a wide range of computer operations
into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Access Economics has advised its businesses to fix potential
problems, but said it doubted a world recession would result from
the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
"Given the publicity and extent of corrective spending it seems
unlikely that there will be severe problems generally," it said.
</P>
<P>
"There may be temporary disruptions, some firms may get it
wrong and some emerging countries may have severe problems."
</P>
<P>
"However, temporary disruptions -- like the Victorian gas
crisis -- while annoying at the time, have little impact on
activity as lost output is made up."

<HEADLINE> American Scholar: China, US Should Be Partners, Not Rivals (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China imposes no threat to the
United States or to other countries because it needs a peaceful
environment to improve its economy and people's lives, an
American scholars has said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Ross, a research associate at Harvard University's
Fairbank Center and a professor of Political Science at Boston
College, told Xinhua recently that a person needs to know the
history and the reality of China if one wants to better
understand what this country is doing.
</P>
<P>
Ross is the author of six books and nearly 40 articles on
China and has been to most parts the country.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China seems like a "complicated book" with a
lot more to be read, and has become a topic of worldwide
interest, with its fast growing economy and influence in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the United States and China have decided to
establish a constructive and strategic partnership, he says, but
some people in the United States still agonize over China's
development and oppose the U.S. policy of "constructive
engagement".
</P>
<P>
Calls for greater pressures on China were even heard not long
ago when the U.S. House of Representatives accused China of
"stealing" U.S. military technology through economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The book "The Coming Conflict with China", which was published
in the U.S. in 1997, asserted that China will be the U.S.'s
biggest rival and that there could even be a war between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ross does not agree with the viewpoint of that book and says
that the U.S. and China should be partners instead of rivals.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Ross and another China hand, Andrew Nathan, published
"The Great Wall and the Empty Fortress", which analyses China's
history, culture, geopolitics, strength, security strategy, and
policy-making process.
</P>
<P>
His conclusion is that China would not be a threat to the
United States because China's strategy is defensive and the
country needs to maintain a peaceful environment to develop its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Their book is intended to give ordinary Americans a better
understanding of China, Ross said, suggesting that the two
countries' common interest in politics, economy and security
outweighs differences in human rights, trade, weapons,and other
areas.
</P>
<P>
He does acknowledge the big differences between the U.S. and
China in social values, human rights,and other areas,but says
that the question is,should these differences be obstacles or
something to be surmounted in the pursuit of the shared interests.
</P>
<P>
In the "most sensitive issue", Taiwan, Ross said that the
United States should be prudent in dealing with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He is much impressed by the changes in China in the past
twenty years. The biggest change is the improvement in the
quality of life and the emancipation of Chinese minds.

MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The gastroscopic test performed
on Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday showed that
internal bleeding had stopped, the inflammation of the tissue had
vanished and the first signs of recovery had appeared, president
ial spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.

Yeltsin, 67, was rushed to the Central Clinical Hospital
Sunday for acute gastric ulcer bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said doctors recommended that the medicinal course
of treatment be continued and some restrictions on Yeltsin's
physical activity had been relaxed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin may now walk by himself in his ward and work behind
his desk, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Basketball Super League to Be Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was announced here Wednesday by Carl Men Ky Ching,
president of the Asian Basketball Confederation and chairman of
Asian Professional Basketball Management &AMP; Development Co. LTD.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenal excitement, success and popularity of the
National Basketball Association (NBA) in North America over the
past decade have, in recent years, also spread like wildfire
across Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
ABSL, primed to begin its operation on June 7 and end on July
15, will be a stepping stone for Asian basketball teams to meet
world-class standards.
</P>
<P>
But unlike NBA, ABSL, sanctioned by the Asian Basketball
Confederation, is comprised of different teams from Asia rather
than from different national and regional teams. Therefore, it
will be more exciting for Asian basketball fans from different
countries and regions to watch the league and support their teams.
</P>
<P>
There will be eight teams representing countries and regions
from China, Korea, Japan, Chinese Taipei, the Philippines,
Thailand, China's Hong Kong and Singapore (or a united star team
from Singapore and Indonesia).
</P>
<P>
The eight teams will be divided into two groups and each team
will play one another twice in three different stops. The top
four teams will sail into best-of-three semifinals and the
winners of the semifinals will vie for the champions in best of
five.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Commends Police for Re-capture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday congratulated the police on the re-arrest
of the country' s most wanted fugitive, Colin Chauke.
</P>
<P>
"Achievements like this are a product of the dedication of men
and women of integrity who are determined that we win the war
against the criminals," Mandela's office said in a statement
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the re-arrest of Chauke was a mark of the determination
of the government and police to take whatever measures necessary
to apprehend those who commit crime, especially the syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Chauke, believed to be a cash-in-transit heist kingpin, was
re-captured Tuesday night in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, in the north
of the country.
</P>
<P>
He has been on the run since December 1997 when he and five
other dangerous prisoners escaped from a Pretoria prison.
</P>
<P>
After his appearance in Pretoria Magistrate's Court on
Wednesday, his case was postponed until June 1. The judge ordered
that he be held in the high security section of Pretoria Central
Prison.
</P>
<P>
Chauke, a former member of the African National Congress armed
wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), was arrested in
October 1997 in connection with a 12.6-million-Rand
(2.1-million-U.S. dollar) cash-in- transit robbery.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to be also linked to several other such
robberies.
</P>
<P>
In January last year, barely a month after his escape, Chauke
made news headlines when he allegedly attended a 40th birthday
party of deputy environmental affairs and tourism minister, Peter
Mokaba.

<HEADLINE> Somali Clans Accuse One Another of Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The hostility in Somalia's
southern port town of Kismayu takes a new turn as warring factions
started killing prisoners of war while the opposing militiamen of
Marehan and Majerten clans continue their military building up on
the outskirts of the town for even more serious clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Majerten militiamen loyal to General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi
Morgan who now control the town of Kismayu have issued a statement
accusing those of the Marehan Somali National Front (SNF) faction
of killing nine out of the 12 Majerten prisoners of war captured
two weeks ago during fighting for control of the town.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners which include a 11-year-old boy were killed in
public four days ago, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Morgan's side claimed that they still keep SNF prisoners of war
and treated them well in Kismayu, saying Morgan's fighters will
not take any vengeance action against the Marehans they are
holding .
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in south Mogadishu Wednesday, SNF
spokesman Ibrahim Jama Howleh strongly denied the Majerten
allegations saying the 42 prisoners of war captured in Kismayu by
their forces are now held in their custody safely.
</P>
<P>
"This accusation just means that they now want to kill those
civilians (the Marehan prisoners of war)," said Howleh.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the situation, Howleh said his men have captured 17
prisoners in the December fighting and another 25 early in
January, and they are all held in the Jilib town area of Middle
Jubba region. Howleh has called on the International Committee
for the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Somali Red Crescent Society to
come and collect all 42 prisoners of General Morgan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong controversial statements, independent
sources speculate that at least five prisoners of war from both
sides were killed in and outside Kismayu town, 500 km south of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Despite these allegations and counter allegations, the town of
Kismayu is now calm, but volatile. However, preparations from
both sides are under way for a most probably decisive attack
against each other for the control of Kismayu. The last armed
confrontation on January 6 had left 35 people dead and over 100
others wounded.

BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Two NATO generals who visited
Belgrade Tuesday told NATO ambassadors that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic showed "no flexibility" over the crisis in
Kosovo, AFP reported.
</P>
<P>
The French news agency quoted a NATO official as saying that
the two generals, Wesley Clark and Klause Neumann, reported that
Milosevic had been inflexible and shown "little willingness" to
cooperate with the international community or to honor his
commitments under the peace deal struck by Milosevic and the U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke last October.
</P>
<P>
NATO ambassadors have reportedly failed to come up with
concrete measures in response to Milosevic's tough stance.
</P>
<P>
They repeated their call for Belgrade to respect their
commitments and said they would continue to review possible
action, "in support of political efforts" for the settlement of
the crisis, the NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is ruled out," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a late-night statement, Milosevic's office said he
insisted on Yugoslavia's "legitimate right to combat terrorism"
in Kosovo.

<P>
Monthly sales of digital cameras at the Xidan Department
Store, one of the largest in Beijing, have averaged ten, most of
them being bought by people from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
There were about 2 million sold worldwide in 1996 and in 1997,
almost the same amount was sold in the United States as
traditional cameras.
</P>
<P>
At a recent international photo equipment show in Beijing,
Japanese brand digital cameras from Ricoh, Canon, Sony, and
Olympus attracted a great deal of attention, China Tourism News
reports, and 38 foreign companies are now selling the cameras in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The manufacture of digital cameras is also under way in China.
The Shanghai-based Sea Gull Camera Factory, one of the largest in
China, has successfully developed China's first generation of
digital camera -- Sea Gull DC-33, which went on sale last October.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Phoenix Optical Co. Ltd., another leading photographic
apparatus maker, has now also begun research to develop digital
photographic equipment. However, a company spokesman said that at
present it has no plans to manufacture them as it would require
massive capital outlay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma Naizong, a senior salesman of Beijing
Photographic Apparatus Trade and Service Center, also a leader in
the field, said his company does not at present attach too much
importance to digital camera sales.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he himself has sold two to middle school
students who are interested in computer and digital photography
and he agreed that this may be indicative of future trends.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese are still using
fully-automatic cameras, especially Japanese brands, but photo
buffs are thinking of a more expensive state-of-the-art digital
model.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest camera market, selling 11 million
cameras in 1998, or about an eighth of the world's total. This
year's sales are expected to reach 12 million, the State
Administration of Machinery Industry (SAMI)says, and the market
is far from being tapped to its full, with only 30 cameras for
every 100 urban families and fewer than 3 sets for every 100
rural households. SAMI estimates that annual demand for digital
cameras will be one million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
As living standards improve and more Chinese buy computers,
digital cameras are expected to be more common, according to Sun
Changji, the vice-director of SAMI.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts predict that production techniques will mature
and costs will go down. Most digital cameras now cost from 2,000
yuan (240 U.S. dollars) to 10,000 yuan in China. The most
sophisticated ones cost a million yuan. These are mainly used by
journalists, passport offices, by advertisers, insurance
companies, and in medical use.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency, Chinas largest news organization, is one
of the pioneers and a leading user of digital cameras. It started
with 12 of them to cover the return of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997,
and has bought 30 of them ranging in price from 100,000 yuan to
120,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua is aware of the competition and plans to equip each of
its 31 home bureaus and major foreign bureaus with a digital
camera, according to Kong Lumin, the director of supplies at
Xinhua's Photo Division.
</P>
<P>
Sogo, the Sino-Japanese department store that opened in
Beijing last June has sold all five of its Ricoh digital cameras
that it had and got two more this week, but they remain cautious
because the market is not clear, according to Liu Liansheng, head
of Sogo's photograph equipment counter.

BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese prosecutors recovered
4.38 billion yuan in direct economic losses for the state and
collective enterprises as a result of the anti-corruption
campaign carried out in 1998, according to a senior prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors "focused on major and important corruption cases"
during the year, said Zhao Dengju, deputy procurator-general of
China's Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP).
</P>

Standards for so-called "major cases" include bribery
involving over 50,000 yuan and the misappropriation of 100,000
yuan or more in public funds. Important cases, on the other hand,
refer to corruption involving officials at and above the county
level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that prosecutors investigated 9,389 "major
cases" and 1,820 "important cases" in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhao noted that prosecutors also joined law enforcement
agencies in investigations involving smuggling and illegal
foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors intensified the campaign against corruption and
dereliction of duty as part of an effort to help promote the
reform of state-owned enterprises, as well as the financial,
grain, housing and medical care systems.
</P>
<P>
A number of officials were prosecuted for selling government
positions. Zhao specifically cited the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region where corrupt officials sold positions as "assistant
mayors" to managers and owners of private businesses.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also investigated a number of cases involving
embezzlement, as well as the misappropriaton of disaster relief
funds earmarked for the victims of last summer's record flooding
in the areas along the Yangtze River and Songhua and Nengjiang
rivers in Northeast China.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Party Leader to Sue Truth Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Wednesday
that he would sue the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
over an affidavit by an amnesty applicant which complicated him.
</P>
<P>
The affidavit was made by Andries Matanzima Nosenga, a
25-year-old amnesty applicant for the1992 Boipatong massacre.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said in a statement on Wednesday: "The TRC itself
solicited the affidavit rather than waiting for the applicant to
come forward, and in doing so ignored the applicant's own lawyer,
who was not informed or present when the affidavit was taken."
</P>
<P>
The IFP said it had information that the applicant had not
applied for amnesty, and the TRC approached him for a statement.
</P>
<P>
Nosenga's affidavit implicated the police and senior IFP
officials. He claimed that he attended a rally in Ulundi,
KwaZulu-Natal, about a month after the massacre, during which
Buthelezi personally thanked those who carried out the attack for
a job well done.
</P>
<P>
Nosenga also claimed the massacre was a joint operation of IFP
 militants and members of the South African police.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45 people were killed in the cold blood massacre on
June 17, 1992 in Boipatong, south of Johannesburg. Even a
four-month-old baby was not spared. The massacre, which was the
most notorious incident in clashes between political parties in
the early 1990s, also left scores of people injured.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's statement denied the allegations of the affidavit.
He said he had never congratulated anyone for any crime, nor had
he authorized or condoned any gross violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said: "No wonder that Nosenga stated what the biased
TRC has wanted to hear for so many years, namely allegations
against me.
</P>
<P>
"My lawyers are suing the TRC because there is no evidence to
support its statements that I was in any way involved in gross
violations of human rights, and it seems that the TRC is now going
to the desperate extreme of fabricating such evidence itself."
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the TRC had nothing to do with a judicial
process in which evidence and allegations could be tested and
contradicted.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can say what he or she wishes with impunity,
especially if it is what the TRC wants to hear."
</P>
<P>
TRC spokesman Mdu Lembede said Nosenga's amnesty application
was received by the TRC on August 25, 1996. Lembede said an
affidavit was attached to the application Nosenga made from
Leeuwkop prison. The affidavit was dated June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lembede said the IFP was represented at the amnesty hearing
currently under way in Vanderbijlpark and lawyers were free to
cross-examine Nosenga on his affidavit.
</P>
<P>
All documents related to the Boipatong massacre were made
public during a public hearing in Vanderbijlpark in August 1998,
Lembede said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- MOZAL, the Mozambican Aluminum
plant, Tuesday fired some 400 striking workers from Concor Ltd.
attached to MOZAL.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican News Agency Wednesday reported the strike has
been the second since last July when the plant was started. The
first one took place last November when the workers demanded that
their wages be raised and their status be improved.
</P>
<P>
MOZAL workers earned 24,992 Metical (some two U.S. Dollars) in
average per day.
</P>
<P>
With some 3,000 workers in Boane County, some 30 kilometers
from capital Maputo, MOZAL is run by the South Africans. The
1.2-billion-U.S. Dollar project is the biggest of the joint
ventures recently launched.
</P>
<P>
The strike began Monday because the workers wanted wage
increment and the same benefits as their South African
counterparts have been enjoying.
</P>
<P>
The strikers held as hostages some 30 managerial people of
Concor Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The MOZAL denied the demands from the striking workers, arguing
that their action was illegal.
</P>
<P>
But the management decided to give each fired employee a
compensation worth pay for one week.
</P>
<P>
However, the workers said they wanted a compensation worth
their wages for six months.

BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hu Ming, 27, survived
life-threatening injuries and was discharged Tuesday from the
Chaoyang Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hu was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach area while attempting
to apprehend a thief on December 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hu's blood pressure dropped from a high of 40 to a low of 20
during the trip to the hospital. The injured man was listed in
critical condition due to the loss of bodily functions resulting
from the excessive loss of blood.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons saved Hu's life by immediately administering a blood
transfusion of over 20,000 milliliters of fresh blood and
removing both his right kidney and gallbladder. Doctors worked
intently to restore the normal function of Hu's blood
circulation, respiratory and digestive systems.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of victims suffering from related injuries
stands at 95 percent. The successful surgery and treatment
accorded Hu clearly indicated that Beijing hospitals have reached

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Organizers Hope for More IOC Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haggman, from Finland, became the first IOC member to resign
following allegations of corruption by IOC delegates in relation
to Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
She was one of 13 IOC delegates under investigation over
allegations they were bribed to vote for Salt Lake City, and
Sydney wants action taken to remove others "on the take".
</P>
<P>
"A number of other people, I'm hopeful, will see the writing
on the wall and put in their resignation," Sydney Olympics
organizing committee president Michael Knight told ABC radio
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Games organizers are worried about the possible damage
the IOC scandal will cause to the 2000 Olympics, including
attempts to raise a further 200 mill ion Australian dollars (128
million U.S. dollars) in sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
"From Sydney's point of view, although there are no
allegations that the Sydney bid was anything other than clean, we
are trying to run the next Olympic Games," said Knight, who is
also Olympics Minister.
</P>
<P>
"We need that resolved and we need it resolved quickly."
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Australian Olympics officials
have sent a strongly worded message to the IOC to clean up its
act. Australian IOC board member Kevan Gosper would take the
message to an IOC meeting in Switzerland this wee nd.
</P>
<P>
Knight has urged the IOC to change the bidding process and
appoint a small group to choose host cities rather than all its
delegates.
</P>
<P>
Sydney insisted its bid for the 2000 Games was above board,
and a SOCOG (Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games)
spokesman has dismissed claims by a former Adelaide lord mayor
that the bidding process for the games was not clean.
</P>
<P>
Former Adelaide Mayor Steve Condous said overseas Commonwealth
Games officials asked the unsuccessful Adelaide 1998 bid team to
pay for tertiary education for their children in return for their
votes.
</P>
<P>
The SOCOG spokesman said the organizing committee was
satisfied with assurances from bid organizers regarding the
integrity of the bid.
</P>
<P>
"We are not aware of any knowledge or evidence that ...
(Condous) or anyone e lse has of any corruption in the Sydney
bid," he said.

LUANDA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Head of Angola's superior
council of opposition parties Ndongala Garcia left here Wednesday
for Europe to seek international support in its anti-Savimbi
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Garcia told the press before his departure that he will visit
France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and contact with the
political and diplomatic circles there in a bid to win their
sympathy toward the peace cause in Angola and stop their moral and
material support to the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) led by its chairman Jonas Savimbi who is termed
by the Angolan government as a "war criminal".
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who is also leader of the People's Reunification Party
of Angola, said he will ask the Hague International Court to try
Savimbi as war criminal and sue him on human rights violation as
Chile's former dictator Augusto Pinochet is currently treated by
some countries.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan official appealed to the security institutions of
all countries to arrest Savimbi wherever he is spotted so that he
can pay for the war crimes he has committed.
</P>
<P>
Garcia noted that he will also meet leaders of overseas
Angolans and tell them the true situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Does IMF Bailout Package Mean to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The ailing Pakistani economy
is finally on a respirator after the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved a bailout package, for which Pakistan had been
waiting with great anxiety.
</P>
<P>
After long-drawn negotiations, The IMF Executive Board on
January 15 agreed to assume the economic assistance package for
this South Asian nation beset with unprecedented economic
difficulties due to the sanctions triggered by its detonation of
nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The revival of the suspended Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility/Extended Fund Facility (ESAF/EFF) arrangement finally put
an end to the uncertainty that had prevailed about the
availability of foreign assistance since Pakistan's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged uncertainty and continued suspension of foreign
aid had brought Pakistan's credit rating to a very low level and
this Muslim nation has remained on the verge of debt default for
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the IMF decision, Pakistan's Finance Minister Ishaq
Dar said the revival of the IMF package will boost the country's
economy and restore investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is on path to macroeconomic stability and turning
around from the situation after the May 28 nuclear tests is a
great achievement of the Pakistan Muslim League government," Dar
said.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the IMF loan package was also widely welcomed
by Pakistan's business community, which called it "a vote of
confidence" in the government's efforts to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the business sector believe that Pakistan's
foreign trade, which saw a dramatic decline during the first half
(July to December) of the current fiscal year, is likely to be an
immediate beneficiary of the IMF loan package.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's imports have been continuously falling since last
June as banks are hesitant to open letters of credit while their
confirmation charges have gone up to 8 percent due to the fragile
position of the country's foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that during the first half of 1998-99,
Pakistan's imports were valued at 4.39 billion U.S. dollars,
registering a decline of more than 19 percent over the same period
of the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan's export earnings during the period dropped
by 12.4 percent to a mere 3.84 billion dollars because of the
country's economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF package, Pakistan will get a total of 575 million
dollars immediately which, analysts believe, will improve the
country's foreign exchange reserve position and boost the
performance of its foreign trade sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the buildup in the foreign exchange reserves might be
temporary as the government has to use most of the money to pay
its huge debt arrears.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif may
see the IMF's decision as a victory for itself, although the IMF
has made it clear that it would hold Pakistan on a short leash of
mutually agreed conditions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the IMF package will provide only
some temporary relief to Pakistan in paying the debt arrears that
the country has accumulated in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, with its foreign debt amounting to more than 33
billion dollars, has long been under the increasing pressure of
servicing its huge debt. It is believed that all the cash receipts
from now on from donors may not be sufficient even to clear the
outstanding dues.
</P>
<P>
What is really worrying is the tough conditions attached to the
package which have not been disclosed despite the commitment of
both the Pakistani government and the IMF to openness and
transparency.
</P>
<P>
Doubts persist about Pakistan's ability to implement some of
the vital conditions such as the recovery of bank loans, the
reduction of budget deficit in proportion to the GDP, a sizable
increase in revenues, acceleration of the process of
privatization, enforcement of sales tax at the retail level as
well as increase in power and gas tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The long-talked devaluation of the local currency, the rupee,
another important condition set by the IMF, will certainly come
about in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts maintained that the government of the Pakistan Muslim
League, which came to power in February 1997, might not have the
political will to implement some of these conditions while popular
resistance could be formidable to others.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, what the government needs to do is to
restructure the economy so as to remove macroeconomic imbalances
to ensure a sustainable growth, achieve a measure of self-reliance
and reduce dependence on external assistance for debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Suspicious of Burglaries Around Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Wednesday that a series of
breaking-ins happening in the offices of aides to opposition
leader Ehud Barak here and Washington may be a scheme designed to
embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
One day after a second burglary in less than a week took place
in Washington at the office of an American campaign advisor to
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, Netanyahu told Israeli Radio that
all these incidents look "strange."
</P>
<P>
After a file containing "research material" on Barak's
campaign for premiership in the May election was found stolen
from the office of American pollster Stanley Greenberg early
Tuesday morning, some aides to Barak said it's no doubt that
Barak's opponents have done all these.
</P>
<P>
"Last week we thought it was a coincidence, which maybe had
nothing to do with the Israeli political scene," U.S. political
consultant Steve Rabinowitz, who is working for the Barak
campaign, was quoted by the local daily Haaretz as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But now it's clear beyond a shadow of doubt that there's no
coincidence. Barak's opponents did this, and it's a scandal," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest burglary took place after security was beefed up in
Greenberg's office following last week's break-in, during which
petty cash and office supplies as well as a diskette containing
information on Barak's campaign were missing.
</P>
<P>
After that incident, five local aides to Barak, two
secretaries and three campaign activists, reported to police here
that their offices had also been broken in.
</P>
<P>
They said nothing was stolen in all the five cases, but it's
obvious some documents relating to Barak's campaign had been
copied.
</P>
<P>
Barak has refrained from pointing his fingers toward Likud or
any other political rivals, just saying that the Labor is waiting
for results of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud Party, which was stung by the insinuation that it
is somehow involved, lashed out Tuesday night at the Labor, saying
the break-in was "a cheap provocation to frame the Likud."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sees Return of Foreign Confidence: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is in a better
position this year to stimulate its economy with the return of
foreign confidence in the country, Second Finance Minister Mustapa
Mohamed said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia can expect more foreign investments in various
economic sectors with the growing confidence in Malaysia among
foreign leaders and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders and businessmen in foreign countries have
voiced support for the measures taken by Malaysia to kick-start
its battered economy, Mustapa told reporters at his Eid al-Fitr
Open House in Jeli, the northern state of Kelantan, according to
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his recent visit to European countries,
some European leaders lauded Malaysia's measures which had yielded
positive effects on the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said his counterparts from Germany, Japan and Thailand
expressed confidence in Malaysia's economic initiatives after
listening to his explanation.
</P>
<P>
With an improved economic and political situation this year,
Malaysia should strive to redeem its image to effectively
jump-start its economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said the loan of 300 million U.S. dollars which the
World Bank provided to Malaysia in the middle of last year also
contributed to the country's socioeconomic recovery as the money
was used to re-start small businesses which were badly-hit by the
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The government's radical measures had also proven to be
effective in restoring foreign confidence in efforts to revive the
economy, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prosecutors Investigate Bridge Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese prosecutors have
launched an intensive investigation of three high-ranking local
officials allegedly involved in the collapse of a southwest China
bridge which killed 40 people.
</P>
<P>
The three officials have been detained and charged with taking
bribes and dereliction of duty, said Zhao Dengju, deputy
procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, at a
press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The officials are Lin Shiyuan, 37, vice-secretary of Jijiang
County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Zhang Jibu, 49,
director of the county's Urban and Suburban Construction
Commission; and Sun Li, 34, deputy director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The heavy death toll resulting from the collapse of a
100-meter bridge in Qijiang County, Chongqing, shocked the
nation. The collapse of the bridge, which was built a short three
years ago, killed 40 people and left 14 injured.
</P>
<P>
Lin has been charged with accepting bribes and dereliction of
duty, with Zhang and Sun Li facing charges of dereliction of
duty, according Zhao.
</P>
<P>
The local public security bureau has also detained four people
responsible for designing constructing the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said prosecutors are engaged in an extensive
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Spain Opposes Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes y Juan said here on Wednesday that his country opposed
military intervention as a means to bring a settlement to the
conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bombing Serb military installations in Kosovo was "not the
way to settle the crisis", and the international community should
reach an agreement over resolving the crisis, Matutes said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had called U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and they agreed that the international
community should impose pressure on the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
But the Western allies must first deal with their own
differences and take Russia's stance over the issue into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Matutes also criticized his Yugoslav counterpart, Zivadi
Jovanovic, over the escalation of the Kosovo crisis. Last week,
Jovanovic expressed the hope that the crisis could be solved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The United States had threatened to use force against
Yugoslavia after 45 ethnic Albanians were found killed last week
in the Kosovo village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgrade asked William Walker, an American
diplomat, to leave Yugoslavia within 48 hours on Tuesday,
declaring him persona non grata after Walker blamed Yugoslav
security forces for the killings.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Join Regional Organization as Observer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will soon join as an
observer in the Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand
Economic Cooperation, Nepali Foreign Secretary Murari Raj Sharma
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that all the members of the
organization have supported Nepal's entry as an observer.
</P>
<P>
The organization established some years ago has identified six
areas of cooperation among the member states such as tourism,
infrastructure, trade, investment and energy, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the long-standing issue of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, he
said his country is prepared to hold the eighth round of
ministerial meeting with Bhutan to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
"But we have not got any information from the Bhutanese side,"
he added. "We're waiting for the agenda of the Bhutanese side to
be discussed during the meeting to be held in Nepal."
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan had agreed to resume ministerial talks on the
refugee issue in Kathmandu in January 1999. The talks have been
stalled since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eastern Nepal
after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989 and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Sharma said the date for the 11th summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to be held in
Kathmandu later this year will be decided by the SAARC Council of
Ministers which will meet in Sri Lanka in March.
</P>
<P>
He said the SAARC summit should be issue-oriented with focus on
the economic aspect rather than ceremonial in nature.
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 to promote the economic and
social development of its seven member states -- Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua)-- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Due to low prices of gasoline in Iran, gasoline
smuggling from Iran to its neighbors has become the most
profitable illegal trade second to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian official said on Tuesday that the illegal exporting
of 5,000 liters of gasoline using a motor boat from Iran to its
southern neighbors would bring the trafficker some 1,200
U.S. dollars in profits.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that the
price of gasoline in some countries neighboring Iran is up to 22
times higher than that in Iran.

<P>
The smuggling of gasoline to Gulf states is conducted via motor
boats while large amount of gasoline is hauled across the
Iran-Turkey border with mules, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no report about the exact number of gasoline
smuggled every year.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Marcoses to Speak as One on Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the heirs of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos should first talk to the government in one voice
before talks on recovering the family's alleged ill-gotten wealth
start.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Laguna, 30 kilometers south
of Manila, Estrada said that while he hopes to seal a compromise
agreement with the Marcoses within this year, talks on the wealth
issue cannot start until they can come to the negotiating table as
one.
</P>
<P>
Former first lady Imelda Marcos and her three children should
agree on the terms they want to discuss with the government so the
negotiations can proceed smoothly, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he expects Imelda Marcos and her son,
Governor Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of Ilocos Norte, to meet in two
week's time in a bid to come up with a uniform position on the
matter of forging a compromise settlement with the government.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that so far, only the young Marcos has sought an
audience with him but they have not discussed anything substantial
 yet.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that he will make public any proposed
agreement that he can reach with the Marcoses so they can
scrutinize the details before any signing takes place.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he told the young Marcos that he wants the
recovery issue settled within the year, as the matter has been
unresolved for 12 years already.

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical scientists are
to join forces with their New Zealand counterparts to manufacture
a special vaccine to combat the common parasitic hydatids disease
which creates cysts in both humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
An agreement of cooperation between the two sides was signed
here today in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Developed by New Zealand scientists, the vaccine will be
produced by China's Beijing Gene Biotechnology Company Limited in
Beijing, the National Agriculture Bio-technology Center in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and New Zealand's Vaccine
International Co.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years in many countries where the larva
induced parasite is rampant, including China, there have been
strenuous efforts to find ways to prevent and eradicate the
disease.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the New Zealand Pastoral Agriculture Research
Institute successfully developed the gene vaccine against
hydatids.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sino-NZ letter of intent, which was signed in
February if 1996, China set up trials of the vaccine in Xinjiang.
By last October the successful immunity rate of the vaccine had
reached 85 percent and experts from the two countries were
satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
"With the application and wide distribution of this vaccine in
China's rural areas, it is hoped that the disease will be brought
under complete control," said Liu Chengguo, China's vice-minister
of agriculture, at the signing ceremony. "It will undoubtedly
assist economic development in western China," he added.
</P>
<P>
John Carter, the New Zealand government's senior whip, said
that the project is another example of the many activities and
joint ventures involving New Zealand and China.

<HEADLINE> Philippoussis Outlasts Chang in Five Sets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big-hitting hometown hero took three hours and forty-five
minutes to clinch the the second round victory 7-6 (7-1), 2-6,
6-3, 5-7, 7-5, outlasting one of the toughest opponents in the
game.
</P>
<P>
In the opening set, he broke Chang in the 11th game to lead
6-5, only to be broken back by enduring Chang when serving for
the set.
</P>
<P>
But in the tiebreak the 22-year-old gave his hometown crowd a
look at his No.1 game, allowing Chang only one point.
</P>
<P>
Although the set went to the sudden death decider,
Philippoussis had dominated it, moving with more freedom than in
his first round match and unleashing his renowned power on almost
every shot.
</P>
<P>
But the ease of the tiebreak win may have had a negative
effect in the second set.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis tried to slaughter every ball above net, only to
allow Chang back into the match.
</P>
<P>
The American was set back on his heels in the third set before
drawing on his incredible court speed and tenacity to level at
2-2.
</P>
<P>
Chang appeared to have the edge in the decider as well, but
Philippoussis matched it with him, finally forcing the break in
the 11th game and wrapping it up in five sets.
</P>
<P>
Apart from his outstanding US Open where he was runner-up to
compatriot Pat Rafter, Philippoussis had developed a reputation
for fragility and inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, however, he was both resilient and
controlled, matching Chang's speed with formidable power and deft
touch.

<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday reaffirmed its trade liberalization policy to make local
industries competitive in the increasingly borderless global
economy.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, presidential spokesman Jerry
Barican said there is no change in the policy of the Estrada
administration regarding tariff and trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Executive Order 63, which grants highly selective tariff
protection for certain industries from the beginning of this
month, was consistent with the country's commitments to the World
Trade Organization and the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) Free Trade Agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government continues to move in the direction set by the
two previous administrations relative to tariff and trade
liberalization policies," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under Executive Order 63, which was announced two days ago, the
government granted six industries, including steel, petrochemicals
and garments manufacturing, tariff relief to shield them from the
ill effects of the regional economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Household Appliance Boom Expected in China in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Domestic demand for household
electric appliances is expected to increase 11 percent this year,
up slightly from the 9.8 percent increase last year, according to
Beijing's Market Daily.
</P>
<P>
Because incomes are not expected to increase significantly
this year, consumer demand will not improve much until new
consumer opportunities emerge, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
According to international measurements of the service life of
electric appliances, more than 3 million TV sets, 2.5 million
refrigerators and 3 million washing machines in China will need
to be replaced, and increasingly, consumers think that one TV
set, one washing machine and one refrigerator are just not enough
for their families.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the rapid development of technology and an ever
changing consumer market, refrigerators alone have undergone a
conspicuous change from the old single-door model to the
double-door, and then from the double-door to an even larger
model with a larger freezer space, better insulation, and
freon-free.
</P>
<P>
TVs and washing machines have also undergone changes, as have
compact discs, which have been followed by VCDs, CVDs, SVCDs, and
DVDs.
</P>
<P>
The increasing consumer demand is directly related to
household desires. Several years ago, a TV, refrigerator, and
washing machine, the "three big items," was the measure of a
family's wealth. Today, the three are being replaced by other
products like air conditioners, VCDs, cam-corders, and audio
equipment.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Congratulate King Hussein on Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein Ibn Talal
has received congratulations on his recovery from dozens of
foreign leaders following his return home Tuesday after a
six-month cancer treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz talked with Hussein on the phone Tuesday,
congratulating him on his recovery and safe return home.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also received congratulation messages from other
international leaders, including French President Jacques Chirac,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir
and Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said in his message that "the Middle East and the Arab
world need your wisdom, advice and initiative," as the peace
process is in a crossroads more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The French leader thanked Hussein, a key and active player in
the Mideast peace process, for his efforts in persuading parties
concerned to sign the land-for-peace Wye River accord last
October, which was later shelved after the Israeli Knesset
(parliament) decided last December to call for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Hussein returned to Jordan Tuesday after a six-month
chemotherapy treatment for lymphatic cancer at the Mayo Clinic,
Minnesota, the U.S.. He had spent more than two weeks in
Washington and London for recuperation after he left the hospital
last December.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani paid
special visits to Jordan Tuesday to welcome Hussein back home at
the Marka military airport in northeastern Amman.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab leaders have also voiced their desire to visit
King Hussein after he returned home, including Saudi Arabian
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Jordanians braved the freezing rains
Tuesday and lined the streets to greet Hussein when the
king`s motorcade marched through downtown Amman towards his
home in Hummar, west of the capital.

<HEADLINE> Spain Opposes Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes y Juan said here on Wednesday that his country opposed
military intervention as a means to bring a settlement to the
conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bombing Serb military installations in Kosovo was "not the way
to settle the crisis", and the international community should
reach an agreement over resolving the crisis, Matutes said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had called U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and they agreed that the international
community should impose pressure on the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
But the Western allies must first deal with their own
differences and take Russia's stance over the issue into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Matutes also criticized his Yugoslav counterpart, Zivadi
Jovanovic, over the escalation of the Kosovo crisis. Last week,
Jovanovic expressed the hope that the crisis could be solved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The United States had threatened to use force against
Yugoslavia after 45 ethnic Albanians were found massacred last
week in the Kosovo village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgrade asked William Walker, an American
diplomat, to leave Yugoslavia within 48 hours on Tuesday,
declaring him persona non grata after Walker blamed Yugoslav
security forces for the killings.

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Trash dumps covering over 500
million sq.m. currently encircle more than 200 Chinese cities,
according to a report by the Science Times.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Chinese urban residents produce
440 kg of trash per capita each year, with the annual volume
growing by 10 percent. The annual volume of urban trash is
expected to reach 150 million tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest commercial city, has over 2,000
trash dumps covering 50 sq.m., while Beijing, the Chinese
capital, has over 4,000.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts note that improperly burying garbage and
exposed trash piles pollute the soil, underground water table and
air. They also note that methane released from trash heaps pose a
great threat in terms of igniting fires.
</P>
<P>
Han Deqian, vice-minister of science and technology, said
China will prioritize the development of trash recycling
technology in order to transform trash into a renewable

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt. Urged to Curb Timber Poaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Wildlife Services
(KWS), the National Museums of Kenya, and local officials and
traditional leaders have demanded the government to curb the
poaching of timber at the Shimba Hills National Park in
southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
KWS security personnel recently intercepted 10 tons of timber
cut by the poachers within the national park, according to a
report at the Daily Nation web site Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The timber poachers fled as soon as they saw the KWS security
personnel.

But the KWS team found a medicine kit and a tent at the scene left
by the timber poachers.
</P>
<P>
The illegal timber dealers are said to have camped for a month
at the scene. The timber was removed to the KWS offices in Kwale
town by KWS officials.
</P>
<P>
The rampant timber poaching has prompted the district officials
to ban the movement of timber and logs from within and outside the
district in order to curb the alarming destruction.
</P>
<P>
Last August, a historic Mvule tree was felled by timber
poachers in the forest park which, known for its indigenous hard
wood Mvule trees, is reportedly being destroyed by timber
poachers.
</P>
<P>
Traditional leaders in the district vowed to seek legal action
if the government failed to punish the related officials.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economic Recovery Efforts Need Public Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's new Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Wednesday that the
success of the government's efforts to steer the country out of
the economic downturn would depend on people's continued support
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
People should play their role to help make a success of the
economic recovery measures taken by the government, Abdullah said
at Eid al-Fitr Open House at his mother's residence in Kepala
Batas in the northern state of Pulau Pinang, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who was named deputy prime minister earlier this
month, said the government only makes plans, issues directives and
formulates specific policies, but it is the people who are
directly involved in implementing the economic recovery measures.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the government's determined efforts have begun to
bear fruit as there were signs of the economy recovering, which
included an increase in the country's reserves and a record sale
during the recent month-long Home Ownership Campaign.
</P>
<P>
If this trend could be sustained, he said, he is confident that
economic activities will be as vibrant as before.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Registration System For China's Industrial Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A registration system for
China's large industrial enterprises with a new foreign trade
scheme has been effective in the country since January 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), the registration system was designed to
encourage more enterprises to get involved in foreign trade and
replace the foreign trade rights applications subject to
government approval.
</P>
<P>
There are over 6,000 large industrial enterprises in China.
Under the new scheme, enterprises affiliated with the central
government can go directly to MOFTEC to register for foreign
trade rights. Local companies register with regional foreign tr
ade authorities.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC and its regional counterparts register enterprises
within 15 working days after receiving a written application and
other pertinent documents. When a registration certificate is
issued, an enterprise goes through customs, commodity inspection,
quarantine, foreign exchange, commerce and taxation procedures to
get an import and export certificate from MOFTEC and local
foreign trade departments.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC says that 10,708 enterprises have obtained the right to
independently handle imports and exports without a go-between.
They account for about 10 percent of the country's total
exports.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes Clinton Pledge of Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday welcomed
U.S. President Bill Clinton's pledge to increase financial aid to
help Russia eliminate its nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov made the
comment following Clinton's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov said Washington's decision to increase financial
assistance to Russia for the elimination of nuclear warheads and
for the ensurance of the safety of nuclear materials and know-how
"will be very welcome," Interfax quoted Maslyukov's spokesman,
Anton Surikov, as saying.
</P>
<P>
This aid will be particularly useful for processing obsolete
weapons systems, Surikov said.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted Maslyukov as saying that the ratification of
the START II treaty had been included in the agenda of the
Russian Duma's spring session.
</P>
<P>
Under the START II treaty on reduction of strategic nuclear
weapons, Russia and the United States would each cut their
strategic warheads to 3,000-3,500.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, already ratified by the U.S. congress, remains
stalled in the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The recent air raids against Iraq launched by the United
States and Britain and fresh U.S. sanctions against three Russian
institutes for their alleged cooperation with Iran in nuclear and
missile weapons programs have made it more difficult for the
treaty to clear the Duma.
</P>
<P>
"The government will urge the deputies to ratify this
agreement so talks on START II may begin as soon as possible,"
Surikov quoted Maslyukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States signed START II in 1993, and the
U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies of the State Duma believe that the pact could
weaken Russia's security and would be too expensive to implement.
</P>
<P>
Russian military officials say many of the country's nuclear
weapons are nearing the end of their service life and will have
to be dismantled in any case.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Swazi Party Releases Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Risking arrest, former
Swazi prime minister Obed Dlamini has announced the manifesto of a
revived Ngwane National Liberatory Congress, pushing for
democratization in the tiny kingdom, South African daily, Business
Day, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Political parties have been banned since 1973.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Dlamini blasted palace resistance to a
constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
"This has resulted in labor unrest and general dissatisfaction
which have led to disinvestment in the Swazi economy," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not say when the conference was held.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini was elected president of the illegal political party at
a secret members' conference late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ngwane congress joins another banned political party, the
People's United Democracy Movement, to have emerged from the
underground to campaign openly for political reform.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini was appointed prime minister in 1989. His
administration was considered the most liberal in Swaziland's
post-independence era and a backlash by palace conservatives saw
him ousted in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini condemned donor countries such as the United States and
Britain for funding the Constitutional Review Commission,
appointed by King Mswati III in 1996 to draft proposals for a new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen countries which are known for being champions of
democracy, and which in other regions of the world have gone out
of their way to support democracy, prostituting their principles
when it comes to this country."
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said the Swazi Administration Order of 1998, decreed by
King Mswati with his council of ministers, which strengthens the
powers of chiefs while diminishing the powers of the courts,
"makes the current so- called constitutional process intended to
allow Swazis to determine how we shall live a fraud and an
irresponsible use of taxpayer's money."
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said the king's passage of laws by decree makes
parliament "a redundant institution, costly to maintain". He also
condemned the recent parliamentary elections as a "sham".

<HEADLINE> ICC, UNCTAD to Boost Investment in Least Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC) and the United Nations conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) launched a joint project on Wednesday to
help six of the world's least developed countries (LDCs) attract
more foreign direct investors.
</P>
<P>
The six countries -- Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mali,
Mozambique and Uganda, are among the 48 LDCs, of which 33 are in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Less than one percent of private foreign direct investment
(FDI) goes to these countries, said the UNCTAD in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"Once the project is well established, the intention is to
extend it to other least developed countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
The project will help provide information on investment
opportunities and conditions in the form of guides and build
capacity among relevant government agencies to deal with
investment issues.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on the six countries' investment climate and
their potential for more FDI. An important part of the process
will be the identification of best practices and optimal
conditions to create a favorable climate for FDI.
</P>
<P>
The governments of China, Finland, France and Norway are
providing financial support. Leading international and local
companies are expected to talk with governments concerned on the
essentials of a successful FDI regime.

<HEADLINE> Software Industry Needs Accelerated Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's software industry
continues to lag behind worldwide level in spite of rapid growth
in recent years and must extend greater effort to narrow the gap,
according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China has some 2,000 software
companies in operation, in addition to 4,000 businesses engaged
in various aspects of software development and services. The
industry features 100,000 programmers and 400,000 computer
technicians.
</P>
<P>
Software sales for 1997 hit 11.2 billion yuan, a year-on-year
rise of 21.7 percent. However, the sales accounted for less than
one percent of the worldwide total, according to China
Electronics News.
</P>
<P>
Other shortfalls included a low 20 percent domestic market
share for software and information services, as well as the
relatively small scale of the software enterprises, and lack of
product variety.
</P>
<P>
Analysts point out that the software sector does enjoy certain
advantages which will enable it to narrow the gap with foreign
counterparts. One particular advantage centers on the
government's attention and support. For example, the Ministry of
Information Industry has listed software development as a primary
focus during 1999. Another strong point rests with the vast
market potential in China.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Describes Kaunda as Dishonest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has described former state president Kenneth Kaunda as a
"dishonest man" , government-owned Zambian Daily Mail reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was reacting to Kaunda's recent remarks that he would
continue with active politics and enjoy his retirement benefits
given to him by the government because he is entitled to them.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian parliament, late last year, passed a law which
entitled former heads of state to retirement benefits, but they
would not be privileged to have the package when they decided to
continue with politics after their tenure.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told journalists at State House Tuesday that it was
inconceivable that Kaunda, at his old age, believed Zambians could
still vote him back into power after serving for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the former president had the mentality of
colonial politicians who were rigid and didn't believe that Zambia
could be ruled by any other person.
</P>
<P>
"That is being dishonest, but I will not argue with Dr. Kaunda.
This is the problem with politicians of the 1960s. Zambia wants
to go forward, not backwards and I will allow my old man to say
what he wants. Zambians are the best judges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has made it clear that he will not retire from active
politics and continue to enjoy the retirement benefits.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Sees Record High Crime in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The amount of crime reached
an all-time high in Israel last year with over 500,000 criminal
cases being reported in the country with a population of 6
million, The Jerusalem Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Police Chief Yehuda Wilk said he believes Israel is on the
way toward lowering crime since the annual figures he released
Tuesday showed the growth rate of crime in 1998 sharply declined
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the amount of crime rose 2.8 percent compared with
that in 1997, much lower than the 15.2 percent growth rate
between 1996 and 1997 and the 5.8 percent rate between 1996 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Wilk said he was "not proud of the amount of crime."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is not to minimize the increase, but to lower it,"
he said, noting that crime has risen by 30 percent since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that serious crime, including murder,
robbery, sexual assault, bribery and arson, is on the rise. Almost
9,000 cases of this type were reported in 1998, up 27 percent
over 1997.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 499 recorded terror attacks in 1998, 50
more than those in 1997, Wilk said. But the number of deaths
caused by the attacks dropped from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Palestinian police of failing to cooperate with
Israel in retrieving stolen Israeli property, saying they had
been given information on chop shops in the West Bank and lists
of stolen cars, but "nothing was done."
</P>
<P>
Wilk said the biggest challenge facing Israeli police is
organized crime. "We are strengthening ties with other countries
around the world to combat international organized crime," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Quarterly Profit Rises 75 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the
world's largest software-maker, announced Tuesday its quarterly
earnings soared 75 percent over the level a year before, said a
report from the company.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft had a net income of 1.98 billion U.S. dollars for
its second quarter ending on December 31, up from 1.13 billion
dollars a year earlier. Revenue rose 38 percent to 4.94 billion
dollars from 3.59 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales of Microsoft's "platform" products, including Windows 98
and Windows NT, an operating system for high-end workstations and
computer networks, were robust, the report said, adding that
demand also remained strong for Microsoft's financial performance
to remain strong through its fiscal year that ends on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly profit and revenue were records, and analysts
said they were amazed by the upside surprise, which came on top
of a strong quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's Windows operating system runs the vast majority of
personal computers, and healthy sales during the holidays for new
PCs, especially cheaper models aimed at home users, meant more
money for Microsoft, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
Maffei, however, was cautious about the remainder of the
fiscal year, saying that growth rates were likely to come down
substantially. He warned of continued risks, including
uncertainties in the Asian and Latin American markets as well as
the effect of the Year 2000 computer bug.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Zambia Confident About Economy in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) is
confident about the country's economic prospects in 1999, a senior
official from the central bank has said.
</P>
<P>
In answering questions from the Business Mail Tuesday, BOZ's
Acting Head of Public Relations, Dave Kalumba said that an
increase in agricultural exports, the privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and benefits expected to be drawn
from the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Fund (ESAF) would set the
stage for an economy take-off this year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Wednesday quoted Kalumba as saying
that the expected expansion in the agricultural exports on account
of the present favorable weather patterns are likely to attract
the much needed foreign currency while ensuring the stability of
the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for the year are promising," he saId. "Growth in
the agricultural sector is expected as a result of the countrywide
good rains being experienced."
</P>
<P>
On privatization of the ZCCM, Kalumba said the action was
expected to add impetus to the economy, with an improved
production and export performance.
</P>
<P>
"This development will have a positive impact on other
mining-related sectors such as manufacturing, transport and other
services," he added.
</P>
<P>
The fresh agreement between the Zambian government and the
International Monetary Fund on a three-year ESAF program is also
expected to stimulate confidence among the donor community and
other international lending institutions, Kalumba said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is likely to lead into "the reactivating of
project funding in physical and social sectors, a build-up in
international reserves, stability in the exchange rate and a
reduction in inflation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Reiterates Support to "One-China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh, as always, supports
the "one-China" policy, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Terming Bangladesh-China ties "very good, excellent," the
foreign minister said that "there is only the sky limit in
developing bilateral relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua before his departure early Thursday morning for a
five-day visit to China, his first independent visit to China as
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
This will be his first foreign trip in 1999, he said. Azad
toured China in September 1996, as a member of the delegation led
by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on her first official visit abroad
after taking office in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Azad will hand over two personal letters
written by the prime minister to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji respectively when he calls on them, and hold
talks with his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan on bilateral
issues, particularly economic ones.
</P>
<P>
His main purpose is to sign an agreement with the Chinese side
on China's assistance to Bangladesh in constructing an
international conference center for the Non-Alignment Movement
summit to be held in Dhaka in 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the trade gap between the two countries in favor of China,
he said the two sides are making "sincere" efforts to narrow the
difference.
</P>
<P>
Besides Beijing, Azad will also visit Shanghai and Kunming, in
southeast China's Yunnan province, before returning home next
Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Declines by 7.5 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
registered a 7.5 percent decline in 1998 compared with the 5.7
percent growth in 1997 and its outlook for 1999 remains uncertain
given the cloudy economic outlook in regional markets and the
expected economic slowdown in developed markets, the Trade
Development Board (TDB) of Singapore announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But trade with emerging markets expanded by 10.4 percent in
1998 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
TDB's Chief Executive Barry Desker told a press conference that
it was Singapore's first trade decline since 1986 when the total
trade shrank by 3.2 percent,
</P>
<P>
He said overall non-oil domestic exports growth in 1998 was 0.9
percent, significantly lower than the 5.3 percent expansion in
1997, while non-oil re-export in the year remained flat, dipping
by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Desker noted that the second half of 1998 saw a hefty 12.4
percent decline in trade, about six times the decline in the first
half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Desker attributed the poor performance in trade to the
softening of demand from developed markets, deterioration of
economic conditions in regional economies and the continued
oversupply situations in key electronics segments.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
market will continue to enjoy strong demand in 1999, according to
a projection recently released by the Ministry of Information
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for the business volume for telecomm
unications products to exceed 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China had 2.1 million Internet subscribers by the end of last
year, with the figure expected to rise by 1.5 million subscribers
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The China Internet Information Center under the State Council
projects that the total number of Web users will exceed 4.5
million by 2000, including three million corporate users.
</P>
<P>
The domestic and export volume for telephones is expected to
hit 8-10 billion yuan, with the domestic demand for telephones
set at 40 million units.
</P>
<P>
China has produced between 100-150 million telephones annually
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan, the capacity of mobile phone switch
boards will increase by 10 million lines this year, and the total
number in use will reach 34 million by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The market demand for the sector is expected to reach 25-30
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Projections also predict an oversupply of program-controlled
telephone switchboards.
</P>
<P>
The demand for related products will reach 2-2.5 million
units, with the combined production capacity of China's 150
manufacturers exceeding seven million units. The sales volume for

<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's air force has
significantly improved its combat readiness during 1998,
according to Vice-Commander Wu Guangyu.
</P>
<P>
 Wu made the comments at a recent work conference on air
force training. He noted that pilots in 1998 achieved a record of
per capita flying time, the highest since 1985, in spite of
heavy summer floodings and a program to restructure the air force.
</P>
<P>
 He said that pilots paid particular attention to improving
basic flying techniques. Wu added the air force completed the
largest number of difficult experiments in its history.
</P>
<P>
 The air force made tremendous progress in terms of tactical
training and live-fire manouevers in harsh weather conditions,
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
 He said the fact that 66 percent of air units conducted
highly successful long-distance mobile maneuvers under harsh
weather conditions indicated that China's air force has greatly
enhanced its combat readiness.

<HEADLINE> Horn of Africa Parliamentary Caucus to Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A regional conference is
scheduled to end in Kenya's Indian Ocean port of Mombasa Wednesday
with expectations to launch the Horn of Africa Parliamentary
Caucus on women's capacity building.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Wednesday, the United
Nations Fund for Women (UNIFEM) regional advisor in east Africa,
Laketch Dirasse, said at the three-day meeting on capacity
building for women leaders that the caucus is necessary to develop
strategies of sustaining women in decision making positions.
</P>
<P>
It will also develop rights and democracy, increase awareness
and acceptance of women as a political force, she was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Such a forum would continuously lobby and advocate increased
women's economic and political empowerment and adherence to their
rights," she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. advisor said the proposed forum would ensure that
parliament and sub-regional organizations enact gender-sensitive
laws and treaties.
</P>
<P>
She noted that women's ability to act as an economic force and
their opportunities for economic empowerment were affected at
policy, institutional and individual levels.
</P>
<P>
"Trade and tariff policies associated with structural
adjustment have caused women [loss of] their livelihood because
the informal sector cannot compete with inexpensive imports," said
the U.N. advisor.
</P>
<P>
Gender bias and lack of efficiency in the public sector
services, banking, research institutions and the private sector
had affected women's opportunities, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Horn of Africa II conference brings together women
parliamentarians from Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and
Kenya. The first conference was held last January.

<HEADLINE> Draft Bills on Politics to Be Adopted in Indonesia: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Home Affairs
Minister Syarwan Hamid expressed his optimism that the draft bills
on politics, currently still under House debate, will be adopted
in due time.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident," he said during an open house in conjunction
with the post-fasting Idul Fitri (feast celebrating the end of
fasting period) celebration at his residence here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three draft bills on politics still under House debate are:
the draft bill on political parties, the draft bill on general
elections, and the draft bill on organizational structures of the
People's Consultative Assembly, the House of Representatives and
the regional legislative assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda of the House, the three draft bills are
expected to be adopted during the next House plenary session
slated for January 28.
</P>
<P>
When asked about tough debates on the status of civil servants,
during which the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction is
sticking to its position that civil servants should be allowed to
be elected as executives of political parties, the minister
reaffirmed that the country's civil servants have to be neutral.
</P>
<P>
Hamid said that President B.J. Habibie in his recent address to
the House instructed that civil servants and members of the
Indonesian Armed Forces should be neutral.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is that the upcoming general elections should be
conducted in a just and fair manner," Hamid was quoted by Antara
News Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill on political parties, there is an article
that civil servants are not allowed to be elected executives of
any political party.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the general elections, Hamid said that the polls
would go as scheduled on June 7, 1999.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will

while the rest will come from donor agencies and non-governmental
organizations, said the permanent secretary.

<HEADLINE> Oil Giant Sets Profit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC) plans to increase its profits to at least 5.8
billion yuan (698.79 million U.S. dollars) and strive to increase
to 7.8 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
CNPC, China's major oil company, accounts for over 80 percent
of the country's total onshore oil output.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Ma Fucai said the group increased 1998 output
to 107 million tons of crude oil and 14.9 billion cu.m. of
natural gas. The group also processed 67.57 million tons of crude
oil last year, or basically the same volume as in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
CNPC's 1998 sales volume reached 205 billion yuan, with
profits totaling 4.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements came in spite of low international oil
prices, oversupply and mounting oil smuggling," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
He noted that restructuring completed in 1998 enabled CNPC to
integrate exploration, development and processing, domestic and
international trade, and production and marketing in order to
effectively optimize distribution and the rational use of oil
resources.
</P>
<P>
Three oil and natural gas fields with estimated reserves of
100 million tons each were discovered in the Tarim and Junggar
basins in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin. The fields increased the groups oil
reserves by 485 million tons and natural gas reserves to 223.2
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The group's business volume for contracted overseas projects
and labor services hit 482 million US dollars last year. CNPC
also signed export contracts for oil products and equipment worth
470 million US dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the country faces an arduous task in overcoming
structural faults, high production costs and loss-making
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> China Announces Plans to Renovate Ancient Tower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's relics protection
authorities recently announced plans to renovate an ancient tower
in Jiujiang City, east Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Cultural Heritage and local
cultural and relics departments will renovate the Suojianglou
Tower at a cost of 600,000 yuan (72,300 US dollars). The tower,
with a history of some 413 years, sits on the bank of the Yangtze
River. The project is scheduled for completion in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The 25.26-meter brick and stone structure was built in 1586.
The scenery in the surrounding area has been regarded as one of
the city's eight most beautiful sites..
</P>
<P>
Japanese shelling in 1938 damaged the tower, with the ravages
of war causing the structure to lean by some 1.1 meters.
</P>
<P>
The city government has extended great effort to solve the
problem and completed partial restoration.

<HEADLINE> Henman Survives Five-Set Thriller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBEERA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tim Henman
overcame a choppy start on a cool morning Wednesday to beat
Australian Sandon Stolle 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 and advance to
the third round in the Australian Open in Melbourne of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Henman, a semifinal losser to Pete Sampras in Wimbledon last
year, is coming off his best season and may be ready for a
breakthrough grand slam victory.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tournament I should do well at," Henman said. "The
conditions are favorable for me. It's a pretty fair court. I
think it does the help the aggressive players, the
serve-and-volleyers and the guys who are moving forward."
</P>
<P>
The Australian has not been kind to Henman in the past. He
lost in the first round last year in a five-setter against Jerome
Golmard. He fell in the third round in 1997 against Michael
Chang. And in his Australian debut in 1996, Henman lost in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
The match turned for Henman when he broke Stolle for a 3-1
lead in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
"Twelve months ago, there's a very, very good chance I would
have lost that match," Henman said. "But you've got to learn from
your experiences. If anything I was trying too hard to do too
much in the third set. I made life difficult for myself in the
first three sets. In future matches I've got to try not to dig as
big a hold for myself."
</P>
<P>
Henman next meets Switzerland's unseeded Marc Rosset.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Convert Some Reserves Into Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will convert part of the country's international
dollar reserves into the Euro currency, the Philippine News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as
saying that the conversion will be at least equivalent to the
country's external liabilities.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of
the central bank, is yet to determine how much of the
international reserves will be up for conversion.
</P>
<P>
The country's international gross reserves increased to 11.8
billion U.S. dollars after the country successfully issued 1
billion dollars of global bond early this month.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that Europe accounts for 11 percent of the
country's imports and 18 percent of its total exports.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Euro as the single currency of 11
European nations will simplify trading procedures between Europe
and the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
When this happens, Singson said, exporters will no longer have
difficulty in comparing notes because the procedure is now Euro
against the peso.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's reference exchange rate bulletin Wednesday
shows the peso' exchange rate with the Euro is at 44.5311:1.

<HEADLINE> AIDS/HIV Infection Rate Drops in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- AIDS/HIV infection rate in
Uganda has dropped dramatically over the years as a result of
sensitization programs and other prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
HIV infection rate among sexually transmitted disease patients
was 44.2 percent in 1989 and now it plummeted to 15 percent,
Wednesday's Monitor newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed this drop to social mobilization, safe
blood transfusion and monitoring by HIV sero-surveillance.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS awareness now exceeds 90 percent among the general
population.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, two million people are reportedly infected while 23
percent of them have already developed full blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Although the rate of infection is declining, the paper warns
people against relaxing the campaign against the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
It said that the declining trend in the infection rate is in
the urban areas but the in the rural areas where over 80 percent
of the population live, there is still a very high infection rate
of 30.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
AIDS was first reported in Uganda in 1982. A total of 500,000
people in the country have died of the pandemic since.

<HEADLINE> Most Chinese Favor Traditional Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll shows that the
majority of Chinese citizens either trust the efficacy of
traditional medicine, or otherwise believe in the strong points
of both traditional and western medicines.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of respondents cited the good points of both
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine, and 30
percent favor the efficacy of the former.
</P>
<P>
The majority of respondents agreed the strong points of TCM
include minor side effects and the core philosophy of "achieving
a permanent cure". Others said TCM can cure illnesses beyond the
reach of western medicine, or that TCM is more suited to the
physique of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Horizon Market Survey Company polled 1,500 residents in
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 percent of respondents cited a preference for western
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 75 percent of respondents had used TCM
over the previous year to treat colds, asthma, stomach problems
or chronic diseases. TCM was also used to treat hypertension,
headaches and rheumatism.
</P>
<P>
An analysis revealed that educate people have a greater
awareness of the strong points of both TCM and western medicine.
</P>
<P>
The fact that younger people voiced a stronger preference for
western medicine was attributed to the influence of advertising
and sales promotions.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a series of policies in recent years to
protect and develop traditional Chinese medicine which has a
history of well over 1,000 years.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Fire Prevention China's New Ways To Prevent Fires Caused By Electric Discharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist says that
he has found a way to prevent fires caused by static electricity
in filling stations, ammunition storehouses, or other petroleum
or military facilities.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shanghe, a professor at the Mechanical Engineering
Institute of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has invented a
device that detects the electrostatic induction level of
electrostatic energy, according to Science and Technology
Daily.  It reports that, in doing so, Liu first
had to solve the problem of electric discharges in relation to
the human body.
</P>
<P>
He found that the human body's aility to withstand electric
shock is as high as 71,000 volts, unlike the 40,000 to 50,000
volts that many Western scientist believe.
</P>
<P>
From that, Liu went on to discover a basic rule for conducting
electricity in high-pressure electrostatic media and suggested
how to separate places by grades of electrostatic-fire risk.
</P>
<P>
His special device has helped prevent fires and explosions caus
ed by static electricity in nearly 100 aerospace, weapons, and
petrochemical facilities over the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Kenya not to Liberalize Air Routes Now: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is not in a hurry to
fully liberalize its air routes until the country acquires a
capacity to effectively compete in the international air
transport, Transport and Communications Permanent Secretary
Stanley Murage has announced.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is at the moment investigating the full benefits of the
open-skies policy with a view to gradually adapting to it in a
manner that would preserve the current benefits and safeguard the
national interest, Murage was quoted by Wednesday's People
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a one-day consultative meeting between
the Kenyan government and a visiting delegation of the U.S.
aviation agents Tuesday. The meeting was reportedly the first in
a series of aeronautical authorities from various countries.
</P>
<P>
The aviation market in Kenya is still small with only 32
international airlines operating, said Murage.
</P>
<P>
The situation has recently become worse following the
withdrawal of about 10 flag carriers from Kenyan air space, he
added, giving no reasons.
</P>
<P>
Even the giant Lufthansa is scheduled to cease flights to
Nairobi as from April this year, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
However, the national carrier, Kenya Airways, has heavily
invested since its privatization three years ago, he said, citing
its recent acquisition of four B737-300 aircraft and an annual
traffic growth in excess of 40 percent over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Consumer Goods Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They give several reasons for the estimate. For one, the
central government has allocated funds this year especially for
commercial housing, part of which will be added to salaries.
Also, the decrease in interest on savings accounts on December 7
last year will affect people's attitudes toward saving and
consumption; and the bank loans for the purchases of apartments
and automobiles will help further develop Beijing's consumer
goods market.
</P>
<P>
It is also estimated that personal income in urban and rural
areas will rise by 9.8 percent and 7.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
A new survey of Beijingers' attitudes toward consumption shows
that the most popular items are daily consumption, investment,
and insurance, favored by 44.9 percent, 15.3 percent and 12.8
percent of those polled respectively, suggesting that personal
savings will very likely be spent on consumer goods this year.
And government departments estimate that the volume of retail
sales will reach 131.1 billion yuan (15.8 billion U.S. dollars)
in Beijing this year, 12 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
Commercial departments in Beijing reckon that spending for
food will account for 35 percent to 37 percent of all retail
sales, and health foods and quality and highly nutritious foods
will become more popular due to new attitudes toward
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
However, clothing sales will account for below 12 percent of
all consumer spending, and wider choices and more brands of
higher quality clothes will be popular in 1999, since people
have begun paying more attention to price and quality when they
shop.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that sales of daily necessities are likely
to be the main force pushing the development of the retail sales
in Beijing. Sales of such products are expected to increase by
about 18 percent, accounting for over half of all retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Another trend this year is expected to be greater expenditures
on things such as ornaments, furniture, and other items related
to the boom in auto and housing purchases. And cultural products
and durable and high-tech goods including videos, books and
magazines, soft ware, air conditioners, microwave ovens, mobile
phones, pagers, and personal computers are all expected to find
great favor in the marketplace in 1999.

methods.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Develops Medicine to Combat Mountain Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 20 (Xinhua ) -- A traditional Tibetan medicine
helpful in combating diseases caused by high altitude, low
pressure and lack of oxygen on lofty plateaus recently passed
official appraisal.
</P>
<P>
The drug was developed by scientists at northwest China's
Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital by combining modern medical
science and biological techniques with theories of traditional
Chinese and Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
It has proved effective in slowing the aging process,
enhancing physical strength and improving the body's oxygen
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Xinsheng, director of the hospital in
charge of the research and development of the medicine, people
living on the plateaus usually age more quickly than those living
at lower elevations because of the thin oxygen at higher levels.
They are also prone to mountain sickness and heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Tibetan medicine, which is an important part of
medical science in China, is unique in preventing and curing some
diseases.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's External Debt Up By 5.4 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's external debt is
growing at an annual rate of 5.4 percent, a senior official in the
Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Devlepment has said.
</P>
<P>
Damon Kitabire, director for economic affairs in the ministry,
made the revelation when presenting a review of Uganda's external
debt strategy at a workshop here Tuesday. In 1992, the
country's debt stock stood at 2.65 billion U.S. Dollars and it
shot up to 3.63 billion Dollars by June of 1998, the Monitor
daily Wednesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kitabire, however, noted that sustained macro-economic reforms
have enabled the economy to grow at an average rate of seven
percent, making the debt-ratio fall over time from 88 percent in
1992/1993 to 61 percent in 1997/1998.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have led to increased exports of goods and services
 resulting into the debt service/exports of goods and services
ratio falling from 60 percent in 1992/1993 to 17 percent in
1998/1999.
</P>
<P>
This ratios, though declining, still indicate that Uganda's
debt stock and debt service remained at an unsustainable level
without the granting of mulitlateral relief.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Lule, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda, said the
government has continued efforts to reduce the external debt
burden which has put heavy demand on budgetary resources and
reduced private savings.
</P>
<P>
The Government has imposed strict concessional borrowing and
created a multilateral debt fund which was used to pay the service
on multilateral loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative will
provide a debt relief to Uganda to the tune of 650 million Dollars
to be disbursed over the next 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Steps Up Efforts to Protect Fish Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a breeding
center aimed at artificially breeding and releasing young naked
carp, a rare fish found in Qinghai Lake in northwest China's
Qinghai Province, was recently completed.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the provincial government's efforts to protect
local fish resources and keep the lake's ecology in balance.
</P>
<P>
Work on the center began in 1997 and cost a total of four
million yuan. Situated near Qinghai Lake, the center covers an
area of 61.6 million square meters, and plans to release around
20 million naked carp into the lake each year.
</P>
<P>
This rare fish lives in cold water with a high saline content,
and grows by about one-half kilogram over a ten-year period.
Illegal fishing and poor environmental conditions may also affect
the breeding of this fish.
</P>
<P>
The development and utilization of the lake's fish resources
began in 1959, and over the past four decades the lake has
produced 300,000 tons of the fish.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Sees Kosovo Massacre as Threat to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday adopted a presidential statement, saying that
the massacre in the village of Racak, southern Kosovo of
Yugoslavia, threatens the efforts to settle conflicts through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council considers that the events in Racak
constitute the latest in a series of threats to the efforts to
settle this conflict through negotiations and peaceful means,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the 15-member council's unscheduled
closed-door consultations on the current situation in Kosovo, the
Serbian province of mainly ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council condemns the shooting of the personnel of
the international monitors, known as the Kosovo Verification Mi
ssion (KVM) sent into Kosovo by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on January 15, and all actions
endangering the KVM and international personnel.
</P>
<P>
"It reaffirms its full commitment to the safety and security
of the KVM personnel," the statement said, adding that the
Security Council "reiterates its demands that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanians cooperate fully
with KVM."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council calls upon the parties to cease
immediately all acts of violence and to engage in talks on a
lasting settlement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council also strongly warns the 'Kosovo
Liberation Army' against actions which are contributing to
tension" in the province, where ethnic Albanians make up some 90
percent of the province's population of two million.
</P>
<P>
The "Kosovo Liberation Army" is an armed group of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, who are fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council considers all of these events to be
violation of its resolutions and of relevant agreements and
commitments calling for restraint," said the statement. "The
Council reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The corpses of 45 civilians, including three women and one
12-year-old child, were reportedly found on Saturday on hillsides
and gullies around the village of Racak, some 25 kilometers south
of the provincial capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations high commissioner for refugees said in a
report that five and a half thousand civilians fled the Racak
area following the massacre, "showing how rapidly a humanitarian
crisis could again develop if steps are not taken by the parties
to reduce tensions," the statement added.

<P>
CANBEERA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Jennifer Capriati suffered
another setback on her way to comeback Wednesday when she was
ousted in the second round of the Australian Open by Spain's
Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo in Melbourne of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Capriati went down to Sanchez Lorenzo, ranked No. 65, in
straight sets 6-7 (2), 2-6.
</P>
<P>
"The actual playing skills are still there,'' she said. ``I
just have to dig deeper and find it."'
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Lorenzo launched out a solid play to hold off
Capriati's strong rally in the first se.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, 22, seemed headed for greatness when she arrived on
the women's tour in March 1990 at the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
She became the youngest Grand Slam semifinalist, making it to
the final four at the French Open, and beat five top-10 players
in her first year.
</P>
<P>
She made it to two Grand Slam semifinals in 1991, then beat
Steffi Graf at the '92 Olympics in Barcelona to capture the gold
medal.

<HEADLINE> State Pharmaceutical Enterprises Urged to Improve Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's administrative
department of the pharmaceutical industry will halt redundant
production, tighten control of imports and speed up the
bankruptcy of ailing firms in a bid to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of new factories will be under strict control to
reduce the excessive production of drugs whose supply exceeds
demand, according to a national meeting of the State Economic and
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Imports will not be allowed if domestic enterprises are able t
o provide sufficient quantities, a report in today's Guangming
Daily quoted participants at the meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's pharmaceutical sector should learn a lesson and not
blindly establish factories while ignoring the development of new
drugs, the report said, while 40 to 50 percent of these
production lines are now left unused.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises suffering serious losses will be merged or even
closed down, it said.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of the more than 600 state-owned
pharmaceutical enterprises suffered serious deficits last year,
as the entire industry reported profits unchanged from those of
1997.
</P>
<P>
"State enterprises in this sector will face more rigorous
challenges from private firms and overseas pharmaceutical giants
which are now entering the domestic market," the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shanghai, China's
leading industrial and commercial center, is considering building
a bridge or tunnel between the city proper and Chongming Island,
the nation's third largest island, at the mouth of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
This idea was prompted partly by the emerging tourist industry
on the island, which used to focus on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that more than one million Chinese and
overseas tourists visited the island last year, an increase of 33
percent over 1997, and local residents realized a total of 350
million yuan in revenue from tourism.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-square-kilometer island has one of the largest
afforested areas in east China, and its eastern end is a
traditional habitat for 130 bird varieties.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the forest has been turned into a huge park
with a convenient bird-watching area.
</P>
<P>
Repairs are now being made on the island's major historical
sites, such as the Confucius Temple and an ancient battlefield.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Exports to Asia Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's exports to
Asia are starting to slog their way back to pre-crisis levels
after a year of decline.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand (SNZ) said Wednesday in a media release
that provisional New Zealand's exports to Asia totaled 612
million NZ dollars (330 million U.S. dollars) in November.
</P>
<P>
While this is still 3.3 percent down from November 1997, the
gap between the 1998 and 1997 figures is drawing closer.
November's 3.3 percent fall compares with a 6.1 percent drop from
October 1997 to October 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Trend figures for (New Zealand's) exports to Asia show small
but steady growth for the last four months after a year of
decline caused by the Asian economic crisis. The trend in imports
from Asia continues to rise," New Zealand's deputy government
statistician Dianne Macaskill said in the release.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, New Zealand's provisional exports in
November totaled 1.94 billion NZ dollars (one billion U.S.
dollars), up 10.2 percent on November 1997.

<HEADLINE> PM Shipley Calls for Keeping NZ Natural Heritage Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley called for protecting the country's diverse
eco-systems while launching New Zealand's Draft Biodiversity
Strategy here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said in a statement that she has been informed that up
to 1,000 species in New Zealand are under threat including the
kiwi, kakapo (ground parrot), kokako (New Zealand crow), takahe (a
sea bird), saddleback and stitchbird that would not survive
without proper protection.
</P>
<P>
"The Government and the people of New Zealand must work
together to keep our country's natural heritage alive," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year biodiversity strategy is about caring for and
appreciating New Zealand's diverse eco-systems like high country
tussock lands, lowland forests, wetlands and coastline, which are
home to unique native species like the kea and kiwi, Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
"While the strategy is a government-led initiative, the
government cannot stop the decline of our biodiversity by itself.
We need the help of all New Zealanders," she said.
</P>
<P>
The release of the draft strategy signals a three-month
consultation period. The discussion over the next three months
would be an opportunity for the New Zealand people to "think about
how much biodiversity we want to conserve and how best to do it",
the prime minister said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Will Increase Spending On Clothes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1998, total retail sales stood at 2.93 trillion yuan, and
264 billion yuan of this was spent on clothing.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the average annual income of urban
residents will rise to between 5,400 and 5,700 yuan in 1999, and
the proportion spent on clothes will continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
Buying habits are also expected to change: about 70 percent of
the clothing sold will be finished products, and consumer demand
for high-quality and name-brand garments will increase. But
medium-quality clothing purchases will continue to remain the
norm.
</P>
<P>
Formal dresses will take a larger proportion of sales and
shoppers will give more attention to style, quality and casual
clothes.
</P>
<P>
Pure cotton clothing will remain the favorite among youth, and
an increasing number of consumers will prefer woolen dresses.
</P>
<P>
Experts say these changes show that China's consumers are
becoming more mature, which will push the clothing industry to
improve their styles, quality and management.

<HEADLINE> Green Garments Available in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Environmentally friendly
garments are now available in China, now that one ecological
textile product was officially approved on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jiucailuo, a green textile-product brand, became China's first
cotton product to receive the environmental seal of approval
granted to products that do no harm to the environment, the China
Economic Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of the authentication said China can now
offer green garments on the international market.
</P>
<P>
With great attention to environmental protection, many
European countries, Japan, and the United States have set
standards for textile products to limit their content of
polluting substances.
</P>
<P>
These restrictions have put pressure on major textile expo
rting countries, including China, India, Thailand and the
Republic of Korea to follow these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, China has initiated a system for approving such
products, and now grants an environmentally safe seal to those
meeting the required specifications.
</P>
<P>
China is now striving for recognition from several
international authentication organizations in order to bring its
products to the world.

<HEADLINE> California Environmental Group Sues Oil Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A California environmental
organization Tuesday filed a lawsuit against a dozen of major oil
companies, charging them with allowing dangerous chemicals to
contaminate the state's water supply, according to reports from
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit filed in the San Francisco Superior Court, the
organization "Communities for a Better Environment" alleged that
the oil companies had violated Proposition 65, a safe drinking
water measure California voters passed in 1986, by leaving more
than 3,500 leaky storage tanks unrepaired.
</P>
<P>
"This case will send a strong message to all polluters in the
only language that they understand," said Denny Larson, northern
California director of the Communities for a Better Environment,
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The group also charged the state's water boards with doing
little to stop oil companies and gasoline stations from allowing
poisons to flow into the water supply systems, and said there are
now more than 10,000 sites across California where drinking water
sources have been contaminated by the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
The multibillion-dollar suit, the largest environmental
lawsuit in California history, seeks to force the clean-up of
these sites and the return of profits earned by companies found
guilty of breaking environmental laws.

<HEADLINE> North China's Largest Port Expands Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The port of Tianjin, the
largest in north China, has seen its handling capacity increase
by 6.5 fold in the past two decades, with fixed assets growing by
nearly 20 fold.
</P>
<P>
This 100-year-old port handled only 740,000 tons in 1952 when
it was rebuilt, and this capacity grew to over 10 million tons by
1978.
</P>
<P>
The port invested 5.8 billion yuan (698 million U.S. dollars)
over the past 20 years for the construction and improvement of
key berths and wharves for containers, grain, raw materials, the
country's largest cross-sea sea-port bridge and many other
projects as well.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1998 show that the port handled 68.18 million
tons of cargo, including 1.08 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The port's bonded area has attracted more than 3,000
foreign-funded enterprises since it was established over six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the port has opened over 100 navigation lines
linking it with some 300 ports in 160 countries and regions
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The port's handling capacity is expected to exceed 100 million
tons by the year 2010, with an annual container-handling capacity
of 5 million TEUs, according to port sources.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Authorities Discuss Miners' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu summoned key cabinet members Tuesday afternoon to
discuss the miner union's actions in the Jiu Valley area, the
country's largest coal field.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, an estimated number of 10,000 miners
from the Jiu Valley, 350 kilometers southwest of Bucharest, broke
through barricades put up by the riot police and reached Targu
Jiu, 290 kilometers southwest of Bucharest, in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Union leader Miron Cozma vowed to march on to the capital
unless Prime Minister Radu Vasi1e comes to Targu Jiu for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Vasile, along with Chief of Army's General Staff and heads of
the Intelligence Service, the Police General Inspectorate and the
Gendarmerie were present at the meeting called by the president,
said the president's press office.
</P>
<P>
It said the participants reasserted the government's readiness
to negotiate with trade union leaders to end the two-week-old
strike in the Jiu Valley.
</P>
<P>
Miners in the Jiu Valley went on a general strike on January
4, protesting against the government's decision to close down
some unprofitable mines in the area and to lay off their
employees.
</P>
<P>
They sent the government a list of 30 demands, including
redundancy pay worth 10,000 U.S. dollars for each laid-off miner
and the grant of a two-hectare plot of land. Negotiations between
the trade union and government representatives have yielded no
results.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vasile said Tuesday he was ready to participate
in the negotiations if the miners return to work, an offer
rejected by the trade union.

<HEADLINE> Families of Bridge-Collapse Victims to Get Government Allowance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The family of each of the 40
people killed in the January 4 bridge collapse in southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality will receive 13,000 yuan (about
1,500 U.S. dollars) in "government relief allowance," local
authorities said here today.
</P>
<P>
An official investigation found that the collapse of the
Rainbow Bridge in Qijiang County, which killed 22 civilians, 18
armed police soldiers and injured 14 others, was caused by
serious structural problems stemming from shoddy construction.
The local police have since detained the bridge contractor and
several local officials charged with corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist Association of Chongqing also pledged to donate
1,000 yuan (about 120 U.S. dollars) to each victim's family, and
local insurance companies will pay compensation to the families
of the soldiers covered by life insurance for the army
servicemen, a local official noted.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the remains of all the victims have
now been cremated, and that family members of some victims from
other provinces who came to Qijiang for the funeral have all
returned home.
</P>
<P>
Six of the 14 injured have completely recovered and have left
the hospital, while the rest must remain for one to four months
for further treatment, according to a hospital spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
"We have invited specialists from all the major Chongqing
hospitals to conduct thorough examinations of the injured and
work out detailed treatment plans for each of them," said one of
the attending physicians.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities also say that most of the debris from the
fallen bridge has been removed from the Qijiang River and
navigation will soon be resumed.

<HEADLINE> Most Urban Youth Have No Internet Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- As many as 70 percent of the
young people in China's urban centers have no access to the
Internet, according to a survey conducted jointly by the China
Youth Research Center and the China Youth Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which sought to learn about "the situation of
modern Chinese urban youth," involved nine cities and provinces
including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Henan Province, and
more than 6,500 people aged 14 to 28.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their attitude toward the Internet, 66.4
percent of the respondents including students, workers, teachers
and civil servants said the Internet is a brand-new method of
communication, a miracle of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also revealed that 69.1 percent said they have
no way to get on-line, while only 1.9 percent said they are
Internet fans, and 3.4 percent said they use the Internet quite
often.
</P>
<P>
There are still 6.6 percent of the youth who say they have no
desire to use the Internet, and six percent said they have never
even heard of it.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe this demonstrated a great potential for the
development of modern communications in China, and also indicated
there is still a long way to go before the Internet becomes truly
popular among Chinese youth.

<HEADLINE> Experts Predict Drop in China's Wine Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's wine prices, which
have been risen continuously since 1996, will gradually fall to a
more reasonable level, according to the China Light Industry News.
</P>
<P>
China's wine market supply has been meeting demand since
1998, and this market is expected to become oversupplied this
year as more wineries continue to come on the scene, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
A great many Chinese took to wine drinking in 1996 to follow
the fashion, and at that time grape output was unable to keep up
with demand, bringing about high prices.
</P>
<P>
Now that more grape are grown and more wine produced, there
will be a glut on the market this year, and some brands of wine
have already lowered their prices. In addition, most Chinese
people still prefer liquor and beer to wine.

<HEADLINE> Special Task Forces Suggested to Save Rivers in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Special task forces have
been suggested to be set up in Malaysia's all states to formulate
programs for sustained action to save polluted rivers in the
country from further deterioration and destruction.
</P>
<P>
Making the suggestion in a statement here Wednesday, Kuala
Lumpur City Hall Environmental Committee Chairman Lee Lam Thye
said the task force's program should include awareness and
educational campaigns, stringent law enforcement to deal with
polluters and mobilization of all local authorities to deal with
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Such task forces, if necessary, should be headed by the chief
minister of each state and made up of representatives from
government agencies, department of environment and non-government
organizations, Lee, a social activist, said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to 1997 Environmental Quality Report, Malaysia's
river water quality drastically deteriorated in 1997 with the
number of polluted rivers doubled from 13 in 1996 to 25 and clean
rivers reduced mostly by half from 42 to 24.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that while the El Nino weather phenomenon had been
cited as a cause of the deterioration of water quality, it could
not be denied that inadequate enforcement and the insensitivity of
those responsible for the river pollution were major causes of the
present state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said other contributors to the river pollution were the
continued discharge of effluents by irresponsible
factories/industries into rivers, earthworks and land-clearing
activity and illegal dumping.

</P>
<P>
The president promised to increase efforts to restrain the
spread of nuclear weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made it clear that the United States will continue to
contain Iraq. "We will work for the day when Iraq has a
government worthy of its people."
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the U.S. strategy in Europe and Asia. "We
must support security in Europe and Asia -- expanding NATO and
defining its new missions at its 50th Anniversary summit this
year in Washington, maintaining our alliance with Japan and
Korea, and our other Asian allies, and engaging China," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized the importance of the United Nations,
although the U.S. took military action against Iraq without
consulting the UN last month.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Clinton urged Congress to
provide resources to implement the Wye Agreement, which was
signed between Israelis and Palestinians last October in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of American policies in Latin America, Clinton said,
"To increase shared prosperity, we will work to launch a Free
Trade Area of the Americas."
</P>
<P>
Turning to domestic social issues, Clinton offered a bold plan
to protect Social Security with budget surpluses that Republicans
are eyeing for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
With the economy booming, Clinton said, "The state of our
union is strong. America is working again. The promise of our
future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we
allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency."
</P>
<P>
The president's proposal would create new retirement accounts
for workers and invest some of Social Security's cash reserves in
the stock market for the first time. "With the number of elderly
Americans set to double by 2030," Clinton said, "the baby boom
will become a senior boom."
</P>
<P>
Moving from last year's call to "save Social Security first,"
Clinton proposed transferring 62 percent of expected budget surplu
ses over the next 15 years -- 2.7 trillion dollars -- to the
Social Security account to keep the program solvent until 2055.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan would also reserve 15 percent of the surplus --
650 billion dollars over 15 years -- for the ailing Medicare syst
em. An additional 11 percent of the surplus -- 500 billion
dollars -- would be devoted to new government-subsidized
retirement accounts, with the U.S. Treasury matching the savings
of lower-income people. The rest of the surplus would go to
military spending and domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
On global trade, Clinton called for a new round of trade
talks, which could be kicked off at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the new round of talks would make the exports of
services, manufacturers, and most of all farm products expand,
building a more free trade system for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States will work with the
International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise
labor standards around the world. And this year, "We will lead
the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive
child labor everywhere in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the economic sector, Clinton said the United
States today "is the most dynamic, competitive job-creating
economy in history" and "can do even better -- in building a 21st
century economy for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
"America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion
in our history -- with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising
at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest home-o
wnership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years --
and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced,
he said. From a deficit of 290 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, the
U.S. had a surplus of 70 billion dollars last year and is "on
course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Chilean FM Expects Favorable British Ruling on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza said on Tuesday that he hoped the British House of
Lords would throw out the charges by Spanish and British lawyers
against former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to justify what happened before or after
(Pinochet's 1973 coup). We are requesting jurisdictional immunity
concerning events that happened in Chile," Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to judge outside Chile events that
happened in Chile before or after September 11, 1973," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Insulza criticized Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon for "clearly
adopting a policy of saying that he would get Pinochet in any way
he could, without respecting any procedures."
</P>
<P>
At a new hearing at the British House of Lords on Monday, Alun
Jones, a lawyer for the British and Spanish governments, said he
has new evidence of Pinochet joining a "conspiracy" of Chilean
military officers of murder and torture in days preceding the
1973 coup against then leftist President Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the new evidences will probably lead
to the rejection of Pinochet's claim for state immunity.
</P>
<P>
If Pinochet loses again in the House of Lords, he will have to
start a lengthy battle against extradition. But if Britain's
highest court upholds another court's November 25 ruling, he will
be free to return to his home land.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that the United States must meet security challenges
by fighting against terrorism and weapons proliferation,
supporting security and stability in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union address, Clinton said, "No nation in
history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now
have to shape a world more peaceful, secure and free."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the U.S. must expand cooperation with
Russia, Ukraine, and the other former Soviet nations to safeguard
nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the
wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
"My balanced budget will increase funding for these critical
efforts by almost two thirds over the next five years," said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration had imposed tough sanctions against
some institutions in Russia, accusing them of passing nuclear and
missile technologies to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. will reverse the decline in defense
spending that began in 1985. Since April, nearly six billion U.S.
dollars have been added to maintain the military readiness.
</P>
<P>
"My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the
next six years for readiness and modernization, and pay and
benefits for our troops," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals.
The START II treaty and the framework we have already agreed to
for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their Cold War
height," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged the Congress to approve the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, which was signed by him two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the Treaty
now, so we can make it harder for other nations to develop
nuclear arms -- and we can end nuclear testing forever," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president promised to increase efforts to restrain the
spread of nuclear weapons and missiles in countries, including
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made it clear that the United States will continue to
contain Iraq. "We will work for the day when Iraq has a
government worthy of its people."
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the U.S. strategy in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We must support security in Europe and Asia -- expanding NATO
and defining its new missions at its 50th Anniversary summit this
year in Washington, maintaining our alliance with Japan and
Korea, and our other Asian allies, and engaging China," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized the importance of the United Nations
although the U.S. took military actions against Iraq without
consulting the UN last month.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing
burdens America might otherwise bear alone. America needs a
strong and effective UN," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our
debts," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Clinton urged Congress to
provide resources to implement the Wye Agreement, which was
signed between Israelis and Palestinians last October in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We must not, we dare not, let them down," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the American policies in Latin America, Clinton
said, "To increase shared prosperity, we will work to launch a
Free Trade Area of the Americas."
</P>
<P>
The American people have opened their arms and their hearts to
our Central American and Caribbean neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of terrorism, Clinton said the U.S. will work to keep
terrorists from disrupting computer networks, to prepare local
communities for biological and chemical emergencies, and to
support research into vaccines and treatments.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Greece Find Expelling OSCE Mission Chief unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of
Bulgaria and Greece said on Tuesday that Yugoslavia's declaration
of the mission chief in Kosovo of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) persona non grata is
"unacceptable," according to a statement issued after their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who was on a
one-day visit to Sofia on Tuesday, said, "We believe that the
culprits for the massacre in Kosovo should be punished as
criminals are."
</P>
<P>
In his view, the Yugoslav government should be responsible for
the killing, while all provocations on the part of the ethnic
Albanian side should also be condemned without this serving as a
justification for the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that around Monday midnight the Greek government
contacted the Serbian government and expressed its disapproval of
declaring William Walker, head of the OSCE mission, persona non
grata.
</P>
<P>
Greece confirmed its support for the stand that the OSCE
mission in Kosovo should include observers from countries
neighboring Yugoslavia, such as Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova
recalled that the Yugoslav authorities were against the
participation of observers of the neighboring countries in the
OSCE mission. She described this as a refusal to use an important
instrument for finding a lasting peaceful solution to the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Pangalos, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov assured him that for Bulgaria, an air strike against
Serbia would be the worst option.
</P>
<P>
Kostov said that the latest events in Kosovo show that the
threat of NATO air strikes has not been eliminated, and urged
that countries in the region consider once again how they can
help solve the conflict.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details UN Security Council Lashes out at Massacre in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday night issued a presidential statement, voicing
its strong condemnation of the massacre of ethnic Albanians in
southern Kosovo, the Serbian province where ethnic Albanians make
up some 90 percent of the province's two-million population.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council strongly condemns the massacre of Kosovo
Albanians in the village of Racak in southern Kosovo, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, on January 15, 1999, as reported by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Kosovo
Verification Mission (KVM)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, read to the press here by the president of the
15-nation Security Council, Celso Amorim of Brazil, came at the
end of unscheduled closed-door consultations on the latest
development in Kosovo, where conflicts broke out after ethnic
Albanians fought with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
"It notes with concern that the report of the KVM states that
the victims were civilians, including women and at least one
child," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council also takes note of the statement by the Head of
the KVM that the responsibility for the massacre lay with the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia security forces, and that
uniformed members of both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
armed forces and Serbian special police had been involved," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council emphasizes the need for an urgent and full
investigation of the facts and urgently calls upon the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to work with the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and KVM to ensure that those
responsible are brought to justice," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The corpses of 45 civilians, including three women and one
12-year-old child, were reportedly found on Saturday on hillsides
and gullies around Racak, some 25 kilometers south of the
provincial capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council deplored the decision by
Belgrade to declare KVM Head of Mission William Walker person non
grata and reaffirmed its "full support" for Walker and the
efforts of the OSCE to facilitate a peaceful settlement in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "calls upon Belgrade to rescind this
decision and to cooperate fully with Walker and KVM," the statem
ent said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Security Council deplored the decision by the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to refuse access to the chief
prosecutor of the International Tribunal, Louise Arbour of
Canada, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Arbour was turned away at the Kosovo border on Monday when she
planned to conduct an investigation of the massacre in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sergei
Lavrov told reporters here on Monday that Arbour had "never
addressed the Security Council asking for support before she
decided to go."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "calls upon the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal in
carrying out an investigation in Kosovo, in line with the call
for cooperation with the International Tribunal" under relevant
Security Council resolutions, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held the unscheduled consultations in a
bid to bridge gaps about who should probe the killings, a
controversial issue before the end of the Council's emergency
session.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said on Monday that the Yugoslavia authorities should
lead the investigation but should cooperate with the
International Tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Calls for Political Settlement of Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry
issued a statement Tuesday to express its concern over the
escalation of tension in Kosovo and call for a political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities are creating a "dangerous precedent"
of breaking its agreement with the OSCE, the statement said,
citing that Belgrade has demanded OSCE Kosovo verification
mission chief William Walker leave the country within 48 hours
and denied international investigators access to the village of
Racak, where 45 ethic Albanian civilians were allegedly killed by
Yugoslav police forces.
</P>
<P>
Only after Yugoslavia make a constructive cooperation with the
OSCE, can the truth behind the killings be discovered by
international investigators, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Opposed to any intentions to solve the Kosovo crisis by the
use of force, the statement asked all conflicting parties in
Kosovo to abandon military operations and resume negotiations,
while abiding by the Yugoslav promises of securing the safety of
OSCE monitors.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has all along held that a solution to the Kosovo
should be found on the basis that the territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia is preserved and greater autonomy is given to Kosovo,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls to Build 21st Century Economy for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said in the State of the Union on Tuesday night that the United
States today "is the most dynamic, competitive, job creating
economy in history" and "can do even better -- in building a 21st
century economy for all Americans."
</P>
<P>
"America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion
in our history -- with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising
at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest
homeownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years
-- and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three decades, he said, the budget is
balanced. From a deficit of 290 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, the
U.S. had a surplus of 70 billion dollars last year and is "on
course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years".
</P>
<P>
"So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding,
our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to
meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
He asked Congress to support his plan to help businesses raise
up to 15 billion dollars of private sector capital to bring jobs
and opportunity to inner cities and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton's proposal did not include income tax cuts and
 thus is certain to set up conflicts with many Republicans who
want the budget surplus spent, at least in part, to reduce
taxes.

YANGON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A national seminar on Myanmar's
health development in the 21st century is being held here to find
ways and means to meet the health challenges of the century as one
of the member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO)
Southeast Asia (SEA) Region.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein said at the
seminar, which began Tuesday, that the country's National Health
Committee has provided policy guidelines for the country's
national health plan to achieve "Health For All By 2000", forming
strong partnership with government and non-governmental
organizations in the community.
</P>
<P>
He cited successful implementation of the National Immunization
 Days in the country in the last four years, in which nearly six
million under-five children were administered oral polio vaccine
within a day for two successive rounds.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a Myanmar township, Ayadaw, won the Sasakawa
Health Prize for its outstanding achievement in primary health
care in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration on Health Development in the SEA Region in the
21st Century was adopted at the 15th Meeting of the Health

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Major Panamanian private
and government agencies started a series of civic events on
Tuesday to celebrate the return of the Panama Canal on December
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government has dubbed 1999 "the year of the return of the
Panama Canal."
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal Authority, created by President Ernesto Perez
Balladares to manage the waterway, also wants to raise the
population's consciousness regarding the political importance of
the event.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal Commission, a U.S. government federal agency,
and the Panama Aviation Company travel agency have printed
special calendars showing scenes from the canal's history.
</P>
<P>
The land transportation agency under the justice ministry has
manufactured license plates showing an image of the canal that
will be used for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The General Comptroller's Office has ordered the printing of a
background representing the canal's giant Miraflores locks on the
paychecks of 150,000 public employees.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian Amateur Baseball Federation has decided to dub
its major championship game as the "Canal Return Cup."
</P>
<P>
The chief news media, TV and radio networks and local dailies
are broadcasting and publishing special features on the
importance of the canal in Panama's economic life.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Agricultural Products Fall on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Prices of major
agricultural products fell Tuesday on U.S. market as investors
are concerned that Brazil's currency crisis will extend to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the Board of Trade of the City of New York, raw sugar for
March delivery tumbled by 0.73 cent, or 9 percent, to 7.69 cents
a pound, the lowest active-contract price since December 28 and
the biggest one-day loss since October 1995.
</P>
<P>
March arabica coffee fell by nine cents, or 8 percent, to
1.066 U.S. dollars a pound.
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Board of Trade, March wheat fell by 8.5 cents
to 2.6815 dollars a bushel; March corn fell by 1.75 cents to
2.1375 dollars a bushel; March oats fell by two cents to 1.0575
dollars a bushel; March soybeans fell by 7.25 cents to 5.25
dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
U.S analysts say all these are bad news for U.S. farmers, who
saw a 32 percent plunge in Brazil's currency in the last week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and foreign producers are anticipating two problems: a
collapse of demand in Brazil itself, the world's ninth-largest
economy, and a flood of cheap goods from Brazil that will put
further downward pressure on commodity.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched a massive road expansion program in the North Western
Province where a crucial provincial poll is scheduled for January
25.
</P>
<P>
This 1000 million rupees (15 million U.S. dollars) project
which began last September is due to be completed by the end of
this year, said official sources Wednesday.

<P>
The main project entails the development of the highway from
Katunayake in the Western Province to Keeriyankalliya in the North
Western Province and the construction of five modern bridges.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the road and bridge rehabilitation program
will considerably cut travel time from the Colombo international
airport to the sacred city of Aunradhapura through Puttalam.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to immensely benefit tourists and pilgrims, said
the sources, adding that cultivators and industrialists will also
be able to transport their commodities faster, once the project

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details Clinton Offers Bold Plan to Protect Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
made State of the Union address in Congress Tuesday, offering a
bold plan to protect Social Security with budget surpluses that
Republicans are eyeing for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
On a day of high drama that shifted from his trial in the
Senate to his State of the Union speech, Clinton urged spending
billions of U.S. dollars for new programs in child care,
education, crime-fighting, the environment and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
With the economy booming, Clinton reported "the state of our
union is strong. America is working again. The promise of our
future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we
allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency."
</P>
<P>
The president's proposal would create new retirement accounts
for workers and invest some of Social Security's cash reserves in
the stock market for the first time. "With the number of elderly
Americans set to double by 2030," Clinton said, "the baby boom
will become a senior boom."
</P>
<P>
Moving from last year's call to "save Social Security first,"
Clinton proposed transferring 62 percent of expected budget
surpluses over the next 15 years -- 2.7 trillion dollars -- to
the Social Security account to keep the program solvent until
2055.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five percent of that money would be invested by the
government in the stock market in hopes of achieving higher
returns, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both
houses and ask you to join me in saying we will save Social
Security now," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we
knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we
should not spend any of it until after Social Security is truly
saved." he continued.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan also would reserve 15 percent of the surplus
-- 650 billion dollars over 15 years -- for the ailing Medicare
system. An additional 11 percent of the surplus -- 500 billion
dollars -- would be devoted to new government-subsidized
retirement accounts, with the Treasury matching the savings of
lower-income people. The rest of the surplus would go for
military spending and domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's speech came just hours after White House lawyers
began defending the president in a Senate trial, arguing he was
innocent of perjury and obstruction of justice charges and "must
not be removed from office." The president spoke from the same
House chamber where lawmakers voted exactly one month ago along
party lines to impeach him -- only the second time in history
that has happened.
</P>
<P>
Never before has a U.S. president delivered a State of the
Union address under such extraordinary conditions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows More Efforts to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton said
in his State of the Union speech Tuesday that the most fateful
new challenge facing the American people is the threat of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
He proposed spending two billion U.S. Dollars to set up a new
clean air fund to help American people reduce pollution and
protect the country's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded. "Last
year's heat waves, ice storms, and floods are but a hint of what
future generations may endure if we don't act now," he told
Congress lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that he will work with Congress to take action to
reduce greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
In the last State of the Union message of this century,
Clinton also stressed the need to strengthen the U.S. lead in
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said his government's investment led to the creation of the
Internet, and a nearly 30 percent increase in investments will be
diverted into long-term computing research.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Clinton also called for efforts to resolve the
Y2K problem, and urged the federal and local governments and
businesses to work together to eliminate the problem before
entering the new century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Calls for New Round of Global Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to contain a rise
of protectionism in the wake of the global financial chaos, U.S.
President Bill Clinton called for a new round of global trade
talks, which could be kicked off at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the State of the Union address here Tuesday night, Clinton
said that the new round of talks would help expand exports of
services, of manufactures, and most of all, farm products,
building a freer trade system for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the United States will work with the
International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise
labor standards around the world. And this year, "we will lead
the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive
child labor everywhere in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials hinted the new round of trade talks, which
could be called the Clinton Round, will be the key U.S. goal at a
meeting of trade ministers from more than 120 countries in
December this year.
</P>
<P>
European and Japanese officials had been urging the U.S. to
back a new, comprehensive round of negotiations but the U.S.
administration had been debating internally just how broad those
talks should be, fearing a repeat of the impasse that plagued the
last global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
Those negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round, because they
were launched in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, dragged on for
seven years as the participating countries could not reach
agreement on all facets of the talks.
</P>
<P>
While planning to push for comprehensive talks, the
administration wants a more limited range of negotiations than
the Uruguay Round. Among the areas it will seek to cover are
industrial tariffs, agriculture, services, intellectual property,
labor rights and environment.
</P>
<P>
The actual scope of the talks will be decided at discussions
over the next several months leading up to the December
ministerial meeting. While the site has not been selected, the
six cities being considered are Dallas, Denver, Detroit, San
Diego, Seattle and Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Develop Tourist Attractions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to develop little
known tourist attractions through a program launched by the
Tourist Board to promote foreign tourism as well as domestic
tourism, the official Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An official told the paper that the board has identified 10
such locations in association with the Ministry of Provincial
Councils and 10 million rupees (150,000 U.S. dollars) will be
spent to develop them.
</P>
<P>
The development program is aimed at developing infrastructure
to make available accessible roads to destinations and sites,
souvenir outlets and sanitary facilities, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Tourist Board and the Provincial Council Ministry have
already discussed the matter as the ministry is considered as the
ideal authority to push such a program.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry is the fourth foreign exchange earner in
Sri Lanka. There are over 300,000 foreign tourists traveling the
country annually during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign tourists' number declined in 1998 due to
terrorist bombings in Colombo and Southeast Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government launched the tourist
attractions program to promote "local tourism" and "foreign
tourism" as they are equally important.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate domestic tourism it is planned to make available
bungalows and guest houses for reasonable cheap accommodation.
</P>
<P>
It was the view of the Task Force on tourism that the
development of domestic tourism is important for creation of
economic activities at regional level, socio-cultural advancement
of the people and national integration, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Allows OSCE Mission Chief Another 24 Hours Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government has
agreed to allow top OSCE Kosovo monitor William Walker to extend
his stay in Yugoslavia for 24 hours, the Yugoslav Tanjug news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the request of Norwegian Foreign
Minister Knut Vollebaek, who is also the OSCE's rotating
chairman, the news agency quoted the Information Department as
saying.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, The Yugoslav government declared Walker, a retired
U.S. general and chairman of the Kosovo Verification Mission of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, persona
non-grata and ordered him to leave the country within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Walker had blamed the Yugoslav police forces for the deaths of
45 ethnic Albanian civilians in the South Kosovo village of
Racak, and asked the International Tribunal in the Hague to send
personnel to investigate the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade insisted that Serb police have only killed some 15
Albanian militants after being forced to open fire and stressed
that the conflict in Kosovo was between the state and terrorist
organizations, not a war, thus there is no ground for
International personnel to conduct investigations in the
embattled land.
</P>
<P>
Calling Walker's remarks "groundless", Yugoslavia said his
activities went far beyond the defined limits of the OSCE
mandate, and represented a "brutal violation" of the agreement
reached between Belgrade and the OSCE.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 950 hectares of poppy
fields were destroyed in Shan State of Myanmar in the last two
months, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported

<HEADLINE> Extramarital Birth in Bulgaria Reaches 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The extramarital birth rate in
Bulgaria has hit a record high of 14 percent, a recent survey by
the Women's Democratic Union of Bulgaria claims.
</P>
<P>
Emilia Maslarova, president of the national women's
organization, announced the results of this survey at a recent
seminar on women's problems in the city of Dobrich, said the
Bulgarian Telegraph Agency.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that most of the 3,000 women between
18-45 who answered the poll chose traditional marriage as their
own normal lifestyle, with another 7 percent giving options to
non-identified marriage or celibacy, while 66 percent of those
responding said "yes" to giving birth out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Bulgarian women generally were
married for the first time and bore the first child between the
ages of 18-22, much earlier than women in other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the increase in the number of
children being born out of wedlock to women's fears of family
violence and the rising number of pregnancies among unmarried
teenage girls.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Sofia, at least 15 women a year reportedly
die from abuse inflicted by a legal spouse.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's macroeconomic
goals will remain unchanged in 1999 despite Brazil's financial
instability, said Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said the 3 percent growth rate predicted by the governme
nt was "possible," adding that measures taken in recent years and
in the past few weeks would enable Mexico to successfully face
world market volatility.
</P>
<P>
He said Mexico has already dealt with the effects of the
Brazilian crisis and that the flagging peso, interest rates and
stocks have recovered from the so-called samba effect.
</P>
<P>
"We must remain calm, wait until the markets stabilize and
most of all, wait until the strength of the Mexican economy
becomes obvious," Gurria said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister pointed out that the economy's
"intrinsic" strength is based on the implementation of a moderate
financial deficit and a flexible exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
He said the exchange rate policy has prompted an increase in
savings and eliminated the need for excessive indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
We have been cautious in recent years and we are not
overburdened by excessive terms on our overall indebtedness,"
said Gurria.

PANAMA CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign
Minister Jorge Eduardo Ritter on Tuesday rejected reports that
the United States intended to postpone the turn-over of Howard
air force base.
</P>
<P>
Ritter told the press that U.S. military personnel could leave
Panama earlier than originally scheduled in the 1977
Torrijos-Carter treaty, which set the date for the withdrawal of
U.S. troops on December 31, 1999, at the latest.
</P>
<P>
He said the Panamanian government had not received any U.S.
request to remain longer in its military bases, rejecting the
reports as unfounded rumors spread by some politicians for their
own purposes.
</P>
<P>
This week, U.S. press reports said there was a proposal in the
U.S. Congress to postpone the return to Panama of Howard air forc
e base, located on one side of the canal.
</P>
<P>
The base is a key logistical and operational center for U.S.
military forces throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
From Howard, U.S. troops carry out joint anti-drug operations
with authorities from Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and other South
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Howard also provides logistical and technical assistance to
the Colombian government in its fight against rebel guerrilla
groups.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Export Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China will introduce more
counter-measures in 1999 to address harsh international
challenges and maintain a growth in exports, China Daily said
today.
</P>
<P>
Hit hard by the Asian financial crisis, China's export lost
momentum throughout 1998. Statistics from the General
Administration of Customs show that China's export volume only
edged up 0.5 percent from 1997 to reach 183.8 billion U.S.
dollars last year, the lowest record of annual growth rate in the
past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign trade volume dropped 0.4 percent in 1998 to
323.93 billion U.S. dollars, the first year of negative growth
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation (Moftec) said that China is to export more bulk
commodities and improve the quality and profits of exports this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We will also expand overseas processing and installation of
business this year," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
While enabling China to transfer part of its surplus
production capacity abroad, this move will stimulate exports of
Chinese raw materials and circumvent export quotas imposed on
China-originated products by the EU and the US, trade experts
said.
</P>
<P>
China will use the element of credit, taxation and economic
co-operation to expand its exports of hi-tech and high
value-added commodities and mechanical and electronic equipment,
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will also try to boost exports through
increasing imports and step up efforts in responding anti-dumping
cases against Chinese products, sources from Moftec said.
</P>
<P>
Shi also stressed that China will use overseas investment, but
only where it is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
"The preferential policies for overseas investors will be
vigorously implemented. We will stop all titles of random charges
and improve laws to better investment environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that favorable conditions do exist despite current
harsh economic environment.
</P>
<P>
"China's rapidly growing economy has raised the nation's
profile and laid a solid foundation to counter potential risks.
That, essentially, is the basic favorable factor for China's
trade and economic cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Shi noted that the proceeding of domestic reforms and
bilateral friendly relations between China and the rest of the
world will provide many opportunities for China's trade and

<P>
BELGRADE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Initial autopsies showed that
40 bodies found in the Kosovo village of Racak were those of
armed ethnic Albanians who died in fighting last weekend, not
civilians as claimed by OSCE chief inspector William Walker, a
local judge told the Tanjug news agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
OSCE official Walker, who on Saturday visited the site of the
killings in the southern Kosovo village, blamed Serbian security
forces for the deaths of 45 ethnic Albanian farmers, including
three women and a child.
</P>
<P>
Danica Marinkovic, judge of the Pristina court in Kosovo, said
investigators from the Yugoslav judicial department transported
only 40 bodies to the Forensic Medicine Institute in Pristina on
Monday with the help of the verifiers of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
Marinkovic said Yugoslav forensic doctors from Pristina,
Belgrade, Nis and Norisad conducted the autopsies on Tuesday in
the presence of their Belarussian colleagues and OSCE verifiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDs is spreading across
Vietnam at a rapid pace, and increasing numbers of young people
are being drawn into its vortex, the Vietnam News reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,500 new infections were detected in 1998, the
English-language newspaper quoted reports to a two-day National
Conference on HIV/AIDs Prevention began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of HIV carriers nation-wide as of January 16
was 11,681. Of them, 2,231 have developed full-blown AIDs and
1,180 have died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports, HIV/AIDs is spreading not only
in urban areas but also in remote and isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that low-risk provinces including border areas
will also be affected by this plague.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's government strives to have 82 percent of those people
aged 15-49 aware of the threat of HIV/AIDs and how to prevent it,
Health Minister Do Nguyen Phuong told the national conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that 70 percent of detected HIV carriers will be
provided with care and consulting services and all HIV-affected
pregnant women will be provided with treatment in 1999.

WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
made State of the Union address in Congress Tuesday, offering a
bold plan to protect Social Security with budget surpluses that
Republicans are eyeing for tax cuts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youngsters Decide for Themselves: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese youngsters would
rather make decision on their own than follow advice from
experts, according to a national poll.
</P>
<P>
About 6,800 urban residents aged between 14 and 28 were asked:
"If someone tells you that one mu (0.0667 hectare) land can
produce 1,000 kilograms grain, in what way do you think you can
justify that person?"
</P>
<P>
Among eight given options for the answer, about half of the
respondents chose to "make a thorough analysis of the enclosed
information and do some experiment if possible".
</P>
<P>
"The result shows the highly developed independence of the
urban youth," today's China Daily quoted researchers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Options from experts specialized in agriculture won the trust
of 35.1 percent of the respondents while 1.7 percent said they
would toss the coin. Some 7.5 percent said they had no idea of
the question.
</P>
<P>
Urban youths would cast a skeptical eye on experts now. They
based their judgment not only on scientific advice but also on
their own practice, said pollsters with China Youth Research
Center together with China Youth Development Foundation.
</P>
<P>
It was impossible for the urban young people to accept so
called authorities including their tutors and heads without their
own analysis of the facts, they said.

<HEADLINE> State Plans to Lower Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The central government intends
to achieve its industrial sulfur dioxide emission goals by next
year.
</P>
<P>
The government also intends to attack the spread of acid rain,
which now affects about 30 percent of China's territory, today's
China Daily quoted an official of the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's atmospheric pollution results mainly from
coal-burning, with soot and sulfur dioxide as the major
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
SEPA official Yu Fei admitted that China has met only 50
percent of its national standard pollution-reduction goals. The
country is the second largest emitter of sulfur dioxide in the
world.
</P>
<P>
This year's All-China Century Tour of Environmental Protection
will focus on checking atmospheric pollution, said Yu.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain, a result of atmospheric pollution, is very serious
in Central and Southwest China, with notable increases in the
southwest. Acid rain in South China mainly occurs in the Pearl
River Delta.
</P>
<P>
He said China is paying ample attention to atmospheric
pollution control.
</P>
<P>
China expects that by 2010, the air concentration of sulfur
dioxide in cities will be within national standards and the
country will try to reduce the range of acid rain in controlled
zones significantly below levels set for 2000, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The official reiterated that to mitigate the effects of acid
rain, the government has adopted a series of measures, including
the use of cleaner coal and energy conservation to help prevent
acid rain.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister
Nadezhda Mihailova Tuesday condemned last Saturday's killing of
45 ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo village of Racak on
January.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is closely watching the matter and the dangerous
possibility of the breakout of new massive conflicts between
ethnic Albanians and Serbians, said Mihailova in a statement
issued via the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova firmly urged international investigations into the
matter and cooperation of concerning parties with the
International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to Yugoslavia to reconsider the decision
to expel William Walker, chairman of the Kosovo Verification
Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Belgrade blamed Walker for being unfair in solving the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova urged the concerning parties to exert restraint from
extremist and violent actions and to hold negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, in talks wit
h visiting Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, expressed
concerns about the deterioration of Kosovo situation and hoped
that the countries in this region could consult with each other
to seek political settlement on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of the population
in Kosovo. They have constantly demanded independence of Kosovo
from Yugoslavia, where the Serbians are the dominant ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The two ethnic groups have constantly broke into conflicts.
Last Saturday, the Yugoslav armed forces killed 45 ethnic
Albanians, whom Belgrade labeled as terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Finance Minister's Resignation Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso on Tuesday denied reports of Finance Minister
Pedro Malan's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a lie. I spoke to him last night and he will
continue to work for Brazil. Malan will not leave the
government," Cardoso told a group of new ambassadors to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
A rumor of Malan's resignation was circulating Monday night in
local financial markets following the Central Bank's decision to
increase its annual interest rate from 36 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rate hike appeared to be aimed at containing
inflation in the wake of the devaluation of the real.
</P>
<P>
The real closed Monday at 1.59 to the dollar, plunging 24
percent since last Tuesday, just before the government made its
first step to devalue the currency.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government had spent 45 billion dollars of its
foreign currency reserves to prop up the real.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Central Bank often intervenes in the market by
spending reserve dollars to buy reals, driving up their value.
</P>
<P>
Malan, a key player in Cardoso's economic team, masterminded
the real devaluation program.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Myanmar Strives to Reduce Crime Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been carrying out a
systematic program for reducing violence against women in the
country.
</P>
<P>
More research on the issue, which the world characterizes as a
social ill, are being conducted in Yangon and other parts of the
country to gain more data despite information about the extent of
this violence is still relatively scant.
</P>
<P>
Violence against women is among the six priority areas of
concern for Myanmar women identified by the government. The other
priority areas are education, health, economy, culture and
girl-child.
</P>
<P>
Activities on all these priority areas are reportedly under
successful implementation throughout the country since the Myanmar
National Committee for Women's Affairs (MNCWA) was formed in July
1996 with a sub-committee handling prevention of violence against
women.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an awareness campaign is also launched for
dissemination of information through print and electronic media as
well as by holding discussions and seminars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Training programs for police, prosecutors, judicial personnel
and prison officials are being developed to enhance knowledge
awareness of the causes, consequences and mechanism of violence
against women.
</P>
<P>
In addition, counsel centers are opened to provide necessary
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Following the first convening of Myanmar Women's Conference in
last December, the country also hosted for the first time a
regional consultation meeting on violence against women and the
role of health sector in Yangon in January, sharing experiences
with resource persons of other Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The regional meeting is believed to go a long way in adopting
new strategies and means of reducing the dimension of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The two events have also demonstrated the recognition of the
crucial role of women in Myanmar society and the government's
commitment to advancement of women.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also implementing the Beijing Declaration and the
Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on
Women held in Beijing in 1995. The country acceded in July 1997 to
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.
</P>
<P>
Yangon is seen as one of the safest global cities in terms of
crime including crime against women.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's women population accounted for 23.6 million or 50.34
percent of the 46.4-million total population in 1997-98 fiscal
year, official statistics show.

SHANGHAI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A taxi passenger who suffered
serious disability in a traffic accident will be compensated with
286,000 yuan, according to a recent local court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Ma Denglun, an employee of the Shanghai Prospecting and
Designing Institute, suffered fractures causing sexual disability
when the taxi in which he was riding collided head-on with
another car on May 10, 1995 due to negligence on the part of the
taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
After attempts to negotiate a compensation deal between Ma and
the Shanghai Yuanlin Hotel, the owner of the taxi, failed, Ma
filed a lawsuit to a court in the Yangpu District in January last
year, demanding a lump sum compensation of 750,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of the awarded compensation amount, according to the court ru
ling, 117,000 yuan is for medical treatment fees, transportation
fees, lost salaries and the cost of reconstructive surgery,
69,000 yuan for injury evaluation fees and disability
compensation fees, and 100,000 yuan for emotional suffering.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that the Shanghai Yuanlin Hotel has not
accepted this first ruling, and plans to appeal to the Second

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Refugee Camp in Northeastern Thailand to be Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai authorities and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have voiced
confidence that a Cambodian refugee camp in Si Sa Ket province,
northeastern Thailand, would be closed in April.
</P>
<P>
Sunai Lardkhamkrung, deputy governor of the province, said
Tuesday after talks with UNHCR officials that both were satisfied
with the ongoing repatriation plan, despite the inability to send
the refugees back in a large batch, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The camp, at Phu Sing district, housing 14,866 Cambodian
refugees, could be emptied in the next four months unless the
smooth process in disrupted, Sunai said.
</P>
<P>
Regional representative of the UNHCR for Thailand and Cambodia
Amelia Bonifacio Tuesday led the visitors to witness preparations
for sending 430 refugees back Wednesday to Cambodia. They formed
the third group going back this month.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation takes place twice a week because Cambodian
officials cannot accommodate them in a large group.

<HEADLINE> Textile Sector Gets Slimmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China's debt-laden textile
sector, the flagship of the country's state enterprise reforms,
laid off 660,000 workers and melted 4.8 million outmoded spindles
last year, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the country to witness such large
pool of lay-offs in one industrial sector in a year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the State Administration of Textile
Industry, the sector's losses were cut by 2.6 billion yuan (313
million U.S. dollars) to 1.84 billion yuan (221.6 million U.S.
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
"We have done all we can to achieve the targets under such
economic situation," said Du Yuzhou, director of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
The sector planned to eliminate 4.8 million spindles and
displace 600,000 employees in 1998 while the deficit was targeted
at 3 billion yuan (US$361 million).
</P>
<P>
The exports of textile products, the sector's key profit
source, saw a decline of 5.87 percent last year, a dramatic
change from the 31.1 percent of growth it enjoyed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At home, the sales volume dropped by 15 billion yuan last
year, hit hard by the sluggish domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Some local textile plants transferred outmoded spindles to the
township enterprises in order to obtain extra profits.
</P>
<P>
The government reserve fund, available to help companies write
off bad loans, reduced the sector's red numbers significantly
last year.
</P>
<P>
A number of loss-sustaining textile companies were helped at
the end of last year, when the sector received 12.6-billion-yuan
fund.
</P>
<P>
The write-off schedule included 134 bankruptcies and 217
mergers.
</P>
<P>
The spindle elimination and dismissal of employees are two
major tasks in the sector's three-year program.
</P>
<P>
This year the sector will lay off 440,000 workers and melt 4.8
million spindles.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the sector is to eliminate a total of 10 million
outmoded spindles and reduce payrolls by displacing 1.2 employees.
</P>
<P>
"The restructuring does not simply mean to reduce production,
but also to upgrade the whole industry," said Du.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- International Tennis
Federation president Brian Tobin claimed the drugs did not
obsessed tennis when he said in Melbourne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I can't accept the fact that tennis is being killed or
damaged by drugs. It's very isolated," the Australian said in a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Tobin said in the five years the ITF had run a drugs program
with the Association of Tennis Professionals there had been only
six or seven positive tests out of more than 1,000 tests taken
annually.
</P>
<P>
The drugs controversy was unleashed when Petr Korda, last
year's Australian Open champion, tested positive for anabolic
steroids at Wimbledon last year.
</P>
<P>
He escaped a ban and was allowed to defend his crown at the
current Australian Open event because of the ITF appeals
committee said as exceptional circumstances which have not been
explained.
</P>
<P>
The ITF, who has now asked the Court of Sports Arbitration in
Lausanne to rule on the case, planned to extend its 12-month ban
for steroid-type drugs.
</P>
<P>
Tobin said: "Tennis is a clean sport. All we have here is a
dispute over a penalty. That's the problem."

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Charlotte Hornets might
lose its leading scorer Glen Rice at the beginning of the season
since the NBA player plans to have a lone chip surgically removed
from his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
Rice said doctors have told him the normal recovery time
following the arthroscopic procedure is 3-6 weeks, meaning that
if the surgery is done this week, he could miss nearly the first
four weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
"Not having Glen from the start will be a real challenge,"
Hornets general manager Bob Bass said Tuesday. "We are waiting
for Glen to get some additional opinions on the injury."
</P>
<P>
An All-Star in each of the past two seasons, Rice has been
wearing a sleeve on his right elbow for most of the past two
years. The bone chip was discovered by a magnetic resonance
imagining test.
</P>
<P>
The injury marks the first time in his pro career. He has
missed only 20 games in nine NBA seasons, and he has averaged
21.6, 26.8 and 22.3 points in three seasons in Charlotte and is
one of the best three-point shooters in the NBA.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Luc Longley is expected to
sign a five-year, $30 million deal with the Chicago Bulls, who
would be traded by Bulls to the Phoenix Suns for three reserves.
</P>
<P>
Longley joins Scottie Pippen and Steve Kerr leaving the six-
time NBA champions when the lockout is over.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Mcdyess, one of the big names Suns hope to re-sign
with, has narrowed his choices to the Suns and the Denever
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
"Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's most at
home with those two options: Phoenix is going to stay a winner,
and Denver is going to be a winner," agent Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
The Suns expected to trade three of the five players they have
under contract to Chicago for center Luc Longley. Longley was in
Phoenix on Tuesday and worked out on the Suns' practice court.
</P>
<P>
Longley will earn about $4 million this season, while the Suns
would send Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Longley said: "I think there's a good chance I will be here
and I'd like to be here. It seems like a good town. If we can
agree to terms, this is probably my favorite choice of towns to
be in."

In most of the trading day, investors were nervous about the

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has started a "weapons for development"
program in Albania's Gramsch district, a release from the agency
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program encourages Albanians to turn in illegal small arms
in exchange for social services, improved infrastructure and
development assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to the Government of Albania, the Gramsch district
has one of the highest concentrations of weapons in the country.
There are an estimated 10,000 illegal arms in the district, which
has a population of only 50,000.
</P>
<P>
UNDP has allocated 1 million U.S. dollars for the programs and
will establish a trust fund for disarmament in Albania to channel
additional donor contributions.

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Paolo di Canio has been passed
fit by two doctors -- but there seems little chance of an early
comeback with Sheffield Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian agreed to be examined by an independent medical
practitioner after earlier informing the club he was suffering
from stress and depression.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio has not played since the Football Association banned
him for 11 matches for pushing referee Paul Alcock over after
being sent off in the home game with Arsenal last September.
</P>
<P>
He was subsequently given compassionate leave by the club but
failed to return by an agreed date and has been fined every week
by them since mid-December.

<HEADLINE> Solskjaer Says no, but Negri on Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United's
second-string striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has rejected the
chance to resurrect his first-team career with a move to West Ham.
</P>
<P>
But there was better news for Hammers boss Harry Redknapp when
Rangers forward Marco Negri began a week's trial with the London
side.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian striker Solskjaer has been surplus to requirements
at Old Trafford for much of the season due to the burgeoning
partnership between Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke.
</P>
<P>
Norway manager Nils Johan Semb has already warned Solskjaer
his international place will be at risk unless he is playing
first-team football.
</P>
<P>
But, after turning down a move to Tottenham in August, he has
now shrugged off an approach from Redknapp, who is desperate to
replace John Hartson following the Welsh frontman's move to
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"If I had been at any other club but United then I think I
would have gone to the manager and asked to leave," he admitted.
"But I want to stay here and win things."

UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations

<P>
According to diplomats here, the Security Council was seeking

</P>

The diplomats said the differences center on whether Canadian
Louise Arbour, the prosecutor for the U.N. war crimes tribunal who

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States expressed
hope Tuesday that Cuban leader Fidel Castro will use his influence
to promote peace in Colombia by being a mediator in that country's
civil war.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin noted that Castro
accepted a request from Colombian President Andres Pastrana to act
as a go-between at some point in Colombia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If this were to occur, let me simply say we hope that Castro
would convey very clearly to the insurgents that the time for
violence is over and that all Colombians should be working towards
a negotiated settlement," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana met with Castro in Havana in recent days. Also taking
part in the talks was Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana has given high priority to ending Colombia's 34-year
civil war and opened negotiations on January 7 with Colombia's
largest guerrilla group, the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia.

<HEADLINE> UK to Release New Support to Sierra Leone Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- British government is to release
one million pound (about 1.6 million U.S. dollars) humanitarian
assistance for the people of Sierra Leone, Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Further logistical support for Nigerian-led forces which are
fighting rebels who intend to oust elected President Kabbbah in
the Western African country would also be released, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary told parliament members the government
had followed recent events in the former British colony "with
grave concern".
</P>
<P>
The situation in Sierra Leone "remains worrying", with much of
the capital, Freetown, destroyed and much of the rest of the
country in rebels' hands, Mr Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to an emergency question on the deteriorating
situation in Sierra Leone, Mr Cook said the Nigerian leader,
General Abubakar, had rung British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the call, General Abubakar thanked the United Kingdom for
its support to his forces earlier this month by offering trucks
and other equipment, as well as intelligence-sharing.
</P>
<P>
Mr Cook said he would raise the subject of Sierra Leone at this

<HEADLINE> Hague Sets Out British Way Against Labor's Third Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Conservative Party
leader William Hague warned Tuesday that Prime Minister Tony
Blair's "third way" is undermining the most fundamental aspects of
British life.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Conservative think tank, the Center for
Policy Studies, he set out an alternative "British way" for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Hague said, "The prime minister is in effect holding a dagger
to the heart of what it is to be British. If he is left to carry
on unchecked, he will drive it right through that heart."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the third way was pushed forward, British
people "will wake up and find themselves living in what feels to
be a different country."
</P>
<P>
"People did not elect a Labor government because they wanted to
make Britain into a foreign country. But the impact of the Blair
agenda will make people strangers in their own land -- with an
alien voting system and Parliament and an over-mighty state," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is why the third way is a threat to the British way. New
Labor is a threat to our Britishness, and our prime minister is a
threat to Britain."
</P>
<P>
The Tory leader focused on devolution in Wales and Scotland and
planned changes to the voting system and the House of Lords as
major threats to the national way of life.
</P>
<P>
He said that devolution has unleashed a wave of nationalism in
Scotland and Wales which, in turn, is threatening a dangerous
eruption of English nationalism.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Blair's policies on education, the family,
health, welfare and Europe are all contributing to destroy
"distinctive British qualities and political institutions."
</P>
<P>
"All these policies share one common feature, they run counter
to the essential character of the British people. They are the
third way not the British way. "
</P>
<P>
"Because New Labor do not understand the British way, they
pursue policies which not only threaten our political institutions
but also, because those institutions shape our national character,
threaten Britain itself," he said.

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- An international group of
scientists is leaving for Antarctica Tuesday to test whether iron
can help slow down global warming, The Daily Telegraph newspaper
has reported.
</P>
<P>
The team, which includes nine Britons from Plymouth Marine
Laboratory and the University of East Anglia, will use several
tons of iron to fertilize the southern ocean.
</P>
<P>
The scientists hope this could create a bloom of
micro-organisms that could scrub greenhouse gases from the Earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
They will measure changes in levels of carbon dioxide, the main
greenhouse gas produced by human activities, that are expected to
occur as a result of increased growth of algae.
</P>
<P>
And they will also check whether plankton produces other
greenhouse gases, The Daily Telegraph said.

BONN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Social Democrats will
decide at a special party congress early next year on whether to
advocate joining the single European currency, Sweden Trade
Minister Leif Pagrotsky said in an interview of the German
newspaper "Handelsblatt".
</P>
<P>
According to the interview, which will be published by
"Handelsblatt" on Wednesday, Pagrotsky said, if the party congress
decided that Sweden should join the euro launched at the start of
this year, his government would either hold a referendum on the
issue or make it a key issue of an election campaign.
</P>
<P>
A decision would come in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Pagrotsky said the decision on joining the euro zone also
hinged on whether the single European currency turned out to be a
success. It was important that there was a clear decision either
in favor or against the euro, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden will take over the rotating European Union presidency in
the first half of 2002.

<HEADLINE> UK Company Develops "Smart" Central Heating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A British company has invented a
"smart" central heating system that listens to the weather
forecast, the Daily Mail newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The electric system, called Celect and developed by EA
Technology, uses hidden radio signals broadcast by the BBC, which
carry the weather forecast for the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
By monitoring the radio every few hours, the boiler can predict
cold snaps or heat waves a day in advance and alter radiator
settings around the house ready for the sudden change.
</P>
<P>
The radiators will be told to store up heat in plenty of time
if a cold snap is on the way, and it will be turned down if it is
going to be warm.
</P>
<P>
The radio signals also tell the boiler the best time of the day
to use electricity. Once the computer knows the weather forecast,
it works out the most cheapest use of electricity, saving up to 40
percent on the electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
The system is now being tested in 350 British homes, according
to the Daily Mail.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says 48 Million Children, Women in Extreme Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Tuesday issued urgent appeal for
emergency assistance and protective measures for an estimated 48
million children and women who are victims of war, natural
disasters, extreme poverty and other forms of violence and
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, requesting just over 136 million U.S. dollars for
emergency assistance in 20 countries in an effort to stop these
trends, said seldom in history has such a large number of people
been in such danger.
</P>
<P>
"The entire picture of war in the world has changed," UNICEF
Executive Director Carol Bellamy said. "Today, children and women
are not only the first casualties in armed conflicts, they are
being deliberately targeted and are being forced to take part in
these conflicts as well."
</P>
<P>
"The plight of these millions of children and women speaks for
a major component of UNICEF's mandate: to ensure special
protection for the most disadvantaged and defenseless," Bellamy
said. "For this reason we appeal not only for funds but also to
the United Nations Security Council to increase recognition of the
needs of children and women in emergency situations."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy cited the need for specialized child rights training
for all military, civilian and peacekeeping personnel, so that
they will understand their solemn legal responsibilities to
children, including the need to shield children from violation of
their rights.
</P>
<P>
She also called for increasing the accountability of those who
target children and women, and who force children to become
soldiers, by hastening the process of deploying a fully empowered
International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
Only four years ago, UNICEF was working in some 15 countries
gripped by civil conflicts. Today that number has risen to more
than 55 nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling was
stronger against leading international currencies last week,
according to the Kenyan Central Bank's weekly update on economic
indicators released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan currency was trading against the U.S. Dollar at an
average rate of 61.62, compared to 62.01 in the previous week, the
update said.
</P>
<P>
The update, signed by the bank's chief economist Maurice Kanga,
said the Pound Sterling was mean-rated at Sh101.55, while the Euro
exchanged at 71. 56. The two currencies were traded in the 102.04
and 72.10 range respectively in the week up to January 13.
</P>
<P>
The update noted that the yield on the benchmark 91- day
Treasury bill recorded a marginal rise in the auction dated
January 18 to 10.78 percent from 10.74 posted previously.
</P>
<P>
At the Nairobi Stock Exchange Tuesday, the market's 20-share
index continued its decline into the second week, easing some
9.48 points to end at 3,028.34, the update said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the rally that the market witnessed
toward the end of the year may not hold as it was hinged on demand
for small lots. Most of the big investors do not seem to have
moved in.
</P>
<P>
Turnover increased by about 50 percent to net eight million
Shillings, the update said, adding that in the previous trading,
the bourse had sales of 4.6 million Shillings.

<HEADLINE> Albright Demands Yugoslavia to Allow Walker Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Tuesday asked the Yugoslav authorities to allow
U.S. diplomat William Walker, head of the verification mission in
Kosovo, to carry out his work.
</P>
<P>
With tensions between the United States and Yugoslavia already
running high, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic provoked
additional American anger by ordering the expulsion of Walker.
</P>
<P>
Albright demanded that Milosevic relent and permit Walker, to
carry out his work.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for Ambassador Walker to be able to do his
job," Albright told reporters after she and other national
security officials briefed lawmakers in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
In her remarks, Albright said she had spoken with other foreign
ministers about the situation over the past 24 hours. "The main
purpose here is for Mr. Milosevic to get the message," she said.
</P>
<P>
As to the possible use of force, Albright said: "The activation
order is on the table."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Milosevic is
"playing with fire" by giving Walker 48 hours to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
Walker has been in charge of hundreds of peace monitors who
have been sent to Kosovo in recent months to verify compliance
with a cease-fire reached last October involving Yugoslavia and
pro-independence ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia said the 45 Kosovo Albanian victims were guerrillas
who died in combat while Walker blamed their security forces for
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the U.N. Security Council member most sympathetic to
Yugoslavia, also condemned Walker's expulsion, calling it a matter
of "great concern" that can "only further destabilize the
situation."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Considering Sale of Farm Goods to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering selling farm goods to Iran but no decision has been
made, the State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's being considered," spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
"I don't think any decision has been made on this," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said Tuesday that Iran surprised Washington
with a request to buy more than 500 million dollars in U.S. grain
and sugar at a time when the Clinton administration just felt its
effort to rebuild ties to Iran was going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
The proposed transaction requires a Treasury Department license
and the application for that, Rubin said, has been filed with the
Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control.
</P>
<P>
"An application for a license to broker a sale of U.S.
agricultural products to Iran has been filed with the Treasury
Office of Foreign Assets Control," he said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The license is needed because President Bill Clinton banned all
trade with Iran in 1995 under what he called Iran's protect of
terrorism and opposition to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to comment on the status of internal
administration deliberations or on details of the license
application.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farm groups and a bipartisan group of farm state lawmakers
have urged Clinton to consider a waiver for the sale as a step
toward more normal trading relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Iran have severed their diplomatic
relations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed last year to hold government-to-government
talks, but his proposal was rejected by the Iranian government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Displeased at Italy in Ocalan Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States expressed
displeasure on Tuesday that Italy allowed Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan to escape justice.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that the path chosen by Italy does not appear to
have advanced the goal of bringing Ocalan to justice," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said at a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The United States believes Ocalan should be brought to justice
for the terrorist crimes of which he is accused in a manner
consistent with international standards for due process and
domestic legal requirements," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, whom Turkey and the United States call a terrorist, was
arrested in Rome in November 1989, but Italy refused to extradite
him to Turkey because Ankara retains the death penalty. He left
the country as a free man last weekend and flew to an unknown
destination.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he could provide no further information about
Ocalan's possible whereabouts since he left Italy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke by telephone with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini in the last two days and the Ocalan case was among the topics
discussed.
