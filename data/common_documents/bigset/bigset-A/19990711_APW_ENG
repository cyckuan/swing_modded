<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Jump Nearly 2 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices jumped nearly 2 cents  
in the past two weeks because of rising crude oil prices and 
increased demand, an industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades and taxes,  
was $1.2153 Friday, up 1.93 cents a gallon from the previous survey 
on June 25, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey 
of 10,000 gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A main factor has been more expensive crude oil, which has risen  
from $13 a barrel at the beginning of the year to $20 now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost increase is (due to) crude oil, but another factor is  
that this is the strongest season for gas consumption, which is an 
impetus rather than a damper to gasoline's response to crude oil 
prices,'' Ms. Lundberg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Price increases were felt in most cities and in all parts of the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong gasoline demand, coupled with the fact that gas  
hasn't caught up entirely with crude oil prices, suggests gasoline 
prices could rise a bit further,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded was  
$1.1577, mid-grade was $1.2587 and $1.3435 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	For full-service, regular was $1.5259, mid-grade averaged  
$1.6138 and premium $1.6869.

<HEADLINE> Lower Tobacco Prices Help Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANASTOTA, N.Y. (AP) -- When James Case runs out of smokes, his  
choice is clear. His brand, Marlboro Lights, costs $27.84 per 
carton at the Express Mart. Across the street, at the Sav On 
convenience store, run by the Oneida Indian Nation, the price is 
$25.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sav On shop, a few feet beyond the reach of New York state's  
56-cent-a-pack tax, is one outpost in a nationwide enterprise that 
began with small stores on often isolated Indian reservations and 
grew into a multimillion dollar business. 
</P>
<P>
	The cut-rate tobacco prices that lure local resident Case and a  
steady stream of customers through the door are also available on 
the Internet. Cyber-retailers with names like ``Peace Pipe'' and 
``Tax Free Cigarettes'' offer discounts to any consumer with a 
modem and a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	Of late, however, their ability to sidestep state taxes that can  
run as high as $1 a pack (in Alaska and Hawaii) is drawing the ire 
of state governments and tax-paying competitors as tobacco lawsuits 
force cigarette prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona misses out on an estimated $16.4 million in unremitted  
tobacco taxes each year, Florida $15.9 million and Kansas $1.6 
million, according to a survey last fall by the Federation of Tax 
Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	States have the right, recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court, to  
require Indian nations to collect and remit state taxes on 
reservation sales of tobacco and gasoline to outsiders. But because 
Indian nations are sovereign, states cannot force them to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a right without a remedy,'' says Greg Scott,  
counsel to the National Association of Convenience Stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The association, along with its New York counterpart, is  
pursuing a lawsuit trying to compel New York to enforce taxation. 
The state loses at least $200 million in annual tax revenue from 
Indian sales of cigarettes and gasoline to non-Indians, according 
to David Cherubin, an attorney for the New York Association of 
Convenience Stores. He had no breakdown for tobacco only, and New 
York was not among the 35 states that responded to the tax 
administrators' survey. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial-level judge heard arguments in the 3-year-old case in  
April, and his ruling is considered imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	To collect tobacco taxes, some states make compacts with  
individual tribes. As of February, Scott says, he knew of 11 states 
that had compacts with at least some tribes within their borders, 
but Indians in Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, 
South Dakota and Washington freely sell cigarettes to non-tribal 
members without remitting state taxes. Twenty-seven states have 
federally recognized Indian nations. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of states have been unwilling or unable to reach  
compacts. In New York, for instance, sporadic efforts to reach tax 
agreements with tribes in the Iroquois confederacy prompted 
protests that briefly closed an expressway south of Buffalo in 1992 
and, on May 18, 1997, touched off a melee with troopers in riot 
gear over a bonfire on an interstate highway near Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the confederacy, which includes the Cayugas, Mohawks,  
Oneidas, Onondagas, Senecas and Tuscaroras, saw it as a fight not 
over tax dollars, but over their sovereignty. Four days after the 
bonfire, Gov. George Pataki abandoned compact efforts, saying he 
respected that sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	W. Ron Allen, president of the National Congress of American  
Indians, says Indian retail businesses have ``gotten pretty well 
established over the last five to 10 years'' and growth has slowed. 
But expansion on the World Wide Web has been robust. 
</P>
<P>
	State Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein says the number of tax-free Web  
sites set up just by Seneca retailers in western New York appears 
to have tripled, from eight or nine a year ago to a few dozen now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web sites typically tout the retailers' tax-free status and  
include prices on dozens of cigarette brands, from Camel and 
Winston to generics. A ``value brand'' like Prime, which retails 
for $21.34 per 10-pack carton off reservation, is offered on the 
Internet for $16.75 plus $1.50 shipping. Prices for other off-brand 
cigarettes can dip below $10. 
</P>
<P>
	When prices rise, ``the people call and scream,'' says Michelle  
Papineau of the Smoke Signals shop, near Buffalo, N.Y. ``That's 
usually when a lot more people jump on the Internet and look for 
cheaper cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're doing is perfectly legal,'' says Morgan Reid of  
JR's Smoke Shop on Seneca land. ``The taxpayer finally gets a 
break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some states are cracking down on the tax-free retailers. In  
January, Washington state Liquor Control Board agents seized 7,000 
cartons of cigarettes from a grocery store on the Yakama 
reservation. Officials say the seized cigarettes lacked tax stamps 
and were being sold over the Internet to customers in Alaska, where 
the cigarette tax is $1 a pack. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, agents confiscated more than 1,400 cartons of  
cigarettes from the Redwolf Smoke Ship on Puyallup Indian land at 
Tacoma, Wash., saying the owner had neither a business license nor 
one to sell tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Assemblyman Klein has proposed legislation that  
would ban Internet sales unless the retailer pays state taxes. He 
says he's concerned not only about lost tax revenue but also about 
minors buying cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax-free sale sites almost invariably warn that customers must  
be at least 18 years old. But Klein said a 17-year-old intern in 
his office easily ordered cartons of Marlboros, both online and via 
a toll-free number. 
</P>
<P>
	``She received the cigarettes at her doorstep,'' Klein says.  
``No adult had to sign for it.''

<HEADLINE> Miners Pay Price for Lackluster Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Gold's status as the ultimate store of value is  
fading, and miners in gold-producing nations are suffering from the 
effects of its plunging price. 
</P>
<P>
	A global gold selloff, hastened by the Bank of England's auction  
of 3.5 percent of its reserves last week, has sent prices down to 
their lowest level in a generation, triggering bankruptcies and 
street protests in South Africa and spreading gloom among miners 
from Uzbekistan to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	But gold is still coveted by many people around the world.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Benn, a 21-year-old London-based fitness instructor, said  
he still has faith in gold's inherent value. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has always been seen as a thing of value. I can understand  
gold. I can't understand all these bonds and when you write a 
check, it's only paper. It's not real money. Gold is real. I can 
understand the solidness of gold -- its simplicity, its purity. It's 
just gold, rather than something symbolic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And gold's falling price has a bright side -- more lavish dowries  
in India and less expensive jewelry in shops in Asia. For many of 
the world's poor, faith in the metal that British economist John 
Maynard Keynes called a ``barbarous relic'' remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	To wealthier nations, the current era of low inflation and  
peaceful post-Cold War relations have eliminated gold's historic 
role as a solid investment with universal appeal and value. So, 
too, has the increasing popularity of investment alternatives, 
especially stock markets proliferating in rich and poor countries 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``The typical reasons for holding gold, at least in developed  
countries, don't exist anymore,'' said John Slater, a research 
economist at Britain's National Westminster Bank Group. ``Gold does 
not provide the function that it used to in terms of a hedge 
against inflation and as a haven against disruption in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain announced in May it planned to replace much of its gold  
holdings with higher-yielding assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds. 
Gold prices have plunged 11 percent since then. It closed at 
$257.70 a troy ounce in New York trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980 it reached a high of $875 during a period of global  
instability that provided a classic example of gold's value. Soviet 
troops had invaded Afghanistan, U.S. hostages were being held in 
Iran and oil prices were skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
	In coming months, prices are likely to drift lower as investors  
anticipate sales of gold by the International Monetary Fund and the 
central bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	To supporters of gold's traditional role, Britain's financial  
authorities ``have lost sight of the reason for having gold 
reserves in the first place -- they are the bastion of a nation's 
currency -- to be used in the last resort when paper money becomes 
unacceptable,'' said Haruko Fukuda of the World Gold Council, a 
London-based group financed by gold mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's decline is most troubling for poorer nations with  
comparatively big gold-mining industries, such as Uzbekistan, Mali 
and Papua New Guinea. Gold is Uzbekistan's second-biggest export 
after cotton, and it accounts for 8 percent of Mali's gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	At gold's current prices, sub-Saharan African countries,  
excluding South Africa, stand to earn $200 million less than 
expected this year. The IMF, which hopes to help poor countries 
with proceeds from its gold sales, will not be able to fill that 
gap, according to the World Gold Council. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa, the world's leading gold producer, has one of the  
highest average costs of production, at $246 per ounce. One of the 
country's oldest firms, East Rand Proprietary Mines, announced 
plans Wednesday to liquidate because it could no longer make a 
profit. The liquidation could cost 5,000 mining jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other mining companies want to lay off an additional 11,700  
workers, a step that prompted a large protest on Thursday in South 
Africa's capital, Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's economy is in an ``extremely precarious  
position,'' said David Munro, director of gold banking at The 
Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd. in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	But cheaper gold is welcome in developing countries. Many Asians  
and Middle Easterners, wary of shaky banks and political 
uncertainty, are firm believers in hoarding gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold jewelry is now more affordable throughout East Asia, where  
the financial crisis that erupted two years ago in Thailand 
reinforced a widespread respect for gold as the safest of 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In India, a bride's family typically gives gifts of gold jewelry  
to the groom's parents. Anecdotal evidence suggests demand for gold 
in India has risen in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Asia, jewelry is now more affordable in  
pay-by-weight gold shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States currently holds half the world's gold  
reserves, but Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has played down the 
possibility that Washington might sell some of its 8,139 metric 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not think the United States should sell its gold, for a  
whole host of reasons,'' Rubin told the House Banking Committee in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Such words could help soothe tempers in U.S. gold mining states  
such as Nevada, where 8.86 million ounces were produced last year, 
an amount surpassed only by South Africa and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Crashes at British GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SILVERSTONE, England (AP) -- Two-time world champion Michael  
Schumacher suffered a broken leg but apparently no head or spinal 
injuries as he crashed 30 seconds into the start of Sunday's 
British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher came out of a turn and, as his brakes seemed to lock  
up, went barreling across the track and into a retaining wall 
traveling at well over 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, 30, was able to climb out of his Ferrari but then  
was placed on a stretcher and given medical attention as he was 
carried to a waiting ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate medical report said Schumacher had broken his  
right leg but ``was conscious and being air lifted to hospital,'' a 
Formula One spokesman said. The spokesman called his condition 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The German didn't look seriously injured as the restart of the  
race was delayed as he and his car were taken away from track. 
</P>
<P>
	The front end of the red Ferrari folded up like an accordion as  
it hit a three-layer deep tire barrier after Schumacher had been 
slowed little going through a gravel shoulder, skating across it 
and hitting the war squarely. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's crash came as the red flag went up and the start of  
the race had to be abandoned and restarted as two cars stalled on 
the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is sure to keep Schumacher out of several races and  
damage his chances of winning this year's series title.

<HEADLINE> Kansas City School Search a Mess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City's school district has a  
revolving door for superintendents -- 18 have walked in and out over 
the last 30 years. And the search for No. 19 has become a real 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, national educators say, is a school board divided  
politically and racially -- and saddled with the decades-long task 
of desegregating classrooms and raising poor test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, the district lacks full accreditation by the  
state of Missouri and local businesses are losing confidence in its 
ability to provide skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Kansas City School District's reputation is so bad,  
that its day-to-day operations must be approved by a federal 
court-ordered oversight panel. Former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, who 
once floated the idea of a mayoral takeover of the district, 
recently called its bungled attempts to hire a new superintendent a 
``national embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This district needs to be put out of its misery,'' board  
member Fifi Wiedeman said at a recent meeting. ``I'm telling the 
judge to take us over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school board is down to its fourth -- and last -- candidate.  
The other three withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
	The man with arguably the best credentials pulled out deep into  
the negotiations, which he likened to ``used car salesmanship.'' 
Pascal Forgione, a consultant to Education Secretary Richard Riley, 
said he was put off by the $140,000 base salary, which many 
educators say is too low for such a rescue project. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside educators and even some board members bemoan a  
dysfunctional board routinely sidetracked by internal bickering and 
racial innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people understand that the Kansas City board is  
divided by race, by perspective, by outlook and by political 
interest,'' said Michael Casserly, executive director of the 
Council on Great City Schools, a Washington-based group 
representing the nation's largest urban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``But other major cities have racially and politically diverse  
boards as well, and I don't know of any that have played out their 
division to the extent that Kansas City has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board is comprised of four whites, three blacks and two  
Hispanics. There are five women and four men who hold the unpaid, 
elected positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The district has been without a superintendent since October,  
when Henry Williams, who is black, left after board members 
questioned his fiscal management and leadership skills. Supporters 
suggested he was let go because of his race. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Forgione and the board's first choice -- retired Air Force  
Major Gen. Jay Edwards -- are white. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the board is expected to offer the job to Oklahoma  
businessman Benjamin Demps Jr., the final candidate. He and the 
third candidate to drop out, Grandview, Mo., superintendent John 
Martin, are black. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, race has dogged the district whose 36,000-student  
enrollment is predominantly black. In 1985 a federal judge ordered 
what would become one of the nation's largest-ever desegregation 
payouts, a ruling that forced Missouri to spend more than $2 
billion on the district over the next 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were mixed. Critics chided the district's lavish  
spending on plush buildings, an Olympic-size swimming pool and 
other expensive extra-curricular tools -- all of which couldn't 
budge test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	State test scores released in November showed 65 percent of  
Kansas City's 10th grade black students scored at the bottom level 
of achievement in science. In math, 75 percent of Kansas City's 
black 10th graders ranked at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more disturbingly, more than 48 percent of Kansas City's  
secondary students who were supposed to take the math test either 
didn't finish the test or skipped it entirely, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Activist Larry Kitto Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) -- Larry Kitto, a lobbyist who was a  
powerful force for American Indian tribes in Minnesota and who was 
fined in connection with a federal investigation of Interior 
Department action on a casino, has died at the age of 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitto died Friday at Methodist Hospital of a bacterial infection  
for which he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the Santee Sioux tribe, spending his early  
childhood on the Santee reservation in Nebraska, and represented 
many of Minnesota's Dakota and Ojibwe tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	KItto was quick to respond to any legislative proposal he  
considered a slight to Indians people or a threat to tribal 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not afraid to speak out against some legislators when  
he thought they were crossing the line on racial issues,'' said 
Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, a friend of Kitto for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitto also worked to mobilize Indians politically. He helped  
enlist reservation support for Bill Clinton's presidential 
campaigns, and generated turnout on South Dakota reservations for 
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle first election to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitto was a key figure in investigations of the Interior  
Department's refusal to allow several Wisconsin tribes to convert a 
dog track at Hudson, Wis., into a casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitto represented casino-rich tribes in Minnesota and Wisconsin  
that opposed the Hudson proposal. The unsuccessful casino group 
alleged that the opposing tribes won a favorable decision from the 
Interior Department by donating more than $400,000 to Democratic 
candidates in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with another lobbyist and a law firm, Kitto was fined  
$85,000 last year for repeatedly failing to turn over documents in 
the civil suit challenging the rejection of the proposed casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has denied allegations of  
political interference in his department's decision on he casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitto is survived by his wife, Mary Jo; two daughters, a sister  
and four brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Chile, Brazil in America Cup Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CIUDAD DEL ESTE, Paraguay, (AP) -- Ronaldo and Rivaldo scored,  
and Dida saved a penalty kick for the second time in the tournament 
as Brazil beat Argentina 2-1 Sunday and advanced to the semifinals 
of the America Cup, South America's soccer championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina went ahead in the 10th minute when a long shot by Juan  
Pablo Sorin bounced off the knee of defender Joao Carlos and into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivaldo tied it with a free kick in the 32nd minute after Cafu  
was tripped at the top of the penalty area. Ronaldo then scored the 
go-ahead goal three minutes into the second half after Emerson 
streaked up the middle and passed to Ze Roberto, who left the ball 
for the oncoming forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Dido saved the penalty kick by Roberto Ayala with 13 minutes  
remaining. He also stopped a penalty kick during a 1-0 win over 
Chile in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil plays Mexico in the semifinals on Wednesday. A day  
earlier, Chile plays Paraguay in the first semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's other game, Pedro Reyes scored twice and Ivan  
Zamorano got the go-ahead goal as Chile upset Columbia 3-2 at 
Luque. 
</P>
<P>
	As Marcelo Salas sat out the second game of a two-game  
suspension, Chile twice came from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jorge Bolano's goal put Columbia ahead in the seventh  
minute, Reyes tied it in the 25th with a header off Jose Luis 
Sierra's corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Bonilla put Colombia back ahead 10 minutes later, tapping  
the ball past goalkeeper Marcelo Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes tied it again four minutes into the second half when he  
headed in a perfect cross from Sierra. Zamorano put Chile ahead in 
the 64th, slipping through the defense and eluding goalkeeper 
Miguel Calero with a subtle feint.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METZ, France (AP) -- A look at Sunday's eighth stage of the 86th  
Tour de France: 
</P>
<P>
	STAGE: A 35-mile time trial in the city of Metz.  
</P>
<P>
	WINNER: American Lance Armstrong, riding for the U.S. Postal  
Service team, won the trial in a time of one hour, eight minutes 
and 36 seconds, at an average speed of 30.7 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	HOW OTHERS FARED: In second place for the eighth stage was Alex  
Zulle of Switzerland, and Frenchman Christophe Moreau came in 
third. The world time-trial champion, Abraham Olano of Spain, came 
in fourth, followed by American Tyler Hamilton, also of U.S. 
Postal. Another American, Bobby Julich, who came in third in the 
Tour last year, fell during a steep descent and was forced to 
abandon the race. Julich was riding for the French Cofidis team. 
</P>
<P>
	OVERALL STANDINGS: Armstrong recaptured the leader's yellow  
jersey. Moreau moved into second place, 20 seconds behind the 
leader. Olano edged up to third place, 33 seconds back. Estonian

<HEADLINE> US Women's Team Leaves Lasting Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The lasting image is of game-winning goal  
scorer Brandi Chastain sliding on her knees near the penalty spot, 
celebrating the U.S. women's World Cup triumph with a full-throated 
roar and waving her jersey instead of wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is whether a nation that fell under the  
spell of a sport and the female athletes who played it this summer 
will still love them both by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's be real about this,'' Hank Steinbrecher, general  
secretary of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said Sunday. ``We caught 
lightning in a bottle. The Queen Mother doesn't have enough money 
to pay these women what they deserve right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrecher spoke just minutes before Chastain and her  
teammates swept past during a parade at Disneyland. It marked the 
start of a two-day, two-coast whirlwind tour that will put the team 
in front of the cameras that missed them the first time around -- 
when they crisscrossed America en route to winning the 16-nation, 
32-game tournament that concluded Saturday with a 5-4 victory over 
China on penalty kicks following a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' thrilling triumph produced the most-watched  
soccer game ever on U.S. network television, with ABC estimating 
that 40 million viewers tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	The game posted a 13.3 overnight rating and a 32 share for the  
network, 4 percent more than the previous record, a 12.8 for the 
1994 men's World Cup final, also played at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating was nearly double the 6.9 overnight for last year's  
men's World Cup final between Brazil and France. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michelle Akers, the 33-year-old grande dame of the  
American team, did not make the Disneyland parade because she was 
still recovering from heat exhaustion. And U.S. coach Tony DiCicco 
skipped the festivities, too, saying he wanted to get back home to 
the wife and four sons he's barely seen since April. Both are 
expected to be back when the U.S. team resumes training in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will meet several as-yet-unnamed national teams in  
October's U.S. Women's Cup. The team will remain largely intact to 
defend its Olympic gold medal next summer in Sydney, Australia, and 
at the 2003 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment, satisfying demand after this World Cup will be  
tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain turned up on Sunday morning news programs, stunned by  
her instant celebrity when she heard the voices of fellow guests 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright through her earpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain and her teammates were paid between $25,000 and  
$45,000, plus a bonus that has been increased from $12,500 to 
between $40,000 and $50,000 each for winning the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	From Disneyland, the U.S. women headed to a downtown rally and  
then were set to fly to New York for another round of television 
appearances on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a far cry from 1991, when the U.S. women returned  
victorious from the World Cup staged in China. Back then, 
midfielder Julie Foudy was a student at Stanford University and the 
only person who even mentioned ``finals'' to her was a professor, 
who wasn't sympathetic about granting her extra time to finish her 
course work or the exam. 
</P>
<P>
	That explained, in part, why even as they soaked in the applause  
and adulation this time around, the women and U.S. soccer officials 
like Steinbrecher made plans to get back to work. At the top of 
their agenda is charting a course to make sure the momentum built 
up during the past three weeks doesn't dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the United States played host to the men's World Cup  
in 1994, but the men's national team and the professional league 
created soon afterward are still struggling for attention in a 
crowded sports landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, most of the U.S. women team members want a  
professional league of their own. And despite startup costs as high 
as $50 million, they sounded determined to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is about making things happen,'' Chastain said. ``If  
it takes each one of us knocking on doors to get that, we'll do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Soccer Federation, which developed the business plan  
for Major League Soccer before turning the enterprise over to 
private investors, has launched a similar feasibility study for a 
women's league. And while Steinbrecher was cautious about whether 
the World Cup had been successful enough to launch and sustain a 
pro league, he had no doubts about its success in another, more 
important sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to take what we've learned about women's equity,  
what we've learned about women as equal partners and not 
subordinates, and export it around the world,'' he said. ``I think 
we're on the cutting edge of a revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmation of that was practically at Steinbrecher's elbow,  
where Jeff Marquis and his family, from nearby Corona, sat along 
Disneyland's Main Street, waiting for the open-air buses carrying 
the team to go by. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquis came into possession of two tickets for the final only  
last week, no small feat after the U.S. team packed stadiums in New 
Jersey, Chicago, Boston, Washington and Palo Alto, Calif. He 
decided to take his 15-year-old daughter, Brittany, because she 
plays on her high school team. And besides, he already had tickets 
to take his 13-year-old son, Bryce, to the Dodgers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were growing up, I don't think I ever imagined that  
they'd have equal opportunities to play sports,'' Marquis said. 
``But even before this thing exploded, she had many of the same 
things he got out of sports -- a network of friends, the confidence, 
the power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he could envision his daughter playing  
professionally as easy as his son, Marquis paused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody always ties it to that,'' he said, ``but I'm not  
sure that's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may be right. Brittany said the most important thing to her  
was how good she and her friends felt to be on a soccer field, 
knowing that their boyfriends had come to see them play -- instead 
of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, her younger brother was one of those boys watching  
the girls play and he admitted loving every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see any difference,'' Bryce said, ``except at the  
end, the ripping-off-the-shirt part. I haven't ever seen that 
before.''

<HEADLINE>  China Puts Best Face on Cup Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- It happened once before to Italian soccer  
superstar Roberto Baggio. And over the weekend it happened to 
China's Liu Ying too. 
</P>
<P>
	Both missed crucial penalty kicks, handing World Cup  
championships to opposing teams. In China's case, the miss meant a 
5-4 shootout loss Saturday to the United States after 120 minutes 
of hard-fought, scoreless play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baggio defense plied the lips of Chinese sports fans and  
media, tempering the bitter loss of what many saw as a grudge match 
between two rivals on the field and two countries locked in 
political disputes. The message was clear: there was honor in being 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad Chinese girls,'' read the front-page headline in the  
Beijing Evening News, the only newspaper in the Chinese capital 
that published late enough Sunday to carry word of the defeat, 
which occurred shortly before 7 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
	Underneath ran a photograph of President Clinton meeting members  
of the Chinese team after their defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportsmanship was by no means the assured reaction to defeat in  
China. Stoked by decades of communist propaganda, Chinese tend to 
see victory in international sports as proof China's national 
strength. And there was still plenty of anger in losing, some of it 
ugly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bomb the U.S. Embassy,'' read one message posted on a popular  
Chinese Internet site minutes after the loss in a call for revenge 
for the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put a missile in their net,'' businessman Wang Jilei shouted  
at the TV screen in the Soccer Buff's Cafe, a regular haunt for 
sports fans in a working-class neighborhood in south Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in other bars shouted expletives at U.S. team members. Some  
hurled racist epithets at U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeated a litany of suspicions aired by state media in the  
run-up to the match: the American referees were biased, China's 
players were starved for decent Chinese food, and tournament 
organizers tired the Chinese team by making them crisscross the 
United States four times in earlier rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Beijing Evening News lined up the same evidence to  
attest to the mettle of the Chinese players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This second spot did not come easily,'' the tabloid-style  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	China Central Television opened its first nationwide newscast  
after the match with footage not of the loss but of Baggio missing 
the penalty kick that meant victory for Brazil and defeat for Italy 
in the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a normal thing to lose on penalty kicks. Even Italy's  
greatest star, Baggio, missed a penalty kick in a World Cup. That's 
not so bad,'' said Wang Zhanjun, an unemployed factory worker who 
runs a fan club for a Beijing men's team. ``It's an honor for the 
Chinese people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the food, the travel, even the 90-degree heat didn't  
matter, said fan Meng Xianyou. ``The Chinese team played well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese President Jiang Zemin set a positive tone, promising the  
Chinese players in a pre-game telephone call a hero's welcome 
whether they won or not. 
</P>
<P>
	For China's communist leaders, the game was an opportunity to  
take the high ground. With intractable economic problems at home, 
they couldn't risk more furious public protests outside the U.S. 
Embassy like the ones that followed the bombing. And U.S. officials 
are due in Beijing this week to discuss compensation for China's 
losses, a face-saving demand of the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, we have linked sports and politics too often.  
We're always thinking of winning for the glory of the country,'' 
said one message posted by someone called ``Chu Shou'' on the 
Internet. ``But for our women's team to play so well in such an 
important game is already an honor for our country.''

	U.S. Troops Targeted in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- American troops in the Kosovo  
international peacekeeping force were fired on in three separate 
incidents yesterday but were not hurt. The shootings underscored 
continuing violence and ethnic tensions one month after KFOR, the 
international peacekeeping force, moved into Kosovo under an 
agreement ridding the province of 40,000 Yugoslav military and 
Serbian police forces. Meanwhile, more Russian troops were flown to 
Kosovo to beef up Moscow's peacekeeping contingent that is to 
comprise 3,600 men by the end of the month.

	China Loses World Cup to U.S.

<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The U.S. team defeated China 5-4  
yesterday on penalty kicks to capture the Women's World Cup soccer 
title. When Brandi Chastain's left-footed kick landed high in the 
net, the Rose Bowl erupted in cheers. U.S. goalie Briana Scurry had 
stopped Liu Ying's shot with the penalty score at 2-2. The game 
remained 0-0 after regulation and two 15-minute overtime. President 
Clinton was one of the 90,185 spectators at the biggest women's 
sporting event in American history. ``It was the most exciting 
sports event I have ever seen,'' Clinton told the victorious U.S. 
athletes.

worker at Antarctic Support Associates who found a lump in her 
breast, but can't leave the continent until October, when aircraft 
can safely land on the continent. Base staff at the Amundsen-Scott 
South Pole Station had just seven minutes in the winter blackness

	BERLIN (AP) -- An estimated 1.4 million yesterday bounced to the  
techno throb of the Love Parade, the annual all-weekend rave billed 
as the world's largest street party. But the parade was not all 
festive. One person was stabbed to death during a fight, police 
said. Police said they had no suspects, and further details were 
not immediately available. Since the Love Parade started in 1988, 
when a small group danced behind a VW van through then-West Berlin, 
the event has drawn increasingly large crowds -- to the dismay of 
environmentalists.

monitors tracked the exact location of each aircraft. The ``ADS-B'' 
system, more accurate than radar and with a longer range than 
existing collision-avoidance systems, simultaneously gives air

airplanes were and whether any were on conflicting courses.

the marchers to detour. Four protesters were arrested. After the 
20-minute parade, some of the two dozen Aryans saluted supporters 
in the crowd with the Nazi straight-arm gesture. City officials had

<HEADLINE> Schilling To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Phillies ace Curt Schilling was selected  
Sunday to start for the National League in the All-Star game, The 
Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A baseball source confirmed that Schilling was chosen by NL  
manager Bruce Bochy to start over Arizona's Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy, the San Diego Padres manager, would only say he was  
leaning toward starting Schilling. Bochy will make the official 
announcement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who was familiar with the selection process,  
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be his first (All-Star game) start, and he started  
his career with the Boston organization,'' Bochy said. ``It's a 
tough call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling has 13 victories, one fewer than Kent Bottenfield of  
St. Louis. He is tied with Johnson for the league lead with seven 
complete games and is second to Johnson in strikeouts. Schilling 
also declined to confirm that he was Bochy's choice -- although he 
was seen accepting congratulations in the clubhouse after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know who's starting,'' said Schilling, a three-time  
All-Star. ``I've got a pretty good idea who will have the ball when 
the game starts. The manager is going to announce it tomorrow, and 
we'll all have fun talking about it tomorrow. It's not my job to 
announce it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just more than a week ago, Bochy was leaning toward starting  
Johnson, but the Arizona left-hander, who is 9-7, has been 
victimized by his own offense. Arizona hasn't scored a run in the 
last 34 innings Johnson has been on the mound. Johnson is 0-4 in 
his last four starts despite allowing a total of five earned runs 
and striking out 54. 
</P>
<P>
	In another All-Star development, Bochy was told by the NL office  
that Mark McGwire has to start at first base since he voted in by 
the fans. Bochy wanted to use McGwire as his DH, but instead will 
use Houston's Jeff Bagwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy's likely batting order will be Cincinnati's Barry Larkin,  
Colorado's Larry Walker, Chicago's Sammy Sosa, McGwire, Arizona's 
Matt Williams, Bagwell, Mike Piazza of the New York Mets, 
Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona's Jay Bell.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Quiet About Moon Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Neil Armstrong was standing at the  
pad where he blasted off on July 16, 1969, watching the tower roll 
away from the soon-to-be-launched space shuttle Columbia, when a 
technician approached him. 
</P>
<P>
	Would he kindly sign a photo? After all, the shuttle worker  
explained, we're all following your dream. The first man on the 
moon replied he didn't sign autographs. The worker, irritated, 
walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten or 15 minutes later, Armstrong went over, asked to see the  
photo and scrawled his name on it. The technician thanked him. But 
more than two years later -- the encounter was in April 1997 -- it 
still irks him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand it if you were outside with a big crowd and  
everybody was bombarding you,'' the worker, who did not want to be 
identified, said in recalling the story last week. ``But I don't 
know why he's got so many hostilities when he's around the launch 
pad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just days away from the 30th anniversary of his first step on  
the moon -- when he proclaimed, ``That's one small step for man, one 
giant leap for mankind'' -- Armstrong is as reclusive and reticent 
as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 68-year-old commander of Apollo 11 has agreed to  
attend a banquet at Kennedy Space Center on Friday, he will take 
part in no interviews or news conferences, and give no autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll be joined by Buzz Aldrin, who followed him down the ladder  
onto the Sea of Tranquillity. Aldrin, 69, is pushing space tourism 
these days as president of a couple of Los Angeles companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Collins, 68, who circled the moon in the Apollo 11  
command module, is skipping the banquet. He's retired in Marco 
Island, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Aldrin is the only one of the three publicly  
reminiscing on this 30th anniversary of man's first moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time has passed,'' Aldrin told the National Press Club in  
Washington last month, ``I've come to understand that the true 
value of Apollo wasn't the rocks, wasn't the data that we brought 
back. It was the worldwide sense of participation, of people 
everywhere recalling where they were at that moment, and how they 
shared in a human adventure that brought out the best in all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow astronauts wish Armstrong also would speak out, but they  
respect his decades of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a reason to tell the story. Neil has the  
capability of doing that very, very well. He chooses not to,'' said 
Apollo 12's Dick Gordon. ``You can imagine what would happen if he 
started something like that. I mean, the poor guy would never have 
any peace of mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, that burden is borne by the Neil Armstrong Air &AMP; Space  
Museum, in his hometown of Wapakoneta, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just are bombarded weekly with requests for him, everything  
from `Will you sign this for me?' to 'Will you come to my son's Boy 
Scout, Eagle Scout program?' '' said museum manager John Zwez. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwez wishes Armstrong, who has an office in Lebanon, Ohio, would  
drop by now and then and mingle with visitors. Armstrong has no 
ties to the 27-year-old museum and has been there only five or six 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand,'' Zwez noted, ``the fact that Neil  
Armstrong is quiet and reserved about the whole thing perhaps is 
the better approach than going out there and selling this and 
selling that, promoting this and promoting that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong surprised many when he threw out the ceremonial first  
pitch at the Houston Astrodome in April. Two months earlier, he 
introduced a singer at Italy's San Remo music festival. Aldrin was 
at the songfest, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the common question of whether he would have made  
a better first man on the moon from a PR perspective, Apollo 12's 
boisterous commander Pete Conrad refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on. I mean, Neil's entitled to do his thing,'' Conrad,  
the third man on the moon, said in a recent interview. Conrad was 
fatally injured in a motorcycle accident last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's loner status goes way back. Conrad noted that during  
Armstrong's test-pilot days at Edwards Air Force Base in 
California, he lived miles away in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	His piloting skills, though, were unmatched. So was his cool.  
</P>
<P>
	As a fighter pilot in Korea, Armstrong lost part of a wing over  
enemy territory but still managed to return to safety. He struggled 
to regain control of his tumbling Gemini 8 spacecraft in 1966 and 
brought it down early. He ejected from a lunar-lander trainer in 
1968 moments before it crashed in flames. And he was down to about 
15 seconds of fuel, after dodging boulders on the moon, when the 
Eagle landed on July 20, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't offhand think of a better choice to be first man on  
the moon,'' Collins wrote in his 1974 book ``Carrying the Fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Gordon would have preferred to see his Apollo 12 buddies  
Pete Conrad and Alan Bean be the first two men on the moon, instead 
of third and fourth. But he acknowledges Armstrong ``has to command 
a lot of respect for what he did and his capabilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the 30 years since, Gordon said: ``I make no judgment --  
Neil did what he wanted to do.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Leave Lasting Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The lasting image is of game-winning goal  
scorer Brandi Chastain sliding on her knees near the penalty spot, 
celebrating the U.S. women's World Cup triumph with a full-throated 
roar and waving her jersey instead of wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is whether a nation that fell under the  
spell of a sport and the female athletes who played it this summer 
will still love them both by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's be real about this,'' Hank Steinbrecher, general  
secretary of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said Sunday. ``We caught 
lightning in a bottle. The Queen Mother doesn't have enough money 
to pay these women what they deserve right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrecher spoke just minutes before Chastain and her  
teammates swept past during a parade at Disneyland. It marked the 
start of a two-day, two-coast whirlwind tour that will put the team 
in front of the cameras that missed them the first time around -- 
when they crisscrossed America en route to winning the 16-nation, 
32-game tournament that concluded Saturday with a 5-4 victory over 
China on penalty kicks following a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' thrilling triumph produced the most-watched  
soccer game ever on U.S. network television, with ABC estimating 
that 40 million viewers tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	The game posted a 13.3 overnight rating and a 32 share for the  
network, 4 percent more than the previous record, a 12.8 for the 
1994 men's World Cup final, also played at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating was nearly double the 6.9 overnight for last year's  
men's World Cup final between Brazil and France. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Michelle Akers, the 33-year-old grande dame of the  
American team, did not make the Disneyland parade because she was 
still recovering from heat exhaustion. And U.S. coach Tony DiCicco 
skipped the festivities, too, saying he wanted to get back home to 
the wife and four sons he's barely seen since April. Both are 
expected to be back when the U.S. team resumes training in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will meet several as-yet-unnamed national teams in  
October's U.S. Open Cup. The team will remain largely intact to 
defend its Olympic gold medal next summer in Sydney, Australia, and 
at the 2003 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment, satisfying demand after this World Cup will be  
tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain turned up on Sunday morning news programs, stunned by  
her instant celebrity when she heard the voices of fellow guests 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright through her earpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain and her teammates were paid between $25,000 and $45,000  
plus a $12,500 bonus for winning the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	From Disneyland, the U.S. women headed to a downtown rally and  
then were set to fly to New York for another round of television 
appearances on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a far cry from 1991, when the U.S. women returned  
victorious from the World Cup staged in China. Back then, 
midfielder Julie Foudy was a student at Stanford University and the 
only person who even mentioned ``finals'' to her was a professor, 
who wasn't sympathetic about granting her extra time to finish her 
course work or the exam. 
</P>
<P>
	That explained, in part, why even as they soaked in the applause  
and adulation this time around, the women and U.S. soccer officials 
like Steinbrecher made plans to get back to work. At the top of 
their agenda is charting a course to make sure the momentum built 
up during the past three weeks doesn't dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, the United States played host to the men's World Cup  
in 1994, but the men's national team and the professional league 
created soon afterward are still struggling for attention in a 
crowded sports landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, most of the U.S. women team members want a  
professional league of their own. And despite startup costs as high 
as $50 million, they sounded determined to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is about making things happen,'' Chastain said. ``If  
it takes each one of us knocking on doors to get that, we'll do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Soccer Federation, which developed the business plan  
for Major League Soccer before turning the enterprise over to 
private investors, has launched a similar feasibility study for a 
women's league. And while Steinbrecher was cautious about whether 
the World Cup had been successful enough to launch and sustain a 
pro league, he had no doubts about its success in another, more 
important sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to take what we've learned about women's equity,  
what we've learned about women as equal partners and not 
subordinates, and export it around the world,'' he said. ``I think 
we're on the cutting edge of a revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmation of that was practically at Steinbrecher's elbow,  
where Jeff Marquis and his family, from nearby Corona, sat along 
Disneyland's Main Street, waiting for the open-air buses carrying 
the team to go by. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquis came into possession of two tickets for the final only  
last week, no small feat after the U.S. team packed stadiums in New 
Jersey, Chicago, Boston, Washington and Palo Alto, Calif. He 
decided to take his 15-year-old daughter, Brittany, because she 
plays on her high school team. And besides, he already had tickets 
to take his 13-year-old son, Bryce, to the Dodgers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were growing up, I don't think I ever imagined that  
they'd have equal opportunities to play sports,'' Marquis said. 
``But even before this thing exploded, she had many of the same 
things he got out of sports -- a network of friends, the confidence, 
the power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he could envision his daughter playing  
professionally as easy as his son, Marquis paused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody always ties it to that,'' he said, ``but I'm not  
sure that's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may be right. Brittany said the most important thing to her  
was how good she and her friends felt to be on a soccer field, 
knowing that their boyfriends had come to see them play -- instead 
of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, her younger brother was one of those boys watching  
the girls play and he admitted loving every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see any difference,'' Bryce said, ``except at the  
end, the ripping-off-the-shirt part. I haven't ever seen that 
before.'' 

</P>
<P>
	There are about 10 million full-time soccer players in the  
United States and 44 percent are women.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUDON, N.H. (AP) -- Hall of Fame driver Buddy Baker was among  
the least surprised of those who watched rookie Tony Stewart 
dominate the Jiffy Lube 300 -- his first Winston Cup event at New 
Hampshire International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Stewart, he ran out of gas with two laps  
remaining -- giving Jeff Burton his third straight victory in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can drive anywhere or any surface,'' Baker, now a  
commentator who worked the race for TNN, said of Stewart before the 
race Sunday. ``It doesn't matter if it's dirt, pavement, a road 
course, whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he has been impressed with the 28-year-old rookie  
since first seeing him race in the USAC midgets, sprints and Silver 
Crown cars nearly a decade ago. Baker wasn't surprised that Stewart 
became the 1997 Indy Racing League champion, and figures there are 
many NASCAR victories ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Baker, Stewart has a special ingredient --  
indomitable courage -- that will make him a big star in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Stewart is the bravest driver I've ever seen,'' Baker  
said. ``I remember seeing him in a Silver Crown car, passing six 
cars on the apron. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `He's dead,' but he made it through.''  
</P>
<P>
	Baker likens Stewart to three-time Winston Cup champion Jeff  
Gordon, saying both were born with immense ability to drive, but 
developed beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff Gordon won 500 races before he even got into a Busch  
car,'' Baker said. ``I looked at him and I said, `God, that's 
somebody's child out there.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's no child. That's a man in the race car.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MARTIN'S DAY:* With Tony Stewart running out of gas, Jeff  
Burton winning his third straight Jiffy Lube 300 and Jeff Gordon 
bumping and banging with Dale Jarrett and Rusty Wallace, hardly 
anyone paid any attention to Mark Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	But his was the most inspirational story of the race, a wounded  
warrior who had to be lifted into his car. He not only drove all 
300 laps, he finished sixth despite a broken rib, leg and wrist -- 
injuries sustained nine days earlier in a practice crash at Daytona 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	So, how did Martin feel about all this?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I said Friday we'd be real disappointed if we didn't get  
a top five,'' he said. ``So we're a little disappointed'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* Iron man Terry Labonte extended the Winston Cup  
record for consecutive starts to 620 when the green flag fell on 
the Jiffy Lube 300. Labonte, who has 625 starts overall, has run 
every race in the series since 1979. He finished 11th. ... 
Seven-time series champion Dale Earnhardt restored order in his 
family by finishing seventh, 36 positions ahead of son Dale Jr. -- 
making just his second Winston Cup start. The elder Earnhardt has 
expressed disappointment over qualifying 14th Friday after his son 
earned the 13th spot on the grid. But it wasn't much of a contest 
because the younger Earnhardt went out after 44 laps with an 
ignition problem. ... Joe Falk, unable to attract sponsorship for 
his team, carried the Kodiak colors Sunday because Larry Hedrick's 
team failed to qualify for the race. Dick Trickle drove Falk's 
Chevrolet to a 29th-place finish. Roush Racing, which failed to 
land a car as high as 25th on the starting grid, did much better in 
the race. Jeff Burton won, Mark Martin finished sixth, Johnny 
Benson 17th, Kevin Lepage 22nd and Chad Little 24th. ... Baseball 
Hall of Famer Ted Williams was the grand marshal for the race.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Best Face on Cup Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- It happened once before to Italian soccer  
superstar Roberto Baggio. And over the weekend it happened to 
China's Liu Ying too. 
</P>
<P>
	Both missed crucial penalty kicks, handing World Cup  
championships to opposing teams. In China's case, the miss meant a 
5-4 shootout loss Saturday to the United States after 120 minutes 
of hard-fought, scoreless play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baggio defense plied the lips of Chinese sports fans and  
media, tempering the bitter loss of what many saw as a grudge match 
between two rivals on the field and two countries locked in 
political disputes. The message was clear: there was honor in being 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad Chinese girls,'' read the front-page headline in the  
Beijing Evening News, the only newspaper in the Chinese capital 
that published late enough Sunday to carry word of the defeat, 
which occurred shortly before 7 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
	Underneath ran a photograph of President Clinton meeting members  
of the Chinese team after their defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportsmanship was by no means the assured reaction to defeat in  
China. Stoked by decades of communist propaganda, Chinese tend to 
see victory in international sports as proof China's national 
strength. And there was still plenty of anger in losing, some of it 
ugly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bomb the U.S. Embassy,'' read one message posted on a popular  
Chinese Internet site minutes after the loss in a call for revenge 
for the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put a missile in their net,'' businessman Wang Jilei shouted  
at the TV screen in the Soccer Buff's Cafe, a regular haunt for 
sports fans in a working-class neighborhood in south Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in other bars shouted expletives at U.S. team members. Some  
hurled racist epithets at U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeated a litany of suspicions aired by state media in the  
run-up to the match: the American referees were biased, China's 
players were starved for decent Chinese food, and tournament 
organizers tired the Chinese team by making them crisscross the 
United States four times in earlier rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Beijing Evening News lined up the same evidence to  
attest to the mettle of the Chinese players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This second spot did not come easily,'' the tabloid-style  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	China Central Television opened its first nationwide newscast  
after the match with footage not of the loss but of Baggio missing 
the penalty kick that meant victory for Brazil and defeat for Italy 
in the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a normal thing to lose on penalty kicks. Even Italy's  
greatest star, Baggio, missed a penalty kick in a World Cup. That's 
not so bad,'' said Wang Zhanjun, an unemployed factory worker who 
runs a fan club for a Beijing men's team. ``It's an honor for the 
Chinese people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the food, the travel, even the 90-degree heat didn't  
matter, said fan Meng Xianyou. ``The Chinese team played well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese President Jiang Zemin set a positive tone, promising the  
Chinese players in a pre-game telephone call a hero's welcome 
whether they won or not. 
</P>
<P>
	For China's communist leaders, the game was an opportunity to  
take the high ground. With intractable economic problems at home, 
they couldn't risk more furious public protests outside the U.S. 
Embassy like the ones that followed the bombing. And U.S. officials 
are due in Beijing this week to discuss compensation for China's 
losses, a face-saving demand of the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, we have linked sports and politics too often.  
We're always thinking of winning for the glory of the country,'' 
said one message posted by someone called ``Chu Shou'' on the 
Internet. ``But for our women's team to play so well in such an 
important game is already an honor for our country.''

<HEADLINE> Gypsies Say They Were Driven Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Though they all have homes nearby,  
hundreds of Gypsies are camping out along a muddy stream, chased 
into the open by returning ethnic Albanians who accuse them of 
collaborating with the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing retribution, untold thousands of Kosovo's Gypsy minority  
have fled Kosovo since the end of the NATO bombardment and the 
departure of Serbian forces in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Djakovica's Gypsies tried to stay but said Saturday that they  
now feel pressured to go. Many of the 400 camped along the stream 
say their homes had been destroyed in the past week. Home, for now, 
is a makeshift camp secured by Italian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions are squalid. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees  
has given them tents, though most of their shelters consist of 
lean-tos of blue plastic sheeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Many wash clothes in muddy puddles, but 7-year-old Valentina  
Behluli found a blue plastic bucket to wash her pink pants. Drying 
laundry hung over headstones in an Albanian cemetery next to the 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gypsies' recent experience has fueled their hostility. They  
shout at curses at passing bus carrying ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirtless on a sunny afternoon, Muharem Ibrahimi shaved himself  
near a footbridge as his wife held a mirror near his face. He says 
his house was burned down by Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers, many 
of whom aspire to an independent ethnic Albanian state. Ibrahimi 
recognized some of the soldiers as neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want to return home, and neither do the others. Nor  
do they want to be repatriated elsewhere in Kosovo, or elsewhere in 
Yugoslavia. The UNHCR is negotiating to get them out of the 
country.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Out 6 Weeks After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jose Canseco, picked for the All-Star game for the  
first time since 1992, had back surgery Sunday to repair a 
herniated disc and will be sidelined for at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who leads the AL with 31 homers, will not be able to  
resume baseball workouts for at least four weeks, Dr. Tom Tolli 
said after the 90-minute operation, and will then have to get back 
in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Tolli and Dr. Gary Giesseke removed two fragments from Canseco's  
lower right back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect a full recovery,'' Tolli following the Devil Rays'  
3-2 loss at Miami. ``Jose had the option of non-surgical care but 
the amount of pain he was in was the deciding factor. He wanted it 
done as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, Tampa Bay's designated hitter, left Friday's game in  
the eighth inning with intense back pain. He had an MRI that 
revealed a severely compressed nerve was causing weakness in the 
toes of his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gets through it healthy and OK at the end, then I accept  
it,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild said. ``I'd rather have 
him here playing and swinging the bat. ... Jose's not easy to 
replace, but we've done OK the last three weeks when he wasn't 
swinging the bat great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, a six-time All-Star, also missed the game because of  
injuries in 1989 and 1992. American League manager Joe Torre picked 
Baltimore's Harold Baines to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of injuries this season, but obviously this is  
a big one,'' Rothschild said. ``There's nothing we can do about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who turned 35 on July 2, missed 12 games in June and  
July last year with similar back spasms but didn't miss a start 
following the All-Star break. He easily won the fan voting to start 
at designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big surprise,'' Devil Rays closer Roberto Hernandez

<HEADLINE> 'American Pie' Leads Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Buy, buy ``American Pie'' tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what moviegoers did at the box office over the weekend,  
bringing in $18.1 million for the raunchy teen comedy about a bunch 
of high school guys trying to lose their virginity by graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleeper hit knocked Will Smith's critically savaged ``Wild  
Wild West'' into second place, while ``Arlington Road,'' the only 
other movie opening in wide release, debuted with a disappointing 
$7.4 million, industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The loose remake of the old ``Wild Wild West'' TV show lost a  
devastating 40 percent of its audience after two weeks, earning 
$16.7 million for a total of $76.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But so-called ``gross-out'' comedies such as ``American Pie''  
continued doing well at the box office, with Adam Sandler's ``Big 
Daddy'' in third place, the ``South Park'' feature in eighth and 
the ``Austin Powers'' sequel in ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody expected 'American Pie' to do well and it did,''  
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc. ``It boasted no big stars and succeeded purely 
on the strength of its advertising campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the recent success of gross-out movies is partly due to  
the popularity of last summer's blockbuster comedy ``There's 
Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That movie raised the bar for crude humor, and its success has  
gotten not only audiences interested but also studios, who are now 
willing to take chances,'' Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy,'' which features Sandler and a little boy urinating  
in public and brutalizing rollerbladers in a park, earned $16.3 
million in its third week for a total of $116.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Raunchy and unapologetically obscene, ``South Park: Bigger,  
Longer and Uncut'' has drawn critical raves. The film earned $7.1 
million in its second week as it fell from fourth to eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
	The crudely animated film lost 37 percent of its audience, which  
may be due to tougher enforcement of the R-rating. That could have 
prevented many young fans of the Comedy Central cartoon from seeing 
their favorite, foul-mouthed schoolboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Disney's child-friendly animated ``Tarzan'' continued  
drawing respectable crowds by deliberately targeting older 
moviegoers, said Chuck Viane, president of distribution at Disney's 
Buena Vista pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 'Tarzan' audience is actually broadening to more teens and  
more adults. That's what's keeping it up there,'' Viane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vine-swinging apeman earned $11.3 million for a total of  
$129.5 million in its fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
	John Travolta's thriller ``The General's Daughter'' held on to  
fifth place with $8.1 million, defying mediocre reviews and a 
crowded box office. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Arlington Road,'' another thriller staring Jeff Bridges as  
a college professor who suspects his suburban neighbor (Tim 
Robbins) is a right-wing terrorist, failed to find a significant 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie tied with ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom  
Menace'' for sixth place with $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' about the sweltering months when  
serial killer David Berkowitz terrorized New York City, drew large 
crowds in urban areas but played to mostly empty suburban and rural 
theaters, said Viane. 
</P>
<P>
	The film fell to 10th place in its second week with a paltry  
$3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales have routinely broken box office records this  
summer, but receipts from this weekend were down 6.9 percent from 
the same time last year, when ``Lethal Weapon 4'' opened at No. 1 
while ``Armageddon,'' ``Small Soldiers,'' ``Doctor Dolittle'' and 
``Mulan'' were still in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``American Pie,'' $18.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Wild Wild West,'' $16.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Big Daddy,'' $16.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Tarzan,'' $11.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The General's Daughter,'' $8.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Arlington Road,'' $7.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. (tie) ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $7.4  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	8. ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' $7.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $6.5 million.

	10. ``Summer of Sam,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Fighting Coffee Pests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Jamaica's coffee growers, bedeviled by  
a beetle costing the industry famed for its rich Blue Mountain 
beans some $3 million a year, are bringing out the big guns. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 20 years farmers have been battling the coffee  
berry borer with pesticides that barely touched the borer, instead 
slaying harmless cousins like the lady bird beetle and causing 
other environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Jamaica will use stingless wasps from Honduras and a  
particularly ferocious fungus -- methods used effectively for 
decades in Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a technological leap for the Coffee Industry Board and  
for Jamaica,'' said Alford Williams, the board's extension manager. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 30, two experts from the Central American and Caribbean  
Coffee Research Organization arrived in Jamaica with 5,000 of the 
wasps. They started breeding the parasites at the Caribbean 
Agricultural Research Development Institute and at the University 
of the West Indies' Mona campus. 
</P>
<P>
	By September or October there should be enough wasps --  
cephalonomia stephanoderis and prorops nasuta -- to release in four 
of the worst-hit areas, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil was the first -- in 1927 -- to start using wasps to control  
the berry borer. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Jamaica will try to take advantage of research  
showing that the borer beetles have a high mortality rate in areas 
where there is a native fungus called beavaria bassiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the example of Colombia, scientists will develop the  
strongest possible strain of the fungus and spray it on coffee 
plantations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coffee Industry Board estimates that, in recent years, the  
pests have been destroying 10 percent of the prized Blue Mountain 
coffee crop and 15 percent of lowland coffee crop. But if the 
infestation isn't quickly controlled, the board said, it fears that 
40 percent of saleable coffee will be lost each year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likely To Veto GOP Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is passing the word  
that Republican lawmakers can expect a presidential veto if they 
send the White House a big tax-cut bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly installed Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said  
President Clinton ``absolutely'' would reject a bill promising as 
much as $800 billion in tax cuts, the amount GOP leaders are 
promoting. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Summers also  
voiced strong support for Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board 
chairman whose third four-year term expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, Chairman Greenspan has done a terrific job, and I  
have very much enjoyed working with him and look forward to working 
with him going forward,'' said Summers, formerly the deputy 
treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	But, asked whether Clinton might reappoint Greenspan now to keep  
the job from becoming a political factor in the 2000 presidential 
campaign, Summers said: ``We've got enormous confidence in Chairman 
Greenspan. Let me leave it at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, both Summers and the White House chief of staff, John  
Podesta, said Clinton would support a cut in the $250 billion 
range. But they said the GOP alternative would threaten defense and 
domestic programs, what Summers called ``core government, 
everything from the national parks to the FBI to medical 
research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans agree that reinforcing Social Security  
and Medicare should be the top priority for most of a projected 
$2.9 trillion budget surplus over the next 10 years. Those benefit 
programs are threatened by the aging of the massive post-World War 
II baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties disagree, however, on how to safeguard the programs  
and what to do with around $1 trillion that would be left over. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, Republicans want to return much of it in lower taxes,  
which Democrats say would mean tax breaks for the rich. Democrats 
want to use it for much smaller tax cuts and for more generous 
upgrades of Medicare and additional spending on such programs as 
education. The GOP criticizes that as a big-government 
tax-and-spend policy. 
</P>
<P>
	On ABC's ``This Week,'' Podesta said the latest House proposal,  
a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed by Rep. Bill Archer, 
R-Texas, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, would cost the 
government $179 billion more in interest payments than if the 
surplus were used to pay down debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Congressional Budget Office's projected surplus totals  
$996 billion, and Archer's tax cut would be $864 billion, that 
would put government in deficit by $47 billion, Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said such proposals create a cost ``that is exploding,  
that is on a takeoff path out beyond 10 years, that would threaten 
all we've worked hard to do in terms of creating budget surpluses 
and would do a great deal of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he thought  
Summers' comments still ``left room for discussion in a number of 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good that the secretary of the treasury is here  
talking about what we do with this surplus we now have, and I think 
that a good portion of it should be returned to the people that are 
now being overtaxed,'' Lott said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``I keep getting mixed signals from the president.  
I don't know whether he wants to get some things done through 
cooperation, or whether he's going to go the partisan route, the 
political route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and other congressional leaders of both parties were  
meeting with Clinton late today. If the president opts for 
bipartisanship, Lott said, ``We can do it together. ... I hope that 
he'll approach it that way. Not where can we disagree, but where 
can we agree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Summers said Clinton continues to stress spending  
for Social Security, Medicare and ``the needs of the vast majority 
of American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other needs and other issues, and certainly we're  
prepared to talk about things,'' he said, ``but the main issue has 
to be putting our priorities very clear.''

<HEADLINE> China Puts Best Face on Cup Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- It happened once before to Italian soccer  
superstar Roberto Baggio. And over the weekend it happened to 
China's Liu Ying too. 
</P>
<P>
	Both missed crucial penalty kicks, handing World Cup  
championships to opposing teams. In China's case, the miss meant a 
5-4 shootout loss Saturday to the United States after 120 minutes 
of hard-fought, scoreless play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baggio defense plied the lips of Chinese sports fans and  
media, tempering the bitter loss of what many saw as a grudge match 
between two rivals on the field and two countries locked in 
political disputes. The message was clear: there was honor in being 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad Chinese girls,'' read the front-page headline in the  
Beijing Evening News, the only newspaper in the Chinese capital 
that published late enough Sunday to carry word of the defeat, 
which occurred shortly before 7 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
	Underneath ran a photograph of President Clinton meeting members  
of the Chinese team after their defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportsmanship was by no means the assured reaction to defeat in  
China. Stoked by decades of communist propaganda, Chinese tend to 
see victory in international sports as proof China's national 
strength. And there was still plenty of anger in losing, some of it 
ugly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bomb the U.S. Embassy,'' read one message posted on a popular  
Chinese Internet site minutes after the loss in a call for revenge 
for the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put a missile in their net,'' businessman Wang Jilei shouted  
at the TV screen in the Soccer Buff's Cafe, a regular haunt for 
sports fans in a working-class neighborhood in south Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in other bars shouted expletives at U.S. team members. Some  
hurled racist epithets at U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	They repeated a litany of suspicions aired by state media in the  
run-up to the match: the American referees were biased, China's 
players were starved for decent Chinese food, and tournament 
organizers tired the Chinese team by making them crisscross the 
United States four times in earlier rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Beijing Evening News lined up the same evidence to  
attest to the mettle of the Chinese players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This second spot did not come easily,'' the tabloid-style  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	China Central Television opened its first nationwide newscast  
after the match with footage not of the loss but of Baggio missing 
the penalty kick that meant victory for Brazil and defeat for Italy 
in the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a normal thing to lose on penalty kicks. Even Italy's  
greatest star, Baggio, missed a penalty kick in a World Cup. That's 
not so bad,'' said Wang Zhanjun, an unemployed factory worker who 
runs a fan club for a Beijing men's team. ``It's an honor for the 
Chinese people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the food, the travel, even the 90-degree heat didn't  
matter, said fan Meng Xianyou. ``The Chinese team played well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese President Jiang Zemin set a positive tone, promising the  
Chinese players in a pre-game telephone call a hero's welcome 
whether they won or not. 
</P>
<P>
	For China's communist leaders, the game was an opportunity to  
take the high ground. With intractable economic problems at home, 
they couldn't risk more furious public protests outside the U.S. 
Embassy like the ones that followed the bombing. And U.S. officials 
are due in Beijing this week to discuss compensation for China's 
losses, a face-saving demand of the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, we have linked sports and politics too often.  
We're always thinking of winning for the glory of the country,'' 
said one message posted by someone called ``Chu Shou'' on the 
Internet. ``But for our women's team to play so well in such an 
important game is already an honor for our country.''

<HEADLINE> Birmingham's Black Mayor Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Twenty years the mayor of Alabama's  
largest city, Richard Arrington knows he'll be remembered for one 
thing above all else -- the color of his skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, whose long run as mayor ends Friday, boasts of  
Birmingham's expanded tax base and points out bank towers and 
sprawling hospitals that have replaced steel mills at the heart of 
the city's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But it always seems to come back to race. The former college  
administrator knows he'll be remembered simply as the first black 
mayor of a city once rocked by racial violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very comfortable with it,'' Arrington says. ``My being  
elected to office was very important to the city. It made all of 
our citizens feel a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, 64, is stepping down with three months to go in his  
fifth term. City Council President William Bell, a fellow black, 
will become interim mayor while campaigning to replace Arrington -- 
with the mayor's backing -- in the Oct. 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington says he's leaving early because he's done all he can  
do in office and wants to finish a book. His critics say he's doing 
it as a way of choosing his successor. ``It's similar to a 
remote-control vehicle, with Arrington holding the controls,'' 
complained Councilman Bernard Kincaid, a fellow black and one of 
four other announced mayoral hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also have accused Arrington of padding friends' pockets  
with city business. He endured a two-year federal grand jury 
investigation of City Hall deals under the Reagan administration; 
Arrington wasn't charged, but others were. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, Arrington kept a lid on the kind of racial  
hatred that plagued Birmingham when black civil rights 
demonstrators were met with fire hoses and snarling police dogs 36 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He maintained his own black power base even as he dined with the  
city's white leaders, reassuring them Birmingham was a safe and 
stable place for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He inherited a very tense situation as the first black mayor.  
The potential for mischief was very great,'' said Bill Hull, a 
professor and former provost at Samford University in Birmingham. 
``He was a splendid choice for the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Birmingham, like many urban areas, has been losing population  
for decades. The Census Bureau estimated its population last year 
at 252,997, an 11 percent decline from 1980, the year after 
Arrington took office. The city is about 70 percent black, while 
many whites have moved to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council member Jimmy Blake, who is white and a longtime  
Arrington opponent, partly blames the mayor for the exodus and what 
he describes as the poor condition of Birmingham's schools and 
infrastructure. Yet he credits the biologist-turned-politician with 
being savvy around election time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The older blacks saw him as a messiah figure. He was very  
popular among the white establishment and always has been because 
they made a lot of money off him,'' Blake said. ``He has played 
both sides of the race fence beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Racial tension was still a big part of daily life in Birmingham  
in 1979, when Arrington was first elected. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing of an unarmed black woman by a white police officer  
that year revived some of the old animosities, setting off marches 
and protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington already had campaigned against police brutality as a  
city council member, and won a runoff against a white attorney by 
garnering the support of nearly all blacks and some whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was sort of a turning point for Birmingham, the crossing of  
a bridge,'' Arrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he describes Birmingham as the most racially diverse city  
in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Kincaid accuses the mayor of having ``played the race card'' too  
often by pitting blacks against whites. And he joins Blake in 
accusing Arrington of neglecting schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Kincaid also gives grudging respect to Arrington for  
changing Birmingham from a city was in the back of the pack in the 
South to one with a future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The skyline of Birmingham has changed, and it is his doing,''  
said Kincaid.

<HEADLINE> Senior Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Early in the week the volunteers at  
the merchandise tent worked hard to keep shelves stocked with 
jackets, hats, shirts and other U.S. Senior Open souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who didn't buy a keepsake before Sunday was in trouble.  
Many of the shelves in the sprawling tent were empty. Tables near 
the checkout stands, packed days earlier with golf balls, keychains 
and other trinkets, were bare. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans came through the tent anyway, some of them curious and  
others hunting for a last-chance bargain. The cash registers beeped 
and clicked as a steady stream of hundreds filtered across the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll buy a cap or a shirt, if I can find one,'' said Jess  
Murillo, 49, an accountant from Johnston, Iowa. ``Right now, the 
options are pretty limited. It's my first time through here all 
week. I should have bought something before.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BACK TO IOWA:* Champion Dave Eichelberger has been here before.  
He played the U.S. Amateur at Wakonda Club in Des Moines in 1963, 
which until this week was the last time the USGA staged a 
tournament in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger said he felt more confident going into that event  
than he did at the Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a sophomore in college and was playing pretty good at  
Oklahoma State,'' he said. ``There were just a lot of guys that 
were really good players, and I was beating them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the third round of the Amateur before being  
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BARNES WITHDRAWS:* Brian Barnes had a painful week.  
</P>
<P>
	The Scotsman withdrew Sunday on the ninth hole, complaining of  
severe pain in his hands and feet stemming from rheumatoid 
arthritis. His left hand was so painful early in the round, he 
could barely grip his club. 
</P>
<P>
	``My driver, I almost missed the bloody thing on five, almost  
missed it on six, almost missed it on seven,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes also had trouble walking without pain on the back nine  
all week. When his knuckles flared up, he knew it was time to load 
up his motor home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started to hurt badly on the range this morning, and I knew  
it was not going to be too good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes was 4-over starting the final round and 1-over through  
eight holes. He canceled an exhibition Monday in Toronto but said 
he plans to return to Scotland for the British Senior Open in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ATTENDANCE OVERLOAD:* The fans in Des Moines loved the Senior  
Open. And the players loved the fans, all 252,800 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance Sunday was 51,200, the seventh day of increases  
that started with 25,000 spectators for Monday's practice round. 
The crowd climbed to 27,000 on Tuesday, then 29,000 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For Thursday's opening round, it was 35,000. On Friday, the  
figure climbed to 38,400 and Saturday's crowd was 47,200. 
</P>

	USGA officials have said there are no records for attendance  
because they don't want to compare cities or golf courses. But all 
have agreed the fans in Iowa have turned out like no other Senior 
Open.

<P>
	Runner-up Ed Dougherty said starting with his practice rounds,  
he didn't want to disappoint so many people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care whether you're an amateur playing in the U.S.  
Open or a grizzly old tour veteran,'' he said. ``If you have 25,000

<P>
	Starting the final round at 15-over 231, Thompson was the first  
player to tee off Sunday morning. He played alone and finished his 
round in 2 hours, 15 minutes. An hour later, the first paired

a golf tournament would be familiar with golf etiquette. To be on 
the safe side, the daily pairing sheet offered tips for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	There were obvious suggestions like observing silence through  
each shot, staying behind the gallery ropes and obeying course 
marshals. It also was advised to wear low-heeled shoes ``for your 
sake and the sake of the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And above all, don't forget: ``It is most inappropriate to  
applaud or cheer the misplays or misfortunes of a player.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary and History's Carpetbag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was just a valise, a cheap and flexible  
travelers bag stitched together from pieces of patterned carpet -- 
in short, a carpetbag. 
</P>
<P>
	But used as a symbol, the carpetbag, that homely and practical  
19th century satchel, has emerged from the past to become one of 
the more pungent jibes in American politics. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is said to be carrying one as  
she moves from the White House into the race for the Senate from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	She is, her critics say, a certified nonresident, an outsider,  
an unworthy opportunist seeking political power at the expense of 
local politicians -- a ``carpetbagger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need someone from Arkansas or Illinois, coming in and  
trying to learn about our state in the hopes of being sent back to 
Washington,'' New York's Republican governor, George Pataki, said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cry of ``carpetbagger' has been heard before in New York  
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and James  
Buckley, a Republican from Connecticut, ran as outsiders for the 
Senate from New York. Both were called carpetbaggers. Both won. In 
Kennedy's case, New Yorkers ignored such gaffes as being addressed 
as, ``Fellow New Yorkites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Times columnist and word expert William Safire says  
``carpetbagger'' was used originally to describe itinerant bankers 
with meager means who operated in the sparsely settled countryside 
in the years before the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	The word likely gained currency on Deep South railway platforms  
in the late 1860s when sharp-eyed and resentful ex-Confederates 
observed lean and hungry-looking Northerners stepping off 
southbound trains with all their worldly goods stuffed into a 
single bag, often a carpetbag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The carpetbag was the symbol of the man who traveled light,  
and hence of the man on the make,'' Safire wrote in ``Safire's 
Political Dictionary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the victorious North tried to reconstruct the defeated South  
after the Civil War, the unwelcome carpetbagger was seen by many 
Southerners as an instrument of unwanted change, an exploiter who 
left social unrest and financial corruption in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
	But to others, many of these Northern carpetbaggers were heroes  
who put the war-devastated Southern states back on their feet and 
tried genuinely to help newly enfranchised black citizens exercise 
their political right. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19th century cartoonist Thomas Nast, credited for creating  
both the Republican elephant and the Democratic donkey, was quick 
to pick up the carpetbag. 
</P>
<P>
	An 1872 Nast cartoon showed long-legged Carl Schurz, a prominent  
German-American newspaper editor and Civil War general, carrying 
carpetbags from Wisconsin to Missouri to win a Senate seat. One 
satchel carries the label, ``Carpetbagger South.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the 1870s, Reconstruction was over; white  
Southerners regained political power. According to some present-day 
historians, they also wrote much of the history of what had 
happened, giving carpetbaggers the evil eye in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the Senate is concerned, an out-of-state birthplace  
has never been a disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	As the United States moved west, many senators in newly  
organized states were born elsewhere. ``It was part of the natural 
flow of migration,'' said Richard Baker, the Senate's historian. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said the record is held by Irish-born Sen. James Shields,  
who served from three states -- Illinois, Minnesota and Missouri -- 
in the 19th century. 
</P>
<P>
	In this century, moving from one state to another to seek a  
political opening is far from unknown. Winthrop Rockefeller moved 
far from his gilded New York roots to serve as governor of Arkansas 
in the 1960s. His nephew, Jay Rockefeller, is in his third term as 
a Democratic senator from West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Safire concluded in his dictionary that voters may be less  
concerned than before with a politician's birthplace. 
``Carpetbagger just doesn't seem as dirty a word as it once was,'' 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Safire was not referring specifically to Mrs. Clinton in the  
book, published years before her candidacy became a possibility. He 
has been a frequent critic of the first lady in his columns, at one 
point calling her ``a congenital liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If New York voters do choose to ignore the carpetbagger cries  
they will, at the least, shatter two centuries of expectations 
about the limits surrounding America's first ladies and their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, tells audiences she does not resent the  
carpetbagger allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Her job now, she says, is to convince folks that ``what I'm for  
is maybe as important -- if not more important -- than where I'm 
from.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bell's Slam Makes Fan a Millionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- With one swing of the bat, Jay Bell made Gylene  
Hoyle a millionaire. She never saw the ball hit the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my eyes closed at that point,'' she said. ``I didn't  
actually know he'd hit the home run until everyone around me 
started yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle, a 31-year-old child care provider from nearby Chandler,  
won the $1 million prize in the Diamondbacks' grand slam contest. 
At every Sunday home game since the Diamondbacks began play last 
year, there has been a contest where a fan wins tickets, then picks 
a player to hit a grand slam and the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the game tickets and the right to be the grand slam  
contest entrant through KNIX, a Phoenix country music station. She 
figured the odds that she'd win the $1 million were astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to get into the game because we'd never been  
here before,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle chose Bell ``because the rest of my family are big  
Diamondbacks fans and they said he was the best hitter with the 
most home runs.'' Her husband Clayton, a drill rig operator, 
suggested the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bingo.  
</P>
<P>
	After Tony Womack drew a two-out walk, the bases were loaded as  
Bell walked to the plate. He already knew she had chosen him and 
the sixth inning. He was 0-for-12 in the three-game series against 
the A's. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question I wanted to hit a home run there,'' Bell  
said. ``I saw her on our dugout before the game and knew the whole 
situation. Most of the fans did, too. It was a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the A's Jimmy Haynes on the mound, Bell worked the count to  
3-1, then fouled a couple pitches into the seats. The last foul 
barely escaped the reach of catcher Ramon Hernandez. A few rows up 
behind the Arizona dugout, sitting with her husband and her two 
children, Colleen 8, and Clayton II, 7, Hoyle was going crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were counting players. I was saying, `Jay Bell isn't going  
to make it in the sixth' and my husband said, `You know, anything 
could happen,' '' she said. ``Then when he got up there and the 
bases were loaded, I just cringed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the foul balls went into the stands, ``my stomach was in  
knots,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he hit it,'' she said, ``I was ecstatic.''  
</P>
<P>
	Haynes delivered a fastball up and over the plate, and Bell hit  
into the left-field seats for his 24th homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's my share?'' Haynes said. ``Maybe I had greater powers  
working against me today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's slam was the fifth of his career and his first in two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 1-for-14 in the series,'' he said, ``and that hit was  
very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Hoyle seemed almost in shock. She hugged Bell outside  
the Diamondbacks' clubhouse and talked about what she'd do with the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' she said, ``other than take a well-deserved  
vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter already had an idea. ``I want to go to  
Disneyland,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle wasn't sure if she'd quit taking care of other people's  
children, despite her newfound wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like the kids I have,'' she said, ``but I won't take  
any more.''

<HEADLINE> Thailand Debtors Band Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Debt-stricken individuals and small  
businesses in Thailand have formed a group to give mutual support 
and increase their bargaining power with creditor banks, local 
newspapers reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Club for the Protection of Bank Debtors' Rights, officially  
launched Saturday, has already attracted more than 1,000 members, 
the Bangkok Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Law Society of Thailand played a major role in forming the  
club, and one of its primary purposes is to offer legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The club will also serve as an intermediary in negotiating with  
banks for debt restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand was hit hard by the financial crisis that began in  
1997. An economic slowdown turned into a recession after the 
national currency, the baht, sharply depreciated, making a mountain 
of offshore debt virtually unpayable and triggering defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	The boom which preceded the bust was marked by years of  
double-digit growth, but much of that was fueled by speculation in 
real estate and the stock market.

<HEADLINE> The Heart-Healthy Giet Changes Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It used to seem simple: an apple a day to keep  
the doctor away. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came warnings against butter, then margarine, then against  
fat in general, and then for some fats. 
</P>
<P>
	Head scratching turned to head spinning with scientific odes to  
the healthiness of red wine, beer, grapes and certain types of fish 
-- and the Mediterranean diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Now from London comes the idea that a cup of tea a day, or maybe  
six cups, can help prevent heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the advice is so myriad, and ever changing, that health  
experts and even cooks say it's all too confusing for the average 
person who simply wants to know what's good to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of naughtery about food,'' says Julia Child,  
speaking in the same sure voice that calmly advised adding a cup of 
cream in hundreds of episodes of television's ``The French Chef.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adds dietician Lisa Cohn: ``We go to sleep at night and they say  
you must have fat. You wake up and they say `No fat.' It's 
confusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cohn, who's with the Partnership for Women's Health at  
Columbia University, advised that those seeking healthy foods 
should look at what's in the food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing is flavonoids; they're becoming an important  
part of nutrition,'' she said. ``And that's what's in tea and 
bright colored fruits and vegetables -- and red wine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flavonoids are natural substances that make blood cells less  
prone to clots, which can cause heart attacks. They are also one of 
the most powerful antioxidants, which offset the damaging effects 
of oxygen in the body, such as fatty deposits in the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go for bright colors like purples and reds, and I don't mean  
jelly beans,'' Ms. Cohn said. ``Beautiful salads, eggplants, mixed 
fruit salads with oranges and reds and maybe bright blue 
blueberries. Have them on a daily basis. Have vegetables at least 
two meals a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Eckel, chairman of the American Heart Association's  
nutrition committee, agreed that looking for the latest fad health 
food is not the solution to healthy eating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that there are a couple foods we should be  
hyperconsuming is just not the right message,'' he said. ``People 
get too focused on individual food items. It's the whole diet 
that's reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eckel said that while people shouldn't ignore new studies on the  
possible benefits of individual foods, they should be taken with a 
grain of salt, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to balance the new information against what we  
already know,'' he said. ``We're not going to recommend drinking 
lots of alcohol just because a study favors small quantities of 
beer or wine. You need to look at the whole diet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mi Narrow Wins Oceanport Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Mi Narrow split horses in midstretch and  
then held off a hard-charging Hurrahy to win Sunday's $100,000 
Oceanport Handicap at Monmouth Park in course record time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mi Narrow, trained by Eddie Broome, raced the 1 1-16 miles over  
firm turf in 1:39.2 to beat the record set by El Mirasol on June 19 
by one-fifth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored by three-quarters of a length over Hurrahy, with  
Forbidden Apple, the favorite, nearly three lengths farther back. 
Mi Narrow paid $18 to win and combined with Hurrahy for a $67.40 
exacta. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first graded stakes victory on turf for the  
5-year-old Mi Narrow. He finished second in last year's Oceanport. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 10th race on the card, the Bill Perry-trained Hogan's  
Goat became the winningest horse at the Monmouth meeting as he 
scored for the fourth time in five tries. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8-year-old, a stakes performer in his younger days, has won  
his last two at the $7,500 claiming level. Rafael Mojica Jr. has 
been aboard in all the Hogan's Goat's victories.

<HEADLINE>  What's Next for U.S. Women's Team? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The incredulous look on Shannon MacMillan's  
face silently answered the question of what's next for the U.S. 
women's soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow!,'' MacMillan said. ``We'll let that one go for a while.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Women's World Cup champions can't let it go  
for too long, for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
	--The momentum from the tournament needs to be ridden.  
</P>
<P>
	--An international tournament, the U.S. Women's Cup, is planned  
for October. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Olympics are next year.  
</P>
<P>
	--The world clearly is gaining on the Americans.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the goodwill created by the most successful women's  
sporting event ever must not be lost by having these women go idle 
for a long period. The boost from the prosperous men's World Cup 
staged in the United States five years ago helped create Major 
League Soccer, but it hasn't lifted the sport off the back pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's event, thanks to the popularity of the Americans,  
surged onto the front pages -- and not just in the sports sections. 
From Michelle Akers to Mia Hamm to Briana Scurry to Brandi 
Chastain, these women are heroines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids see something they can't do and we are doing it and  
it's being done well,'' Kristine Lilly said, ``and whether it's 
male or female, they are amazed by what they see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not too amazed to forget about it if the women don't stay in  
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've showed that women can be powerful and graceful in  
athletics,'' Scurry said. ``We showed the basic trait of American 
women is not frail and fragile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While they've earned some time to play around -- Hamm, Chastain  
and Julie Foudy will play in an LPGA pro-am this week -- many of the 
players will be back in training by summer's end. The four-team 
U.S. Women's Cup begins Oct. 3, although only Columbus, Ohio, has 
been named as a site. Discussions about participation are ongoing 
with several foreign federations, including China and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the heart of the squad will be available. Veterans Hamm,  
Scurry, Chastain, Foudy, Lilly, MacMillan and Tiffeny Milbrett 
likely will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers is another story. Once again, her 33-year-old  
body took a beating during the World Cup, especially in the last 
two games. As coach Tony DiCicco noted, ``Michelle is a warrior, 
and she gives you everything she has when she is on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she might not have much left.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough year physically,'' said Akers, who left  
after regulation time of the final against China with heat 
exhaustion and a slight concussion. ``I have to weigh if I want to 
go through this again. Do I need to? 
</P>
<P>
	If she sticks around, it would be with an eye on Sydney in 2000.  
By midwinter, DiCicco's team must gather together for residency and 
training, the prestigious Algarve Cup tourney in Portugal, and then 
a pre-Olympic tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Several young players -- Cindy Parlow, Lorrie Fair, Christie  
Pearce -- might head back to college to finish work on their 
degrees. But their youth, along with that of future stars Kate 
Sobrero, Danielle Fotopoulos, Sara Whalen and Tiffany Roberts, will 
be needed to keep pace with the ever-improving competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we achieved was great,'' DiCicco said. ``But we know we  
have to get better. Probably a whole lot better.''

be needed to keep pace with the ever-improving competition.

<HEADLINE> Splendid Splinter a Big NASCAR Fan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUDON, N.H. (AP) -- As one of the greatest hitters in baseball  
history, Ted Williams knows a good fastball when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw plenty of them Sunday at New Hampshire International  
Speedway, where the Splendid Splinter served as grand marshal for 
the Jiffy Lube 300. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80-year-old Hall of Famer, recovering from a series of  
strokes, isn't able to enjoy fishing as much as these days. But he 
has a new passion -- NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched on television, but being right there when they're  
vroom. Boy, wow,'' he said with the enthusiasm of a child. ``It 
reminds me of when I saw John Glenn him go up on his shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a fighter pilot who gave up six years of his career to  
serve in World War II and Korea, served with Glenn in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Boston Red Sox slugger, who rarely makes public  
appearances, was given a massive ovation by a crowd of 90,000 as he 
rose from a golf cart at the start-finish line. He was visibly 
moved, but very much in command when he uttered the most famous 
words in auto racing: ``Gentlemen, start your engines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're there and you see it go, you say, `I've never seen  
anything like this,''' Williams explained of Glenn's rides into 
space. ``And I didn't see anything like this before today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the last player to bat .400 -- he hit .406 in 1941 -- Williams  
made everything look easy. Before attending his first Winston Cup 
event, he thought NASCAR racing looked the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, boy, get out there and look at it close,'' he advised.  
``With all the noise, yow!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams sees similarities between baseball and stock car  
racing, but isn't quite sure what kind of training the racers do. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know how to do it and stay within their means,'' he said  
of the drivers. ``And nobody gets by unless they conform to the 
group plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He always knew what a pitcher with bad control was likely to do,  
and sees some of those same problems in drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a guy who's wild, and somebody's going to get  
screwed up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he was excited about the prospect of meeting the  
drivers -- particularly one with the same nickname he had as a young 
player -- The Kid -- before he was known as the Splendid Splinter and 
the Thumper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never heard of Jeff Gordon, but this guy is winning a lot of  
races,'' Williams said. ``I watch him progress, and he's always in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overall image presented by NASCAR is impressive to Williams,  
who these days rarely ventures far from his Florida retirement 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he is especially thrilled by watching the competitors.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm impressed with these fine-looking, young vibrant guys,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He looks at a driver and figures he's fast, and that another  
might be resourceful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could become a damn ardent fan of this pretty easily,''  
Williams said. ``The whole thing is so damn overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sees horses run faster and baseballs go farther, but nothing  
seems to thrill him as much as stock cars hurtling around the track 
at close to 200 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``This experience today was an outstanding experience,'' he  
said. ``And if I have a chance to see them again, I will.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Investigated King's Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Within a month of the assassination of Martin  
Luther King Jr., the FBI began investigating King's successor, 
looking for the same type of ``immoral activities'' the bureau had 
tried to use to discredit King, newly released FBI files show. 
</P>
<P>
	The files, obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom  
of Information Act, include an April 22, 1968, memo from FBI 
headquarters ordering an investigation of the Rev. Ralph David 
Abernathy. He had been King's right-hand man since the two led the 
Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott in 1955 that launched the civil 
rights movement. Abernathy died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo asked the Atlanta FBI office to search its files for  
``background information'' on Abernathy and to begin following all 
his activities ``through established informants and sources.'' The 
investigation continued until 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Tron W. Brekke said the Abernathy files ``should  
be viewed in their historical context and should in no way infer 
that the FBI currently initiates investigations utilizing the 
standards of that era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before King's April 4, 1968, assassination, the FBI had used  
wiretaps to gather detailed information about his private life and 
extramarital affairs and had leaked it to reporters and government 
officials in attempts to discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI files on Abernathy -- previously released only to an  
attorney for James Earl Ray, the man who pleaded guilty to killing 
King -- suggest the FBI under former Director J. Edgar Hoover hoped 
to use similar information to discredit Abernathy after he became 
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little information has been developed regarding promiscuous  
activity on the part of Abernathy,'' the Atlanta FBI office told 
headquarters in an April 29, 1968, memo responding to what Atlanta 
called ``the bureau's recent request for information dealing with 
immoral activities on the part of'' Abernathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta noted that FBI headquarters in 1964 had been sent  
transcripts from a 1958 Alabama court case in which a woman accused 
Abernathy of having ``normal and abnormal sexual relations'' with 
her when she was 15. It also noted that Abernathy had contact with 
a woman in San Francisco in 1965 ``that suggested a degree of 
affection between them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our limited knowledge of Ralph Abernathy suggests he might  
have had some extramarital experiences,'' the Atlanta office 
concluded. ``It by no means supports the conclusion his experience 
has been extensive or may be continuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, Hoover had the Washington, D.C., field office  
checking out allegations that Abernathy was ``involved in illicit 
relations with white women'' and had been ``beaten by five Negroes 
who surprised him in bed with a white woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington office reported back that three confidential  
sources, as well as the local police department and the U.S. Park 
Police, had been unable to confirm any aspect of the allegation. 
The FBI files do not provide the source of the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI files, heavily censored to remove information considered  
by the FBI to infringe on the privacy rights of others, include 
several instances in which the bureau used sexual information in an 
attempt to undermine Abernathy. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1968, FBI headquarters approved sending a detailed  
report on the woman's testimony from the 1958 Alabama Court case to 
church officials in Pittsburgh, where Abernathy was scheduled to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, Vice President Spiro Agnew called Hoover to complain  
about Abernathy's ``inflammatory pronouncements.'' Hoover wrote 
that Agnew ``said he thought he was going to have to start 
destroying Abernathy's credibility so anything I can give him would 
be appreciated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the FBI sent Agnew a report that included  
``militant statements'' by Abernathy, as well as ``information 
about sexual immorality, Abernathy's luxurious accommodations 
during the Poor People's Campaign and his support of the Black 
Panther party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abernathy had complained in 1975, when the FBI's attempts to  
discredit King were fully disclosed by a Senate investigation, that 
he had been investigated by the FBI far more than King. 
</P>
<P>
	His FBI files, however, do not bear that out. While the bureau  
released 1,169 pages of Abernathy files, its preassassination file 
on King includes some 16,000 pages. There also is no evidence in 
the files that Abernathy ever was the target of an FBI wiretap. 
</P>
<P>
	Abernathy was ostracized by many prominent civil rights leaders  
shortly before his death because he wrote in his 1989 autobiography 
that King had a weakness for women and that on the night before he 
was killed, he had sexual encounters with two women and fought with 
a third.

	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's government today fired  
two security chiefs responsible for a violent assault on a student 
hostel, Tehran television reported. The National Security Council 
issued a statement saying that Brig. Gen. Sadat Ahmadi and his 
deputy have been dismissed and would be handed over to judiciary 
officials, the television said in a broadcast monitored in Dubai. 
Police and hard-line activists stormed a Tehran University

	China Calls Taiwan President a Liar

<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China criticized Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui as  
a separatist and a liar today in one of its most direct and 
harshest attacks on the leader of the rival government in three 
years. Lee drew the heated response by telling German radio station 
Deutche Welle that Taiwan and China should see each other as two 
separate countries. China insists that the mainland and island, 
which separated amid civil war 50 years ago, are one country. The 
statement by the spokesman for the Communist Party's Taiwan affairs 
offices said Lee's remarks violate his pledge not to lead Taiwan 
toward independence.

	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Thousands of women and  
children, who survived Bosnia's biggest massacre, took to the 
streets today to commemorate the fall of the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica four years ago. Starting July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb 
forces overran the eastern Bosnian enclave, which was a 
U.N.-protected zone. Up to 8,000 men and boys older than 14 went 
missing. Bosnian Muslims blame the United Nations for the massacre 
because the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution declaring 
Srebrenica a ``safe area'' under its protection, but didn't do 
anything when Serb forces overran it.

<HEADLINE> Kasich Campaign Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Amid rumblings he might drop from the  
presidential race, House Budget Committee chairman John Kasich said 
Sunday he wasn't certain whether he would proceed with his 
long-shot bid for the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get to the point where we've made a decision and are  
going to talk about it, we'll let you know,'' the Ohio Republican 
said when asked about rumors he might drop from the race and 
endorse another candidate this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether a decision had been made, Kasich said he would  
talk about it when he was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, Todd Harris, said that unlike some other  
Republican hopefuls who are certain they will run, Kasich only has 
an exploratory committee and has just been exploring his chances. 
He said he didn't know how much more exploring Kasich had to do 
before announcing a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kasich were to give up his shot at the nomination, he would  
be the first dropout among 12 Republicans. Most analysts believe 
that field will be reduced significantly following next month's 
straw poll in Iowa, if not before. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush has dominated the Republican slate of  
candidates, in the polls and in campaign fund raising. Kasich has 
fared poorly in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican analyst Tom Rath of Concord said that at the  
Republican National Committee meeting in Philadelphia last week, he 
heard Kasich and other cash-strapped candidates may be close to 
dropping out. But he said he did know of any final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money and political reality are going to force a lot of these  
people to take a look at where they are,'' Rath said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and former Vice President  
Dan Quayle have cut staff and travel plans because of low 
fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich met with a dozen residents at a historic carriage house  
in Concord on Sunday in his 10th trip to the state with the 
earliest primary. He portrayed himself as a down-to-earth guy, 
telling stories of speaking with voters who didn't realize they 
were talking to a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also talked about the difficulties government poses to small  
businesses, and said Americans should have more faith and humility. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have humility, you don't have road rage,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Breaks Leg at British GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SILVERSTONE, England (AP) -- Michael Schumacher lasted just 30  
seconds at the British Grand Prix on Sunday, breaking his leg in a 
crash that could possibly sideline him for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion had surgery on his right leg, which  
was broken in two places. There were no head or spinal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Northampton Hosptial said there were no complications  
and the 30-year-old driver is expected to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened after Schumacher came out of a turn and  
his brakes seemed to lock. He barreled across the track into a wall 
at about 130 mph but was able to climb out of his crumpled Ferrari 
and wave to a few fans. 
</P>
<P>
	His team said a failed power steering unit probably caused the  
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was placed on a stretcher and carried to an  
ambulance. He reportedly called his wife to reassure her. 
</P>
<P>
	The restart of the race, won eventually by McLaren's David  
Coulthard, was delayed 40 minutes as Schumacher's car was taken 
from track. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is sure to keep Schumacher out of several races and  
hinder the German's chances of winning this year's series title. 
</P>
<P>
	The front end of his red Ferrari folded like an accordion. The  
car hit a three-layer deep tire barrier after Schumacher had been 
slowed going through a gravel shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's crash came as the red flag went up. The start of  
the race had to be abandoned and restarted as two cars stalled on 
the starting line.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Billing Followed Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hospitals nationwide are re-evaluating how well  
they follow obscure Medicare billing rules in the wake of a 
government fraud probe into Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., which 
resulted in convictions against two midlevel hospital 
administrators earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Most hospitals have spent thousands of dollars to hire  
executives called ``compliance officers'' who check if the 
institutions are correctly billing Medicare and other government 
health insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry experts say hospitals have also become more  
conservative in billing -- in effect they are asking the government 
for less money for some patients. They note the change could be one 
reason why Medicare spending has fallen dramatically in the first 
half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	How much hospitals are paid by Medicare depends on many factors,  
including the patient's diagnosis at time of admission. A more 
complex case of pneumonia, for example, nets a higher fees than a 
simple pneumonia. Hospitals that may have put more patients into 
the complicated category now may be more likely to bill the 
government for a simple case so as not to raise ire of government 
auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into Columbia/HCA was one of hundreds  
occurring throughout the hospital industry in recent years. Indeed, 
the government has accused hundreds of hospitals of filing false 
claims, a civil violation which can result in huge fines. But 
health experts say the Columbia/HCA investigation has drawn the 
most attention because the chain is the nation's largest, and the 
inquiry included a criminal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``All hospitals are trying harder to make sure they are in  
compliance with billing rules,'' said Tom Smith, president of VHA, 
a consortium of 1,800 non-profit hospitals and affiliated health 
organizations. ``The problem is there are 120,000 pages of Medicare 
regulations and the opportunity for failure to comply is 
enormous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants in the Columbia/HCA trial testified that their  
dispute with the government was based on a difference in opinion 
about complicated Medicare regulations. Prosecutors said the 
administrators knew what they were doing was trying to steal from 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Two executives with Columbia/HCA were found guilty July 2 of  
defrauding Medicare and other government insurance programs of 
nearly $3 million. The jury acquitted another executive and could 
not reach a verdict on a fourth defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resulted from a six-state investigation of Nashville,  
Tenn.-based Columbia/HCA facilities over their billing practices 
for Medicare, Medicaid and CHAMPUS, tax-supported health programs 
for the disabled, elderly, poor and military. 
</P>
<P>
	After the investigation began in 1997, Columbia/HCA ousted its  
top executives, stopped an aggressive hospital acquisition program 
and began a major downsizing, trimming from a high of 345 to its 
current level of 236. The company, which has operations in 31 
states, England and Sweden, has been negotiating a settlement with 
federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, hospital trustees have become more vigilant in their  
oversight role as a result of the Columbia/HCA probe, Smith said. 
``No one wants to see their hospital publicly embarrassed,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdicts in the Columbia/HCA case were irrelevant to the  
hospital industry, which had begun to pay more attention to 
Medicare rules soon after government investigators began serving 
subpoenas on Columbia/HCA hospitals in 1997, industry officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question the government got what it wanted,'' said Thomas  
Scully, president of the Federation of American Health Systems, 
which represents for-profit hospitals. ``The entire industry got a 
jolt and ... focused on compliance to make sure they are billing 
appropriately.''

<HEADLINE> Grain Prices Fall to 30-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Marvin Yost was far from jubilant when he  
finished harvesting the 800 acres of wheat this past week on his 
farm near DeWitt in southeast Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	In any other year, he would be celebrating yields of more than  
50 bushels per acre -- but this is not a good time for a good crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumper harvests across the nation's Bread Basket are adding to  
an oversupply of grain that has pushed commodity prices to their 
lowest levels in nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yost and others are feeling the pinch of falling incomes and  
when they hurt, the people who sell them everything from washing 
machines to tractors also suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where do we starting cutting?'' Yost asked. For so many  
self-employed farmers, it begins with personal expenditures, like a 
new pickup. ``That's totally out of the question,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat, corn and soybean production is far exceeding demand,  
pinning prices below the break-even mark for most farmers for the 
second straight year. And the situation gets worse as more grain is 
brought in from fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``To turn it around, it's going to take a severe drought ... but  
I hope it's not here,'' said Victor Bohuslavsky of the Nebraska 
Soybean Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Many area grain elevators and silos were already spilling over  
before this year's harvest started. Last year's above-average crop 
yields and low prices prompted many farmers to store their grain 
rather than sell. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, 850 million bushels of soybeans sit in storage  
nationwide, compared to 180 million bushels two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The grain surplus is burying many farmers in debt, and forcing  
sections of rural America into poverty, said Greg Peterson with 
Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's adjusted gross income figures for the 50 poorest  
U.S. counties show 22 of them lie in the fruitful upper Plains, 
from North Dakota to Nebraska -- areas dependent on agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 on that list is Arthur County, in northwestern Nebraska's  
panhandle, with a gross income averaging $9,385. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are traditionally a sturdy lot who can withstand the  
myriad of pressures, many of which -- like the weather -- are beyond 
their control. But optimism is waning as those pressures multiply. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wheat farmers are getting about $2.25 a bushel at local  
elevators, a price that was last this low in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Corn has been trading at about $1.50 a bushel, the lowest  
level since the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Soybean prices are hovering at 27 year lows of around $3.35 a  
bushel, a drop of more than $1 since April. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Analysts say that even though Asian markets are beginning to  
recover from the economic collapse that began two years ago, relief 
to U.S. farmers may come too late. Before recent economic troubles, 
the Pacific Rim traditionally consumed U.S. grain surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pork producers only recently started to recover from some of  
the lowest prices in four decades, but continue to face intense 
competition from factory farms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mental attitudes are the lowest in my recent memory,'' said  
Mark Lambert with the Illinois Corn Growers and Marketing Board in 
Bloomington, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	When farmers look at prices, Lambert said they no longer see  
dollar signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see their future,'' he said. ``They make a direct  
correlation between those numbers and their survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's beginning to be felt in the farmhouse.  
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Soll with the Nebraska Farm Hotline in Walthill said  
they field an average of 13 calls per day, up from 9 per day this 
spring. The hotline began during the 1980s farm crisis. Calls were 
not tracked during the program's infancy, but are up significantly 
since then, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotline has received at least four suicidal calls in the  
past year. It had received only two suicidal calls during the six 
years before. 
</P>
<P>
	Most callers, not yet that desperate, seek financial or mental  
stress counseling referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotline mailed 200 credit vouchers for rural family members  
to get free mental stress counseling between April and mid-June. 
All but four were used in the program's first offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders are beginning to put pressure on farmers to get their  
finances in order. Callers want their finances reviewed by 
attorneys and farm counselors. ``They want to know, 'do we 
liquidate, restructure ... where do we go from here?''' Soll said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., recently reported  
the region's farmland values dropped for the third consecutive 
quarter. Federal Reserve economist Russell Lamb said farm loan 
demand is not on the rise, but that may indicate farmers are 
restraining their borrowing. Rural banks report they have funds 
available to loan farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't see a recovery in prices in the next few weeks,  
there are going to be some pockets of pain,'' Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
	And they will not be limited to the farm.  
</P>
<P>
	The poor agricultural economy has already set off a chain  
reaction. The New Holland farm equipment plant in Grand Island on 
Thursday began laying off nearly all of its 630 employees and will 
close until January because of decreased sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere &AMP; Co., the world's largest producer of farm equipment,  
said in May it expects sales to fall by 18 percent to 20 percent 
this year from last year's levels and has lengthened its usual 
summer plant shutdowns to reduce production. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, aimed at weaning farmers away from  
government price supports in exchange for more leeway in what they 
plant, may have contributed to the grain glut, said Doug Schmale, a 
member of the Nebraska Wheat Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get away from this fantasy that we can sell  
everything we can grow at a profitable price. We simply oversupply 
the market,'' Schmale said. ``You can't pay the bills on the 
rhetoric of free trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until a change in farm policy or until Mother Nature decides  
it's time for a drought, farmers like Yost are forced to play the 
waiting game. 
</P>
<P>
	While he decides whether to sell his grain or hold it for a  
better price, his pocketbook is hit again -- paying to store his 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are just two things wrong with wheat,'' he said. ``Price  
and price.''

<HEADLINE> Baines Replaces Canseco As All-Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles designated hitter Harold Baines  
replaced ailing AL home run leader Jose Canseco of Tampa Bay on the 
American League All-Star team Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baines, one of the steadiest hitters in the game but also one of  
the least talkative, was pretty nonchalant about making his sixth 
All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not into that history stuff,'' Baines said after the  
Orioles beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-2 Sunday. ``I'm just glad 
to make the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who leads the AL with 31 home runs, had back surgery  
Sunday to repair a herniated disc and is out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a distinct possibility he will play this year,'' Devil  
Rays manager Larry Rothschild said. ``We've had a lot of injuries 
this season, but obviously this is a big one. There's nothing we 
can do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Baines is having one of his best seasons in  
years, batting .345 with 19 home runs and 63 RBIs. His career-high 
in homers is 29, set in 1984 with the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice they called me,'' Baines said. ``But I won't feel a  
special moment until I get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, the Devil Rays' designated hitter, is batting .276 with  
69 RBIs and was elected to start as the DH. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay played this weekend at Miami, where Canseco lives. On  
Saturday, the Devils Rays sent Canseco home to rest his back.

<HEADLINE> What's Next for U.S. Women's Team? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The incredulous look on Shannon MacMillan's  
face silently answered the question of what's next for the U.S. 
women's soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow!,'' MacMillan said. ``We'll let that one go for a while.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Women's World Cup champions can't let it go  
for too long, for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
	--The momentum from the tournament needs to be ridden.  
</P>
<P>
	--An international tournament, the U.S. Women's Cup, is planned  
for October. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Olympics are next year.  
</P>
<P>
	--The world clearly is gaining on the Americans.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the goodwill created by the most successful women's  
sporting event ever must not be lost by having these women go idle 
for a long period. The boost from the prosperous men's World Cup 
staged in the United States five years ago helped create Major 
League Soccer, but it hasn't lifted the sport off the back pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's event, thanks to the popularity of the Americans,  
surged onto the front pages -- and not just in the sports sections. 
From Michelle Akers to Mia Hamm to Briana Scurry to Brandi 
Chastain, these women are heroines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids see something they can't do and we are doing it and  
it's being done well,'' Kristine Lilly said, ``and whether it's 
male or female, they are amazed by what they see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not too amazed to forget about it if the women don't stay in  
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've showed that women can be powerful and graceful in  
athletics,'' Scurry said. ``We showed the basic trait of American 
women is not frail and fragile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While they've earned some time to play around -- Hamm, Chastain  
and Julie Foudy will play in an LPGA pro-am this week -- many of the 
players will be back in training by summer's end. The four-team 
U.S. Women's Cup begins Oct. 3, although only Columbus, Ohio, has 
been named as a site. Discussions about participation are ongoing 
with several foreign federations, including China and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the heart of the squad will be available. Veterans Hamm,  
Scurry, Chastain, Foudy, Lilly, MacMillan and Tiffeny Milbrett 
likely will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers is another story. Once again, her 33-year-old  
body took a beating during the World Cup, especially in the last 
two games. As coach Tony DiCicco noted, ``Michelle is a warrior, 
and she gives you everything she has when she is on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she might not have much left.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough year physically,'' said Akers, who left  
after regulation time of the final against China with heat 
exhaustion and a slight concussion. ``I have to weigh if I want to 
go through this again. Do I need to? 
</P>
<P>
	If she sticks around, it would be with an eye on Sydney in 2000.  
By midwinter, DiCicco's team must gather together for residency and 
training, the prestigious Algarve Cup tourney in Portugal, and then 
a pre-Olympic tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Several young players -- Cindy Parlow, Lorrie Fair, Christie  
Pearce -- might head back to college to finish work on their 
degrees. But their youth, along with that of future stars Kate 
Sobrero, Danielle Fotopoulos, Sara Whalen and Tiffany Roberts, will 
be needed to keep pace with the ever-improving competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we achieved was great,'' DiCicco said. ``But we know we  
have to get better. Probably a whole lot better.''

<HEADLINE> Pyewacket Finishes Transpac Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Roy Disney's Pyewacket had a record crossing in  
the 40th Transpacific Yacht Race, but Grand Illusion apparently had 
the fastest overall corrected handicap time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-foot Pyewacket out of the Los Angeles Yacht Club sailed  
past the Diamond Head finish line at 9:41 p.m. Saturday to win 
first-to-finish honors in the voyage from Los Angeles to Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The maxi sled finished the 2,225-mile race in 7 days, 11 hours,  
41 minutes, 27 seconds, taking 3 hours, 43 minutes, 5 seconds off 
the record set by Disney's smaller Pyewacket in the 1997 race. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney said it became clear halfway through the race that his  
boat was on a record pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Baker's 68-foot turbo sled Magnitude from the Long Beach  
Yacht Club of California also broke the 1997 record, finishing 1 
hour, 5 minutes, 40 seconds behind Pyewacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Illusion, representing the Lahaina Yacht Club of Hawaii,  
finished at 12:52 p.m. Sunday, beating Pyewacket by almost three 
hours on corrected time. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other boats in the race, Gone With the Wind from San  
Francisco and Stealth Chicken from Long Beach, had an outside 
chance of besting Grand Illusion, race officials said.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Red-Faced byr Prank Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A baseball tossed to a San Diego Padres fan by  
Texas right fielder Juan Gonzalez turned out to be a hot potato for 
the red-faced Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres fan Deborah Calimlin had been asking Gonzalez for a ball  
during Saturday's game. When he finally tossed her one, it had the 
inscription ``Here's your ... ball, redneck'' written on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers had some explaining to do because the woman turned  
the ball over to a Padres official, who showed it to Rangers 
spokesman Brad Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who's been booed for asking out of the All-Star game  
because he wasn't voted in as a starter, had nothing to do with the 
inscription, Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ball was never intended to leave the playing surface,''  
Horn said Sunday. ``It was the bullpen's shenanigans with the 
outfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horn said center fielder Ruben Mateo and left fielder Rusty  
Greer were having problems getting balls thrown to them from the 
bullpen so they could warm up in the field between innings. 
</P>
<P>
	When the bullpen finally threw out a ball, it was the one with  
the offending message, which Horn said was written by bullpen 
catcher Ken Guthrie. The message was intended for Greer. 
</P>
<P>
	After going into the Rangers bullpen chasing a foul ball,  
Gonzalez picked up a ball laying on the ground there and tossed it 
to Calimlin, whose seat is along the railing, Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers will make a formal apology to Calimlin and plan to  
give her a ball autographed by Gonzalez, Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie didn't face any kind of disciplinary action, according  
to Horn.

<HEADLINE> Storms Wash Away Cars in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN BERNARDINO NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- Flash floods swept  
cars and cabins into a creek Sunday afternoon as storms rolled 
through Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 1/2 inches of rain flooded the Forest Falls area of the San  
Bernardino National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reports of numerous cars off the roads and several  
cabins washed off into the creek,'' said David McLees, battalion 
chief for the San Bernardino County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports of injuries, he said, including head injuries  
and people trapped in the mud. He did not know how many people were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a narrow canyon area and when the rain comes down real  
hard, it focuses right there where residents are,'' McLees said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were many homes, rented cabins and a conference  
center in the forest, about 85 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles County, firefighters rescued about 100 hikers and  
picnickers stranded in Azusa Canyon, said Mark Whaling, a spokesman 
for the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain in the upper portion of the canyon north of Los Angeles  
caused the level of a nearby river to rise two feet, making it hard 
to cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people covered with mud,'' he said. ``Some people  
got swept down a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rain was part of a monsoon pattern drawing moisture inland  
from the southwest, forecasters said. A 40 percent chance of 
showers was expected throughout Southern California Monday 
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Trial Moves to Second Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Mary Farnan began smoking at age 11.  
</P>
<P>
	Diagnosed with lung cancer three years ago, the 43-year-old  
registered nurse still could not break the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	She tried to quit using hypnosis, nicotine gum, and patches but  
smoked through her first course of radiation and chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	And the cancer spread.  
</P>
<P>
	Now Farnan's story is at the center of a legal battle to force  
cigarette companies to pay potentially billions of dollars in 
damages to an estimated 500,000 sick Florida smokers and their 
heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers who won a landmark liability decision against the  
tobacco industry last week plan to use Farnan's story to show 
tobacco's human toll to the Florida jury hearing the case as the 
trial enters its second stage -- the award of damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of the Florida smokers' class-action lawsuit  
dealt primarily with the deeds of faceless corporations. The second 
phase will be much more human, dealing with the lives of the Farnan 
and eight other sick smokers who represent the class of half a 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye may set the start date for the second  
phase this afternoon. The judge has issued a gag order preventing 
parties to the case from discussing it with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs attorneys Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt have said they  
plan to open with Farnan's story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mary Farnan has lung cancer, her lung cancer has metastasized  
to her brain,'' Susan Rosenblatt said in court last week. ``She's 
had brain surgery. She unfortunately has a limited life 
expectancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors will also hear about Frank Amodeo. The 60-year-old  
Orlando man hasn't eaten since the 1980s. Throat cancer robbed him 
of the ability to swallow; he now takes nourishment directly into 
his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Engle, the Miami Beach pediatrician for whom the case is  
named, suffers from emphysema and has trouble breathing. The 
lawsuit says he started smoking while in medical school to mask the 
smell of cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Lacey has Buerger's disease, a circulatory disorder  
which almost exclusively strikes young men who smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Lacey's addiction to nicotine resulted in the loss of part  
of one leg; he was told to stop smoking or he could lose the entire 
leg. Mr. Lacey devoutly wished to end the addiction which was 
causing the loss of his limb but he was unable to do so,'' the 
lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacey came to court in a wheelchair; both of his legs have been  
amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite repeated attempts, Robert Angell of Miami-Dade County  
couldn't stop smoking even after being diagnosed with throat 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due to his addiction, Mr. Angell had a cigarette on the way to  
the operating room,'' the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	His was one of the electronic voice boxes jurors heard in the  
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren Lowery of Hillsborough County, who started smoking at 15,  
lost most of his lower jaw and part of his tongue to cancer. 
Michael Matyi of Pinellas County began smoking at age 11, developed 
a tumor and had a vocal cord removed. 
</P>
<P>
	And Frosene Steevens of Miami-Dade County developed congestive  
heart failure, resulting in a quadruple bypass 10 years ago. 
Afterward she still couldn't stop smoking, according to the 
lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer TV Ratings Top Men's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The success of the American team in the Women's  
World Cup produced the most-watched soccer game ever on U.S. 
network television. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory over China on Saturday afternoon posted a 13.3  
overnight rating and a 32 share on ABC, 4 percent more than the 
previous record, a 12.8 for the 1994 men's World Cup final, also 
played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 championship game also had 1,620,000 viewers tune in on  
Univision, a Spanish-speaking station in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's rating was nearly double the 6.9 overnight for last  
year's men's World Cup final between Brazil and France. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC estimated 40 million viewers watched the Americans' 5-4  
victory on penalty kicks following a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience for the women dwarfed that of their male  
counterparts. The Americans, who finished last in the 32-nation 
field at France last year, averaged a 4.1 overnight rating for 
their three World Cup losses on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest rating for the U.S. men is a 10.4 overnight and 27  
share for a 1-0 loss to Brazil at Stanford, Calif., in the second 
round of the '94 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one expected these kinds of numbers,'' ABC spokesman Mark  
Mandel said. ``It proves the power of big events on network 
television. You can still bring in nice numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight ratings measure the top 44 markets in the country,  
while the nationals, which will be released Thursday, measure the 
entire country. Generally, the national ratings for sports slip 
about 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup finale easily topped the NHL's Stanley Cup  
ratings, a 3.4 averaged a 3.4 for the three games on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating for the women's final is expected to be about the  
same as this year's NBA Finals, which averaged a 11.3/21 in prime 
time for San Antonio's 4-1 win over New York. However, that series 
went just five games and did not have the benefit of a 
winner-take-all game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't see these numbers unless you're watching the NFL,''  
Mandel said. ``If this event were on a Sunday afternoon, these 
numbers would be through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup title game fell well short of this year's  
Super Bowl, which received the lowest rating in nearly a decade, a 
40.2 national mark and a 61 share. 
</P>
<P>
	Television ratings started slowly for the event and picked up  
momentum as the U.S. team advanced. ABC's tournament opener between 
the United States and Denmark last month had a 1.7 national rating 
and was watched in 1.7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory against Nigeria was seen in 1.4 million homes on  
ESPN, the win over Germany was watched in 1.67 million households 
and the semifinal match against Brazil was viewed in 2.9 million 
homes, making it the largest number of households to watch a 
telecast on the cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
Each cable point represents 766,000 homes on ESPN. The share is the 
percentage tuned to a program among televisions in use at the time.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Send Envoy to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has given the U.S.  
Chamber of Commerce approval to send its president, Tom Donahue, to 
Cuba this week to promote private enterprise, the White House said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donahue delegation will include Craig Fuller, chief of staff  
when George Bush was vice president, Time magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council,  
said a license for the trip was issued by the Treasury Department's 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, which ruled the visit a 
``people-to-people'' exchange and not an effort to support the 
government of Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a private initiative that is consistent with the  
president's policy of finding ways to help the Cuban people while 
continuing to isolate the Castro regime,'' Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of the Chamber of Commerce, Donahue has opposed U.S.  
trade sanctions against any country, including Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	He is described as seeking contact with Cuban entrepreneurs and  
laying the foundation for an independent Chamber of Commerce in 
Havana, the Cuban capital, according to the magazine report.

<P>
	Despite the rapid response, however, any defense against the  
hacking program may prove fleeting thanks to some aggressive 
tactics taken by the tool's authors, an irreverent group named Cult 
of the Dead Cow, or CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	The hacking tool, called ``BO2K,'' can enable someone to gain  
control of a computer or network from a remote location. BO2K is an 
abbreviation for a slightly profane variation of ``Back Office,'' 
the name of a program in Microsoft's Office 2000 suite of business 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC and other hackers attending the seventh annual  
``DefCon'' convention in Las Vegas charged that Microsoft has 
stubbornly refused to address a multitude of gaping security holes 
in Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	By exploiting those vulnerabilities, hackers hope to force the  
world's largest software company to repair them. And, raising the 
ante another notch, the CDC is also releasing the software code for 
BO2K -- inviting other programmers to create mutations that would 
frustrate efforts to immunize computers against attack. 
</P>
<P>
	But that vigilante-type ``hactivism'' was rejected by Microsoft  
and federal officials, including many who attended DefCon under 
cover -- at least until they were unmasked during the convention's 
popular ``Spot the Fed'' contest. 
</P>
<P>
	BO2K is actually an update to a hacking tool released at last  
year's DefCon hackers convention. The first tool targeted the 
Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems that run an 
overwhelming majority of the world's desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Much to the delight of the nearly 1,000 anti-Microsoft  
enthusiasts who crammed into the BO2K launch Saturday, the new tool 
can also hijack control of network systems using Windows NT, a top 
program for running computer networks, as well as computers running 
on test versions of the as-yet unreleased Windows 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is that Windows is a fundamentally broken  
product,'' said Deth Veggie, the CDC's ``minister of propaganda.'' 
Like nearly every hacker, Veggie only identifies himself by his 
online pseudonym, partly for effect and partly out of legal 
concerns. ``Hopefully, this will force them to fix this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government-chartered Computer Emergency Response Team at  
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh is investigating B02K, but 
has not issued any advisory or warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The hacking tool ``is one of several programs which, if  
installed on an organization's computers, can give control of the 
computers to outsiders with malicious intent,'' Jeffrey J. 
Carpenter, senior incident responder for the CERT, said Sunday. 
Because BO2K works with Windows NT, ``intruders have the potential 
to gain control of more sensitive server machines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday morning, leading computer security firms such as  
Symantec and Network Associates had already posted advisories and 
detection software for BO2K on their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had been blasting BO2K even before Saturday's highly  
theatrical presentation, which relied heavily on thumping 
industrial music, strobe lights and screaming -- a bizarre mutation 
of the dog and pony shows that often accompany a Microsoft product 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly categorize what they're trying to do as being  
malicious. This program they have created has absolutely no purpose 
except to damage users,'' said Jason Garms, lead product manager 
for Windows NT security, complaining that hackers behave as if the 
Internet operates under a different set of rules than the rest of 
the world.

<HEADLINE> 7 Ejected in Mariners-Dodgers Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A brushback pitch by Seattle's Frankie  
Rodriguez triggered a bench-clearing brawl Sunday that led to seven 
ejections in the Mariners' game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners relievers Damaso Marte, Jose Mesa and Jose Paniagua  
were ejected along with outfielder Jay Buhner, who is on the 
disabled list. Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley was ejected along with 
teammate Pedro Borbon and bullpen coach Rick Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
	The brawl, which interrupted the game for 15 minutes, began  
after Trenidad Hubbard hit a three-run double in the sixth inning 
and Rodriguez's next pitch went at Mark Grudzielanek's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Words were exchanged and the reliever made a motion at  
Grudzielanek, as though he was inviting him to charge the mound. 
The dugouts and bullpens emptied, and fights broke out as the brawl 
spilled over toward the warning track in front of the Mariners' 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans littered the outfield with debris. Order was restored but  
benches emptied again when Hundley shouted toward the mound and 
made a gesture before Rodriguez started his warmup throws. 
</P>
<P>
	No punches were thrown in the second incident. Dodgers catcher  
Angel Pena injured his left arm in the fighting and was replaced by 
Hubbard, who had been in left field. It was Hubbard's major league 
debut behind the plate.

<HEADLINE> Vt. National Guard Drops Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLCHESTER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont Air National Guard has  
dropped its investigation of a member who wrote a letter to a 
newspaper that raised the possibility that he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Johenry Nunes, a technical sergeant and Air Guard member since  
1987, said he was glad to hear he would be allowed to stay in the 
military, but upset that he was investigated because of a letter he 
wrote to a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has nothing to do with job performance,'' said Nunes, 37.  
``I never said that I was ... (gay), and it shouldn't be a question 
of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, military  
investigators are not allowed to question a member about his or her 
sexual orientation. But a service member who publicly declares he 
or she is homosexual can be discharged. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjutant Gen. Martha Rainville, head of the National Guard in  
Vermont, said the Air Guard properly followed up on Nunes' June 2 
letter to the editor of The Burlington Free Press, which included 
the phrase, ``We, as gay people ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said an investigator who interviewed Nunes on the  
telephone concluded that the letter was not a public declaration of 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they spoke, there was nothing that would lead to him  
having to be discharged,'' Rainville said. ``As far as I'm 
concerned, this isn't going to be taken any further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunes' letter, which didn't mention his guard affiliation, was  
prompted by students at Colorado State University, who used a 
parade float to mock the killing in Wyoming of Matthew Shepard, a 
gay man. 
</P>
<P>
	``June will start up gay pride month throughout the United  
States,'' Nunes wrote. ``Please, please, let's not stoop down to 
the level of these so-called Christians. We, as gay people, along 
with all the other diversities of people, are intelligent and 
creative enough to hurt the people of Colorado, but let's not, 
because it's not right and it's true the spirit never does sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Free Press, Nunes, who also works as a  
prison guard at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. 
Albans, declined to indicate his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the phrase, ``We, as gay people,'' was a general  
statement of solidarity with gays, and that he could as easily have 
indicated solidarity with Jews, women or black people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been very vocal about diversity,'' said Nunes. ``I  
feel akin to all groups.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likely To Veto GOP Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While tax breaks and many other budget matters  
are negotiable, President Clinton will veto legislation GOP leaders 
are promoting that would provide up to $800 billion in tax cuts, 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers also indicated strong administration support for Alan  
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman whose third four-year term 
expires in June. But, like former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, 
Summers refused to say whether Clinton would reappoint Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, Summers said Clinton would support a $250 billion cut.  
The GOP alternative, Summers said, would threaten ``the progress 
we've made toward paying down debt, ... would put at risk core 
government, everything from the national parks to the FBI to 
medical research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came during Summers' first appearance on the Sunday  
talk shows since he succeeded Rubin on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans agree that reinforcing Social Security  
and Medicare should be the top priority for most of a projected 
$2.9 trillion budget surplus over the next 10 years. Those benefit 
programs are threatened by the aging of the massive post-World War 
II baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties cannot agree on how to safeguard the programs and  
what to do with around $1 trillion that would be left over. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, Republicans want to return much of it in lower taxes,  
which Democrats say would mean tax breaks for the rich. Democrats 
want to use it for much smaller tax cuts and for more generous 
upgrades of Medicare and additional spending on such programs as 
education, which the GOP decries as big-government tax-and-spend 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was asked on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' whether the GOP  
plan to use $800 billion over 10 years for tax cuts would be a 
``nonstarter'' and vetoed. ``Absolutely,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	On ABC's ``This Week,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta  
said the latest House proposal, a 10 percent across-the-board tax 
decrease proposed by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the Ways and Means 
Committee chairman, would cost the government $179 billion more in 
interest payments than if the surplus were used to pay down the 
national debt. That would throw the government into deficit and 
leave no money for shoring up Social Security, Medicare, defense or 
domestic programs, Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at those proposals, they go into the kind of place  
in terms of the total cost ... that is exploding, that is on a 
takeoff path out beyond 10 years, that would threaten all we've 
worked hard to do in terms of creating budget surpluses and would 
do a great deal of damage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers also said such legislation ``would preclude our chance  
to do something about Social Security and to get those prescription 
drugs into Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the same program, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said he  
thought Summers' still ``left room for discussion in a number of 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good that the secretary of the Treasury is here  
talking about what we do with this surplus we now have, and I think 
that a good portion of it should be returned to the people that are 
now being overtaxed,'' said Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``I keep getting mixed signals from the president.  
I don't know whether he wants to get some things done through 
cooperation, or whether he's going to go the partisan route, the 
political route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned a budget meeting Monday with leaders of both  
parties. If the president opts for bipartisanship, Lott said, ``We 
can do it together. ... I hope that he'll approach it that way. Not 
where can we disagree, but where can we agree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Summers said, ``has laid out what are his highest  
priorities in the tax area, and those are addressing the Social 
Security and Medicare issues, and then focusing on the needs of the 
vast majority of American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other needs and other issues, and certainly we're  
prepared to talk about things,'' Summers said, ``but the main issue 
has to be putting our priorities very clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the nation's economy is very strong ``because we've been  
pursuing the right economic strategy ... for the last six years. 
... America is back at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve's Greenspan has been a major figure in  
establishing those policies. Summers gave him credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, Chairman Greenspan has done a terrific job, and I  
have very much enjoyed working with him and look forward to working 
with him going forward,'' said Summers, who formerly was deputy 
Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers sidestepped a question about whether Clinton might  
reappoint Greenspan before Greenspan's term ends next year, to 
ensure that the job does not become a political factor in the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got enormous confidence in Chairman Greenspan,'' Summers  
said. ``Let me leave it at that.''

<HEADLINE> Reno To Attend Service for Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is among  
those scheduled to attend a memorial service Monday for a South 
Korean graduate student killed by a white supremacist during a 
two-state shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno will lead a delegation of government and Indiana University  
officials who will join Bloomington residents at the service 
honoring slain student Won-Joon Yoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The event is in response to the killing spree by white  
separatist Benjamin Smith, who targeted blacks, Jews and Asians in 
attacks in Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, an Indiana University student, shot Yoon as he arrived  
for Sunday services July 4 at Korean United Methodist Church. Smith 
later killed himself in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service will include singing, speeches and a candle  
lighting by Kang Soon Lee, the mother of the victim. The service 
will be followed by a march to the church where Yoon died.

<HEADLINE> Changing Dreams May End Trauma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- The little Kuwaiti boy survived the  
Iraqi invasion of his country and was living without his father, a 
prisoner of war. But a recurring nightmare -- of Saddam Hussein 
stabbing his brother to death -- was prolonging the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	One night he had a different dream: This time he carried the  
knife, becoming a hero who kills his nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotional weight he carried disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
	Altering recurring nightmares may hold a key to recovery for  
many victims of trauma, says Dr. Deidre Barrett, a professor of 
behavioral medicine and hypnotherapy at Harvard Medical School. 
Barrett spent a month in Kuwait City after the Gulf War training 
other therapists to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just changing something in the dream gives people such a sense  
of mastery in controlling things,'' says Barrett, who was in Santa 
Cruz last week for the annual Association for the Study of Dreams. 
``Just that sort of dramatic sense of confidence he had in a dream 
carried over into his waking life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than one in 20 adults in the United States say they have  
disturbing dreams, and more than twice as many children have 
nightmares. Trauma victims -- whether students who witnessed the 
Columbine High School massacre, ethnic Albanian refugees or people 
who have been raped or attacked -- often immediately have nightmares 
that recall their experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the bad dreams may take on more frightening twists,  
recurring several times, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the young Kuwaiti boy's dream changed spontaneously,  
hundreds of people have consciously reduced the frequency of 
recurring nightmares or eliminated them altogether, says Dr. Barry 
Krakow, an associate research professor at the University of New 
Mexico Health Sciences Center who also works for the private Center 
for Sleep Medicine and Nightmare Treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In three different studies of a technique Krakow pioneered and  
presented last week, researchers found that about 100 nightmare 
sufferers were able to decrease the frequency of those dreams by 40 
to 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients were taught to create a new ``dream,'' with images they  
rehearsed daily and thought about before going to sleep each night 
as a way of breaking what for many is a nightmare habit. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Western world it's a takeoff on the power of positive  
thinking,'' says Krakow. ``If we do something with the images, we 
might be able to break the habit portion. That really seems to 
break the dam.''

<HEADLINE> Budweiser Takes Czech Firm to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- The maker of top-selling Budweiser beer in Hong  
Kong has taken a Czech rival to court in the latest skirmish in 
their long-standing trademark battle, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch said in court papers that Budejovicky Budvar beer  
had infringed on the St. Louis-based brewer's trademark since 
Budejovicky is the Czech word for Budweiser, the Sunday Morning 
Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. brewer is seeking a court order to have the Czech  
company's products taken off the shelves in Hong Kong, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch has launched similar lawsuits in Europe and the  
United States. It says the Czech brewery is mimicking its name to 
confuse beer drinkers and cash in on the U.S. company's success. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Czechs say they had claims to the name long before the  
Americans began brewing beer. ``Budweiser,'' named after a Czech 
village called Ceske Budejovice, was made as far back as the Middle 
Ages, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The term Budweiser simply describes beer from that region, the  
same way Burgundy and Champagne describe wine from those 
wine-making regions of France, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The German immigrants who founded Anheuser-Busch in 1876 used  
the Budweiser name for their beer because it was well-known in 
their homeland. In Czechoslovakia, the state-owned Budvar brewery 
was founded in 1895. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech brewery exports to 37 countries, mainly in Europe.  
Anheuser-Busch has sales in more than 70 countries around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, federal regulators in the United States began  
investigating whether the Czech brewer's use of the ``Budweiser 
Budvar'' label violates U.S. trademark law.

<HEADLINE> Cause of NYC Blackout Still Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fifteen hours into a blackout that cut power to  
some 300,000 people during a scorching heat wave, the president of 
the utility company responsible for providing the electricity 
walked around the neighborhood trying to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Consolidated Edison, J. Michael Evans, apologized to  
people -- many of whom sat wearily outside in 94-degree heat to 
avoid even hotter apartments that had started to smell of rotting 
eggs and spoiling meat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Evans had few answers about why predominantly poor, densely  
packed Washington Heights in Manhattan had no power while most of 
the city had no noticeable energy problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Several days after the July 6 power failure, Con Ed can explain  
the series of events that led to the breakdown -- feeder cables 
failed in the area after a surge in use. But it still doesn't know 
why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Fallout from the 19-hour blackout is likely to include  
investigations, lawsuits and the residents' belief that electricity 
in one of the city's poorest areas was shut off so the rest of the 
city could remain in light. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll never be able to convince anybody that it was a random  
event,'' said David Paterson, a state senator who represents parts 
of the area. ``They think it was very deliberate and they think it 
was a chosen way to handle the problem at our expense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed, which plans to spend $14 million on transmission and  
distribution infrastructure this year, said they have already 
appointed a team of experts to figure out why the feeder cables 
failed in some places but not others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me,'' said Con Ed spokesman Joe Petta. ``We want the  
answers as much, if not more, than anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani chalks it up to human failure.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last night was not a natural disaster,'' the mayor said on the  
morning after. ``Last night was a man-made disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone have demanded  
investigations and both the city and state governments have 
scheduled hearings on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has also promised a city lawsuit against Con Ed to  
recoup $1.5 million in overtime for police maintaining order, as 
well as an undetermined amount for response to emergency medical 
calls related to the power failure. 
</P>
<P>
	City lawyers are also considering suing Con Ed for consumer  
fraud -- not delivering promised goods. 
</P>
<P>
	A class action lawsuit and a federal civil rights complaint on  
behalf of consumers are also likely. One resident has already filed 
a lawsuit, alleging the company was negligent in preparing itself 
for a predicted heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed, however, says the lights went out in Washington Heights  
and neighboring Inwood simply because that's where the power system 
failed, though they still don't know why. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Public Service Commission said Con Ed is one of the  
most reliable providers in the industry, averaging fewer power 
failures than any other electric provider in the state, said 
spokesman David Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
	The blackout caused no fatalities, but the heat wave that  
prompted it led to at least 28 deaths, according to the city's 
medical examiner. The power failure also ruined heat-sensitive 
medical research on AIDS and Alzheimer's disease being conducted at 
the area's largest hospital, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. 
The hospital says the damage is likely to cost $20 million.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Promote Lefty Ed Yarnall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees, still trying to settle  
their pitching staff, promoted left-hander Ed Yarnall from Triple-A 
Columbus on Sunday and sent reliever Todd Erdos back to the minor 
league club. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarnall, 23, was leading the International League in wins and  
strikeouts, and was picked for the IL's All-Star team. He was 10-3 
with a 3.29 ERA in 17 starts, striking out 113 in 109 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yarnall was 4-0 with a 1.99 ERA in his last six starts, and had  
not lost in a span of 10 starts since May 14. Never before in the 
majors, he was recalled prior to the Yankees playing the New York 
Mets in the wrapup of the three-game Subway Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees got Yarnall from Florida last February in a trade  
that sent third baseman Mike Lowell to Florida. In May 1998, 
Yarnall was 7-0 with an 0.39 ERA at Double-A Binghamton when the 
New York Mets traded him to the Marlins as part of a package for 
Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we've been looking for a second  
left-hander in our bullpen to go with Mike Stanton,'' Yankees 
general manager Brian Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been looking at him for our rotation in 2000,'' he  
said. ``But he's here now and we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AL East-leading Yankees have been exploring trade  
possibilities involving struggling left-handed starter Andy 
Pettitte. They have been trying to add a second lefty in the 
bullpen ever since sending Graeme Lloyd to Toronto in part of this 
year's deal for Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Erdos, a 25-year-old righty, was 0-0 in four games for the  
Yankees. He allowed three earned runs in seven innings.

<P>
	LAKE ISABELLA, Calif. (AP) -- A moderate earthquake and two  
smaller ones shook the southern Sierra Nevada on Sunday, but no

<HEADLINE> GOP Denounced for Attack on Smith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republican presidential candidates  
criticized their own party Sunday for attacking conservative Sen. 
Bob Smith, who is expected to quit the GOP and run for president 
under a third party. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer and Patrick Buchanan, both seeking the GOP nomination  
for president in 2000, defended Smith's decision to bolt the party 
and they blamed the GOP for the defection, saying the party has 
abandoned conservative ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Both said they would remain in the GOP.  
</P>
<P>
	A fourth GOP presidential contender, Steve Forbes, said the GOP  
``should stop running people out of the party'' and ``go back to 
our core principles.'' Forbes said he has no intention of leaving 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The bickering broke out Friday after the chairman of the  
Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, and other GOP leaders 
were sharply critical of Smith's planned defection, which he 
expects to announce this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is a ``serious mistake for you personally, with  
only a marginal political impact -- and a counterproductive one at 
that,'' Nicholson told Smith in a letter. ``This would not be a 
case of the party leaving you, Bob, but rather of you leaving our 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter responding to Nicholson's criticisms, Bauer defended  
Smith, a New Hampshire Republican whom he called ``a man of deep 
conviction and unwavering principle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like millions of other Republicans, (Smith) is concerned by  
the retreat of our party's leadership on matters of fundamental 
principle,'' Bauer wrote to Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	RNC spokesman Mike Collins said Sunday that Nicholson's letter  
was a ``frank and honest expression of his disappointment that a 
principled, lifelong Republican would find it necessary to abandon 
the Reagan coalition and go his own way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only real political impact of Smith's defection would be to  
help the Democrats, Collins said in an interview. ``It could 
possibly supply some marginal support for Al Gore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Bauer's outspokenness in defending Smith, he does not  
plan to follow suit and abandon the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely no intention of leaving the Republican  
Party,'' Bauer said Sunday through spokesman Tim Goeglein. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, campaigning in Iowa, has urged Smith's supporters to  
remain in the Republican party and join Bauer's campaign, Goeglein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said Nicholson's letter was ``rude and insulting and  
ultimately very stupid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the handling of this has been appalling,'' Buchanan  
said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he would not rule anything out when asked whether  
he would consider ditching the GOP and running as a third party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Forbes, speaking on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said that  
``instead of haranguing Bob Smith,'' the GOP should convene a 
series of debates among GOP presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need these debates so Republican voters can decide what our  
principles are,'' said Forbes.

<HEADLINE> Banks Assure Customers Over Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No novice to online banking, Andrea Kovar zooms  
money around daily from her personal computer. But because she 
depends heavily on electronic funds transfers, she worries about 
the millennium bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovar is one of 100 million consumers, including most Social  
Security recipients, who have their paycheck or government benefits 
deposited electronically. Some 4 million people pay bills by 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Because online bankers could be especially inconvenienced when  
the calendar rolls over on Jan. 1, banks and the federal government 
are testing and retesting their systems to make sure the year 2000 
arrives without hassles. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovar, a Coon Rapids, Minn., radio station manager, has seen  
their reassuring press releases. Still, she worries. What if the 
much-discussed computer glitch delays the automatic deposit of her 
paycheck, or the payment of some crucial bill? What if a late 
mortgage or utility payment damages her credit rating, which she 
has taken pains to repair over the past few years? 
</P>
<P>
	``You're a few days late on something, and they hit you with all  
kinds of service charges,'' Kovar said. ``To clear those things up 
takes 10 to 15 minutes, easy, out of a business day. None of us has 
the time to try to clean up messes that somebody else has 
created.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Board says it is ready to answer questions  
like hers. In addition to testing its electronic settlement 
systems, the Fed has ordered an extra $50 billion of new currency 
to put into circulation to cover a spate of potential cash 
withdrawals around the new year. It has proposed an emergency loan 
fund for banks, thrifts and credit unions to cover extra 
withdrawals. And it has ordered at least one big ATM operator, 
TransAlliance LP, to get in shape for year 2000 or face possible 
contract cancellations by its 750 bank customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will have limited recourse if problems do occur.  
Congress earlier this month enacted legislation, which President 
Clinton is expected to sign, that would make lawsuits difficult or 
impossible. A number of states have similar laws on their books. 
</P>
<P>
	But the same bill also prohibits lenders from taking adverse  
action against homeowners whose mortgage payments are delayed by 
Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the preparation that the Fed has taken, it is proudest of  
its rigorous testing procedures. Along with four regional 
organizations that settle electronic transactions, the Fed last 
month successfully finished testing its computer fix by rolling 
dates forward to Jan. 1 and running simulated financial 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The result? ``The financial industry, we feel, is very ready for  
year 2000,'' a Fed spokeswoman said. ``We're not going to say 
there's not going to be glitches. There are glitches every day. But 
if it doesn't work on Jan. 1, is it a Y2K problem? Maybe. But maybe 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Y2K problem'' is caused by the possibility that  
computers originally programmed to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year could interpret 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	One solution was to add the first two digits back into the data  
entries, but that proved too complicated and expensive for most 
organizations. Instead, the Automated Clearing House, the national 
electronic banking network, did a temporary fix that will solve the 
problem through 2073. The systems that process paper checks and 
automated teller machine transactions have taken similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In large part because regulators have insisted on it, the  
banking industry is ahead of most in addressing the Year 2000 
problem. It is also ahead because it has spent a lot of money on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But having been early adopters of computer technology, banks  
have relatively old systems. ``There's all kinds of time bombs in 
there,'' said Gary Arlen, a Bethesda, Md., computer industry 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	And like most other industries, banks rely on telecommunications  
systems and electric utilities that may not be as prepared. Some 
technology experts worry that the bug could still cause computers 
to miscalculate loan payments or due dates, lose deposits or 
payments, or disable ATMs. 
</P>
<P>
	A secret New Jersey location offers a peek at the banks'  
contingency plans. These are the unmarked, nondescript offices of 
the New York Clearing House, which settles domestic electronic 
transactions for 950 banks that are headquartered in New York, New 
Jersey, Connecticut and Puerto Rico. The 950 banks represent about 
10 percent of the total number of banks in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate facility in Manhattan, whose location is kept equally  
secret to discourage terrorism, processes international 
transactions for the New York Clearing House. In addition to the 
Clearing House, the Federal Reserve operates regional facilities, 
and two other private operators are located in Arizona and 
California, handling transactions for the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	At the New York Clearing House in New Jersey, 12,000 square feet  
of cavernous rooms are lined with rows of cabinets containing 10 
computers each. They process about 1.5 million electronic transfers 
a day, worth $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	George Thomas, director of information systems, shows off the  
back-up batteries, diesel generators and telecommunication systems 
that could be deployed within minutes if the front-line systems 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will probably be some spot outages across the country,''  
Thomas said, ``but we don't foresee any major calamity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Andy Kyte, a London-based research director at the Gartner  
Group, an information technology consulting firm: ``The fact is 
that there will be problems. Computer systems have bugs the way 
dogs have fleas. But generally speaking, we still manage to see 
from banks very high service levels and a great willingness to 
rectify problems as they occur. We certainly would cite the banking 
sector as being one of the most prepared sectors of those that we 
monitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some bank customers apparently still need convincing. About 51  
percent of adults surveyed by the Gallup organization in March said 
they were concerned about Y2K, and almost two-thirds said they 
expect to set aside extra cash before the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Kovar is not worried enough to go back to old-fashioned  
paper checks. But she does expect to keep scrupulous account of her 
ATM slips in the final quarter of the year. ``I'm telling you, from 
October on, man, you better save every one you've got,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- The plan to end fighting between  
India and Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region is easing 
concerns of a wider war between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. 
The plan, agreed to today by top military commanders from India and 
Pakistan, calls for a withdrawal of Islamic guerillas from Kashmir, 
and an end to Indian airstrikes, artillery fire and ground assaults 
in Kashmir's Himalayan peaks. Both nations claim control of 
Kashmir, which both countries border in the north.

Tehran University dormitory. The raid, which exposed a widening 
gulf between reformists, who support President Mohammad Khatami, 
and conservatives, who control the police and judiciary, prompted 
thousands of students to protest in the strongest expression of 
discontent since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Two security chiefs 
responsible for the raid were fired today.

Clinton would support a $250 billion cut. The GOP alternative, 
Summers said, would threaten ``the progress we've made toward

with images they rehearsed daily and thought about before going to 
sleep each night as a way of breaking what for many is a nightmare

<HEADLINE> Lott Predicts Holbrooke Will Be OKed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott predicted  
Sunday that the Senate will approve Richard Holbrooke as U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations despite the refusal of Lott and 
three other senators to allow a confirmation vote so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he will'' be confirmed, Lott said on NBC's ``Meet the  
Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's second-ranking Republican senator, Don Nickles of  
Oklahoma, said he too expects a vote to confirm the veteran 
diplomat whose nomination received the unanimous recommendation of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Affairs Committee two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is we'll eventually get around to a vote, but  
certainly we have the right -- some people have the right -- all 
senators have a right to discuss nominations at length if they 
want,'' Nickles said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``Some people have 
some problems with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate procedures allow members to keep a nomination from the  
floor for unrelated reasons as a pressure tactic against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have placed holds, without  
publicly acknowledging them, on the Holbrooke nomination to force 
President Clinton to nominate Bradley A. Smith, a university 
professor from Ohio, to the Federal Election Commission. The other 
holds are by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, trying to reverse a 
State Department disciplinary action against a former department 
employee at the United Nations; and George Voinovich, R-Ohio, to 
protest Clinton administration policy in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Smith, the Republicans' FEC candidate, who has said  
Clinton's administration is probably the most corrupt in the 
nation's history, Lott seemed not to recall the name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley Smith is your candidate ...,'' interviewer Tim Russert  
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh. Brad Smith. Right,'' Lott said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, first of all, I think a little too much has been made of  
that,'' Lott said. ``I suspect the nomination of Holbrooke to go to 
the U.N. and be confirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he couldn't say when, because others also had holds on  
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., appearing with Nickles on ``Fox News  
Sunday,'' expressed irritation with the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I wanted to say is let's debate these issues in  
the light of the day, not in the back room in our cloakrooms,'' 
Reid said. ``We're the most powerful nation in the world, (and) we 
don't have a representative in the United Nations. That's not 
right.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Denounced for Attack on Smith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republican presidential candidates say  
their party was wrong to attack Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, 
who is expected to quit the GOP and run for president under a third 
party's banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivals Gary Bauer and Patrick Buchanan defended Smith's decision  
to bolt the party and blamed the GOP for the defection, saying it

<HEADLINE> Patients' Bill To Be Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has been talking for more than a  
year about how, when and whether to debate the so-called patients' 
bill of rights. This week, it finally gets down to business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the political posturing and maneuvering that both parties  
have mastered is apt to continue, even as a string of votes on the 
details gets under way today. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats have their own legislation labeled a  
patients' bill of rights, though there are major differences 
between them. And each side has political goals it hopes to achieve 
over four days of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Republicans, who enjoy a 55-45 Senate majority, are  
virtually certain to pass the bill they prefer -- one that is more 
limited than the Democrats' plan but still offers many patients 
some new powers in dealing with their health maintenance 
organizations and other managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Democrats will offer as many as 20 amendments --  
each targeting a different piece of the package -- forcing GOP 
senators to support their plan or risk looking like they don't want 
to protect patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The rhetorical lines were clearly drawn as senators offered a  
preview of the debate on the Sunday television talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that the Democratic bill is too expensive and  
will force employers to drop health insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of health care would skyrocket and more and more  
people would be dropping their plans. That's not healthy for 
America,'' Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats responded that their bill is not expensive, likening  
it to the cost of a Big Mac -- about $2 a month. They cited 
estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, which said the 
Democratic measure would increase premiums by about 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A 4.8 percent jump actually would cost about $9 per month for an  
individual plan and $22 per month for a family plan -- but employers 
usually pick up much of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue of patients vs. insurance companies,'' Sen.  
Edward Kennedy said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``It's as simple as 
that. The American people ought to watch this debate and be a part 
of it in this next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, Democrats seemed to have the upper hand going into  
the debate. In the Senate, a determined group of senators -- even 
those in the minority party -- can wield enormous power. Democrats 
managed to shut down business until Republicans agreed to a debate 
that would allow them to offer their amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GOP leadership fired back a procedural salvo last week.  
It arranged for the Democratic bill to be the starting point for 
this week's debate. This allows Republicans to talk about what they 
dislike about the Democrats' approach, while making it more 
difficult for Democrats to hammer the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also makes it more awkward for Democrats to offer their  
amendments, since they will be trying to change their own bill. But 
Democrats plan to do it anyway, simply to get the votes on the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of the debate, the GOP will offer the final  
amendment substituting its bill for whatever is on the table. And 
if Republicans hold together, that's what the Senate will pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The only question is whether Democrats pull together a majority  
for any of their individual proposals. If they do, it's possible 
Republicans will feel obliged to include those items in the final 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats are unlikely to win votes on the high-profile  
differences that have received the most attention so far: 
</P>
<P>
	--Democrats want to give patients new rights to sue their HMOs if  
care is denied. Republicans say lawsuits only drive up the cost of 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kennedy bill is an invitation for lawsuits. You have a  
problem with HMOs, file a lawsuit. We don't think that is the 
answer,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on NBC's ``Meet 
the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Democrats want to force health insurance companies to cover  
care that doctors believe is ``medically necessary.'' Republicans 
would allow insurers to make those decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Both bills have several provisions giving patients easier  
access to emergency rooms, obstetricians and other specialists. But 
the GOP provisions apply only to 48 million Americans who are in 
federally regulated plans that are exempt from state rules. The 
Democrats want to include everyone who has private insurance.

<HEADLINE> China Warned About Deflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Government economists have urged Beijing to put a  
stop to deflation before it drags down China's struggling economy, 
the official China Daily reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent report, a research institute under the government's  
top economic planning agency called tackling deflation an 
``overwhelmingly urgent task,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deflation is ``threatening to undermine economic reforms, growth  
and stability,'' the newspaper said quoting a report by the 
Macroeconomics Research Institute of the State Development Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning underscores the difficulties the communist  
government has experienced trying to inject growth into the 
slipping economy. The communist leadership has announced that 
reviving domestic demand will top its annual policy-setting meeting 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
	But China Daily said there was no indication what options the  
leadership has. 
</P>
<P>
	A massive deficit-financed public works spending program started  
last year and four interest-rate cuts in 17 months have had only 
limited effect. With record unemployment caused by free-market 
reforms, consumers are seemingly too worried about losing their 
jobs to spend some of the $700 billion in bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the government has succeeded in talking up a bull-run  
on stock markets since May, economists have warned that economic 
fundamentals are too weak to keep stock prices high. 
</P>
<P>
	Deflation, inflation's flip-side, occurs when paltry demand and  
not enough money in circulation forces suppliers to drop prices. As 
of May, prices in China had been falling for 20 straight months. 
Under such conditions, companies may follow consumers, investing 
less and further dampening growth. 
</P>
<P>
	An unwillingness to lend by already heavily indebted state banks  
has been partly to blame for the slack demand, Song Guoqing, chief 
economist at the China Securities Executive Council, was quoted as 
saying in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Song warned that banks have little incentive to lend. The  
government for years treated banks as an arm of policy-making, 
forcing them to keep state industries afloat. Although reforms of 
the banking sector are under way, the new system has yet to take 
hold.

<HEADLINE> Many Mentally Ill Americans Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An estimated 283,800 mentally ill inmates were  
in U.S. prisons or jails in 1998, but more than four out of 10 
received no treatment at all, the Justice Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first comprehensive study of mental illness behind bars,  
the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics also estimated Sunday 
that an additional 547,800 mentally ill offenders have been 
released into the community on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though a growing number of states and localities are under  
court order to provide mental health treatment for inmates, only 60 
percent of those in state or federal prisons and 41 percent of 
those in jails received any form of mental health treatment during 
their sentence, including drugs, counseling or mental hospital 
stays. 
</P>
<P>
	Among probationers, 56 percent reported receiving some mental  
health treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers based the estimates on interviews with a random  
sample of state and federal prison inmates, jail inmates and 
probationers. They defined the mentally ill as those who reported 
their own illness and, to compensate for underreporting, those who 
had ever spent a night in a psychiatric hospital. They did not 
count anyone committed to a hospital after a verdict of not guilty 
by reason of insanity or anyone civilly committed to a mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In all four groups studied, the mentally ill were more likely  
than other offenders to have committed a violent offense. 
</P>
<P>
	In state prisons, 53 percent of mentally ill inmates, compared  
with 46 percent of the other inmates, were locked up for violent 
crimes. Among federal inmates, 33 percent of the mentally ill but 
only 13 percent of other inmates had violent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Among local jail inmates, 30 percent of the mentally ill,  
against 26 percent of the others, had violent offenses. And among 
probationers, 28 percent of the mentally ill, but only 18 percent 
of the others, reported their current offense was violent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not mean that mentally ill offenders are more  
violent than other offenders,'' said the study's author, 
statistician Paula Ditton. 
</P>
<P>
	Other causes could produce these figures, she said: Police could  
have an easier time catching violent criminals who are mentally ill 
than those who are not; juries might be more willing to convict 
mentally ill defendants than others; or judges might be more 
inclined to sentence mentally ill violent offenders to prison than 
other violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, a 1997 study in Pittsburgh, funded by the National  
Institute of Mental Health and the MacArthur Foundation, found 
that, among those without substance abuse problems, released mental 
patients are no more likely to engage in violence than other 
residents living in the same neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Substance abuse increased the level of violence among both  
groups, but the violence was significantly higher among recently 
released patients with substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditton said she found the total of more than 830,000 mentally  
ill Americans either behind bars or on probation ``startlingly 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said additional research would be needed to learn how the  
total got so large. She speculated, however, that some of the 
mental patients released from hospitals to the community in the 
de-institutionalization movement that began in the 1970s may have 
ended up behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	More than twice the percentage of mentally ill inmates reported  
prior physical or sexual abuse than did other inmates -- among state 
inmates, 37 percent of the mentally ill and only 15 percent of the 
others were abused before going to prison. Among female inmates, 78 
percent of the mentally ill had been abused, compared with 51 
percent of others. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimates of mentally ill inmates and probationers as of  
mid-1998 included 16 percent of state prison inmates, local jail 
inmates and probationers and 7 percent of the much smaller total of 
federal prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Montgomerie Has Hope in Scotland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Colin Montgomerie hated the  
reminders: He had never won a title before his adoring fans in 
Scotland and had never won a major. 
</P>
<P>
	He took care of one of those shortcomings Saturday by rallying  
for a three-stroke victory at Loch Lomond. And now, he hopes, that 
elusive first major might just be around the corner at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``One gone, one to go, I suppose,'' the 36-year-old Scot said.  
``This is very special to me, coming from this side of Scotland and 
winning here in front of such superb and knowledgeable crowds. The 
support I had was unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie looked unbeatable in his final round. He ran off  
nine birdies in 12 holes to make up a four-stroke deficit, 
overtaking eight players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only go into the British Open with confidence and that's  
what many players can't say,'' he said after his third victory of 
the year put him on course to become the leading money winner on 
the PGA European Tour for the seventh straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monty Magic,'' ``Flying Scot wins in birdie charge,'' and  
``Monty Opens up,'' cried the headlines Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last home victory at the British Open was by Nick Faldo in  
1992. But Montgomerie knows that a familiar course and a strong 
tuneup do not necessarily bode well for the main event. 
</P>
<P>
	At Troon, two years ago, Montgomerie played the course where his  
father was the secretary. Montgomerie had lived barely 150 yards 
from the first tee and played the course as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge galleries followed his opening round and he struggled to a  
76. He followed with good scores of two 69s and a 70, but the 
damage had been done. Montgomerie was a beaten man, and Justin 
Leonard took the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year at Royal Birkdale, Montgomerie missed the cut for the  
fifth time. His best British Open finish was a tie for eighth in 
1994 at Turnberry. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another reason to be wary. Montgomerie played target  
golf at tree-lined Loch Lomond, which has been likened to many 
American courses. It is far different from links courses, where the 
sea wind dictates that many shots be played low. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there are the expectations. Montgomerie is Scotland's  
biggest hope to wrest the title from the Americans, who have won 
the title four years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is savoring his victory at Loch Lomond, and thinks this  
might be his moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could I possible feel any better than I do right now,'' he  
said. ``But it's difficult sometimes and I've got to be careful. 
</P>
<P>
	``You tend to think that sometimes the game is easier than it  
is. And you get to Carnoustie and start attacking and you get 
yourself into a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first victory on the Tour was in Portugal in 1989 and I won  
by 11 shots,'' Montgomerie said. ``I thought golf was very easy 
until I got to Valderrama the next week and opened with an 82.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was fairly steady against the yen early  
Monday amid worry about possible intervention in currency markets 
by Japan's central bank. Japanese stocks fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.38 yen in early trading, down 0.28 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo but unchanged from its late New York 
level on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 75.03 points,  
or 0.42 percent, to 17,862.70 points in early trading. On Friday, 
the average closed down 29.92 points, or 0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was unchanged from Friday's New  
York session in what analysts described as a morning of quiet, 
directionless trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants were cautious about possible yen-selling by  
the Bank of Japan, which has stepped in to prop up the dollar on 
three of the last four Mondays, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial authorities are concerned that a stronger yen  
would slow the country's economic recovery. A stronger yen tends to 
make Japanese exports more expensive abroad and therefore less 
competitive, which cuts into the earnings of export-oriented 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication that the Bank of Japan had intervened  
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 124.52 yen, down  
from 124.97 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started lower on continued  
profit-taking after recent sharp gains, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei 225 climbed to a 21-month closing high of 18,135.06  
last Monday, but then faced some correction pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.81  
points to a new all-time high of 11,193.70 amid expectations of 
robust corporate earnings for the April-June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 0.02 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,464.62. The 
TOPIX closed down 4.69 points, or 0.32 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.6350 percent from Friday's finish of 
1.6650 percent, driving its price up 101.43 yen from 101.17 yen.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Battles 50,000-Acre Wildfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDAS, Nev. (AP) -- High humidity and calmer winds on Sunday  
helped firefighters in their battle against a wildfire that has 
consumed more than 50,000 acres of dry brush. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the progress, fire officials said don't expect to  
contain the blaze until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the biggest wildfires in the West so far this  
summer,'' fire information officer Nick Zufelt said. ``It's been a 
tough one because of the hot weather and low humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was burning within two miles of a ranch, but has caused  
no damage to any buildings. No major injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had not determined the cause of the fire although  
they believe it was started by man. It began Thursday near this 
small Elko County mining town 220 miles northeast of Reno, and was 
burning mostly cheatgrass and sagebrush on mountains and valley 
floors managed by the Bureau of Land Management. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 firefighters from Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho,  
Utah, New Mexico, Arizona and Mississippi are battling the blaze. 
Four air tankers and three helicopters are assisting them.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Looks to Democrat Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his quest for the White House, Bill Bradley  
is drawing on a network of young Democratic activists he helped 
train during an eight-year affiliation with an unorthodox political 
action committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spent a week each summer working with college graduates  
who aspired to be Democratic activists. More than 200 participants 
in the program, funded by the Participation 2000 PAC, are now 
scattered throughout the country, many in Democratic politics, many 
loyal to Bradley as he seeks the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have joined Bradley's campaign. Others are considering it.  
Still others, by virtue of their posts in the Democratic Party, are 
in position to generate support for the former New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Participation 2000's potential value is not lost on the  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saved a lot of time and energy by being able to turn to  
this group of people who had a ton of enthusiastic loyalty to 
him,'' Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzy Pollack, a trainee in 1996, now works at the White House  
Project, which advocates election of a female president within the 
next decade. She has contributed to Bradley's campaign and said she 
would work for him if asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator took a lot of time to talk to us about ethics in  
politics, and integrity, and the big picture of what we're about,'' 
Pollack said about her Participation 2000 experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Political action committees raise money for politicians or  
parties, with individual donations limited to $5,000 per year 
rather than the $1,000 limit for individual donations directly to 
candidates. Though legally a PAC, Participation 2000 does not act 
like traditional ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it raises money, it does not donate to candidates.  
Instead, it holds seven-day campaign training programs in 
Washington each July, bringing together about two dozen recent 
college graduates with Democratic office holders like Bradley, 
campaign consultants, labor leaders and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainees, unpaid except for a $500 stipend from the PAC, are  
assigned in August to help Democratic campaigns throughout the 
country. After election day, they return to Washington to discuss 
their experiences with Bradley and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Selander attended Participation 2000 last July. In August,  
the PAC dispatched him to New Hampshire to work on Jean Shaheen's 
successful gubernatorial campaign. Armed with knowledge about the 
politically important state, Selander now works for Bradley in New 
Hampshire, where the former New Jersey senator hopes to pull off a 
domino-tipping upset in the nation's first primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle Washington, a 1997 graduate, is events coordinator for  
Emily's List, which raises funds for female candidates who support 
abortion rights. ``I'm very loyal to Bradley for helping me get my 
start in my career,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Kwatra, a 1996 trainee, said Participation 2000 gives  
Bradley ``an untapped corps of people who are going to be doing 
whatever they can to help his candidacy.'' He now works in 
Connecticut for Local 217 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees Union. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen Participation 2000 alumni now work for  
Bradley's campaign. Tony Wyche, class of 1992, is Bradley's deputy 
campaign spokesman. Joyce Gresko, also class of '92 and the PAC's 
former executive director, is the campaign's finance coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Program alumni received a memo last month titled ``Activating  
the P2 Volunteer Network Today!'' It was from Sean Gagen, a former 
Participation 2000 executive director who recently left the 
Missouri Democratic Party to work for Bradley's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bradley for President campaign needs your help!'' Gagen  
wrote to the PAC's alumni. ``I know you are busy, but your 
participation in your area of the country can make a big difference 
in many areas. I will be comforted to know that we have a trained, 
politically knowledgeable person to provide BB with assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Richard Celeste, then the governor of Ohio, created  
Participation 2000 in 1988, skeptics suspected he was training an 
army of supporters who could help him run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Celeste, now the U.S. ambassador to India, left office in 1990  
after two terms of governor and did not run for president. Bradley 
took charge of the PAC in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did this for the same reason I did high school seminars and  
`good-citizen days' and scholar-athlete days -- as a way to get 
young people involved in the process,'' Bradley said in an 
interview this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley severed links to the PAC when he became a presidential  
candidate. Officially he was the PAC's ``honorary co-chairman,'' 
first with Celeste, then later with Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., 
and former Texas Gov. Ann Richards. The PAC's newest honorary 
co-leaders are Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Blanche Lincoln, 
D-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has criticized the use of PACs by other presidential  
candidates and has pledged to take no PAC money. 
</P>
<P>
	Participation 2000 raises money with the traditional PAC's  
$5,000 donation limits. In 1998 it raised and spent about $200,000. 
Some of its major contributors are now raising money for Bradley's 
presidential campaign, including John Jordan, a Chicago 
businessman, and Leonard Riggio, chief executive officer of Barnes 
&AMP; Noble. Bradley gave $5000 to the PAC in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel magnate Jonathan Tisch gave $1,000 to the PAC in 1995, and  
Ohio lawyer Stanley Chesley gave $500 in 1991. Both are now raising 
money for Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.

	U.S. Troops Fired Upon in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- American troops in the Kosovo  
international peacekeeping force were fired on in three separate 
incidents yesterday but were not hurt. The shootings underscored 
continuing violence and ethnic tensions one month after KFOR, the 
international peacekeeping force, moved into Kosovo under an 
agreement ridding the province of 40,000 Yugoslav military and 
Serbian police forces. Meanwhile, more Russian troops were flown to 
Kosovo to beef up Moscow's peacekeeping contingent that is to 
comprise 3,600 men by the end of the month.

	Flooding Wreaks Havoc in Serbia

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Flooding forced some Serbs to flee  
their homes and left parts of the capital without power yesterday. 
At least one death was reported and 10 people were missing, the 
private Beta news agency said. ``This must be a punishment from 
God. First NATO nearly destroyed everything I had, then this. ... 
Could it be worse?'' said Petko Budimir, 40, whose rented house was 
flooded. His previous home was nearly destroyed when NATO bombed 
Belgrade's Strazevica suburb. The area was a frequent target during 
NATO's 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia.

	U.S. Wins World Cup Soccer Title  
</P>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The U.S. team defeated China 5-4  
yesterday on penalty kicks to capture the Women's World Cup soccer 
title. When Brandi Chastain's left-footed kick landed high in the

	Airdrop to Antarctic Base a Success  
</P>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- A U.S. Air Force plane today  
dropped six bundles of medical supplies in near-total darkness at 
the South Pole. The drugs and equipment are needed by an American 
worker there who discovered a lump in her breast but can't leave 
until October, when aircraft can safely land. Commander Lt. Col. 
John Pray called the airdrop ``one of our most challenging 
peacetime missions -- many would argue our most challenging.'' To 
guide the plane to the target, staff at the Amundsen-Scott South 
Pole Station ignited barrels filled with a mixture of combustibles 
and diesel fuel and extinguished all other lights at the base.

	Death Mars Berlin Love Parade  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- An estimated 1.4 million yesterday bounced to the  
techno throb of the Love Parade, the annual all-weekend rave billed 
as the world's largest street party. But the parade was not all 
festive. One person was stabbed to death during a fight, police 
said. Police said they had no suspects, and further details were 
not immediately available. Since the Love Parade started in 1988, 
when a small group danced behind a VW van through then-West Berlin, 
the event has drawn increasingly large crowds -- to the dismay of 
environmentalists.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP yesterday recommitted itself to  
confronting issues affecting black America. The affirmation came as 
the nation's largest and oldest civil rights organization 
celebrated its 90th birthday on the opening day of a six-day 
convention in New York. ``This convention will be celebratory, but 
we will also be looking back towards the principles we were founded 
on,'' said Julian Bond, the NAACP's national board chairman. ``It's 
nice to reminisce, but we can't afford not to keep looking

Beach bar and a scuffle with police. Jason Fabini, 24, and John 
``Jumbo'' Elliott, 34, both of the Jets, and Matt O'Dwyer, 26, of 
the Cincinnati Bengals were drinking at Bogart's Bar and Restaurant

Police were called and, after requesting assistance from backup

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Eric Owens singled home the tying run with two  
outs in the ninth inning, and the winning run scored on the play 
when Texas reliever John Wetteland missed a throw, lifting the San 
Diego Padres over the Rangers 5-4 yesterday. The tying run scored 
on an infield single, and when Wetteland was late covering the bag 
and given an error for missing Palmeiro's throw, Damian Jackson 
also scored. Wetteland (2-3), trying for his major league-leading 
27th save, blew his fifth save chance.

<HEADLINE> Da Silva Tops Capel in 100 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Florida track and  
football star John Capel was late out of the blocks Sunday and 
unable to catch Brazil's Andre Domingos Da Silva in the 100-meter 
final at the University Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Capel, in his first competition outside the United States, was  
rattled by three false starts. On the final one, he ran alone in 
his lane for 50 meters before walking slowly back to the start with 
fists on his hips. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way I can run well is if I start well. No excuses,  
but the false starts kind of got to me,'' said Capel, who won the 
NCAA title in the 200 meters last month in 19.87 seconds, the 
second-fastest time in the world in 1999. ``I knew I had to keep my 
poise, but I just couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Da Silva won with a time of 10.34 seconds. Capel finished second  
at 10.35 and South Africa's Matthew Quinn took the bronze in 10.42. 
A strong headwind contributed to the relatively slow times -- 
Capel's best is 10.03. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the slowest I've run all year,'' Capel said. ``I was  
thinking this was going to be a cakewalk. I wasn't on my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Da Silva was put off by the talk.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans are very good at mouthing off,'' the Brazilian  
said. ``I just kept quiet and did what I had to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capel will join Auburn's Coby Miller, who won Friday's 200  
meters, in the 400 relay on Tuesday, the last day of the games. 
Capel passed on the 200, his best event, to prepare for the 100 and 
relay events. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's basketball, the United States moved within one victory  
of its sixth straight gold medal by getting past Spain 88-80 in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain trailed 82-80 with 20 seconds left, but Cincinnati forward  
Kenyon Martin and St. John's guard Erick Barkley combined to make 
6-of-6 free throws down the stretch. Martin finished with 22 
points, 11 rebounds and three blocks. Barkley scored 19 points 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia defeated Mexico 85-60 to secure the other spot in  
Monday's final. Yugoslavia was the last country to beat the United 
States at the University Games, in the 1987 gold medal game. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will face Spain in the women's gold medal  
game, also Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's volleyball, Germany got past Japan for the gold, with  
Spain beating South Korea for the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Capel, 20, has a bright future in sports -- he'll just have to  
pick one. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged more than 27 yards per return as a kick returner and  
also played wide receiver as a freshman last season at No. 5 
Florida. Football practice starts the day after he returns to the 
United States from the Spanish island of Mallorca. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he turned on the jets and nearly caught Silva.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Silva out of the corner of my eye with about 30 meters  
left,'' he said. ``I kicked it up, but just couldn't get him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, getting second place means you're the first loser,'' he  
added. ``You have to take losses, but I don't like them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olena Govorova defended her 1997 title in the triple jump with  
the year's best leap of 49 feet, 2 1/4 inches, which also shattered 
her own University Games record. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Williams, the NCAA champion from Southern California, won  
the women's dash in 11.19 seconds, holding off a late-charging 
Katia Benth of France. Benth was second in 11.25, with Cuba's 
Virgen Benavides third at 11.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Andria King and Yolanda McCray gave the United States gold and  
silver in the women's 100 hurdles, Poland's Ewa Ryback won the 
women's javelin, and Elena Buhaianu of Romania took the 1,500 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's winners included Italy's Giuseppe Maffei in the 3,000  
steeplechase, Richard Spiegelburg of Germany in the pole vault, and 
defending champion Norberto Tellez of Cuba in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	In tennis, South Korea's Hyung Lee upset top-seeded Albert  
Portas of Spain 6-4, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 to win the men's title.

<HEADLINE> Manchester U. Won't Defend FA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, England (AP) -- The chances of Manchester United  
defending the FA Cup were all but erased Sunday when manager Alex 
Ferguson confirmed the club would skip the domestic competition. 
</P>
<P>
	United accepted an exemption from the FA Cup last month in order  
to compete in the inaugural World Club Championship in Brazil in 
January. There had speculation the team would play both events or 
skip the FIFA-backed World Club tournament to defend the FA Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson mourned the chance to defend the Cup, but told BBC  
Radio it wouldn't be possible to compete in both competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my first trophy (with United),'' Ferguson said. ``I  
dearly would have loved to be in it again to defend it but 
unfortunately that will not be the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FA and the British Government supported the team's decision  
to compete in the World Club Championship because it bolstered 
England's World Cup 2006 bid.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Unveil Anti-Crime Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is proposing an  
anti-crime agenda that includes photo licenses for all new handgun 
owners, a ban on cheap handguns, increased spending on police 
training and a constitutional amendment for victims' rights, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of his first major pronouncements since kicking off his  
presidential campaign last month, Gore will propose sweeping 
changes in the criminal justice system designed to get tough on 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes a new policy that includes more federal money for  
the nation's court system and a requirement that criminal 
defendants pledge to get off drugs if they want to stay out of 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, the front-runner for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, was to announce the proposals in a speech 
today at the headquarters of the Boston police department, said 
sources familiar with his plans who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	While many specifics of the agenda, including how much it will  
cost, were not available, the most far-reaching proposals deal with 
gun control. School shootings this year in Littleton, Colo., and 
Conyers, Ga., have turned gun control into a major issue in the 
2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore wants every new gun owner to have a photo license. At  
present there is no federal requirement for gun owners to carry 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheap, easily concealed handguns, known as ``junk guns'' or  
``Saturday night specials,'' would be banned under Gore's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The junk gun industry traces its roots to a crackdown on  
handguns that followed the June 1968 assassination of Sen. Robert 
Kennedy by Sirhan Sirhan, who used a European-made .22-caliber 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, most cheap handguns sold in the United States were  
made overseas. Congress then banned the import of such weapons but 
did not outlaw their manufacture in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current federal law, semiautomatic rifles equipped with  
detachable magazines and certain other features are banned. Similar 
guidelines are imposed on handguns and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also wants tougher penalties for gun trafficking.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president has already said he supports raising the age  
for handgun possession from 18 to 21; barring juveniles from 
possessing assault weapons or large-capacity ammunition clips; 
imposing new penalties for adults who sell guns to minors; and 
requiring safety locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Gore's new gun-control proposals would be approved by  
Congress is questionable. The vice president cast a tie-breaking 
vote in May when the Senate passed legislation expanding a system 
of background checks on firearms purchases so they would cover all 
such buys at gun shows and pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign hoped that the moment of drama would add momentum  
to his campaign. But political squabbling between Democrats and 
Republicans helped kill a House gun-control bill in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bradley, Gore's only announced opponent for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, has put forth his own gun-control plan, 
including a proposal that all handguns be registered and a ban on 
the manufacture and sale of cheap handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's anti-crime package includes a ``Stay Clean to Stay Out''  
policy that says defendants in drug-related crimes who are awaiting 
trial must get off drugs to stay out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminals on parole also would have to stay off drugs to stay  
out of jail, under the proposed policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the technology buff, Gore would make increasing use of  
computers in law enforcement, investing in software that community 
police could use to map and target high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Other features of the anti-crime package include establishment  
of ``gang-free zones,'' more aid for professional development and 
retraining of police officers and increased spending on 
after-school programs for youths and anti-drug efforts.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Focus on Medicare Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From north to south, lawmakers returning to  
the Capitol say their constituents seem impressed by President 
Clinton's plan for optional prescription drug coverage under 
Medicare, adding momentum to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	But there appears to be relatively little excitement over tax  
cuts, one of the top priorities for congressional Republicans, 
according to interviews with members of Congress who were in their 
districts during the Fourth of July break. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the Senate plans to debate competing Republican and  
Democratic plans for increasing the rights of managed care 
patients. The House Ways and Means Committee intends to write an 
$850 billion, 10-year tax cut, and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers 
said Sunday that Clinton would veto such an expensive bill. Also, 
the House Appropriations Committee plans to churn out more of the 
13 annual spending bills for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	No immediate action on prescription drugs is likely, but the  
idea should stay in the political mix for a while. Clinton planned 
to highlight Medicare and his prescription idea at a White House 
budget meeting Monday with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president picked a political winner there,'' said  
Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., who said he heard a lot about the plan 
last week from constituents at town meetings in his affluent 
coastal district. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford, a conservative, said he believes the proposal would eat  
up projected surpluses that he says are overly optimistic. Even so, 
he said he feels like he is ``standing in front of a freight 
train'' when he tries to explain why it is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hearing positive feedback was Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich.,  
whose less prosperous northern Michigan voters mostly lack 
prescription drug coverage because managed care companies are rare 
in the rural district. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prescription drugs would be their top priority,'' Stupak said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, said prescription drug prices are on  
the minds of his East Texas constituents as well, but he says they 
think Clinton's plan does not go far enough. Turner is a sponsor of 
legislation that would let Medicare recipients buy drugs at the 
lower prices available to hospitals and other big purchasers, which 
he says would produce savings of 25 to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look at it as well-intentioned, but it really wouldn't do  
much for them,'' Turner said of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Clinton proposed that beginning in 2002, the  
government would split Medicare recipients' drug costs up to $2,000 
in exchange for a $24 monthly premium. The benefits, which would 
grow gradually, would cost $110 billion over a decade. Republicans 
are expected to reply with a more limited proposal of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Sanford and others said they heard little  
about cutting taxes, which they attribute to the healthy economy 
and voters' preference to use federal surpluses to reduce the 
accumulated national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Though that apathy long has been reflected in public opinion  
polls, top Republicans are trying to stir up interest. 
</P>
<P>
	On separate television programs Sunday, both Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and the GOP's second-ranking senator, 
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, promised that the party will push ahead 
with large tax-cut legislation. Also, leaders sent House members 
home for the holiday recess with a ``Tax Relief Action Packet'' to 
help them promote their upcoming tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's happy because the economy is good,'' said Rep.  
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who said his suburban Philadelphia constituents 
mentioned tax cuts infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Tierney, D-Mass., said at meetings in Peabody,  
Gloucester and other towns north of Boston, ``they kept coming back 
to prescription drugs.'' But he said he sensed little intensity on 
many issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know what I do for a living, and out of politeness if  
nothing else'' they ask questions, he said. But mostly, he said 
``people are spending a lot of time on their own lives and they 
just want us to do our job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agreeing with that was Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, whose  
southeastern Ohio district includes a portion of Appalachia and is 
struggling economically. However, he said people there have ``a 
hopefulness'' and seem more concerned with individual problems than 
with the more global issues Washington usually deals with. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may not be a bad time to be an incumbent,'' said  
Strickland, who was first elected in 1992 but defeated two years 
later. ``But it may not be that way next year. I know how quickly 
things can turn around.''

<HEADLINE> Rapper DMX Arrested in Trinidad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- American rapper DMX was arrested  
on obscenity charges during a concert in Trinidad, prompting a 
bottle-throwing protest by his fans in the audience, authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police who led DMX from the stage Saturday night fired their  
guns into the air to control the angry crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	DMX, whose real name is Earl Simmons, was being held in jail  
Sunday pending a court appearance Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Using obscene language in public is illegal in this conservative  
Caribbean country. Police stopped a concert by hip-hop singer Foxy 
Brown on July 3 over similar allegations, but no charges were 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear Sunday what words Simmons was charged with using.  
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette company Craven A, a sponsor of the concert at the  
Queen's Park Oval cricket ground in Port-of-Spain, said the rapper 
was warned that profanity could lead to his ``arrest and removal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest in a series of recent brushes with the law for  
the 28-year-old rapper. Last month, he was charged in New Jersey 
with possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. He is also free 
on bail in connection with an assault charge in Yonkers, New York.

	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On July 12, 1984, Democratic presidential candidate Walter F.  
Mondale named U.S. Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro (D-N.Y.) as his 
running mate; Ferraro was the first woman to run for vice president 
for a major party.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is proposing an  
anti-crime agenda that includes photo licenses for all new handgun 
owners, a ban on cheap handguns, increased spending on police 
training and a constitutional amendment for victims' rights, The 
Associated Press has learned. In one of his first major

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Scotland Yard police arrested two men Sunday for  
allegedly conspiring with Osama bin Laden in last summer's deadly 
bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, authorities said. They 
are charged with conspiring with bin Laden and his network to 
murder American citizens on or prior to Aug. 8, 1998, police said. 
Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Hadi Eidarous, 42, and Adel Mohanned Abdul 
Almagid Bary are scheduled to appear Monday at Bow Street 
Magistrates Court for the start of the extradition process. Bin 
Laden is suspected of masterminding and financing the Aug. 7, 1998 
bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 
people and wounded thousands.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Engineers shut down a nuclear reactor in western  
Japan Monday morning after monitoring equipment showed it was 
leaking radioactive water, an official said. The No. 2 reactor 
operated by Japan Atomic Power Co. in Tsuruga, 200 miles west of 
Tokyo, was manually shut down, company spokesman Yoshikazu Murabe 
said. There was no danger of radioactivity escaping into the 
outside environment, he said. An estimated 50 tons of water used 
for cooling the inside of the reactor had leaked out, and the 
device was still leaking as of noon, ``but at a lower volume than 
earlier,'' Murabe said.

from Kashmir. The plan calls for Pakistani-backed fighters to 
withdraw from the Indian-controlled region and for both sides to 
halt airstrikes, artillery fire and ground assaults. Kashmir is

Angeles, New York, Dallas and Washington. A police raid Friday on a 
Tehran University dormitory prompted thousands of students to 
protest in the strongest expression of discontent since the 1979 
Islamic revolution. The demonstrations expose a widening gulf 
between reformists, who support President Mohammad Khatami, and 
conservatives, who control the police and judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Fossett Leads Mackinac Yacht Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Millionaire Steve Fossett's Stars  
and Stripes led the pack sailing toward the halfway point Sunday in 
the Chicago-to-Mackinac yacht race. 
</P>
<P>
	Most ships were expected to finish the course Monday. The race's  
winners will then be determined based on a system of handicaps 
based on each boat's speed potential. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars and Stripes, a 60-foot Morrelli catamaran piloted by  
Fossett, was expected to finish the course late Sunday night. 
Fossett, who failed his second attempt to fly around the world in a 
balloon last year, holds the course record in the open division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a slow, steady and safe race,'' said Penny Beatty,  
spokeswoman for the Race to Mackinac. ``Unless wind conditions 
alter, it is not foreseeable that he will break that record. This 
is not going to be a record-setting year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Ludde Ingvall RX-Sight was spotted an hour behind Stars  
and Stripes. His boat won in the IMS (international measurement 
system) division last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 333-mile race began at 1 p.m. EDT Saturday in Chicago with  
winds at 20 to 25 knots out of the north to northeast, forcing 
boats to continually turn to fill the sails in 6-foot seas. 
According to Beatty, the winds Sunday had calmed to 6 to 8 knots 
out of the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The direction of the wind is more favorable but the speed of  
the wind has dropped,'' Beatty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 273 starters had dropped out for mechanical reasons  
by Sunday afternoon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the 92nd running of this invitation-only race are a  
varied group of sailors and vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest sailor is 12-years-old and the oldest is 82. The  
sailboats range in size from 27 feet to 80 feet with the average 
crew size being eight to 12 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fleet is very diverse,'' Beatty said. ``We have several  
boats sailing with several generations. There's lots of tradition, 
lots of families who enter this race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rock singer Bob Seger is also racing. Seger's boat was spotted  
in the second group behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing actually very well,'' Beatty said. ``He's  
definitely in a good pack.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is on the cover of this  
week's New Yorker magazine, pictured as a eager tourist walking 
along a path in Central Park while Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, looking 
menacing in black, lurks behind a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartoon by Harry Bliss, titled ``The Tourist and the Tough  
Guy,'' shows Mrs. Clinton with all the trappings of an 
out-of-towner: Wearing an ``I Love NY'' button, carrying a camera, 
toting a Museum of Modern Art shopping bag and an open copy of a 
tourist guide to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, cloaked in shadow, looks like a mugger ready to  
pounce. He even appears to be holding a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, may run for the Senate representing  
New York. One likely opponent is Republican Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady spent part of last week visiting upstate New York  
in what her campaign billed as a ``Listening Tour,'' in which she 
met with New Yorkers and discussed local issues. She has never 
lived in the state and has been accused by Republicans of being a 
carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton campaign spokesman had no comment on the cover.  
</P>
<P>
	Shown the cover at a press conference Sunday, Giuliani said,  
``Can't see it without my glasses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he's not a regular subscriber to the magazine.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- New Hampshire, known for its independent  
voters, coffee-shop politics and flannel shirts, may not seem an 
ideal fit for the buttoned-down Orrin Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	But campaign organizers expect the Utah senator will fit in fine  
when he makes his first campaign visit to the state on Monday in 
his long-shot White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``His starched collar -- people here aren't going to hold that  
against him,'' said Ken Egan, the former executive director of the 
New Hampshire Republican State Committee, and state director of 
Hatch's efforts there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to come up here and be himself and tell  
people why he's running and I'm very confident he's going to get a 
great reception,'' Egan said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire holds the first presidential primaries and  
candidates hope for a good showing there to boost them above the 
rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch spokesman Jeff Flint says Hatch will likely announce his  
Iowa campaign staff and a visit there in the coming week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's one-day New Hampshire stop will include an appearance on  
a local radio talk show; a meeting with employees of Delta Dental, 
Concord's biggest employer; a trip to a daycare center; an 
appearance on television news and a meeting with New Hampshire GOP 
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Extra Events Spice Up All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Matt Damon stepped to the plate, missed one pitch,  
hit four others foul and put only two balls into fair territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a McGwiresque performance, but a crowd pleaser  
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor from Cambridge, Mass., took part in Sunday's celebrity  
hitting challenge, part of five days of events leading to Tuesday 
night's All-Star game. So did actor Kevin Costner, who fared 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came out to see Kevin Costner because I think he's cute and  
I wanted to see if he could play baseball,'' said Casey Levesque, 
6, of Fall River. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the All-Star game was in Fenway Park was in 1961.  
There was no celebrity hitting challenge, no FanFest, no home run 
derby, no Futures game. The spotlight was, simply, on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's where it remains despite all the sidelights.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that takes the spotlight off the game,'' Damon  
said before taking his cuts. ``This is just some kind of warmup 
stuff, revenue for the city, an excuse to come out to the ballpark 
on a sunny day for a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a chance for those people to feel part of the All-Star  
experience even if they can't attend the game in 33,871-seat Fenway 
Park, the smallest ballpark in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	One person who won't attend is Jose Canseco, who leads the AL  
with 31 homers. The Tampa Bay slugger, elected as the AL designated 
hitter, had back surgery Sunday to repair a herniated disc. Harold 
Baines of Baltimore took his place on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	NL manager Bruce Bochy said his probable starting pitcher is  
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling (13-4), who began his career in the 
Boston organization. He said another ex-Red Sox farmhand, Houston's 
Jeff Bagwell, will be the designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Pedro Martinez (15-3) is likely to start for the AL.  
</P>
<P>
	Bochy's likely batting order will be Cincinnati's Barry Larkin,  
Colorado's Larry Walker, Chicago's Sammy Sosa, St. Louis' Mark 
McGwire, Arizona's Matt Williams, Bagwell, Mike Piazza of the New 
York Mets, Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona's Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's hitting challenge, four teams of three players each  
-- a celebrity, a former major league All-Star and a retired Red Sox 
star -- earned points for hitting the ball to certain spots on the 
field. Despite Damon's problems, his team won because of the 
hitting of Jim Rice and Steve Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's events also gave pitcher Kip Wells a chance to be part  
of the extravaganza. Wells, the Chicago White Sox' first-round 
draft pick last year, was on the United States futures team that 
lost 7-0 to the world futures team in a game involving promising 
minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives prospects a chance to compare their talents against  
others at that point in their game,'' Wells said. ``For me, it was 
a thrill just being in the dressing room with those guys whose 
movies I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also was special for Doug Flutie, the Buffalo Bills  
quarterback who won the Heisman Trophy at Boston College. He lined 
one ball off the Green Monster in left field during the celebrity 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get a chance to come to Fenway for an All-Star game to rub  
shoulders with the current players and go out and be kids again for 
a day,'' he said. ``And it's just a blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie would like the NFL Pro Bowl to add similar activities. In  
basketball, the NBA All-Star festivities feature dunking contests 
and old-timers' and rookie games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston all-star events began with FanFest, running Friday  
through Tuesday, where fans tour baseball exhibits. The last event 
before the actual game is Monday night's home run derby. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961 the game was the thing, the only thing. And there wasn't  
even a winner as rain ended it with the score 1-1 after nine 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Home Run Derby was in 1985 in Minneapolis. The next  
year, in Houston, a relay throw competition was added. In 1987, in 
Oakland, there were two more events -- catcher's throw for accuracy 
and hitting for accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	And last year in Denver, the first All-Star hitting challenge,  
similar to Sunday's event, was held. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of what has been added has been to the fans' benefit,''  
said former Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson, now an 
executive in the commissioner's office. ``The futures game is 
really a way of illustrating the international aspect of the game 
that already exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, the other time the All-Star game was in Fenway Park,  
Ted Williams went 4-for-4 in his home stadium in the American 
League's 12-0 win. Today, at age 80, even he likes the expanded 
format. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't try and squeeze too much in too few days, I  
think it's all a celebration,'' Williams said. ``It's all fun for 
baseball fans.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Find Honor in Cup Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The Chinese are taking some consolation in World  
Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
	If Italian soccer great Roberto Baggio can miss a penalty kick  
during a World Cup game in the Rose Bowl, it's no great shame if 
Liu Ying does so as well. 
</P>
<P>
	And that fact helped Chinese fans temper the loss to the United  
States for the Women's World Cup title. The Americans won 5-4 on 
penalty kicks after 120 scoreless minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	So the message was clear: There was honor in being No. 2.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad Chinese girls,'' read the front-page headline in the  
Beijing Evening News, the only newspaper in the Chinese capital 
that published late enough Sunday to carry word of the defeat, 
which occurred shortly before 7 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
	Underneath ran a photograph of President Clinton meeting the  
Chinese team after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportsmanship was by no means the assured reaction to defeat in  
China. Stoked by decades of communist propaganda, Chinese tend to 
see victory in international sports as proof China's national 
strength. And there was still plenty of anger in losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bomb the U.S. Embassy,'' read one message posted on a popular  
Chinese Internet site minutes after the loss in a call to avenge 
the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia two months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put a missile in their net,'' businessman Wang Jilei shouted  
at the TV screen in the Soccer Buff's Cafe, a regular haunt for 
sports fans in a working-class neighborhood in south Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bars, fans shouted expletives at U.S. players. Some  
hurled racial epithets at U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry. Scurry's 
key save came when she dived to her left to stop Liu's shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans repeated a litany of suspicions aired by state media  
leading to the game: The American referees were biased; China's 
players were starved for decent Chinese food; and tournament 
organizers tired the Chinese team by making them crisscross the 
United States four times in earlier rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Beijing Evening News used the same evidence to attest to  
the mettle of the Chinese players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This second spot did not come easily,'' the tabloid-style  
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	China Central Television opened its first nationwide newscast  
after the game with footage not of the loss but of Baggio missing 
the penalty kick that sent Brazil to victory in the men's 1994 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a normal thing to lose on penalty kicks. Even Italy's  
greatest star, Baggio, missed a penalty kick in a World Cup. That's 
not so bad,'' said Wang Zhanjun, an unemployed factory worker who 
runs a fan club for a Beijing men's team. ``It's an honor for the 
Chinese people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the food, the travel, even the 90-degree heat didn't  
matter, said fan Meng Xianyou. ``The Chinese team played well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese President Jiang Zemin set a positive tone, promising the  
Chinese players in a pregame telephone call a hero's welcome 
whether they won or not. 
</P>
<P>
	For China's communist leaders, the game was an opportunity to  
take the high ground. With intractable economic problems at home, 
they couldn't risk more public protests outside the U.S. Embassy 
like the ones that followed the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	And U.S. officials are due in Beijing this week to discuss  
compensation for China's losses, a face-saving demand of the 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, we have linked sports and politics too often.  
We're always thinking of winning for the glory of the country,'' 
said one message posted by someone called ``Chu Shou'' on the 
Internet. ``But for our women's team to play so well in such an 
important game is already an honor for our country.''

<HEADLINE> Canseco To Have Back Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jose Canseco, picked for the All-Star game for the  
first time since 1992, had back surgery Sunday to repair a 
herniated disc and will miss Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who leads the AL with 31 homers and is batting .276  
with 69 RBIs, left Friday's game in the eighth inning with a stiff 
back and had an MRI Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's designated hitter was examined Sunday at Pro Player  
Stadium by back specialist Dr. Tom Tolli of St. Petersburg. Canseco 
then went to a nearby hospital and was operated on by Tolli and Dr. 
Gary Giesseke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know something more at the end of the game,'' Tampa  
manager Larry Rothschild said. ``Obviously, he'll miss the All-Star 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time All-Star also missed the game because of injuries  
in 1989 and 1992. American League manager Joe Torre picked 
Baltimore's Harold Baines to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a distinct possibility he will play this year,''  
Rothschild said. ``We've had a lot of injuries this season, but 
obviously this is a big one. There's nothing we can do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who turned 35 on July 2, missed 12 games in June and  
July last year with similar back spasms but didn't miss a start 
following the All-Star break. He had two separate stints on the DL 
due to back ailments in 1997. In 1996, Canseco underwent back 
surgery to remove fragments and also ruptured a disc. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Canseco became the first member of the 40-40 club,  
hitting 40 homers and stealing 40 bases in the same season. He has 
428 career homers, 24th on the career list.

<HEADLINE> Dry Kentucky Creates Hay Hotline / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	Faced with intense heat and little rainfall, many farmers in  
central and eastern Kentucky are selling their cattle because they 
can't feed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a bit of moisture,'' said Darrell Arrington, a

	To combat the problem, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture  
established a toll-free hay hotline last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hotline is to hook up people who do have hay with the ones  
who don't,'' said Sally Wilson, a department spokeswoman. ``If 
people need it they can call, or if people have it then they can 
call in also and we'll keep track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall since April 1 has been four to six inches below normal  
in much of eastern Kentucky and two to four inches short in parts 
of central and south-central Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said farmers in some counties are faced with little  
pastureland and are turning to what hay they have to feed the 
livestock. When winter comes, there may be no hay left. 
</P>
<P>
	In western Kentucky, however, rainfall amounts are two inches  
above normal since April 1. Wilson said officials hope that farmers 
in areas not facing a drought will contribute hay. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington said that if the problems subside, he'd like to buy  
some more livestock. ``We haven't had any rain in ... I don't know 
how long it's been. Everything's drying up,'' he said.

	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Republic County farmer James Pachta parked  
his combine in the shed last Thursday night and climbed out of the 
cab with the satisfaction that comes at the end of another 
successful wheat harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, he drove to Linn in neighboring Washington  
County to work at his off-farm job -- branch president of Peoples 
State Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a dual role that has given Pachta a special empathy to the  
problems in the farm economy as the 1999 Kansas wheat harvest winds 
down, with wheat prices hovering at $2.16 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pachta was especially glad when he saw yields in the area coming  
in at 60 pounds per bushel to offset the decline in prices -- and 
why he was anxious when unrelenting rains delayed the harvest 
around the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was nervous about my borrowers and hoping they got their  
wheat crop in and I was nervous about my crop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His bank tries to go the extra mile with farmers who have dealt  
with them for years, especially in these times of low prices for 
most farm commodities. But banking regulators do not look at 
borrowers' loan history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The regulatory people have perceived there is some kind of ag  
crisis out there, then when they come to look at the loan they tend 
to look at it harder,'' Pachta said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said banking regulators have been ingrained to think there is  
a farm crisis, and they are coming into banks carrying a ``heavier 
stick'' when examining farm loans. 
</P>
<P>
	His own bank tightened its lending policies a couple of years  
ago and now documents things a little closer, makes sure the loans 
are covered by crop insurance and is careful not to lend more than 
the insurance value on the crop, Pachta said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Takes Tour de France Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METZ, France (AP) -- Along the roads of the Tour de France this  
year, fans chant for their favorite French, German and Swiss 
riders. Now they're shouting another name, too: ``Armstrong!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Armstrong won a crucial time trial Sunday to regain the  
overall lead of the Tour de France. He led at every checkpoint and 
called his performance ``one of the greatest victories of my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Texan has a lot of admirers these days. Many see  
his comeback from testicular cancer to the very top of cycling as 
nothing short of amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing the red-white-and-blue jersey of the U.S. Postal Service  
team, Armstrong powered through the 34-mile course in 1 hour, 8 
minutes, 36 seconds. He rode at an average speed of nearly 30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Armstrong, once so severely ill almost everyone assumed his  
career was over, is a clear favorite as cycling's biggest race hits 
the Alps this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American did not fare so well in Sunday's eighth stage.  
Bobby Julich, who came in third overall last year, fell on a steep 
descent and is out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Julich, who rides for the French team Cofidis, was taken to a  
hospital and diagnosed with bruised ribs. Nothing was broken, 
except his hopes for this year's Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old rider from Glenwood Springs, Colo., fell at the  
19-mile mark on a descent where speeds reach 46 mph. He was in 20th 
place overall going into the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Tyler Hamilton of U.S. Postal, came in fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' said Mark Gorski, the team's general  
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing second in the stage was Alex Zulle of Switzerland, 58  
seconds behind. He was followed by France's Christophe Moreau, 2 
minutes, 5 seconds behind. The world time trial champion, Abraham 
Olano of Spain, came in fourth, at 2:22 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Moreau is second, followed by Olano and Australia's  
Stuart O'Grady. Spain's Alvaro Gonzalez Galdeano is fifth. 
Estonia's Jaan Kirsipuu had been the overall leader but dropped to 
11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the team trailer before the race, Armstrong exuded  
confidence, joking with a teammate as he warmed up on a stationary 
bike. He even strummed a few bars of air guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance knew this was the day the Tour really began for him,''  
said Dan Osipow, operations manager for U.S. Postal. ``He's been 
waiting for this day for quite a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Armstrong took great care to learn Sunday's course,  
coming to Metz on a rainy day in April to try it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it wouldn't be easy,'' he said. Still, he felt the  
course was tailored to his strengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had a full entourage Sunday from Austin, Texas. His  
wife flew in for the time trial, as did members of his foundation, 
which works toward the treatment and awareness of testicular 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a mainly European sport, the American rider also has  
picked up huge support on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``His comeback is great,'' said Christian Kohl, 19, of Neustadt,  
Germany, waiting for an autograph before the race. ``He was so 
sick, and now he's one of the favorites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His teammate on an amateur cycling team, Kim Schoos of  
Luxembourg, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so, so strong,'' he said. ``He could take the whole race,  
for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer  
that had spread to his lungs and brain. He underwent surgery to 
remove his right testicle and lesions from his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After long months of rehabilitation, Armstrong returned to  
racing early last year and has been steadily improving. 
</P>
<P>
	He was considered a favorite for the time trial since winning  
the race prologue, also a time trial. He wore the yellow jersey for 
two days before losing it to Kirsipuu. 
</P>
<P>
	In public, Armstrong has appeared calm and focused all week. But  
holding the lead can rattle a rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I won the yellow jersey a week ago because I was  
really nervous while I had it,'' he said. ``Maybe now I'll be less 
nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The riders have a rest day Monday. Then they head to the  
mountains, where, as Armstrong says, ``Anything can happen.''

<HEADLINE> Senior Open Dream Ends for Dougherty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Ed Dougherty blew the lead Sunday  
in the final round of the U.S. Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he insisted he was happy to be runner-up, and it was easy  
to see he was telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I need any condolences,'' Dougherty said on the  
18th green. ``But thanks for the congratulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ended up with a final-round 72 and was 4-under 284 for the  
tournament, three strokes behind champion Dave Eichelberger. 
</P>
<P>
	All week, Dougherty said he liked being called a dreamer. The  
fans loved his blue-collar background, the scrambler who won once 
during his on-again, off-again 23-year stint on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty isn't exactly the glamor boy of the Senior Tour. He  
has a body like the Michelin man and he lumbers up the fairways. 
His bright blue shirt was already soaked with sweat on the first 
tee Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was going great for Dougherty when he birdied the fourth and  
seventh to reach 6-under, then he took it to 7-under with another 
birdie at No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	But his wake-up buzzer was a double-bogey on the 160-yard par-3  
14th, where he came to the tee tied with Eichelberger. Dougherty 
swept the ball with an 8-iron and knew right away he was in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I put a lot of backspin on it,'' he said. ``Didn't hit  
it solid enough to carry up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It rolled into a well under the flag and finally stopped on the  
fringe. He pitched up to the plateau where the pin rested, leaving 
him with a sloping 8-footer for par. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed, curling the ball short by more than a foot. Then his  
3-footer lipped all the way around the cup and stayed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it went in, but it did more than a 360,'' he said.  
``I really didn't know where that would end up. It did like a 420 
or something. It went all the way around the hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments earlier, a roar came up from the gallery on the 15th,  
where Eichelberger, playing in the next-to-last group, was on his 
way to the title after a birdie carried him to 8-under. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty said he never looked at the leader board, but he knew  
he had to do something. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to get some birdies right there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	There wouldn't be any. In fact, he bogeyed the 17th with a  
three-putt after finding himself on the back fringe. After his 
tap-in, he pulled out his notebook to study the 18th, but the look 
in his eyes suggested he knew it was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was playing for second place,'' he recalled. ``It's  
a great thing to say, but it's a terrible situation to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty received a resounding cheer when he walked up to the  
18th green. He parred the hole after getting a 60-foot putt to 8 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dougherty said afterward he needed no sympathy. He has  
been a grinder all his life, whether taking the point for his 
infantry unit in Vietnam or working in a bag shop for $1.50 an hour 
on his hometown golf course in Linwood, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a good time all week,'' Dougherty said. ``There are  
plenty of people out there on the driving ranges across America, 
pretending to hit a shot in the U.S. Open. I just lived that 
dream.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Thrilled About Soccer Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. women's victory in the World Cup was  
more than just another match, it was a watershed event for women 
everywhere. At least that's how soccer's newest convert -- President 
Clinton -- sees it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most exciting sports event that I believe I have  
ever seen,'' Clinton told the American team after its victory 
Saturday over China in a shootout following a 0-0 tie at the Rose 
Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, clad in yellow championship T-shirts crowded around  
the president, hugging him and cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a triumphant end to a long week for Clinton, who extended  
a four-day tour through some of the nation's most impoverished 
communities to remain on the West Coast for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called the U.S. women's victory -- in a match that went  
to double overtime before being decided on penalty kicks -- a lesson 
in ``courage and endurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an amazing day,'' he said. ``We learned a lot today  
about soccer and about women athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An avid golfer and football and basketball fan, Clinton admitted  
that he did not know much about soccer, which he first was exposed 
to when daughter Chelsea took up the game at age 6. 
</P>
<P>
	But he could not stop talking about the drama of the game aboard  
Air Force One before leaving Los Angeles for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went on forever and you could never tell who was going to  
win,'' he said. ``It was just amazing. The momentum would shift and 
then shift back and then shift back. They were all so great, if I 
we're not a partisan, you almost hate to see either side lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that a vast television audience watched the match around  
the globe, Clinton agreed it was a watershed event for women's 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will mobilize -- I think you'll have more young  
girls playing soccer,'' he said. ``I think you'll have more young 
girls playing other sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the drive and staying power the women showed was an  
important lesson on why women deserve equal opportunities. He 
called the championship ``a tribute to Title IX,'' the federal code 
requiring schools to provide women athletes the same resources for 
sports that men receive, with helping 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll have even more young girls, you know, finding  
self-confidence, other ways to express themselves because of what 
these women have accomplished,'' Clinton said. ``And I would expect 
that it would have that impact in other countries as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also visited the losing team's locker room after the  
match, expressing his appreciation for China's performance in the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing was the Chinese women were very upbeat,  
very proud of their performance, very respectful of the American 
team.'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations with Beijing have been strained since NATO mistakenly  
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the air campaign over 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese players were visibly delighted to see the president  
of the United States. Members of the squad videotaped Clinton as he 
spoke to them and posed with him for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed by those women. How can you not be?'' he  
said. ``No one played harder than they did. And yet they bore their 
last minute defeat with enormous dignity and grace.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's population likely will increase by  
30 percent over the next 30 years and the country will have to 
prepare to care for a growing portion of elderly, government 
agencies reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Mexicans is expected to grow from 100 million in  
2000 to 130 million by 2030, the government news agency Notimex 
reported, citing studies by two state offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people older than 65 years will grow from 4.4  
million as of 1998 to 6.8 million in 2010 and 15.6 million in 2030, 
the National Population Council said. 
</P>
<P>
	This change will require the government to allocate more  
resources toward the social security system, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, the average birthrate has fallen from seven  
children to two-and-a-half. Life-expectancy, meanwhile, has reached 
nearly 74 years -- more than doubling the 35 years which was the 
average in 1930.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's president said Sunday he  
is recalling the country's ambassador to Colombia because of 
allegedly insulting comments made by Colombia's trade minister. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez said ambassador Fernando Gerbasi was  
ordered to return immediately to Caracas for consultations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian minister, Martha Lucia Ramirez, last week  
criticized a Venezuelan law requiring Colombian truck drivers to 
hand their cargo over to Venezuelan drivers at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Caracas daily El Nacional, she said  
Chavez ``talks about integration, but the measures applied by some 
of his officials are just the opposite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez shot back on his weekly radio call-in show Sunday, saying  
Ramirez ``made some statements that showed a lack of respect for 
the government and the people Venezuela.''

several times in the head have been found in western Mexico, 
apparently the latest cases in a wave of suspected drug-related 
killings in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found Saturday near Tecpan de Galeana, 50 miles  
northwest of the resort of Acapulco.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's government wants tighter  
controls on so-called social groups working in the Amazon, fearing 
some aim to plunder the rainforest's natural resources, a newspaper 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the non-governmental groups which carry out social  
studies and research in the region are bona-fide but some have 
``other objectives,'' said Defense Minister Elcio Alvares in an 
interview with Rio daily Jornal Do Brasil. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Federal Police chief for the Amazon, Mauro Sposito,  
claimed in the daily that some groups are acting unofficially on 
behalf of multinational companies keen to locate valuable 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some 1,000 non-governmental groups in Brazil. At least  
300 work in the Amazon region.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's president said Sunday his  
government will fully cooperate with an investigation into 1989 
riots in which security forces killed hundreds of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``My government does not have any intention to hide the truth,''  
President Hugo Chavez told The Associated Press. Authorities should 
``establish who is responsible ... and carry out justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights workers charge that security forces put down the  
February 1989 riots by indiscriminately spraying mountainside slums 
with bullets even after widespread looting over soaring bus fares 
and food prices had ended. 
</P>
<P>
	They say dozens of shooting victims were dumped in a mass grave  
and have never been identified or turned over to their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyer Raul Arrieta denies widespread human rights  
violations took place and says security forces were simply 
restoring order in a chaotic situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, 276 people were killed in the riots though rights  
activists say the number is 400 or more. Few soldiers or police 
have gone to jail for the killings.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsinite Kelly Denied at GMO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- On the biggest day of his golfing life, Jerry  
Kelly only lost his focus briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	It was still too long.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in four years, the Madison native had a  
chance to win the Greater Milwaukee Open in the final round. But 
just as Loren Roberts did in a 1996 playoff, Carlos Franco stole 
the title from Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly admits he desperately wants to win the only PGA Tour event  
in his home state. After sleeping on a lead for the first time in 
his four-year career, he thought a win Sunday was his destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a very good chance today, but I let it slip away in the  
middle of the round,'' he sighed afterward. ``I can see plain as 
day what went wrong and where it slipped away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly entered the day with a chance at capturing both the GMO  
and a slice of history. He held a one-stroke lead over Franco after 
54 holes, all of which Kelly had played without a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	He stretched his bogeyless streak to 59 holes on Sunday before  
the tricky par-5 sixth hole, where he three-putted for a 6. Just 
like that, his chance at a perfect tournament was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	And so was his lead. Franco birdied the hole to match him at 17  
under, and Kelly began to tense up. The pressure of a cheering 
gallery and Franco's steady play caught up to him, and he bogeyed 
four of the next five holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I made the first bogey, I said, 'So what? That  
happens,''' Kelly said. ``Then I lost control of my game ... and by 
the time I got it back, it was too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly was down but not out. He chipped in on No. 14 with a  
brilliant sand wedge shot, which he celebrated by bowing to the 
roaring crowd and high-fiving his caddy. The shot brought him 
within three strokes of Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	A bogey on 16, however, put him too far back to recover. Tom  
Lehman birdied No. 18 and Kelly missed a chance at his second-best 
career finish when he missed a makable putt on the final green and 
allowed Lehman to slip in front of him for second place. 
</P>
<P>
	When the final shot slid past the cup, Kelly flopped onto his  
back, and the crowd both groaned and laughed. They then gave their 
native son and Franco a standing ovation as they congratulated each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Wisconsinite Steve Stricker was thought before the  
tournament to be the Badger State's best chance at a homegrown 
champion, considering his outstanding season and his runner-up 
finish last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kelly, a former hockey player, endeared himself to fans with  
his exaggerated gestures and running commentary on his game. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 17th hole, he hit a 150-yard iron directly at the pin.  
But when he followed the shot with a Carlton Fisk-like dance and a 
chant of ``Oh, please go in. Oh, please go in,'' he sounded just 
like any weekend warrior with a double-digit handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did in 1996, Kelly plans to take the frustrations of his  
loss and channel them into improving his play for the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably learned more today about myself than I have in any  
other event,'' Kelly said. ``There were a lot more nerves for me 
today. I saw exactly when I got out of my game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this had happened to me earlier in my career, I would've  
gone out the next week and played steamed, played the next 
tournament like it owed me something. ... I'm going to learn from 
this and get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was asked if he thinks he'll ever win the tournament he  
wants so badly, Kelly was unequivocal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'll come back and win it next year,'' he said with a  
grin.

	But through their shared interest in plants and horticulture,  
they crossed paths with Benjamin Matthew Williams, who with his 
younger brother is suspected of killing the gay couple and is 
linked to a series of arson fires at Sacramento synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	Matson helped found the 20-year-old Redding Farmers Market,  
where Williams sometimes sold vegetables and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond words that the farmers market may be the  
connection between the victims and the killers,'' said Margaret 
Jensen, who tends a market stall stocked with squash and organic 
onions. ``If they burned the synagogues, too, that takes it to a 
level that is just staggering from someplace we think of as a small 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Matson and Mowder were discovered at their Happy  
Valley home on July 1. Happy Valley is a small community just 
outside of Redding in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, after one of the victims' credit cards was used,  
police staked out a Yuba City business where the credit card 
purchase was to be delivered, and arrested Benjamin Matthew 
Williams, 31, and his brother, James Tyler Williams, 29. Yuba City 
is about 120 miles southeast of Redding. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were both armed and one was wearing a bulletproof  
vest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, federal and local authorities said the brothers  
also were being investigated in connection with the Sacramento 
synagogue fires on June 18 that caused $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were being held in lieu of $150,000 bail on charges  
of receiving stolen property after authorities found -- a wallet, 
credit card, driver's license and Social Security card belonging to 
Matson. Neither has been charged in connection with the murders or 
the fires. Authorities hope to bring murder charges later this 
week, said Shasta County Sheriff's Capt. Ron Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair lived in a modest, wood-frame house in Redding, where  
investigators said they found material espousing white supremacist 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the material found was literature from the Illinois-based  
World Church of the Creator, according to news reports. A former 
member of the church, Benjamin Smith, killed himself last week 
after a two-state shooting spree targeting minorities in Indiana 
and Illinois that killed two men and wounded nine others. 
</P>
<P>
	Also found in the house was a list of 32 prominent Jewish and  
civic leaders in Sacramento, and FBI special agent James Maddock 
said protection was ordered for those individuals. Officials also 
urged Redding's only Jewish congregation, Temple Beth Israel, to 
increase security. 
</P>
<P>
	Matson, 50, a lifelong resident of the area, helped establish an  
arboretum as well as the museum and farmers market. Mowder, 40, his 
companion of 16 years, worked in the plant department in the local 
hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the Williams brothers had been involved in a  
landscaping business. 
</P>
<P>
	And Matthew Williams knew Matson through a shared interest in  
horticulture, according to Ed Smith, owner of a Redding nursery 
where Williams worked briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were acquaintances. They both sold at the farmers market.  
I don't know if they were friends, but I know that they knew each 
other,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Freitas, a retired teacher who taught 30 years at the  
elementary school, said: ``It's such a tragedy. Gary was a very 
nice fellow. Very much a community-minded person.''

<HEADLINE> Madonna To Take Part in AIDS Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) -- Madonna is lending her name to this  
year's AIDS Walk on her home turf. Organizers of the Detroit-area 
charity event hope she does even more. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop superstar, who grew up in Bay City and the Detroit  
suburb of Rochester, has agreed to serve as spokeswoman for the 
Sept. 19 fund-raiser in Royal Oak, AIDS Walk Detroit president Jim 
Domanski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna offered her support through an organization that  
represents AIDS fund-raisers nationwide, Domanski said. 
</P>
<P>
	As celebrity spokesperson for the ninth 5-kilometer walk, her  
name appears on letters and postcards included in more than 8,000 
registration forms mailed out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hope she'll also be able to attend the event, but her  
final role remains unclear. Domanski said after Madonna agreed to 
serve as spokesperson for the 1998 AIDS Walk in Los Angeles, she 
showed up at the event and spoke to a crowd of about 25,000.

<HEADLINE> FBI Reaching out to Militia Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEW, Texas (AP) -- Born out of the destruction of the Alfred P.  
Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, a little-noticed program 
has made strange bedfellows of FBI agents and militia members. 
</P>
<P>
	On the orders of FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General  
Janet Reno, agents in the 56 FBI field offices around the country 
have been finding ways to reach out to members of militia groups in 
their local areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, established just weeks after the April 19, 1995,  
bombing that killed 168 people, has been an open secret with 
positive consequences for the nation's top police agency and the 
militia movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're seeing it throughout the communities, law  
enforcement trying to reach out and say, 'We're human beings, 
too,''' said FBI spokesman Bill Crowley, who is an agent in the 
Pittsburgh, Pa., office. ``The idea we're pushing is that it's not 
a crime to be a member of the militia, or to be an FBI agent, for 
that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has been pleased that many members of the nation's  
militias are in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are our FBI. We needed to get a face on them,'' said  
Raymond Smith, a commander with the Texas Freedom Fighters and a 
member of the National Militia Advisory Board. ``Our government 
can't be our enemy. If it is, we're in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outreach program takes many forms.  
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, several meetings have taken place in hinterland burgs  
like Dew, a community of 71 people located some 100 miles south of 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowley said the No. 2 agent in the Pittsburgh office, which  
includes the militia hotbed of West Virginia in its territory, was 
a guest on a shortwave radio show highlighting militia topics. 
</P>
<P>
	In early 1996, the head of the FBI's Kansas City office spoke to  
about 100 members of the Missouri 51st Militia at the group's 
annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings give militia members a chance to meet people like  
FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Danny Defenbaugh, who has been the 
subject of dozens of Internet newsgroups because of his role in 
leading the Oklahoma City bombing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sit-downs also help the FBI set the record straight on its  
motives. Last year, Defenbaugh requested a meeting in Dew to dispel 
rumors that he was charged with disbanding the groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get to realize you have integrity, and that you're a  
human being,'' said Defenbaugh, who heads the FBI's Dallas office. 
</P>
<P>
	The militia movement aims to protect Constitutional rights and  
provide for the nation's defense in times of war or emergency. 
Generally, the groups believe in state's rights and a limited 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and some militia groups are at loggerheads largely  
because of a 1992 incident at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and the 1993 Waco 
standoff with the Branch Davidians that ended with the death of 
about 80 people. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ruby Ridge, an FBI sniper shot and killed the unarmed wife of  
white separatist Randy Weaver, the day after Weaver's 14-year-old 
son and a deputy U.S. marshal were killed in a firefight. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and other like-minded militia members said they believe  
they are fighting the same enemy as the FBI: people who want to 
undermine the Constitution and the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we believe and what they think are not that far  
different,'' said Lynn Van Huizen, a commander with the Michigan 
Militia Corps-Wolverines. ``We're all concerned Americans. We all 
have to raise our kids here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents and militia members say the outreach program  
helps distinguish true Constitutional militia members from hate 
groups and changes the public perception that militias are 
``anti-government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Christian Identity groups, Ku Klux Klan, Nazi groups, they  
claim to be a militia. The media gets a hold of it, and that group 
is a militia,'' Smith said. ``Once you break the law, you are no 
longer militia. We don't want Americans killing Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Mealybug Might Threaten U.S. Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- The two passengers  
carrying basil and plant cuttings aboard flights from St. Thomas to 
Miami last year were unsuspecting carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	So were 14 others who sent packages or traveled from six other  
Caribbean islands to Florida, where port inspectors discovered the 
hitchhiking pink hibiscus mealybug. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a pest that has eaten its way through millions of dollars  
in crops and ornamental plants across the Caribbean since it first 
was reported in the Western Hemisphere, in Grenada in 1994. By June 
1997 it had reached the U.S. Virgin Islands and, a year later, 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're watching the ports, but these things have a way of  
getting in,'' said Kenneth Vick of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's research service in Beltsville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	With Miami at the hub of U.S. commerce for Latin America,  
Florida agriculture officials say it's just a matter of time before 
up to 17 Southern states could be infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The bugs feed on the sap, roots and leaves of more than 200  
plants, from oranges and squash to bougainvillea, injecting a 
killer toxin from their saliva. They are tiny -- the oval-shaped, 
wingless female about 1/8 inch and a pink-red, the male half that 
size and a rusty red with wings. And they propagate rapidly, since 
the female lays up to 600 eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural economist Joe Moffitt, of the University of  
Massachusetts, has predicted that if the mainland is infiltrated 
there could be $750 million a year in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we find is the mealybug is moving and isn't detected in  
these other countries until it's a blowout situation,'' said 
mealybug expert Dale Meyerdirk, a USDA entomologist in Riverdale, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The pink mealybug was already established in Asia, Africa and  
Australia when it reached Grenada and, the following year, 
Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Caribbean countries responded with massive doses of  
pesticides, but those could not penetrate the female mealybug's 
waxy coating. The two countries then turned to slashing and 
burning, which began denuding vast areas with no pest relief. 
</P>
<P>
	As the pest pushed farther north, U.S. officials hurried to find  
a way to arrest it. Their hope was a wasp. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1997, Meyerdirk set up a breeding program in the U.S.  
Virgin Islands for stingless wasps that lay eggs in the mealybug. 
When the eggs hatch, they devour the pest's innards. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has grown tens of thousands of the wasps and  
supplied them free to anyone, from backyard gardeners to hoteliers 
to agriculture ministries. It is credited with suppressing the 
mealybug in the northern reaches of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	But that may not be enough.  
</P>
<P>
	The pest has reached Guyana, the only affected South American  
country, and hopped up the archipelago across more than 25 
Caribbean islands. 
</P>
<P>
	In Trinidad, it attacked 130 types of plants and crops. Losses  
could exceed an annual $125 million, or 2.3 percent of gross 
domestic product, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on 
Agriculture reports. 
</P>
<P>
	By next year, it projects that Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican  
Republic and Haiti will be infested. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next five years, the Costa Rica-based institute says, the  
pest is expected to travel north, to the southern United States, 
and as far south as Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Many islands still are suffering trade embargoes, though  
recently pest-free countries such as Barbados have sent inspectors 
to identify mealybug-free areas and certify their produce for 
export. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti and the Dominican Republic regularly send Meyerdirk  
suspect specimens but thus far remain free of the pink mealybug, he 
said. Also clear are the Bahamas and Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyerdirk says that if the $250,000-a-year USDA project folded  
today, the wasps would control 92-95 percent of the bugs on treated 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico, the wasps have reduced the number of pests by  
more than 88 percent, preventing the losses that hit other islands. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Florida, nursery plants require 100 percent control and  
any infestation could bring embargoes by the European Union and 
other U.S. states, hurting the $1.46 billion nursery industry. 
</P>
<P>
	For six months, scientists in Hawaii have been studying  
irradiation and heat treatments and soon will include chemical 
drenches and dips. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have this pest that other states feel threatened by and  
we don't have a treatment that can be applied, we have a real 
economic disaster in the making,'' said Mike Shannon of the USDA, 
who oversees port inspection in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Low Morale at Harvard Law Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Sure, having a Harvard Law School degree  
is valuable, but does earning it have to be so miserable? 
</P>
<P>
	That's what officials at the prestigious school want to find out  
in commissioning a study of the low morale that apparently has 
permeated the campus for years, The Boston Globe reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 survey by National Jurist and Princeton Review ranked  
Harvard Law 154th out of 165 law schools in overall student 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to learn why, the school recently hired management  
consulting firm McKinsey &AMP; Co., which has begun surveying students, 
interviewing professors and sending questionnaires to alumni. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, so far, show that classes are considered too large  
and access to professors too limited at the 1,800-student law 
school. A final report is expected by the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principle we found is that students want more intellectual  
engagement with the faculty,'' said professor Elizabeth Warren, 
chairwoman of the committee that commissioned the study. ``They 
want more feedback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Kaufman, a Harvard Law graduate, doesn't need a study to  
tell him about the school's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to be a U.S. attorney, go to the University of  
Chicago,'' Kaufman said. ``If you want to be a judge or law 
professor, go to Yale. But if you want to work on Wall Street, go 
to Harvard. That teaches you to deal with difficult people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But why hire a high-priced consulting firm? Why not just ask the  
students if they're bummed out? 
</P>
<P>
	``Students may be more comfortable whining to an outside firm  
than whining to us,'' said Alan Dershowitz, another of the school's 
professors.

	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Roy Myers scored the go-ahead goal in the  
72nd minute, and the Los Angeles Galaxy went on to beat the New 
England Revolution 5-2 Sunday in Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers' goal gave Los Angeles a 3-2 lead. Cobi Jones scored in  
the 85th minute and Carlos Hermosillo added a goal off a Jones pass 
in the final minute for Los Angeles (10-7). 
</P>
<P>
	Ezra Hendrickson and Clint Mathis also scored for the Galaxy.  
Joe-Max Moore scored twice for New England (8-9), giving him six 
goals in his last four games and a team-high 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's diving header of Ted Chronopolos' indirect kick put New  
England ahead in the 39th minute, but Mathis beat Walter Zenga to 
tie it a minute later. 
</P>
<P>
	An unmarked Hendrickson gave Los Angeles a 2-1 lead in the 63rd  
minute off a cross from Mauricio Cienfuegos. Moore converted a 
penalty kick three minutes later after Greg Vanney was called for a 
hard tackle on Johnny Torres in the penalty area.

<HEADLINE> Prestigious Law Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The partners of two prestigious British and U.S.  
law firms have approved plans to merge and added a third partner to 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of New York-based Rogers &AMP; Wells and Britain's  
Clifford Chance, the first marriage of major U.S. and British law 
firms, was approved overwhelmingly by the firms' partners over the 
weekend, Rogers &AMP; Wells said in a statement issued Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	They also announced an agreement in principle to merge with a  
leading German law firm, Punder, Volhard, Wever and Axster. The 
partners of all three firms are to vote in September on the 
three-way combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will succeed because all three firms share a strong  
commitment to developing a single, integrated culture, drawing on 
the best of each, that is dedicated to excellence in client 
service, teamwork and training,'' said Larry Cranch, managing 
partner at Rogers &AMP; Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined firm will be known in the United States as Clifford  
Chance Rogers &AMP; Wells and as Clifford Chance along with the Punder 
name in Germany and certain other European locations, Rogers &AMP; 
Wells said. The three-way merger, which will take effect Jan. 1, 
2000, will result in one of the world's largest law firms with 
2,700 lawyers and 30 offices worldwide, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mergers are expected to spark similar unions between firms  
amid a trend of consolidation in the increasingly international 
field of law.

	2 Arrested in U.S. Embassy Bombings  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Police arrested two men Sunday for allegedly  
conspiring with Osama bin Laden in last summer's deadly bombings of 
two U.S. embassies in Africa, authorities said. They are charged 
with conspiring with bin Laden and his network to murder American 
citizens on or prior to Aug. 8, 1998, police said. Ibrahim Hussein 
Abdel Hadi Eidarous, 42, and Adel Mohanned Abdul Almagid Bary are 
scheduled to appear Monday at Bow Street Magistrates Court for the 
start of the extradition process. Bin Laden is suspected of 
masterminding and financing the Aug. 7, 1998 bombings of the 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 people and wounded 
thousands.

	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- Top military commanders from India

from Kashmir, easing fears of a wider war between the two 
nuclear-armed neighbors. The plan calls for Pakistani-backed 
fighters to withdraw from the Indian-controlled region and for both 
sides to halt airstrikes, artillery fire and ground assaults. 
Kashmir is split between India and Pakistan, and was divided by the 
Line of Control under an agreement signed in 1972.

	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iranians across the United

support for student uprisings in Iran. Rallies occurred in Los 
Angeles, New York, Dallas and Washington. A police raid Friday on a 
Tehran University dormitory prompted thousands of students to 
protest in the strongest expression of discontent since the 1979 
Islamic revolution. The demonstrations expose a widening gulf 
between reformists, who support President Mohammad Khatami, and 
conservatives, who control the police and judiciary.

Clinton said in an interview with New York Times columnist Bob 
Herbert. But, Clinton added, ``this is an important story, what 
we've been doing these last three days. I'm so thrilled. I hope I

	Probe of Cuban Migrant's Death Urged

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Anti-Castro groups repeated calls Sunday for  
officials to investigate a collision at sea involving a Coast Guard 
cutter that resulted in the death of a Cuban migrant. Officials say 
the refugee boat was trying to evade capture when it collided with 
the cutter and sank. The Cuban-American National Foundation says 
the incident needs to be reviewed because the Coast Guard's 
intercept policy is putting lives in peril. Under U.S. policy, 
foreigners who reach U.S. shores are allowed to seek asylum, but 
those intercepted at sea are returned to their homeland or another 
country.

venerable Fenway Park on the Fox network, is expected to be one of 
the highest-rated TV shows of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Audience ratings for the annual exhibition game between all-star  
teams of the American and National Leagues were up 13 percent last 
year after sinking to an all-time low in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the rise last year, the rating was 28 percent below  
what it was for the All-Star game in 1994, which came a month 
before a strike that ended the season prematurely and forced the 
first cancellation of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been struggling to rebuild its fan base since then  
and make itself a more attractive partner for marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to MasterCard, advertisers on this year's All-Star  
game telecast include the Blockbuster video store chain, brewers 
Anheuser-Busch and Coors, automakers General Motors and Nissan, 
Quaker State motor oil, discount broker Charles Schwab and John 
Hancock financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate Insurance, the nation's second biggest provider of  
property and casualty insurance, is launching a new advertising 
campaign with four commercials planned for the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads feature Allstate agents, claims adjustors and  
investigators who recount their own experiences on the job to 
demonstrate their personal commitment to the company's customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ads retain the longtime theme ``You're in good hands  
with Allstate'' but each ad ends with the featured employee adding, 
``Mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh Floyd, spokesman for Northbrook, Ill.-based Allstate,  
said the telecast was chosen for the campaign kickoff because it 
draws ``a pretty attractive audience'' both in terms of raw numbers 
and the type of people who buy home and auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The new MasterCard ad will be the fourth with a baseball theme  
in the ``priceless'' campaign from the agency McCann-Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
	The card provider from Purchase, N.Y., showed a father taking  
his 11-year-old son to a ballgame for the ``priceless'' chance for 
real conversation in the first ad in the series in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, it was the ``priceless'' experience of taking a  
Little League team to its first big league ballgame. Also last 
year, another MasterCard ad suggested that witnessing a 
record-breaking home run by Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals 
or Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs during their historic chase that 
shattered Roger Maris' single-season home run mark was 
``priceless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new commercial opens with a mother using a camcorder to show  
her husband and two children leaving for a ballgame. ``Camcorder: 
$400,'' the ad says. The ad shows Dad and the kids inside the car 
as they drive to the stadium and later as they head to their seats. 
``Three hour tape: $7,'' the ad says. ``Extra battery: $25.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some seats. Aaron and Mays are in street clothes sitting with  
the kids. ``Home movies with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays: 
priceless,'' the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
	As in each of the 20-some ads in the series, the commercial then  
adds, ``There are some things money can't buy, for everything else 
there's MasterCard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also notes that five MasterCard users will win tickets to a  
World Series game and sit with legends like Aaron, Mays, Brett and 
Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to have players who inarguably would be considered  
legends of baseball and had a high recognition factor,'' said Larry 
Flanagan, head of marketing for MasterCard. ``These are pretty 
recognizable guys even for people who aren't baseball fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who would Aaron and Mays want to sit with to watch a World  
Series game? Aaron told MasterCard publicists it would be baseball 
legends Lou Gehrig and Jackie Robinson; Mays said Robinson, Ted 
Williams and Joe DiMaggio.

<HEADLINE> Woodbridge Pulls Out of Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Doubles specialist Todd Woodbridge  
broke up the Woodies for this week's Davis Cup quarterfinal against 
the United States when he withdrew from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain John Newcombe said Woodbridge, who forms one of the  
world's top doubles units with Mark Woodforde, decided to withdraw 
Monday because of a minor arm injury and a loss of form. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe said he would have preferred Woodbridge stayed in the  
team but said the player felt he would let his teammates down in 
the tie at Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodbridge was replaced by Sandon Stolle, who is ranked No. 3 in  
the world in doubles, but Patrick Rafter might be called in to 
partner Woodforde or Stolle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian team is already missing U.S. Open finalist Mark  
Philippoussis, who withdrew from his Wimbledon quarterfinal against 
Pete Sampras with a knee injury. The tie starts Friday with 
Australia facing a strong American team of Todd Martin, Jim 
Courier, Pete Sampras and Alex O'Brien.

	India, Pakistan Agree To End Fight  
</P>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- Top military commanders from India  
and Pakistan agreed today on a plan to end the fighting in 
India-controlled Kashmir, easing concerns of a wider war between 
the two nuclear-armed neighbors. The plan calls for a withdrawal of 
Islamic guerillas from the region, and an end to Indian airstrikes, 
artillery fire and ground assaults in Kashmir's Himalayan peaks. 
India accuses Pakistan of orchestrating the occupation of Himalayan 
peaks on the Indian side of a 1972 cease-fire line, and charges 
that Pakistan has sent its own soldiers and Afghan mercenaries 
across the line.

	Congo Rebels Vow To Continue Fight  
</P>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Congolese rebels vowed today to keep  
fighting despite the signing of a peace accord to end Africa's 
biggest ongoing war. The accord was signed late yesterday by 
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, the target of the 11-month old 
rebel campaign, along with his foreign military allies and the 
countries that have backed the rebels, Uganda and Rwanda. One of 
the major accomplishments of the peace accord was to assure Rwanda 
that ethnic Hutu militiamen implicated in the 1994 genocide in that 
country and hiding across the border in Congo would be located and 
handed over to an international war crimes tribunal.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. peacekeeping forces came under  
fire several times over the weekend in Kosovo, evidence that 
tensions are still simmering in the war-torn Serbian province. No 
Americans were hurt in the shootings yesterday in southeastern 
Kosovo, but U.S. soldiers believe they shot and killed one 
assailant and seriously wounded another, U.S. Capt. Paul Swiergosz 
said. Meanwhile, Russian troops faced a protest Sunday by ethnic 
Albanians who distrust them and from Italian peacekeepers who 
refused to let them through a checkpoint.

cuts, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today. He said 
Clinton would support a $250 billion cut. The GOP alternative, 
Summers said, would threaten ``the progress we've made toward 
paying down debt ... would put at risk core government, everything 
from the national parks to the FBI to medical research.'' Summers 
succeeded Robert Rubin on July 2.

convention of a new tool designed for stealth invasions of networks 
operated by Microsoft Windows. The tool's authors, an irreverent 
group named Cult of the Dead Cow, or CDC, and other hackers 
attending the seventh annual ``DefCon'' convention in Las Vegas 
charged that Microsoft has refused to address gaping security holes 
in Windows. By exploiting those vulnerabilities, hackers hope to 
force the world's largest software company to repair them.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The raunchy teen comedy ``American Pie''

The movie, about a bunch of high school guys trying to lose their 
virginity by graduation, knocked Will Smith's critically savaged 
``Wild Wild West'' into second place, while ``Arlington Road,'' the 
only other movie opening in wide release, debuted with a 
disappointing $7.4 million, industry estimates showed today. ``Wild 
Wild West'' lost a devastating 40 percent of its audience after two 
weeks, earning $16.7 million for a total of $76.4 million.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Maddux won his fourth straight decision and  
Ryan Klesko homered twice, leading the Atlanta Braves over the 
Boston Red Sox 8-1 today. Maddux (10-5) allowed one run and six

Young Award winner has allowed three earned runs in 35 2-3 innings 
(a 0.76 ERA), dropping his season ERA from 4.64 to 3.40. Boston 
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, voted to start Tuesday's All-Star game 
at Fenway Park, missed his ninth straight game because of a 
strained groin but said he'll be able to play Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
	She received an Angel Award Saturday night at the organization's  
10th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about hope, kindness and a connection with one  
another,'' Taylor told the audience, which included actresses 
Shirley MacLaine and Camryn Manheim and singer Barry Manilow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth Taylor is simply the finest choice to receive this  
award,'' said John Gile, project director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only has she been supporting Project Angel Food since day  
one, but she has also led the way around the world to break down 
barriers in the fight against AIDS,'' Gile said. ``We just love 
her, and this is our way of saying thanks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, the program has served more than 7,000

<HEADLINE> NAACP To Sue Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP will sue handgun manufacturers,  
distributors and importers, seeking restrictions on the marketing 
and sale of firearms in hopes of keeping guns from criminals, 
sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources within the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity 
that a formal announcement of the suit will come Monday from NAACP 
President Kweisi Mfume at the group's 90th annual convention. The 
move would put the nation's largest civil rights group in league 
with cities like New Orleans, Chicago, Cleveland and Boston which 
have sued the firearms industry in hopes of curbing street and 
school yard violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume declined to comment on the planned lawsuit, first reported  
in Time magazine this week. Sources at the convention said no 
monetary damages will be sought. The lawsuit will instead seek 
court orders that will force gun makers to better monitor where 
guns are distributed and to limit multiple purchases by 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	In February at a meeting in Washington, Mfume said the NAACP was  
considering such a suit. ``We represent a significant constituency 
that is disproportionately affected by gun violence,'' Mfume said 
then. ``The time has come for us to look at the proliferation of 
handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a federal jury in New York returned a $4  
million verdict based upon a new strategy by plaintiffs -- that the 
industry's negligence in marketing and distribution allowed weapons 
to flow illegally to states with strict anti-gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's intention to sue reflects a widespread frustration  
among policy makers with gun proliferation and lethal shooting 
attacks in schoolyards, most recently in Littleton, Colo., and 
Conyers Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	During the recent U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in New  
Orleans, a bipartisan group called on House leaders to enact a 
strict gun safety bill. More than 100 mayors signed a letter to 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., asking that Congress raise 
the minimum age for gun purchases and require background checks for 
all gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the suits said recent government studies show that  
greater oversight by the gun industry could help keep firearms out 
of criminal hands. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms study reported  
that 51 percent of the guns used in crimes by people aged 18 to 24 
were purchased illegally over the last three years from licensed 
dealers by people acting as intermediaries for the real owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-gun groups have fired back by lobbying state legislatures to  
pass laws prohibiting such suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in an address Sunday evening to NAACP delegates,  
National Board Chairman Julian Bond outlined a campaign to combat 
racism, save affirmative action, register voters and work against 
police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said that while the black poverty rate is decreasing, more  
blacks are in college than ever and that black employment and home 
ownership are increasing, not all is right in black America. 
</P>
<P>
	Black families still have less than 10 percent the net wealth of  
white families and black median income is 40 percent less than 
white income. That gap hasn't narrowed in the last 25 years, Bond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our world is so much better than was true when the century  
began, but it is still a world apart from the world in which most 
of white America lives,'' Bond said.

<HEADLINE> Many Mentally Ill Americans Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's prisons and jails held an  
estimated 283,800 mentally ill inmates in 1998, and they were more 
likely than other offenders to have committed violent offenses, the 
Justice Department reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of a department study cautioned that the results do  
not mean necessarily the mentally ill are more violent than others 
but that the violence figure could be skewed by other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first comprehensive study of mental illness behind bars,  
the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics also estimated that 
an additional 547,800 mentally ill offenders have been released on 
probation into communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers based the estimates on interviews with a random  
sample of state and federal prison inmates, jail inmates and 
probationers. They defined the mentally ill as those who reported 
their own illnesses, and, to compensate for underreporting, those 
who had ever spent a night in a mental hospital. They did not count 
anyone committed to a hospital after a verdict of not guilty by 
reason of insanity or anyone civilly committed to a mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In all four groups studied, the mentally ill were more likely  
than other offenders to have committed violent offenses: 
</P>
<P>
	--In state prisons, 53 percent of mentally ill inmates, compared  
with 46 percent of the other inmates, were locked up for violent 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among federal inmates, 33 percent of the mentally ill but only  
13 percent of other inmates had violent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among local jail inmates, 30 percent of the mentally ill,  
compared with 26 percent of the others, had violent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among probationers, 28 percent of the mentally ill, but only 18  
percent of the others, reported their current offense was violent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not mean that mentally ill offenders are more  
violent than other offenders,'' said the study's author, bureau 
statistician Paula Ditton. 
</P>
<P>
	Other causes could produce these figures, Ditton said: Police  
could have an easier time catching violent criminals who are 
mentally ill than those who are not; juries might be more willing 
to convict mentally ill defendants than others; or judges might be 
more inclined to sentence mentally ill violent offenders to prison 
than other violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, a 1997 study in Pittsburgh, funded by the National  
Institute of Mental Health and the MacArthur Foundation, found 
that, among those without substance abuse problems, released mental 
patients are no more likely to engage in violence than other 
residents living in the same neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Substance abuse increased the level of violence among both  
groups, but the violence was significantly higher among recently 
released patients with substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditton said she found the total of more than 830,000 mentally  
ill Americans either behind bars or on probation ``startlingly 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said additional research would be needed to learn how the  
total got so large. She speculated that some mental patients 
released from hospitals to live in communities, part of a movement 
that began in the 1970s to shift patients from institutions, may 
have ended up behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	More than twice the percentage of mentally ill inmates reported  
prior physical or sexual abuse than did other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Among state inmates, 37 percent of the mentally ill and only 15  
percent of the others were abused before going to prison. Among 
females, 78 percent of the mentally ill had been abused compared to 
51 percent of the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditton also noted that homelessness was more than double among  
mentally ill inmates than among others. For mentally ill inmates, 
20 percent of those in state prisons and 30 percent of those in 
jails were homeless in the year before imprisonment, compared to 9 
percent of the others in state prisons and 17 percent of the others 
in jails. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimates of mentally ill inmates and probationers as of  
mid-1998 included 16 percent of state prison inmates, local jail 
inmates and probationers and 7 percent of the much smaller total of 
federal prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the totals were based on self-reporting, they cannot be  
compared to mental illness rates in the general population, Ditton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in National Institute of Mental Health studies in 1994 and  
1998, a Northwestern University psychiatry professor, Linda Teplin, 
had interviewers independently assess the mental illnesses of Cook 
County, Ill., jail inmates. The inmates were found to have rates of 
mental illness two to four times higher than the general 
population, depending upon the type of disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Teplin found 9 percent of male inmates and 18.5 percent of  
females had serious disorders, like schizophrenia, proportions she 
described as huge. She said the female figure was higher because 
``only the most messed-up women end up in jail, the drug users and 
prostitutes,'' and criminal activity is more widespread among men.

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Coke Stacks Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A demolition crew on Sunday toppled six coke  
stacks along the Monongahela River, long-time symbols of this 
city's industrial heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The destruction of the stacks of LTV Corp.'s now-closed coke  
plant signals an end to the days when steel mills and industrial 
plants choked the banks of the city's three rivers, drawing people 
-- many of them immigrants -- to work and live in the communities 
that sprang up there.

	Coke is coal heated in an oven to remove the gasses; it burns  
with intense heat and is used in the steel-making process. 
</P>
<P>
	The first five stacks went easily, 15 pounds of explosives  
weakened the base of each. The sixth stack held on, gasping a cloud 
of smoke from its top but standing firm in denial. Workers rounded 
up more explosives and finally knocked it over late in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's just that people don't like to see part of their  
history go,'' said Tom Berkins, who grew up in Hazelwood, a 
Pittsburgh neighborhood in the shadow of the stacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkins, 44, now lives in Oakland, Calif., and works as an  
environmental engineer. His father worked in the steel industry and 
Berkins remembers looking out his bedroom window to see smoke 
belching from the stacks -- the thick sulfur smell creeping into his 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, he has returned to Pittsburgh to visit his  
parents and watched as the steel mills fell one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clean air and clean water, but it's taken its toll on  
the economy. The steel mills obviously were the lifeblood of this 
area.''

	Congo Rebels Vow To Keep Fighting  
</P>
<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Defiant Congolese rebels pledged today to  
keep fighting despite the signing of an accord to end Africa's 
biggest ongoing war. The accord was signed late yesterday by 
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, the target of the 11-month old 
rebel campaign, along with his foreign military allies and the 
countries that have backed the rebels, Uganda and Rwanda. The 
signers agreed to stop fighting and form a joint military 
commission and start disarming independent militias.

	EREZ CROSSING POINT, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister  
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised today to 
bring peace by rebuilding trust and quickly carrying out 
U.S.-brokered accords. Barak pleased the Palestinians by clearly 
acceding to their demand that he implement the U.S.-brokered Wye 
River accords, frozen by Netanyahu within weeks of their signing 
last October. Arafat emphatically promised to contain terror, a 
point of contention with the previous government.

	India, Pakistan To End Kashmir Fight  
</P>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- A plan to end fighting between  
India and Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region is easing 
concerns of a wider war between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. 
The plan calls for a withdrawal of Islamic guerillas from Kashmir, 
and an end to Indian airstrikes, artillery fire and ground assaults 
in Kashmir's Himalayan peaks. Both nations claim control of 
Kashmir, which both countries border in the north.

	NAACP To Sue Gun Industry  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP will sue handgun manufacturers,  
distributors and importers, hoping that new restrictions in the 
ways firearms are marketed and sold will help keep guns from 
criminals, sources said today. Sources within the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People told The 
Associated Press that a formal announcement of the suit will come 
tomorrow. The move would put the civil rights group in league with 
cities like New Orleans, Chicago, Cleveland and Boston which have 
sued the firearms industry in hopes of curbing street and school 
yard violence.

	Gas Prices Jump Nearly 2 Cents  
</P>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices jumped nearly 2 cents  
in the past two weeks because of rising crude oil prices and 
increased demand, an industry analyst said today. The national 
weighted average, including all grades and taxes, was $1.2153 
Friday, up 1.93 cents a gallon from the previous survey on June 25, 
said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 
gas stations nationwide. A main factor has been more expensive 
crude oil, which has risen from $13 a barrel at the beginning of 
the year to $20 now.

	Nev. Battles 50,000-Acre Wildfire

	MIDAS, Nev. (AP) -- High humidity and calmer winds today helped  
firefighters in their battle against a wildfire that has consumed 
more than 50,000 acres of dry brush. Despite the progress, fire 
officials said don't expect to contain the blaze until Wednesday. 
``It's one of the biggest wildfires in the West so far this 
summer,'' fire information officer Nick Zufelt said. Investigators 
had not determined the cause of the fire, which began Thursday, but 
they believe it was started by man.

	Hackers Launch New Invasion Tool

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Computer security companies updated their  
virus-detection software today after the launch at a hackers 
convention of a new tool designed for stealth invasions of networks 
operated by Microsoft Windows. The tool's authors, an irreverent 
group named Cult of the Dead Cow, or CDC, and other hackers 
attending the seventh annual ``DefCon'' convention in Las Vegas 
charged that Microsoft has refused to address gaping security holes 
in Windows. By exploiting those vulnerabilities, hackers hope to 
force the world's largest software company to repair them.

	Bottenfield Wins 14th for Cards  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Kent Bottenfield pitched six innings to  
become the National League's first 14-game winner as the St. Louis 
Cardinals beat the San Francisco Giants 5-4 today to avoid a 
three-game sweep. J.D. Drew's two-run homer began the scoring in a 
five-run first inning. Fernando Tatis and Edgar Renteria added RBI 
doubles and Darren Bragg had a run-scoring single in the inning. 
Bottenfield (14-3) became the first St. Louis pitcher since Joaquin 
Andujar in 1985 to win 14 games before the All-Star break.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Wife's a Bigger Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says that while issues like  
health-care reform are important, his wife's likely run for the 
Senate from New York is a better story. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a better story,'' Clinton said in an interview with New  
York Times columnist Bob Herbert. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Clinton added, ``this is an important story, what we've  
been doing these last three days. I'm so thrilled. I hope I can 
persuade them to adopt the legislation by the end of the year ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president made his remarks during his recent trip to  
California to promote his ideas for changing the Medicare program, 
including ways to help older Americans pay for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said he'd be happy to live in New York after  
he leaves the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to divide my time between New York and Arkansas no  
matter what happens,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is seriously considering  
seeking the seat that Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., will 
vacate when he retires in 2000.
