Liberian soccer star with assault and slander and demanded
compensation of one million U.S. dollars, reports said here on

<HEADLINE> Nepal Launches National Program Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepal today launched a
nation-wide program to fight against polio when Queen Aishwarya
initiated the National Immunization Day (NID) here by
administering polio drops to five baby children.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has decided to observe two national
immunization days, respectively on December 6 and January 17 next
year, throughout the country to feed 3.3 million children under
the age of five in the country with two polio drops.
</P>
<P>
The NID program, recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO), is targeted to eradicate polio in Nepal by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the two national immunization days, about 80,000 health
workers and volunteers will be mobilized at some 20,000
vaccination centers for distributing and administering oral polio
vaccine drops to children, Nepali health officials said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said today at the inaugural
function for the NID that the government is seriously working to
protect every child from polio.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the cooperation from all sectors in the
country to make the national anti-polio program a success.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Home Ministry has declared Friday as a public
holiday with the objective of ensuring maximum participation in
the polio immunization program.
</P>
<P>
Nepal, where an average 200 children are affected by polio
every year, is the only country in south Asia that has not
conducted the NID program so far, who sources said.
</P>
<P>
Latest WHO statistics show that 60 percent of the total polio
victims in the world were found in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and
Nepal.

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 5 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
of South Africa said in Pretoria on Thursday his government is
making great efforts to build more houses for the low living
standard people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony of handing over keys to new house
owners, Mandela said that a national housing program, which is to
build one million houses for the low income people within five
years, is on track.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said more than 139,000 houses have been built
throughout the country in the past two and half years. This is
the greatest number of low-cost houses under construction in the
histroy of South Africa, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the Housing Ministry will spend all its housing
budget left by the end of this financial year.
</P>

nationally each month had increased from around 500 Rands (about
110 U.S. dollars) last year to 6000 Rands (about 1300 U.S.
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
"That means around 30,000 people a month are now benefiting
from the subsidy scheme," Mandela said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Meeting With Netanyahu Frank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu was frank and direct.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who is in london to attend an international meeting on
Bosnia, said their meeting dealt with Netanyahu's stance regarding
various tracks of the Middle East peace process and Israel's real
future policy towards the process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's made the remarks in an interview with Sawt el-Arab
radio over phone, which was broadcast this morning.
</P>
<P>
Moussa met Netanyahu over an hour-long meeting on the fringes
of an European security summit in Lisbon Tuesday. He delivered a
letter to Netanyhu from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
received a written reply in return.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat said that he expounded to the Israeli
leader Egypt's stance regarding the stalemate of the peace process
as well as its reactions to the recent Israeli practices. "Before
talking about regional cooperation peace should be achieved on
various tracks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has recently stepped up its attacks on the Israeli
government's expansion of Jewish settlements, which it warned
would bring about collapse of the whole peace process as a result.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the British Sky TV Wednesday, Moussa urged
Netanyahu to reach a deal with the Palestinians on the
long-delayed Israeli partial troop withdrawal from the West Bank
city of Hebron, adding that the ball was in Netanyhu's court.
</P>
<P>
He said that what is needed is a just and peaceful solution
between the Arabs and the Israelis and vise versa.
</P>
<P>
Such a solution, he said, demands that the two parties work
together and offer concessions to reach a deal on living together
as neighbours.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the Palestinian issue was a key
subject in the Middle East conflict, adding that the Egyptian and
Arab public and governments were concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Israeli leader to thoroughly consider his
steps and decisons because any miscalculated step will make a bad
impression on the Arab public.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Netanyahu said that time is right
for him to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the
dispute over Hebron, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks as he flew home Wednesday night,
following his European tour which took him to Ireland, Portugal
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the agreement on the long-delayed Israeli
army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron is complete,
and what is now needed, is a "decision on the part of the leaders
to implement it."
</P>
<P>
In response to Netanyahu's call for summit, Hassan Asfour,
Palestinian negotiator for the Hebron talks Thursday linked the
holding of such a meeting with making serious progress and accused
the prime minister of trying to make a public relations maneuver.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, he said, "believes the time has not come for such a
summit because there is no progress."

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- US oil giant Mobil
corporation is to operate business in importing, manufacturing and
marketing petroleum products in Nepal by setting up a joint

<HEADLINE> US Productivity in 3rd Quarter Posts Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Productivity in the U.S.
fell by 0.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter of this
year, the first decline since late 1995, the U.S. Labor Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The latest adjustment of the nonfarm productivity -- defined as
output per number of hours worked -- was far weaker than the
initial estimated gain of 0.2 percent announced last month,
reflecting slower U.S. economic growth in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The decline was the first since productivity fell 1.2 percent
during the final three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
It followed annualized advances of 0.5 percent during the
second quarter and 1.7 percent during the first three months of
the year. The rates are adjusted for seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
The decline of productivity was inconsistent with the pace of
economic growth. The U.S. Commerce Department reported last month
that the economy slowed to just a 2 percent annual growth rate
during the third quarter, less than half the 4.7 percent pace in
the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, a key to Americans' standard of living, has been
blamed for stagnant personal incomes for more than two decades.
Increases have averaged about 1 percent since 1973, just one-third
the growth rate of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that output increased at a 1.8 percent rate in
the third quarter, slower than its initial 2.3 percent estimate
and well below the 4.8 percent advance in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The number of hours worked grew at a 2.1 percent rate,
unchanged from the original report but down sharply from 4.1
percent in the April-June period.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing productivity was unrevised at 6.3 percent, much
stronger than the 2.9 percent gain in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
But total business productivity, including farming, was flat
during the period, rather than posting a 0.3 percent gain as first
reported. It had grown at a 1.2 percent rate from April through
June.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Attracts More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Zimbabwe
during the first 10 months of this year exceeded the combined total
in 1994 and 1995, a leading bank said here today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic bulletin, Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Ltd said
investment worth more than 880 million US Dollars had been
approved, with the potential of creating over 11,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Barclays said although the mining sector accounted for the largest
share of foreign investment this year at 38 percent, there had also
been a sharp increase in the number of approvals in the tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
''During the past 10 months, tourism approvals have amounted to
240 million US Dollars, or 27 percent of 885 million US Dollars
worth of foreign investment approved by the Zimbabwe Investment
Centre (zic),'' Barclays said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said between 1994 and October this year, the ZIC had
approved job-creating projects worth over 1.5 billion US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Expects Cyprus Problem to Be Solved in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A European Union envoy
expressed the hope here today that a solution to the Cyprus
problem would be reached in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Larnaca airport shortly before his departure
after a week-long visit to the island, Kester Heaslip Heaslip said
great progress had been made during 1996 and a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem ought to be reached in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the EU envoy held separate talks with
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash on bringing the two leaders to a direct negotiation
table.
</P>
<P>
Heaslip said that both Clerides and Denktash hoped for direct
talks to take place early in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The EU representative held also a series of meetings with
politicians and businessmen from both sides on the island in order
to prepare his report on Cyprus to be submitted to the EU Council
of Ministers. Currently, Ireland holds the presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the two sides have
been held on and off in the past 22 years, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international peace effort aims at bringing the
two sides into direct talks to reach a solution which envisages
a bizonal, bicommunal federation on the island.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urged to Protect Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. government official today
urged enforcement of Greece's 1993 copyright laws and the 1995
media law to effectively combat piracy of intellectual property
rights in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Deputy assistant U.S. trade representative Joe Papovich, who is
holding talks here with the Greek government on intellectual
property rights piracy, told a press conference that piracy of
U.S. intellectual property in Greece was estimated at 66 million
U.S. dollars last year for the motion picture (TV 60 million
dollars and videos 1 million dollars) and music (compositions)
industry, another 31 million dollars in losses for the computer
programs industry (10 million dollars in business software, 21
million dollars in entertainment software), and a further 5
million dollars to the publishing industry (books).
</P>
<P>
Papovich said lax intellectual property rights protection also
hurt Greece, as it deterred prospective foreign investors who felt
their intellectual property rights would not be adequately
protected.
</P>
<P>
He noted that small rural television stations were the main
culprits, rather than the large stations broadcasting nationwide
and the Athens-based stations.
</P>
<P>
Greece was first placed on a "watch list" of transgressor
countries in 1990, and upped to the "priority watch list" at the
end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Papovich, who was in Greece two years ago for similar talks
with the government, said that since then a major step forward had
been taken with the enactment of the August 1995 media law, which
he said provided a solid basis and effective provisions for
protection of intellectual property rights, which included patents
and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, enforcement of that law was negligible, and
the problem still remained.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Unwilling to Punish S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce
Deputy Minister Obert Mpofu today dismissed calls by industrialists
to adopt retaliatory trade measures against South Africa, saying the
move would derail negotiations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mpofu said negotiations between the two countries had reached an
advanced stage, with more than 75 percent of the key areas having
already been resolved.
</P>
<P>
''That is the view of industry but we feel that the South African
government has been quite responsive to the key issues in our
negotiations and that the negotiating teams should be allowed to
finish their negotiations,'' Mpofu said.
</P>
<P>
''Government position is, therefore, that negotiations are still
on course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
On how soon an agreement would be signed, he said that depended on
how early the negotiating teams agreed on outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Agreement is yet to be reached on agriculture which is of
paramount importance to Zimbabwe whose economy is agriculture-driven.
</P>
<P>
Among the major hurdles causing delays in the issue is the
question of tariffs, with both sides demanding specific clauses.
</P>
<P>
''We want an arrangement that is all-inclusive because it wouldn't
make sense to have a disjointed agreement,'' he said. enditem

PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of people killed in

<HEADLINE> Jiang's South Asia Visit Complete Success: Editorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to South Asia has marked a new stage in the development of
good-neighborliness and mutually-beneficial cooperation between
China and South Asian countries, says an editorial to be published
by the official People's Daily Friday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the visit as a "complete success," the editorial
says the visit has enhanced mutual understanding and mutual trust
between China and the Philippines, India, Pakistan and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which mapped out the direction for the development
of relations between China and the four nations, will produce an
active influence on peace and development in Asia and the whole
world, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Jiang paid state visits to the four countries between November
26 and December 5 after attending the fourth informal leadership
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on
November 25.
</P>
<P>
He exchanged views and reached wide-ranging consensus with
leaders of the four countries on bilateral relations, and
international and regional issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's visits, China signed with the four countries 17
agreements, covering a wide range of issues, including politics,
sea transportation, the environment, the economy and the fight
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
China and South and Southeast Asian countries, which have had
similar historical experiences, are friends indeed, the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
They have sympathized with and supported each other, be it in
their erstwhile fight for national liberation and independence or
in their current quest to maintain state sovereignty and for
faster economic development.
</P>
<P>
China and these countries have played an increasingly important
role in international affairs. As early as the 1950s, China and
India, together with other countries, put forward the famous Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which provide the basic
principles governing nation-to-nation relations and establish an
important foundation for the setting up of a new international
politico-economic order, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
China and South and Southeast Asian countries are all members
of the developing world facing the historic tasks of developing
their economies and improving their peoples' livelihood. They all
need a peaceful and stable international environment and in
particular a favourable environment among their neighors.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that it is China's sincere wish and
unswerving policy to solidify its friendly and good-neighborly
ties with neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's South Asia Visit Complete Success: Editorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- In a speech during his visit to
Pakistan, Jiang said in a speech that China is ready to join hands
with South Asian countries in building long-term, stable and 21st
century-oriented friendly and good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he put forward a five-point proposal to foster
closer ties with South Asia -- "broadening exchanges and deepening
the traditional friendship; respecting each other and handing down
friendly and good-neighborly relations from generation to
generation; promoting mutual benefit and common development;
properly handling existing disputes in the spirit of seeking
common ground while setting aside differences; and working
together towards a better future through unity and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
His proposal, which not only conforms to the essence of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the requirements of
the times, but also to the common wishes of the Chinese people and
peoples of South Asian countries, has been widely acclaimed, the
editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
China sincerely hopes that South Asia will enjoy long-term
stability and vigorous economic development; that South Asian
countries will treat one another as equals, live harmoniously,
and settle their disputes peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that China will, as it always has done,
support the initiative for the establishment of a South Asia
Nuclear-Free Zone and an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace, and support
all efforts designed to serve peace, stability and development in
the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
China believes that so long as all South Asian countries stick
to a path of development suited to their respective national
conditions, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
in handling bilateral relations, and enhance unity and develop
cooperation, then stability and unceasing development will be
maintained in the region, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Stability and development in South Asia are undoubtedly
conducive to peace and prosperity in Asia.
</P>
<P>
China, which is now dedicated to pushing forward its socialist
modernization and will unswervingly pursue a foreign policy of
peace and self-determination, firmly opposes hegemonism and power
politics and will never seek hegemonism, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
China is willing, on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, to live harmoniously with South Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The editorial added that China is also willing to make joint
efforts to promote stability and development in Asia and the whole
world, and to work for a glorious future for Asia and the world as
a whole.

<HEADLINE> Reduction of Population Growth Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Nothing much could be done in
Zambia to halt enviornmental degradation without first solving
issues of poverty and rapid polulation growth.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a paper presented by Lubinda Aongola,
an official of the Ministry of Enviornment and Natural Resources,
at a Wildlife Conservation Society of Zambia workshop here today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that poverty and population growth have been
identified as the major factors to environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Aongola said that women and children, especially, suffer from
disproportionately in-door air pollution that results from
burning unclean but affordable energy sources. ''Some firewoods
contain particles of four to five times above World Health
Organization peak guide lines, yet women and children are exposed
to these daily,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Aongola said the Zambian population is growing at an annual
rate of 3.8 percent, faster than the economic growth rate
envisaged by the government. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Africa to Improve Economic Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on African countries to improve the running of their
economies to prevent international financial institutions from
withdrawing aid.
</P>
<P>
"The good running of economies is the only right response to the
threat of withdrawal" of aid by donor countries, Chirac was
quoted as saying at the 19th Franco-African summit which opened
in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech addressed to 49 African leaders, Chirac said that
economic development of African countries is the only possible way
to stop what he called "the problems of excessive immigration" to
France and other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Africa should now capture the confidence of entrepreneurs and
investors, both at home and abroad," Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
He said that when African countries commit themselves to the
difficult task of economic reform, they need more than ever law
and order, public aid and confidence in their economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Africa has often presented an image of
violence and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic development, the crisis in the Great Lakes
region of Africa and the successor to U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali are also on the agenda of the summit.
</P>
<P>
France is apparently losing its traditional influence among
African countries, compounded by the failure of its diplomatic
manoeuvres to launch a multinational ground force to eastern
Zaire.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Clash with Mutinous Soldiers in Bangui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- French troops fought rebel
government soldiers in the capital of the Central African Republic
early today for the first time since the army mutiny started last
month, the French Defense Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Servent, advisor to Defense Minister Charles Millon,
said French troops shot back after the rebels launched four
rockets at a French four-star hotel in Bangui.
</P>
<P>
He said the French troops were reacting in "legitimate
defense," after two of the four rockets hit the Sofitel Hotel at
03:15 local time (01:15 GMT), which was guarded by French soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, an officer with the mutinous soldiers told Radio
France Internationale today that the rockets were fired by
government forces loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the hotel, close to the French embassy, had been
badly hit but there were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) agency said that the attack this
morning signaled an escalation of the two-week mutiny in the
Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
French troops, based in the former colony under bilateral
accords, have been protecting the presidential palace and other
key sites but until now had not intervened in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting also went on this morning between the rebels
and government troops in Bangui, as the rebels tried to swoop down
on the highly fortified presidential palace, AFP reported.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched their attack in the center of Bangui from
both the west and east sides of the city, where they have been
controlling the district of Petevo in southwest Bangui, and the
Kassai Barracks on the east side of the city.
</P>
<P>
But the situation in Bangui was reported to be calm by noon
today.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny, which began on November 16 and is the third this
year, has shifted from grievances over pay and status to rebel
demands for the resignation of President Patasse. Tribal disputes
are also at the root of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are suspected of allegiance to former president
Andre Kolingba, who was defeated by Patasse in multiparty
elections in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Education Minister Resigns Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Education Minister
Edmund Garwe resigned today, two days after admitting his
daughter was responsible for the leak of a Zimbabwe Junior
Certificate (ZJC) examination paper at the Dominican Convent High
School in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Citing what he said is the ''sham and tarnish'' that the leak
caused, Garwe said he had requested President Robert Mugabe to
relieve him of his post to which he was appointed six months ago.
</P>
<P>
''I think it was only honourable for me to take this course,''
Garwe said. It was a solo decision which he made on Wednesday
night and no pressure had been bought to him from any quarter, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Garwe accepted that his resignation is necessary to save the
integrity of the country's schools examinations, some of which
are now being localised from British universities.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Garwe admitted in a newspaper interview that his
daughter had accessed a ZJC examination paper which he had taken
home after a meeting to discuss printing errors in the paper.
</P>
<P>
After the leak was discovered, the Zimbabwean minister
voluntarily withdrew the girl from sitting the examination.
</P>
<P>
Garwe had been a former envoy to Nairobi and Washington, Chief
of Protocol in the President's Office and Governor for
Mashonaland East Province before his appointment to cabinet.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time since independence that a minister has
left cabinet voluntarily after being involved in a scandal.
Three ministers resigned in 1989 after being implicated in
scandal involving the abuse of a facility to acquire scarce new
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Pays Tribute to Nurses' Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 5 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela today
paid tribute to nurses' contribution to the health and well-being of
the South African nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the Democratic Nursing Association
of South Africa (DENOSA) in Pretoria, Mandela said Marilyn Lehana
and many others who had perished in the course of duty are
"heroes and heroines." "We salute your all."
</P>
<P>
Lehana, a 46-year-old nurse at a private clinic in northern
Johannesburg, became South Africa's first Ebola victim when she died
on November 24 after contracting the deadly virus while nursing a
Gabonese doctor, who had treated Ebola patients in that country.
</P>
<P>
Describing the launch of DENOSA as an important step forward in the
process of nation-building, transformation and reconciliation, Mandela
said nursing, perhaps more than most professions, was divided by
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
As a united force, DENOSA could play a central role in transforming
the national health system, especially in improving access to primary
health care, said the president. enditem

<HEADLINE> London Conference Urges Bosnia to Stick to Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Peace Implementation
Conference on Bosnia ended here this afternoon, calling on Bosnian
leaders to comply strictly with the Bosnia peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the final press conference, British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said Bosnia leaders "can be in no doubt
that the international community's willingness to devote further
human and financial resources to their country is dependent upon a
strengthened commitment from them to implementation of the peace
agreement in all areas."
</P>
<P>
The final document, adopted at the end of the two-day
conference, said the objectives for the next stage was to "build
upon the achievements of the past 12 months; to consolidate
reconciliation and economic, political and social regeneration; to
take the radical steps necessary to restore a multi-ethnic Bosnia
and Herzegovina to economic health and prosperity; and to enable
it to take its place in the region and in Europe."
</P>
<P>
In a bid to fulfill these objectives, the delegates agreed to
"strengthen the role of the High Representative, in particular by
giving him an enhanced role on economic reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
A package of political and economic measures would be taken to
secure proper freedom of movement for people, goods and services
throughout Bosnia, the final document said.
</P>
<P>
Another part of the future action plan was to take practical
measures to encourage Bosnian refugees to return home and
strengthen the International Police Task Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Britain has announced that it would provide up to 30 police
officers to the international police force.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 56 countries and international
organizations attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Calls on Farmers to End Road Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today called on protesting farmers to immediately end
their eight-day blockade of roads throughout the country, saying
it was badly hurting the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said the farmers' action harmed the vital interests of
other branches, trampled on citizens' rights and posed a threat to
the employment and income of other workers.
</P>
<P>
If this type of labor action continues, he warned, it will
cause a chain reaction which will be "paid" by all taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' resort to road blockades reflected "the
anti-democratic attitude of a few who believe that with take-overs
and anti-social actions they can coerce the government into giving
them benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances will the government accept such
behavior," Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' nationwide roadblocks have caused widespread
disruption to road and rail traffic throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' demands include higher produce prices and
increased subsidies, favorable debt settlements, cheaper fuel to
cut the cost of production and lower prices for fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier made some concessions to the farmers'
demand, which include a 40-drachma (about 0.17 U.S. dollar)
increase for per kilogram of cotton, favorable terms for
settlement of outstanding debts and a freezing of current debts,
but said it was unable to satisfy the farmers's demands in their
entirety, which would cost the state more than 1 trillion
drachmas (4.35 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the farmers' representatives in Larissa said they
wanted a meeting with Simitis to explain the problems in the
agricultural sector and rejected any suggestion that their
protests were politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the farmers' coordinating committee called
on the farmers to increase the roadblocks, a call apparently heard
in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace where all road connections between
Greece and Bulgaria and Greece and Turkey have been severed.

<HEADLINE> Botswana, Namibia Discuss Water Supply Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Botswana
and Namibia will meet in Gaborone at the weekend to discuss plans
by Namibia to draw water from Okavango, a River shared by the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has raised concern over the plan of Namibia, Radio
Botswana reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian delegation is expected to present a feasibility
study on plans to draw 20 million cubic meters of water from
Okavango River each year.
</P>
<P>
Drought-prone Namibia plans to use the water to supply its
capital Windhoek and the drier central areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has opposed the plan, citing likely adverse effects
for its tourist attraction center at Maun in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Botswana also said diverting such a huge amount of water will
damage the Okavango's wetlands in its territory.
</P>
<P>
Authorities from the two countries have agreed on the need to
carry out environmental studies to determine the suitability of

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Market Flexibility Leads to Pay Inequality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The flexibility of Britain's
labor market has led to greater pay inequality although it helps
to boost the overall UK economy, according to an official study
published today in the Office for National Statistics' Labor
Market Trends journal.
</P>
<P>
The study acknowledged that the impact of the government's
efforts to make Britain's job market more flexible on earnings and
equality is significant.
</P>
<P>
It said that while the government's reform of unions,
employment rights, social security and minimum wages have led to
some increase in flexibility, these reforms have also contributed
to a significant widening of the earnings distribution.
</P>
<P>
The study compared recoveries in the labor markets of the UK,
the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, France and Italy in the 1980s
and 1990s and found that in the 1980s, "wage inequality increased
more quickly in the UK than in any of the other countries."
</P>
<P>
It added that the trend has continued in the 1990s, with male
wage inequality showing a "large rise" in 1995, and that of the
female rising more quickly in the 1990s than in the previous
decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Michael
Howard has vowed to reject proposals for a common European Union
(EU) immigration policy and preserve the country's border
controls.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that plans of forging a common immigration
policy throughout the 15-nation block would be discussed at the EU
summit due to be held in Dublin, Ireland, later this month.
</P>
<P>
Howard was quoted by BBC Radio as saying this afternoon, "We
can't stop discussion, but our position is entirely clear and has
been for a very long time -- We have no intention of doing
anything whatever which will weaken our frontier controls."
</P>
<P>
Britain would not hesitate to use its veto, Howard said,
adding, "It's quite simple, it's quite straightforward. There's no
doubt about it."
</P>
<P>
On Britain's possible isolation on the issue, he stressed that
if Britain might be isolated in Europe because of defending its
national interests, "we would rather defend Britain's interests
than forsake that isolation."

<P>
TEHRAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Several people were arrested in
an unrest in Iran's western province of Kermanshah, Iran's
state-run radio reported here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the official report denied the western report that
Mulla Mohammad Rabii, Sunni Moslem religious leader, was
assassinated Monday.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said that the Sunni Moslem religious leader
died of heart attack Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Local people staged a demonstration in a protest against the
assassination, which led to clashes between crowds and armed
policemen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that police Colonel Akbar Najafi was killed
and several Sunni protesters had also died in the fighting
with police and some others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's official news agency IRNA kept silence, giving
no word on the incident which happened in western Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's population is predominately Shiite, but there are
Sunni communities living in the western and southeastern regions
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Omani Sultan Qaboos to Attend GCC Summit in Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, Qatar, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Sultan Qaboos Bin-Said of
Oman will attend the 17th Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit to
be held here on December 7-9, the Qatar News Agency (QNA) quoted
a statement from the royal Omani court as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Established in May 1981, the GCC groups six Arab countries,
namely, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
It is speculated that some heads of the GCC member states
will not be present at the upcoming summit due to health and
other reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Bahrain said it will not
participate in the summit because of Qatar's "unfraternal and
uncordial" attitude toward it.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's refusal was due to long-standing dispute with Qatar
over the Hawar Islands and sandbanks in the area and the recent
arrests of two Qatari nationals on spying charges.
</P>
<P>
GCC Secretary-General Jamil al-Hojeilan, a Saudi Arabian,
today told the Qatari press that the difference of opinions
between Qatar and Bahrain is of a bilateral nature and not a
multilateral one. So, Bahrain's possible absence from the Doha
summit would not affect the GCC solidarity, he added.
</P>
<P>
GCC foreign ministers ended here Wednesday a meeting aimed at
preparing the ground for the weekend summit. QNA said they were
still making efforts to persuade Bahrain to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers' meeting unanimously recommended an
agenda for the summit, but no official communique on the agenda
was issued at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, the main issues to be
discussed at the summit are expected to include relations with
Israel, the formation of a free trade zone in the region, and
greater coordination in the agriculture and information
realms.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' State Budgets for 1997 tabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou today tabled to the House of
Representatives the state's budgets for 1997, and predicted the
growth rate for 1997 at 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the country's expenditure will
stand at 1,488 million Cyprus pounds (about 2,976 million
U.S. dollars) in 1997, while revenue will amount to 1,087 million
pounds (about 2,174 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ordinary budget provides for expenditure of 1,162 million
pounds (about 2,324 million dollars) and revenue of 1,066
million pounds (about 2,132 million dollars), the development
budget envisages spending amounting to 233 million pounds (about
466 million dollars) and the refugee fund expenditure of 83
million pounds (about 166 million dollars) and revenue 21
million pounds (about 42 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said development projects in the road network
and the water supply network account for 32 percent of the
total cost for development projects.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of growth for 1997, estimated at 3.5 percent, is
considered satisfactory, while inflation and unemployment rates
are believed to range around this year's figures, about 3
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Public deficit is estimated at 176 million pounds (about 252
million dollars) or 4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)
while public debt will be similar to this year's level.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the monetary policy, the minister said "radical
changes need to take place in our monetary system, including the
gradual restriction on foreign exchange and the abolition of a
maximum ceiling on interest rates, currently governed by
legislation."
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the start of operations by the Cyprus stock
exchange in March, describing it as an "important step toward
modernization and progress in the local money market".
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's socio-economic policy,
Christodoulou said Cyprus faces acute competition following the
liberalization of the world trade of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
"This creates difficulties and opens up new possibilities
which demand flexibility, adjustment, determination and
dynamism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He referred in particular to problems facing the country's
tourism industry, saying that "increasing the number of beds
available and the number of tourists visiting the island cannot
continue. The new environment necessitates renewal and upgrading
of our tourist product to attract high income visitors."
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic developments in 1996, the minister said
the rate of growth is estimated at 2.5 percent compared with
initial forecasts of around 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This slow-down is partly due to a reduction in the rate of
growth in the European Union (EU) from the anticipated 3 percent
to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year unemployment marked a slight increase to reach 3
percent and inflation is estimated to be around 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Public deficit for 1996 is expected to reach 120 million
pounds (about 240 million dollars) of GDP compared with 40 million
pounds (about 80 million dollars) the year before, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that this level falls within controlled
levels and meets the Maastricht criteria set by the EU.

MAPUTO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the
Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries Marcolino Moco today
urged its seven member states to formulate a common
telecommunication policy.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal at the opening ceremony of the first
ministerial meeting on post and telecommunication of the
community in the Mozambican capital here.
</P>
<P>
Moco said that "we must have courage to draw up a common
strategy" on telecommunication which "is of great importance to
the coordinated development of our member nations."
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary noted that the three-day ministerial
meeting has provided "a good opportunity" to prove to the world
its value of existence.
</P>
<P>
This is the first inter-governmental meeting of the seven
members -- Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao

community in Portugal on July 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the meeting, Mozambican Minister of Transport
and Communication Paulo Muxanga stressed the importance of
telecommunication, saying he favors privatization of this sector
as a reform of the state-owned public services.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Universal Postal Union, the Union of
International Telecommunications and the Organization of

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Stresses Big Achievement in Eliminating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz, commenting on a U.S. blacklist of world drug producers,
stressed here today his country's ``very big" achievement in
eliminating drug planting and processing.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced that 95 percent of drug planting and 100
percent of drug processing have been uprooted.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon was included in a recent letter U.S. President Bill
Clinton wrote to the congress, which says 32 countries in Latin
America, Asia and the Middle East still produce drugs or
constitute a main route for drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The blacklist, which has been published by the white House, was
not much different from that in last year.
</P>
<P>
"What Lebanon has done in eradicating drugs in the past
several years following the transition from war to stability is a
very big work," the foreign minister was quoted by the state-run
Lebanese National News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"`Lebanon has succeeded in uprooting at least 95 percent of the
drug growing, and as far as the processing concerned, Lebanon has
eliminated nearly 100 percent," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Shiite-populated Beqaa Valley used to be a major drug
plantation in the Middle East, and this country was also a
traditional corridor for drug smugglers from Afghanistan to Europe
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1975-90 civil war, the Lebanese
government, with help of the United Nations and other
international organizations, has made great efforts to wipe out
the drug production.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Allow Setting Up of Offshore Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Acting Finance Minister
Daniel Yona said today Tanzania will allow establishment of the
offshore banking facility after having relevant legislation in
place and other investment governing regulations are met.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an one-day seminar on the proposed establishment of
global investment project for Zanzibar, held here, Yona said the
provisions of the Banking and Financial Institution Act of 1991,
covered onshore banking only, the Daily News Paper reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the move could be achieved upon enactment of
the law by parliament after thorough study on the advantages and
disadvantages of the offshore banking business, and the
prerequisite of the system in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Yona said that Tanzania has put in place conducive financial
and investment policies to attract private participation in
economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Prior to be allowed to operate in Tanzania, he said, potential
investors in the financial sector are scrutinized to determine
their financial soundness, history character and experience of
management, soundness of business plans and policies and their
likely contribution to the country's economy and development.
</P>
<P>
Speakig at the seminar, Ralf Reitz from the offshore banking
company in Germany, said they had submitted application to the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Tanzania for scrutiny and
action.
</P>
<P>
He said if the legislation on offshore banking is passed and
the country signs the offshore banks laws, it would take them
between 24 and 36 months to have the bank operational.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, an American investor, Herbert Law signed an
agreement to establish an off-shore bank in Zanzibar with his
local partner, Lambert Matherw.

NICOSIA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Popular Bank will
offer a full range of custody services to meet specific
requirements of clients, a move to draw more investment to the
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The services include safe custody, settlement of trades,
income collection, corporate actions, reporting services, tax
reclaiming and foreign exchange, the leading banking institution
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Marios Hadjigavriel, an official from the bank, was quoted by

first bank on the island to have introduced a full range of
custody services and it will act as an agent for the Midland
Securities Services, a division of the Midland Bank, UK.
</P>
<P>
"The legal and trustee department of the bank enjoys an
extensive experience in the provision of trustee and custody
services for local institutional investors, namely insurance
companies with assets held under trust both in Cyprus and abroad
amounting to approximately 170 million U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Demetra Markidou, another official of the bank, also told the
press that the establishment of this service illustrates the trust
 the bank places on the Cyprus stock exchange and its future
development.
</P>
<P>
The new service will attract more foreign investors to
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> 3 Candidates to Run for Ghanaian Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's presidential elections
are scheduled for the coming Saturday and three candidates will
compete for the presidency, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The three candidates are incumbent President Jerry Rawlings,
opposition alliance leader John Kufuor and Edward Mahama of the
People's National Convention (PNC).
</P>
<P>
Rawlings, 49, is one of the several African leaders who first
came to power through military coup and later legitimized their
rule by winning polls.
</P>
<P>
Once a junior air force officer, Rawlings came to power in
1981 and won the presidential race in 1992, with his National
Democratic Congress (NDC) obtaining the majority of seats in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to his rivals in Saturday's poll, Rawlings enjoys
tighter discipline in his party, larger funds with which to
campaign and greater access to local and national media, much of
which is state-controlled.
</P>
<P>
Kufuor, 51, who leads the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and stands
as candidate of the Great Alliance, a fragile union of the NPP
and the People's Convention Party, is a lawyer and was once a
high ranking official in the Provisional National Defense Council
established by Rawlings in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The Great Alliance focuses its campaign on economic and social
problems such as increasing cost of living and the falling value
of the Cedi, the national currency.
</P>
<P>
"Look at your social conditions and vote accordingly," is one
of his campaign slogans.
</P>
<P>
Mahama, 58, is a doctor and a relatively new face on Ghana's
political scene.
</P>
<P>
In his campaign, he tries to explain that he is for the
alienated urban populations, who feel that the more established
politicians, especially those currently in power, have little to
offer them, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Specific Program for Women's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Justice and Constitutional Affairs Bakari Mwapachu today called
for specific programs to alleviate poverty among women as a
necessity to realize the rights of Tanzanian women.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Daily News, he made the remarks when
opening a workshop on the establishment of a mechanism to promote
the human rights of women in Morogoro, about 300 kilometers west
of Dar es Salaam today.
</P>
<P>
Mwapachu also said measures needed to be taken to educate the
society that human rights and the rights of women in particular
are universal.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the rights of women are integral of the
basic rights guaranteed under the constitution of the United
Republic of Tanzania of 1977.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "little had been achieved in the
realization of those rights for women in the country."
</P>
<P>
Mwapachu said the national convention on the elimination of
all forms of discrimination against women requires legislative,
judicial, administrative or other measures to give effect to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
He said it is therefore necessary to establish what specific
measures can be taken in order to give effect to the rights
guaranteed in various international conventions.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the workshop marks the beginning
of a dialogue between the government and non-governmental bodies
in exchanging views on the rights of women in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of
Justice, the Ministry of Community Development, Women and
Children Affairs and the UNDP.

<P>
LUANDA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special delegate to Angola
Blondin Beye said here today that repatriation of former soldiers
hit snags due to the lack of funds from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of the joint commission
meeting of the peace process in Angola, Beye complained that the
international community had not fulfill its promises at the round
table meeting in Brussels in 1995 of providing funds for the
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the work to repatriate children soldiers
below 18 from the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) would go on.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Peace Pact in 1994 provides that repatriation of
UNITA soldiers starts on September 24 this year but up to now
only a little more than 600 UNITA soldiers under the age of 18
have been repatriated.

<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel will have to import gas for home heating to
make up for an expected shortfall this winter, unless the Israel
Oil Refineries steps up its production.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Kulitz, head of the Infrastructure Ministry's fuel
administration, said that the Israelis are expected to consume
40,000-45,000 tons of gas a month this winter.
</P>
<P>
However, the Oil Refineries have committed to producing only
30,000-33,000 tons a month, which is some 20 percent less than
the company supplied last year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment level stood at 6.5 percent
during the first three quarters this year, down 0.4 percent from
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Postal Workers Occupy MPs' Offices Across Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian postal workers have
vowed that they will continue occupy the offices of federal
members of parliament (MPs) until their demand is met.
</P>
<P>
Some 22 constituency offices of the ruling Liberal Party MPs
were occupied across Canada Wednesday, including that of Deputy
Prime Minister Sheila Copps, to protest against the government's
decision to stop Canada Post from delivering junk mail.
</P>
<P>
In Calgary, members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers
(CUPW) even hanged and burned Prime Minister Jean Chretien in
effigy, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Postal workers vow to occupy until each MP agrees to raise the
issue in caucus, and convey our deep concerns to the Prime
Minister and Diane Marleau, Minister responsible for Canada Post,"
said Darrel Tingley, CUPW's national president.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the federal government announced that the Crown
corporation was quitting the flyer and junk-mail business, which
would result in the firing of about 10,000 people as of January
31.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed the release of an independent review
of Canada Post that recommended a massive overhaul of its
operations, including its withdraw from the lucrative junk-mail
business.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of this decision, we will see this work
transferred to the private sector, which is now advertising for
children to take over mail delivery," Tingley said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The occupations are only one part of the union's protest. A day
of action is planned for next Monday, and what form it will take
will be announced today.
</P>
<P>
The union has indicated that its members would hold a one-day
strike before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates National Security Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday named U.N. ambassador Madeleine Albright the country's
first woman secretary of state, and retiring Republican Senator
William Cohen defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
At an Oval Office ceremony Clinton also announced he would
nominate Anthony Lake, his national security adviser, the new CIA
director. Sandy Berger, Lake's deputy, will be promoted to take up
Lake's former position.
</P>
<P>
The nominations of Albright, Cohen and Lake are subject to
Senate confirmation and that of Berger is not.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary
William Perry are resigning.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, Perry and CIA director John Deutch were present on
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Clinton "I'm deeply honored by your decision."
She said she was pleased that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott would be staying on for Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Cohen would build "bipartisan support America's
armed forces must have and deserve." He thanked Cohen for crossing
party lines to join the team.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed Albright would be the first woman to hold the
senior diplomatic post of the United States. The selection of
Cohen, the retiring Maine lawmaker, is in keeping with Clinton's
promise to include Republicans in his administration.
</P>
<P>
Albright, 59, came from the academic world to the Clinton
administration in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, 56, is a Republican who retired from the Senate this
year after three terms. He established a reputation for
independence in the Senate, and was the only Republican last year
to vote against the Republican plan to balance the budget over
seven years.
</P>
<P>
Lake, 57, from New England, wrote five books on foreign policy.
He served in the State Department in both the Nixon and Carter
administrations. Before joining the Clinton administration, he
taught international relations at a College in South Hadley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
Berger, 51, is reputed for his ability to straddle the
intersection of politics and foreign affairs. Before joining the
Clinton administration, he worked as an international trade
attorney and partner at a major Washington law firm. He had worked
in the Carter administration, as deputy director of the State
Department's Policy Planning Staff from 1977 to 1980.

<HEADLINE> IGC: World Grains Production to Meet Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The strong rebound of wheat and
coarse grains output is a clear sign of the capacity of the world
grains to meet increasing food and feed requirements, according to
the International Grains Council (IGC).
</P>
<P>
After reviewing developments in world grains markets and the
production outlook for 1997, the IGC said in a press release: The
Council's first forecast of world wheat production in 1997 was 580
million tons compared with 575 million tons in 1996. Easier
supplies should enable consumption to expand next year.
</P>
<P>
It also said this year's increase in production was due to
favorable crop conditions in most regions, except in
Central/Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
Referring to price fluctuations, the IGC pointed out it was a
matter of concern, especially to developing importing countries.
</P>
<P>
The apparent determination of governments of major exporting
countries to refrain from market intervention that could
exacerbate recent downward price movements was noted, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Council also discussed the evolution of their respective
food aid policies in relation to the needs of low income and net
food importing developing countries, in the light of the outcome
of the recent World Food Summit in Rome, the press release said.

SANAA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) summit, due to be held in the Qatari capital of Doha on
December 7-9, will discuss Yemen's application for joining the
group, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Today's local daily "September 26," citing an official source
from the Yemeni Foreign Ministry, said that Yemen will remain a
part of the Gulf region, and that any attempt to deny this will
mean a denial of facts of geography and history.
</P>
<P>
When people talk about Gulf security, he said, it is difficult
to separate the Strait of Ban al Mandab from the Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani said in recent
statements to the local press that the admission of Yemen to the
GCC would be in line with Yemen's desire.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni parliament Speaker Sheikh Abdullah Al Ahmar had
officially submitted Yemen's application to join the GCC during
his visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week.
</P>
<P>
Established in May, 1981, the GCC groups six Arab countries,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.

LUANDA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The standing committee of the
Council of Ministers of Angola today approved the rehabilitation
of Benguela Railway in central Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release issued here today by the council,

the section from Lobito to Kuito in central Angola will be
repaired.
</P>
<P>
The 1,340-km Benguela Railway which spans central Angola, is
connected to Zaire's railways and one of the trunk rails in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Its rehabilitation will be helpful to development of southern
Africa, especially that of land-locked nations.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Start Recruitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUKAVU, Zaire, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebels today
started massive recruitment in several eastern cities they have
controlled to prepare for a new thrust.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international community has not yet made a
final decision on the mandate, scope and formation of a
multinational force scheduled to be deployed in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
In South Kivu's provincial capital of Bukavu, thousands of
young men queued at the recruitment station in the downtown area,
awaiting registration.
</P>
<P>
"Join the People's Liberation Army and fight for a united
Congo where you have access to food and shelter, freedom and a
corruption-free government," said rebel leader Laurent Kabila
when addressing a mass rally earlier today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Kabila said his forces, with the
sole target of toppling President Mobutu Sese Seko's government,
are continuing to push westward into the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said fighting broke out today in Kisangani,
the biggest city in eastern Zaire and capital of the Upper Zaire
Province which is about 500 kilometers northwest of Kivu.
</P>
<P>
And the rebel force, after a week-long campaign, has at
present gained control of Beni, a gold mine 200 kilometers north
of their northern base of Goma.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the rebels permitted into eastern Zaire's major
cities of Goma and Bukavu personnel from the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and other relief organizations,
although sporadic fighting was still going on in villages and the
suburban areas of the cities.
</P>
<P>
And hundreds of thousands of refugees were detected hiding
deep in the forest or fleeing westward into Zaire's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels claimed that there are only a few left after
over half of the 1.2 million Hutu refugees returned to Rwanda
during the past two weeks, therefor there is no need for the
deployment of a multinational force.
</P>
<P>
The force, proposed by the U.N., has been delayed for over
four weeks due to the stern opposition by Kabila's rebels, the
governments of Rwanda and Burundi, as well as the hesitation of
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges Duma to Approve 1997 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin urged the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
to pass the 1997 budget plan.
</P>
<P>
The draft 1997 budget, if adopted, could produce growth of 2
percent in gross national product (GNP) next year, helped by
reductions in interest rates, the Interfax news agency cited the
premier as saying.
</P>
<P>
That is "a realistic target, even with 11.8 percent inflation,"
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He said a budget deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP was "as much as
we can entertain in today's circumstance."
</P>
<P>
The budget, he went to say, is designed to "achieve an
equilibrium between money supply growth and increased demand for
money," Chernomyrdin said, noting that the economy must hinge on
"a strong, noninflationary rouble (Russia's currency)."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government viewed the draft indicators as
"realistic," and urged lawmakers to pass the revised budget at
their session to be held later today.
</P>
<P>
The Duma deputies rejected the draft budget last month,
describing it as "unrealistic." According to sources close to the
lower chamber, the parliamentary faction of the "Our Home Is
Russia" party has agreed to vote for the revised draft, while the
Communist Party faction and Yabloko's faction oppose it.
</P>
<P>
The Duma deputies are expected to determine "a procedure of
voting on the draft budget for 1997" later this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Admits Secret Deal With Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) admitted today that it had signed
a secret agreement with Serbs concerning the controversial local
elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The document is secret and there is a very good reason for
that, and therefore I would not comment on that," said Johan
Verheyden, a spokesman for the OSCE, which is in charge of the
Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
Verheyden said that one of the reasons for keeping it secret
was that negotiations were still going on with regard to the local
elections which were originally scheduled for September 14 this
year but had to be twice postponed because of concerns over
polling irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs allegedly attempted to use the so-called
P2-forms, which allowed refugees to vote in places where they were
living or intended to live, and to seal their control on cities
and towns where Serbs were minorities before the war.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE abolished the P2-forms in October, to the outcry of
Serbs who threatened to boycott the OSCE-organized local elections
now scheduled for June next year.
</P>
<P>
The secret deal apparently persuaded Serbs to drop their threat
and sign last Saturday an agreement to allow the OSCE to proceed
with organization of local elections in the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
But if the deal was to retore the P2-forms, as being widely
speculated, it would outrage the Bosnian Muslims and put local
elections in jeopardy anyway, according analyses of the local
media.

<P>
SINGAPORE, December 6 (Xinhua/OANA) -- South Korea scored an
upset win over defending champions China in the men's team final
while China retained the women's team title at the 13th Asian
Table Tennis Championships here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
This is the very first time for the South koreans to take the
Asian team title.
</P>
<P>
South Korea beat China 3-0 in the men's team final.
</P>
<P>
Having represented South Korea for four times in the world
championships, sixth-ranked Kim Taek Soo, 26, encouraged the team
with his opening-match victory over China's number one and
top-ranked Liu Guoliang 21-19, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Oh Sang Eun, ranked 98th in the world, followed
the stance to beat China's world champion Kong Linghui from the
43rd championships back in Tianjin in 1994. He won the match
21-17, 23-21.
</P>
<P>
Kang Hee Chan, ranked 70th in the world, sealed up the South
Korean victory with a 21-9, 21-19 win in the third and final match.
</P>
<P>
"The opening victory by Kim is very important and it encouraged
us very much," said South Korean coach Oh Byung Man.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with the performance of our players today.
They just did a good job," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The result of the final is unexpected," said Yin Xiao, China's
men's team coach.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team had less time for training after the Atlanta
Olympic Games and, due to the recent international competitions,
the whole team had been fully engaged and lacked systematic and
extensive training, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Koreans, on the contrary, has been fully prepared and
knew well how the Chinese would play in such high-level
competitions, he continued. "We're not well prepared," Yin
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yuansheng, the Chinese women's coach, praised the Hong Kong
side for their determination, especially their young players.
</P>
<P>
The competitions for the individual events start on Saturday
and the championships close on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Condemns Evictions in Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) today condemned recent evictions in the
Croat-controlled western Mostar, including one in which a
nine-year-old girl was terrified and kicked out from her home.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the UNICEF office in former
Yugoslavia,, six masked gunmen evicted the girl and her parents
from their flat on November 28. During the eviction of the Muslim
family, the gunmen beat the parents with pistol butts in front of
their daughter and traumatized the girl by pointing a pistol at
her head.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF learned that, despite subsequent identification of
two of the gunmen and their arrest by the Bosnian Croat police,
the gunmen allegedly escaped from the police station in western
Mostar, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Dayton accords and the Washington (Croat-Muslim) agreement
are being violated by such criminals, and the failure of the
authorities governing them to prevent such acts or take corrective
action shows that there is a long way to go in ensuring that
children's rights and dignity are protected," the UNICEF said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Bosnian peace accords were signed last December, some
70 evictions of Muslims and Serbs have happened in western Mostar,
with almost one every day in the past two weeks, according to UN
calculations.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Replaces Intelligence Agency After Phone-tapping Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR CITY, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's
government is to replace the country's espionage agency with a
new body in a bid to cool the row over a phone-tapping scandal.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the old agency has also been removed and will be
replaced by a senior member of the judiciary who will head up the
new organization, known as the National Security Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The changes were made by the government following allegations
by the opposition party, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party (MPRP), that the agency, known as the TTG, was ordered to
conduct illegal surveillance of MPRP members.
</P>
<P>
The MPRP, the former communist party which was swept from power
in June's general election, have made repeated allegations over
the last few weeks that the new reformist government used the
TTG's agents to spy on them for political gain, and have demanded
the resignation of the Prime Minister M Enkhsaikhan.
</P>
<P>
The TTG has denied the accusations, although it said that it
had worked on behalf of the MPRP before June's election to spy on
journalists.
</P>
<P>
But according to a Reuter report on December 1, a parliamentary
committee made up of the ruling Democratic Union coalition, the
MPRP and the National Unity Party, had agreed that there was
evidence of violations of the law by the agency.
</P>
<P>
The new agency will be headed by Jamsran Enkhnasan, a senior
member of the judiciary. He was previously Deputy Procurator
General of Mongolia and Chief Procurator of the Ulan Bator City
Court, where all the country's civil, criminal and administrative
cases are handled.

<HEADLINE> Rocky Japan Back on Track to Title Defending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AL AIN, United Arab Emirates, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Defending
champion Japan fought back from a shaky start in the Asian Cup to
beat Syria 2-1 with two goals in the final five minutes here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
After only eight minutes Bachar Srour got the ball to Nader
Jokhadar whose header caught Japan's goalie Kenichi Shimokawa too
far off his line and the ball flew over him into the far corner.
</P>
<P>
Japan pressed the Syrian hard but nothing went right for the
Japanese. The Syrian defenders were always quicker to ball and
sent it downfield.
</P>
<P>
Japan's offence bore fruit in the 85th minute when Syrian
Hassan Abbas went up to head home a own goal, making it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
The five thousands Syrians were stunned into silence and Abbas
stood shell shocked by the post.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later Takagi rose above the defence to head home
the winner.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Blasts Radio Free Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Communist Party
newspaper today slammed the U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia, branding
it "an wicked political instrument" trying to undermine socialist
countries.
</P>
<P>
The leading Nhan Dan (People) Daily said in a commentary, "the
recent formation of Radio Free Asia is a move to renew the
psychological warfare of the Cold War period, using the pretext of
democracy and human rights to launch a war of ideological and
cultural invasion and interference into Asian countries' internal
affairs."
</P>
<P>
As a private corporation funded by the United States Congress,
Radio Free Asia (RFA) was created recently to be an Asian
counterpart of the anti-Soviet Radio Free Europe.
</P>
<P>
The RFA, renamed Asia and Pacific Network, began Mandarin and
Tibetan programming in September and November. The radio station
also plans to broadcast in Burmese, Korean, Khmer, Laotian and
Vietnamese next year.
</P>
<P>
Nhan Dan said "From the idea of its establishment to
preparations for the start of its broadcasts, Radio Free Asia has
exposed itself as a wicked political instrument and a product of
the Cold War period ... to oppose socialist countries, including
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"Using RFA as a means to impose U.S. ideology, intervene in
other countries' internal affairs and destablize Asian nations is
very dangerous, obsolete and unacceptable," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also demanded the United States abolish the plan
and stop its policy vis-a-vis Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Vietnam will intensify vigilance, increase aggregate
strengths and take effective measures, especially in the
ideological and cultural sectors, to frustrate all schemes and
moves of 'peaceful evolution' staged by hostile forces."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the plan has poured cold water over the slowly
improving Vietnam-U.S. relations, as the two countries have yet to
achieve full normalization of relations following the Vietnam War
in the 1970s. Formal diplomatic ties were resumed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Other Asian countries, including China, Thailand and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have also accused the radio
station of interfering in Asian countries' internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> International Electric Vehicle Seminar Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Presentation,
Seminar and Exhibition of Electric Vehicles and Substitutional
Fuel Vehicles Technology, the first of its kind ever held in
China, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which focuses on the subject of "Electric
Vehicles, Substitutional Fuel Vehicles and Sustainable Development
Strategy in the 21st Century", is sponsored by China's State
Science and Technology Commission (SSTC) and the Ministry of
Machine-Building Industry (MMI).
</P>
<P>
China has listed electric vehicles as one of the key
development projects for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Electric vehicles and substitutional fuel vehicles, which
epitomize the advanced technologies in the fields of modern
vehicles, new energies and materials, will become one of the most
important means of transport in the next century, said Song Jian,
minister in charge of SSTC.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, SSTC's vice minister Xu
Guanhua said that the development of electric vehicles and
substitutional fuel ones is part of the country's sustainable
development strategy for the next century.
</P>
<P>
"The research, development and application of "green" means of
transport like electric vehicles are an inevitable trend for
traffic and transportation reform in line with the sustainable
development strategy," Xu added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, director of the MMI's Automotive Industry
Department, said that China has realized that "the blind
development of the auto industry to the neglect of environmental
protection and fuel supply is a dead end."
</P>
<P>
"It is time for China to solve problems related to energy
resources, environmental protection and safety," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China has already become an
oil-importing country rather than an oil-exporting one and the
recovering span of its proven reserves is shorter than the world
average.
</P>
<P>
Zhang warned that in such big cities as Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou, where there are too many motor vehicles, air pollution,
mainly caused by car exhaust, is serious.
</P>
<P>
To carry out its sustainable development strategy and develop
the national economy smoothly, China should pay much attention to
research into and development of electric vehicles and
substitutional fuel vehicles, Zhang continued.
</P>
<P>
In addition to electric vehicles, China plans to develop
vehicles driven by natural gas and methanol.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day seminar and exhibition is being attended by more
than 100 firms and research institutions from eight countries and
regions.

<HEADLINE> New Interbank Payment System to Come Into Use in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Real Time Gross
Settlement (RTGS) system, which is to handle the final settlement
of interbank fund transfers in full compliance with international
standard, will come into operation in Hong Kong next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today informed banks
that the interbank payment system will proceed with data
conversion this weekend, in preparation for the full
implementation of the RTGS system next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new structure, all licensed banks are required to
open accounts with the HKMA for settlement purpose.
</P>
<P>
In early 1994, the HKMA realized that Hong Kong need a more
robust system in accordance with the international standard to
foster a more efficient financial market. The monetary authority
has worked together with the banking community so as to put the
system into operation before the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Report: Chinese People's Health Condition Greatly Improved (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy of
China's 1.2 billion people has doubled from 1949's figure of 35
years, due to the remarkable improvements in the country's general
health, claimed a report from the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
"Poor health conditions of the people have been thoroughly
changed because medical care services are improving, incidence
rates of many diseases are dropping, and living conditions are
better," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released just before a national conference on
health care, scheduled for December 9-12 in Beijing, the first
such meeting sponsored jointly by the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of infectious diseases has dropped to 116 people
per 100,000 people last year, from 20,000 people per 100,000 in
the early 1950s. Infectious diseases are currently named as the
ninth most common cause of death from disease; they were
previously first on the list, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy has been eradicated or controlled in more than 90
percent of counties, and the number of patients declined to 11,000
from some 500,000 in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of tuberculosis has fallen to 523 people per
100,000 people, compared with 3,000 to 4,000 people per 100,000
more than 40 years ago. The cure rate of the disease stands at 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
Widespread use of the vaccines for hepatitis A and B has
resulted in a steady decline of incidence rates of the two
illnesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China has set up 137 disease prevention agencies, staffed with
nearly 30,000 personnel, as part of its work to effectively
prevent and control endemic diseases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Snail fever has been eliminated from 278 counties, and only
seven provinces still reported cases now, instead of the 12 that
were named previously. Plague cases also dropped to 12 last year,
from 73 in the 1990's.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's Court
issued an order today to courts throughout the country to try
cases strictly and rapidly.
</P>
<P>
"Pressure must be kept up," Liu Jiachen, vice president of the
court, told a teleconference on cracking down on crime.
</P>
<P>
He said people involved in murder, robbery, explosions,
kidnapping, abducting women and children, rape, drug smuggling and
gang activities must be targeted first.
</P>
<P>
"We will allow the criminals no breathing spell. And we should
not be soft on those who deserve capital punishment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the official restated that when trying cases, the
judges must strictly observe the law so that every case can stand
up to re-examination.
</P>
<P>
He added that pornography will be another focus of the
crackdown this winter.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to curb iodine deficiency disease (IDD), residents in
80 percent of the country have been able to use iodized salt in
their food since 1995. And 85 percent of people living in areas
that are especially vulnerable to IDD have been able to take
iodine oil pills.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that health conditions of women and
children have been greatly improved in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of pregnant women and new mothers has
dropped to 62 people per 100,000 people, down from 1,500 per
100,000 in 1949. The death rate of infants lowered to 36 per
thousand from 250 per thousand in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The rate of malnutrition among children has also dropped
remarkably, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 85 percent of children in China's urban and rural
areas are immunized against infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Measles, poliomyelitis, diphtheria and pertussis were
preciously four leading killers of Chinese children. But the
number of cases of these diseases reported last year was 136,000,
compared with 11.83 million in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Chinese medical agencies and medics have played a underlying
role in preventing and controlling diseases and improving people's
health conditions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China has had 5,895 epidemic prevention stations -- 25 times
the figure in the 1950s -- employing more than 270,000 people.
Meanwhile, about 134,000 people are working at 3,179 health care
agencies, especially those designed to serve women and children.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Clinton's Choice of Senior Aides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt hailed U.S. President bill
Clinton's appointments of new secretary of state and defense
secretary and expressed the hope that the U.S. would continue to
throw its weight behind the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton named the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,
Madeleine Albright, as his new Secretary of State, and appointed
republican Senator William Cohen as Secretary of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said he looked forward to
working with Albright, who and Cohen are described as outspoken
supporters of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of Albright's policy but fear the results
that could be brought about by Netanyahu's policies," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who was in London for a three-day visit to Britain,
voiced his hope Thursday that the American diplomacy, during the
second term of Clinton, would continue to sponsor the peace-making
as an honest mediator, according to the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency today.
</P>
<P>
As secretary of state, Albright will face the difficult task of
restarting the faltering peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He added that Egypt expects from the new administration in the
U.S. to continue its peace role so that the peace process would
culminate in the full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab
lands and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Arab and American interests should not conflict
with each other so long as the U.S. is playing its role honestly.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat said that the Egyptian-U.S. relations
are based on cooperation and interaction, rather than
confrontation with the sole superpower in today's world.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moussa denied any deterioration in the Cairo-Washington
ties.

Meanwhile, Chinese residents can now extend the validity of
their five-year passports for 10 more years, he said, adding that

<HEADLINE> State Firms in NE China Show Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The sluggish state-owned firms
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, a traditional industrial
base, have recently shown some signs of recovery, a good omen for
the nation as a whole, a senior official revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizhen, the province's governor, said that the industry
will grow by 1.4 percent in 1996 over last year, and that the
state firms will growth by 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
That will be a remarkable achievement, considering the fact
that the province's industry has been stuck in recession for many
years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, industrial output dropped by 2.8 percent, and in 1995
it dropped by 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that among the 77 key state firms that the central
government is paying great attention to, 62 are operating
well. The difficulties faced by the coal and defense industrial
sectors are being eased, he added.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is a place where heavy industries are very densely
located. It turned out great amounts of steel, coal, ships and
trucks for the country under the planned economy. However, its
advantages have been challenged by burgeoning market competition,
a result of the country's reform.
</P>
<P>
The province has witnessed more than 100 state enterprises go
bankrupt and 200,000 people lose their jobs this year.
</P>
<P>
But, according to Wen, most workers are confident in the future
of the reform, and a recovery is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the province is making efforts to import
and develop high-technology, a move which many people believe will
enable the province to prosper.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A press conference revealed
here today that Statistics Canada has conducted three seminars
in the past two months explaining Canadian ways of collecting and
distributing statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government decided in September this year to spend
more than 9.46 Canadian dollars within five years on holding
seminars and training sessions for Chinese statisticians.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Sai, head of the State Statistics Bureau, said that China
has felt a pressing need to reform its statistical work as "the
country is in the process of transforming its traditional planned
economy into a socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
He said that Statistics Canada is one of the best statistical
organizations in the world and that he believes that the inter-
governmental project will be a model project for international
statistical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Ryten, assistant chief statistician of Statistics Canada,
said that his colleagues have introduced Canada's statistical
legislature, management and distribution to China through the
three seminars, adding that the seminars have "cemented the sense
of partnership between counterpart institutions in the two
countries."

<HEADLINE> Government Provides People with Better Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The cure rate of the
hospitalized patients in China has risen sharply and the death
rate has dropped as the result of improved medical services.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Ministry of Public
Health, both the cure rate and effective rate for the hospitalized
patients made up 95.6 percent of the total, respectively, and the
death rate dropped by 2.2 percent in 1995, compared with four
percent in 1954.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country with a large population. Its per
capita medical resource is comparatively small, while the total
demand for the medical services is huge, said Cai Renhua, an
official with the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
He said that to better balance the situation, China must
improve the efficiency of the medical services and try to develop
more medical resources.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's total investment for healthcare
reached 14.7 billion yuan in 1994, or 2.5 percent of the total
state financial expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The hospitalization period for most patients has shortened and
the increase rate of the number of sickbeds used has slowed down,
the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were 2.84 million sickbeds in the hospitals,
about 90,000 at clinics, and 11,000 in sanatoriums, almost on par
with the 1994 figures.
</P>
<P>
Cai said that the total number of patients received by the
various medical organizations increased to 2.2 billion people in
1995, and the number of hospitalized patients reached 50 million.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Medicare for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- After efforts of more than four
decades, China has set up a three-level health care network that
covers every corner of the country's vast rural area, a Ministry
of Public Health official said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"This has laid a solid foundation for reaching our target of
providing full medical care for every rural resident by the year
2000," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the Ministry of Public Health,
by the end of 1995, China had established a total of 5,002
hospitals, women and children's health centers, and
epidemic-prevention stations at the county level.
</P>
<P>
With a total of nearly 250,000 staff members, these medical
institutions can provide more than 354,600 beds for patients,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"China also has over 44,000 township hospitals which are able
to accept patients, and 7,222 others without beds," it claimed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are more than 840,000 medical service
facilities with over 1.33 million medical workers in the
countryside, scattered throughout 90 percent of the country's
nearly 740,000 villages.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the 1950s and 1960s, China's rural healthcare
institutions have seen great development in both number and
scale," the Ministry of Public Health official stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added they have helped to form a national rural healthcare
network at the county, the township, and the village levels.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1950s, China widely set up rural medical
institutions at both the county and township levels, and
introduced the cooperative medicare system into most villages in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always regarded rural health care as its
first priority and as a matter of strategic importance and first
priority, since over 70 percent of the country's population live
in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in June of 1995 by the Ministry of Public
Health and other state administrations showed that nearly 50
percent of the country's agricultural counties had met the minimum
requirements by the state project "Health Care for Every Rural
Resident by 2000."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects British Proposal, Welcomes European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has rejected the British
proposal for creating an organization for Mideast cooperation but
welcomed the appointment of a European envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Any talks about the creation of an organization for security
and cooperation in the Middle East should answer hundreds of
questions about its meaning and the need for it and if there is
need it should stem from inside the region," Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said in an interview with the BBC Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, now in London for a three-day visit,
Thursday met with his British counterpart Malcolm Rifkind on the
topic of security in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Moussa added that Arabs make up the majority in the region and
nothing can happen without their approval, rejecting the
application of European security ideas on the region as untenable.
</P>
<P>
Arabs want to live in peace with other countries, such as
Turkey, Iran and Israel but these countries are expected in the
meantime to respect the Arab interests, rights and identity, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Any such talk about this organization is rejected," he added,
noting that such an organization would naturally include Israel,
Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs have good relations with Turkey while there are
problems and disputes with Iran that should be resolved first, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Without such an organization, the inter-Arab relations will
still continue to improve, said the top Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moussa lauded the recent appointment of a
European envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Europe can not accept to play the role of the financier
without having a role in the process," he said, welcoming
multiplied European efforts for pushing the peace process and
considering this role as an addition to the one played by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy Miguel Moratinos will arrive here Saturday on a
two-day visit on the first leg of his regional tour. He will meet
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Moussa to discuss ways in
which Europe might help to push forward the faltering peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On the European rapid deployment Mediterranean force, Moussa
said active contacts are underway with the four countries that
formed the force, to clarify the situation and target it in order
to maintain "our" sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made it clear that inter-Arab relations will continue to
improve with a view to creating an atmosphere of cooperation and
coordination, in an effort to seek common Arab interests that
serve all Arab peoples.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Netanyahu Invited to Meet in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has invited Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to meet in Cairo to
settle their rows on Hebron, according to local press reports here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader expected them to meet here within two days,
but Israel seemed to be reluctant to heed the call.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority spokesman Ahmed Abdul Rahman said Arafat
and Netanyahu would meet here today or tomorrow to examine the
ways of removing obstacles which obstruct an agreement over Hebron
Between Israel and the Palestinians, the Arabic daily Al-Akhbar
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting would also deal with the final status
negotiations and the establishment of a corridor linking the
Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local newspaper Al Gomhouria reported that
Arafat has announced his readiness to meet with Netanyahu to
fulfil the accord on Israeli troops redeployment in Hebron, the
last West Bank town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, returning from his brief stop in Cairo
Wednesday evening, told reporters waiting outside his office in
Gaza: "Until now, the negotiations have not been finished, but I
am ready to meet him (Netanyahu) if he wants to."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli redeployment from Hebron, supposed to be completed
last March, has been delayed over the Israeli demand for better
safeguards for about 500 Jewish settlers amidst 120,000 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side demanded a timetable for further Israeli
pullback elsewhere in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Wednesday night that the time for a summit had
come and that the two leaders could quickly wrap up the
negotiations on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Israeli offer, Arafat said Thursday he was
willing to meet with Netanyahu to finalize an Israeli withdrawal
from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu's spokesman Michael Scholtz said that there
is no plan for holding Arafat-Netanyahu meeting today or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sufficient time to prepare for such meeting," the
AFP quoted him as saying.

<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and

cooperate actively with Bolivia to develop the agriculture and
mineral industries of both countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement this afternoon during a meeting with
visiting Bolivian Vice Foreign Minister Victor Manuel Rico
Frontaura.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that since the two countries forged diplomatic
relations 11 years ago, China and Bolivia, with much in common,
have enjoyed smooth development in bilateral ties, with increasing
exchanges and cooperation in politics, trade and economy, culture,
science and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches much importance to its

their enterpreneurs, based on mutual respect, equality and mutual
benefit, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rico conveyed Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar
Quiroga's regards to Qian, and said the Bolivian government, while
grateful for China's economic and technological aid, is also

<HEADLINE> Crackdown in Stock Market Hints Further Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China's recent crackdown on
irregularities in the stock market will not block the market's
expansion, as it was carried out to preserve the steady and
sustainable development of the market, according to financial
experts here.
</P>
<P>
China has imposed penalties on two state-owned commercial bank
branches and 45 securities brokerages for illegal stock deals in
the past three weeks, which experts have described as a full
demonstration of the authorities' firm determination to stem
irregularities in the stock market, for a healthy and steady
development.
</P>
<P>
"These drastic measures exposed some problems in China's stock
market, but they also illustrated that the supervision and
monitoring of the market has improved greatly," said Zhang Binxun,
director of the Stock Exchange Executive Council's Research and
Development Department.
</P>
<P>
He added that the market is still not free from irregular
activities, such as speculations, insider-trading, and illegal
stock subscription on credit, although a framework of securities
legislation has basically taken shape.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zuoji, a financial expert with Beijing University, said
all these problems came naturally in the initial development stage
of a stock market, and that on the whole, the operations of the
Chinese stock market have been smooth and normal.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, a steady and sustainable expansion of the market is
inevitable, given the importance the stock market has in China's
endeavor to seek more direct fund-pooling channels," said Xiao.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, has pointed out that his commission will
redouble its efforts to check market irregularities for a healthy
and sustainable development of the market.
</P>
<P>
"Supervision and regulation of the stock market will remain at
the top of the authorities' work agenda for a fairly long period
of time ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dramatic expansion has taken place in China's stock market this
year, with the market capitalization exceeding 980 billion yuan by
the end of October, from the nearly 350 billion at the end of last
year.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Channels of Overseas Fund in Building Transport Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- To improve its transport
infrastructure, China will develop multiple sources of overseas
funds by adopting the BOT (build, operate, transfer) method and
issuing stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
These new channels will not only draw a large amount of
international commercial and individual investment, but also
alleviate the financial burden for the government and reduce its
debt risks, according to an official with the Ministry of
Communications (MOC).
</P>
<P>
Dong Xuebo, deputy director of the planning department under
the MOC, made a speech on the plan to a symposium on China's
Transportation Development towards the 21st Century, which was
held here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to take loans from international financial
organizations and foreign governments as the main sources of
overseas capitals, while expanding the fund channels and
implementing more open policies on utilization of overseas funds
in building transport facilities," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the government encourages Sino-overseas joint
ventures in building and operating wharves and berths for public
use and allows Sino-overseas joint ventures to lease wharves to
run loading and unloading businesses.
</P>
<P>
It also allows overseas-funded businesses which invest in a
development zone to build and operate special-purpose port areas
and wharves in the zone, such as berths used for public passenger
and cargo transport in the zone, and it encourages the
establishment of Sino-overseas joint projects, or those that are
solely overseas-funded, for the building of highways, bridges and
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
Some pilot projects have already been launched. Guangdong
Expressway Development Co. Ltd. has listed B shares in Shenzhen,
while Anhui Expressway has recently issued more than 800 million
HK dollars worth of shares in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to MOC statistics, China has utilized about 5.8
billion US dollars in loans from international financial
institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Banks,
and others from foreign governments since the 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
wrapped up this week's trade with a landslide as investors tried
to dodge the impact of a possible crash on the Wall Street today.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 69.4 points, or 2.91 percent,
lower at 2,313.9 points.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest intra-day fall at the local bourse since
March 11.
</P>
<P>
The sell-off at the local bourse was triggered by comments of
Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan
today.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that central bankers should not be concerned by
a "collapsing financial bubble."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the 1987 crash at the US stock market and warned
that the complexity of the interactions of asset markets and the
economy should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse interpreted his speech as an indication that
the New York Stock Exchange might be over heated.
</P>
<P>
Local investors dumped their shares in the expectation of a
fall on the Wall Street tonight.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index dived 113.9 points to 3,573.2 points,
while the all resources index shed 34.7 points to 1,351.1 points.
</P>
<P>
However, some local analysts said that if the US market came
back or did not drop much tonight, the Australian bourse would
bounce back on Monday.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 585.06 million shares, valued at 1.16
billion Australian dollars (922.3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index
contract slumped 84.0 points to 2,303.0 points.

JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Sharp Corporation has

</P>
<P>
However, Sharp's agent in Israel, Techno Ralco, has conceded
such an investment was being explored. "We were going to make
the investment using Sharp knowhow and manufacturing under Sharp's
brand-name," Techno Ralco director Yaron Ruziak said last week.
"That project is currently frozen."

LAGOS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Shooting Stars Football
Club will leave Lagos today for Tunis to prepare for the December
15 second leg of this year's African Champions Cup against Zamalek
of Eygpt.
</P>
<P>
"The Punch" quoted Secretary-General of the Nigeria Football
Association, Alhaji Sani Toro as saying that earlier plan to
airlift Shooting Stars to Egypt was cancelled because of the
dangers associated with camping the players there for seven days.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they have chosen Tunis, which has the same climate
with Egypt, the Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
A day ago, the Nigerians scored a psychological victory as the
Confederation of African Football ruled that the second leg
earlier scheduled for Alexandria will be played in Cairo, the
Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
However, it is certainly a loss to them when the CAF ruled on
Monday that two of its players will not be able to play in the
decisive match because of the two yellow cards against them in the
first leg On November 30, in Ibadan, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians won the first leg 2-1, which has greatly boosted
their hope of bagging the Champions Cup, the only event on the
African continent that has not been won by them.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Minister Resigns on Corruption Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Agriculture Minister
Padma Sundar Lawati resigned today after a governmental
anti-corruption body filed legal cases against him, the state-run
Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
Lawati handed over his resignation to Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba earlier today and the prime minister has accepted
it, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)
Thursday filed three separate cases at the Appellate Court
accusing Lawati and other 11 senior government officials of being
involved in corrupt activities while carrying out three fertilizer
import deals.
</P>
<P>
The commission has demanded five years of jail term and over
one million US dollars in fines for the minister, local newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
The CIAA, Nepal's official corruption control body, claimed
that Lawati and other officials were found being involved in two
scandals concerning fertilizer deals with foreign companies
conducted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the law of Nepal, any government official will be
suspended automatically if he faces legal charges of corruption
and authority abuse.
</P>
<P>
Lawati is the first cabinet member of Nepal's present coalition
government to be investigated and sued on corruption charges after
the Supreme Court lifted the restriction to probe into cases
involving highest government officials recently.
</P>
<P>
Lawati, leader of the second ruling National Democratic Party
(RPP), was appointed agriculture minister last September soon
after the three-party government led by Deuba of the Nepali
Congress (NC) was formed.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Threat to Shark Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- An escalating trade in
sharks, partly fueled by demand for shark's fin soup in Hong Kong,
is threatening the world population of sharks, said a report in
today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the first global survey into the shark
market reveals that up to 70 million sharks are harvested a year
in a largely unregulated trade that conservationists say is
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
Sharks are in demand not only for their fins, but for meat and
cartilage, which is believed to be a cancer cure.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong forms the biggest entrepot for the trade in shark's
fin, importing more than six million kilograms, worth 1.92 billion
HK dollars (0.25 billion US dollars), from 125 countries a year,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists were quoted as saying that some shark species
may disappear before they are known to be in trouble if the
shark's fin market continues without effective regulation.
</P>
<P>
President of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurant Owners
William Mark said the warning was unlikely to affect sales of
shark's fin soup.

<HEADLINE> HK Residents Reluctant to Back Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's degree of public
support for environmental protection ranks bottom in the world,
according to the results of a recent survey conducted by
researchers at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the Chinese
University.
</P>
<P>
A release from the HKU said that the researchers adopted a
method developed by the University of Michigan in the survey and
found that the environmental protection index for Hong Kong is the
lowest of 39 countries and cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
Only 19 percent of the respondents to the survey consistently
expressed a high degree of support for environmental protection in
contrast to 69 percent in Sweden, 65 percent in Denmark, and 59
percent in Norway.
</P>
<P>
It said that in terms of Asia, Hong Kong's record remains
poor. China and India have recorded 52 percent and 45 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Explaining reasons for the low score, the release said that
firstly, 56 percent of the respondents were against paying higher
taxes to help prevent environmental pollution and secondly, 39
percent believed that environmental pollution is less serious than
often suggested.
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically the results also reveal that more than 80 percent
of respondents considered environmental pollution problems in Hong
Kong as urgent and 68 percent agreed that the government should
increase spending on tackling the problem, according to the
release.

<P>
Hong Kong, December 6 (Xinhua) -- ONFEM Holdings Ltd. announced
Thursday that it had acquired a 52 percent majority stake in Enful
Engineering Ltd., a major fire proofing materials producer in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the acquisition, ONFEM managing director Fang
Dacheng said, "Enful has an excellent business record with huge
growth potential," and "the addition of Enful will help reinforce
our foothold in the specialist contracting sector."
</P>
<P>
Established in 1988, Enful is engaged in the manufacturing,
distribution and installation of advanced passive fire proofing
materials both in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland. It has
captured 15 to 20 percent of the local market with annual turnover
nearly doubled in every two years.
</P>
<P>
Enful also operates a manufacturing plant in Dongguan,
Guangdong Province and has set up an office in Shanghai to
spearhead its penetration into the mainland market.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the support from ONFEM, Enful is going to "ride the
full crest of the market developments" in both the Chinese
mainland and Hong Kong, said Enful managing director Rony Kong.
</P>
<P>
Kong expected the local fire proofing materials market to grow
by 30 percent annually, while a greater demand for quality fire
proofing products on the mainland has resulted in increasing
potential and growth rate for that market.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Thailand Discuss Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Thailand are to
study the possibility of signing a free-trade agreement, which
would be the first between Israel and an Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post reported that the idea was mooted
during a meeting held this week between Industry and Trade
Ministry director-general Yehoshua Gleitman and his Thai
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
This would allow for an expansion of commercial ties and
increased industrial exports from Israel, Gleitman said, who just
came back from an East Asian tour which also took him to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Gleitman said that Israel and Thailand also agreed to establish
a joint economic committee to discuss improved trade links and to
begin making arrangements for business delegations to exchange
visits.
</P>
<P>
Exports from Israel to Thailand totaled 256 million
U.S. dollars last year, with imports of 161 million dollars. In
the first three quarters of this year, trade volume reached 372
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, tens of thousands of Thai workers,
along with other foreign labors, came to Israel to work on
farms and other areas, replacing Palestinians who were barred from
returning to their jobs due to the closure imposed by Israel on
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In June, Thailand's Labor and Social Affairs Minister Prasong
Boonpong said he intended to move his ministry's Middle East
labor attache to Israel from Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 companies from 18
countries and the Hong Kong region are participating in the Third
International Exhibition on Road and Water Transport Technology
and Equipment, which opened here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five-day event was organized by China's Ministry of
Communications (MOC). With an exhibition area of 12,000 square
meters, China Transpo '96 is the largest of the three exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
The show, held in Beijing every two years, aims to promote
exchange and cooperation between the transportation industries in
China and overseas, according to sources with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Apart from equipment and technology displays, technical
seminars, and business talks, a two-day symposium with the theme
"China's Transportation Development Towards the 21st Century" will
also be held.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium, representatives from the MOC, several
provincial communications departments, the China Ocean Shipping
(Group) Corp. and the China Merchant's Group will give speeches on
topics ranging from planning and strategies for construction of
national and regional highway and water transport facilities,
application of high and new technology in transportation, to
policies on investment and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
Special exhibition area will also be set up, where provincial
and regional communications departments can release information on
construction of transport facilities in their area, invite
business, and hold trade talks with overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of its transport infrastructure is a significant
part in China's modernization drive. By the end of 1995, China had
a total of 1.14 million kilometers of highways, including 2,141 km
of expressways. And there were 412 deep-water berths in its
seaports, while the total length of its inland waterways reached
110,000 km.
</P>
<P>
According to a development plan formulated by the MOC, China
will have 1.25 million km of highways by 2000, including four
trunk high-grade roads linking the nation from the north to the
south, and from the east to the west.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Chinese Power Plant's Efforts To Curb Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Guiyang Power Plant in the
capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province used to be
overloaded with coal cinder, which polluted urban environment
heavily, but now dust coal and coal cinder is put to good use.
</P>
<P>
The power plant draw up a series of policies to encourage use
of the dust coal, in 1989, and subsidized big users of the dust,
resulting in consumption of 165,000 tons of the stuff that year.
</P>
<P>
It provided free dust coal to neighboring farmers for improving
the soil, providing them with 26.7 hectares of additional
high-yield fields.
</P>
<P>
The plant offered free use of over 5,000 square meters of
production area to some of its customers who were having
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, consumption of dust coal has been rising at an
annual rate of some 100,000 tons. The first ten months of this
year saw more than 630,000 tons used.
</P>
<P>
While it has been encouraging others to use dust coal, the
plant has developed products itself. Annual production of 12
million bricks, for example, can use 60,000 tons of coal cinder.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that we have lost some money through these policies,
the market for dust coal and coal cinder products is open to us,
and we have saved more than 30 million yuan by not having to
provide fields for cinder piles," the director of the power plant
explained, adding that it is also helpful for pollution controls.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Wants New Force in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has
suggested forming a "reconnaissance force" to replace the
Operation Provide Comfort (OPC) force staying in Turkey for
protecting Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The "reconnaissance force" would be comprised of OPC's air
units to patrol the no-fly zone in northern Iraq, the local newspaper
Daily News here reported today.
</P>
<P>
The OPC force, whose current mandate will expire in two weeks,
is comprised of Turkish, U.S., British and French troops. It was
established in line with a Turkish parliamentary decision made on
January 17, 1991 and deployed at the Incirlik air base, southern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to provide air protection to the Kurds living
in northern Iraq against any possible action by the Iraqi
government in the wake of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has voiced his opposition to
the extension of the OPC mandate in view of the recent
developments in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, two main Kurdish warring factions in northern Iraq,
signed a U.S.-brokered peace accord in Ankara on October 31, one
week after a ceasefire was declared. In November, the two sides
reaffirmed their commitment to the ceasefire in a second round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that there was no further need for it to continue
to stay on the Turkish territories while Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller defends a new OPC extension in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The future of the OPC seemed to have also brought about fresh
disputes between Erbakan and Ciller.
</P>
<P>
In its latest meeting, Turkey's National Security Council
declined to give the cabinet an advisory opinion on whether or
not to extend the OPC mandate.
</P>
<P>
Many Turkish parliamentarians believed that the mandate of the
multilateral forces from major western powers, should not be
prolonged again.
</P>
<P>
However, America, the main player in brokering the ceasefire,
reportedly wanted the force to stay.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
in Washington Monday: "I had no indication that we let (Turks)
know that we don't want the OPC. On the contrary, we do want it to
continue.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Approves Deal With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan has signed a controversial deal with Israel to refit the
country's 54 F-4 fighter planes, the local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan signed the 600-million- U.S.-dollar deal Thursday, a
departure from his previous strong opposition to the contract with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Erbakan severely slammed the Turkish-Israeli
military deal on the grounds that the credit conditions will
raise the total cost to around 800 million dollars, warning that
it will harm Turkey's interests.
</P>
<P>
While signing the deal, the prime minister proposed to allow
maximum domestic participation in the program with Israel's
state-run Aircraft Industry (AI), a senior official source was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The local press said that Erbakan obviously wants to minimize
the costs of the contract.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Israel's AI will help Turkey upgrade
its 54 McDonnell Douglas-made F-4 fighters, including the
installation of Elta radars and electronic warfare and navigation
systems.
</P>
<P>
To date, two agreements have been signed between Turkey and
Israel, one on military training and the other on defense industry
cooperation, sparking worries in the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Some countries in the region accused Turkey of aligning with
the Jewish state. However, Turkey rebuffed the criticism earlier
this week, saying it was based on misunderstanding of the terms
of the agreements.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official on JLG 38th Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Jihua, senior Chinese
representative on the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), said
here today that Hong Kong residents' freedom on entering and
leaving the territory will be guaranteed after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the closing of the 38th JLG meeting
this afternoon, Zhao said that at the meeting, the two sides
reached agreement on most of the problems concerning the
definition of Hong Kong's permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides will redouble their efforts to reach
comprehensive consensus on the definition of Hong Kong's permanent
residents through informal exchange of views at the experts level
after this meeting.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that during the meeting, the Chinese side expressed
great concern with the British side unilaterally putting the draft
amendment to Crimes Ordinances to Hong Kong's Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British side had not consulted with the
Chinese side on the matter, which represented a major change to
the existing law enforced in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhao also accused the British Hong Kong authorities' attempt to
legislate on behalf of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
He said that the unilateral act of the British side is against
the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong
and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that such an act can never be accepted by the Chinese
side and the British side has to bear the serious consequences
arising therefrom.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side also expressed its sincere hope that
at the final phase of Hong Kong's transitional period, there
should be no more new disturbances and troubles, for that will be
in the interest of the smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that between the 37th and 38th JLG meetings, the two
sides had achieved some major progress in their agreement on Hong
Kong's handover ceremony, transfer of HK's Exchange Fund, Hong
Kong-Japan air services, surrender of fugitive offenders between
Hong Kong and the Philippines, contracts on new airport
franchises, and localization of law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese side expects the British counterpart
to be earnest and practical in the talks on the subject of
transfer of archives, government assets, and Hong Kong's defense
and public security.
</P>
<P>
On the question of a small advance party from the Chinese
Liberation Army (PLA) into Hong Kong before July 1, 1997, Zhao
stressed that it is a question concerning the smooth transfer of
government and urged the British side to be practical towards the
issue.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from Cambodia,
China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and the United Nations signed here
today a project document designed to strengthen cooperation in
anti-drug law enforcement operations in the Mekong subregion.
</P>
<P>
Christian Kornevall, an official from the U.N. Drug Control
Program (UNDCP), said at the signing ceremony that the project
would energize drug control efforts by strengthening the essential
link between the drug control legislation and law enforcement
operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N.-sponsored project, practical mechanisms and
techniques, such as controlled deliveries, will be developed to
check illicit drug shipment with a view to apprehending organizers
of the shipment rather than just petty criminals, said Kornevall,
director of the UNDCP Operational Activities and External
Relations.
</P>
<P>
The three-year 900,000-U.S.-dollar project is one of the 11
projects that comprise a subregional action plan for drug control
approved last year by ministers of Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar,
Thailand, Vietnam and the UNDCP.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 11 projects provides collaboration between
governments in drug demand reduction, drug law enforcement and
provision of alternative means of livelihood for opium producing
communities.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar failed to send a representative as scheduled to sign
the document today because of "internal procedure problems," said
UNDCP officials. They added, however, that they believed the
country would sign the pact soon.

CAIRO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- President Hosni Mubarak has invited Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to meet in
Cairo to solve their disputes over Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled for Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in Gaza Thursday that he was ready to meet
Netanyahu to discuss their problems, while Netanyahu's spokesman
MIchael Scholtz said that there was no plan for such a meeting so
far.
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister Amr Mousa said Thursday that the Israeli
withdrawal from Hebron is necessary but it is not the whole
issue. Any talk about the creation of an organization on
security and cooperation in the Middle East should answer hundreds
of questions.
</P>
<P>
Such an organization would naturally include Israel, Iran and
Turkey and there are problems and disputes with Iran that should
be resolved first, he added.
</P>

Al-Akhbar:

Arab interior ministers will gather in Tunis next month to map
out the Arab strategy on combatting terrorism.

</P>

<HEADLINE> Economic Aspects Most Visible in Rise of Malaysia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today nothing is more visible in the
rise of Malaysia and Singapore than economic aspects.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth of the two countries is dependent as well
as on the ability for Malaysia and Singapore to keep pace with
global shift to new economic structure powered by brains rather
than brawn, he said while opening the three-day Sixth
Malaysia-Singapore Forum at Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
The annual forum organized by Universiti Malaya (Malaya
University) with the theme "Three Decades of Malaysia-Singapore
Relations, 1966-1996" this time is to forge closer relationship
between the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of both Universiti
Malaya and the National University of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said there was a variety of circumstances which accounted
for the stupendous growth that the two countries had achieved in
the past 30 years and there was no denying that the role of
leadership had been most crucial in nation-building or social
engineering.
</P>
<P>
The very leaders who pioneered and championed the course of
merger, separation of Singapore and Malaysia have also been at the
helm of power for the past three decades and have been
instrumental for the various successes achieved by the two
countries, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said that statesmen and politicians had not solely been
responsible for the success of Malaysia and Singapore as the whole
enterprise had also been shared by academicians, intellectuals
and writers.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that present and later generations of Malaysians and
Singaporeans must not only understand or derive lessons from the
past but to use them as building blocks for their future destiny.
</P>
<P>
Anwar hoped the forum would bring forward more creative and
novel ideas which might be used as inputs in national planning
and foreign policies of both Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Universiti Malaya Vice-Chancellor Abdullah Sanusi
Ahmad said Singapore is so closely linked to Malaysia
geographically, historically, culturally, politically and
economically that it was important for both countries to restate
that relationship.

<HEADLINE> Bacteriologic Warfare by Japanese Aggressor Troops Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A recent field study by a group
of Japanese researchers confirms that the Japanese aggressor
troops waged a bacteriologic warfare in China during the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
The study, carried out by Japanese professors, proved that the
cereals air-dropped in November 1941 by Japanese troops in the
city of Changde in the central Chinese province of Hunan carried
plague bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The group, named the Society of Investigating the History of
Bacteriologic Warfare by Japanese Troops, was led by Osamu
Fujimoto, honorary professor of the University of Shizuoka.
</P>
<P>
The investigators managed to find Wang Zhengyu, who was working
during the wartime in a local hospital set up by an American
Christian organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the 80-year-old Wang, the hospital found plague
bacteria in the air-dropped sorghum, soybeans, millet and other
grains immediately after they were gathered by local residents and
police.
</P>
<P>
The same bacteria were also detected in the blood of the first
local victim and the internal organs of dead rats, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
The group also visited relatives of two victims of the
bacteriologic warfare. Nie Jialin, 63, told the investigators
that the elder brother of his father became sick with swelling
lymph nodes one week after the airdrop and died four or five days
later.
</P>
<P>
Takao Matsumura, an economics professor with the Japanese
University of Keio and a member of the study group, said the
discovery is important for exposing crimes committed by the
Japanese troops in waging a bacteriologic warfare in China and for
understanding the sufferings inflicted upon the Chinese people.

office stationery for two years.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Advises Dhaka to Abolish 7 Departments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has advised the
Bangladeshi government to abolish seven of its departments which
it said are draining public money to no purpose at all, according
to a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has been spending at least 1 billion
taka (about 23.25 million U.S. dollars) annually on these
departments whose functions are of no essential use for the state
and the citizens, the World Bank said in the report.
</P>
<P>
The departments in concern are those of cooperatives, manpower
employment and training, printing and stationery, meteorology,
soil survey, supply, and prices and market intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has also advised the government to downsize the
Registration Department in a bid to cut its budgetary expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi Department of Cooperatives has a staff of 4,700
and spends 270 million taka (about 6.3 million U.S. dollars) a
year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that most of the cooperatives in the country are
in a dysfunctional state, reflecting both the failure of the
department as a regulator and the incompetence of
government-sponsored cooperatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Tourism
and Wildlife Darius Mbela said that renewed trade in Ivory
will spell doom for the endangered species of elephant,
" Kenya Times " reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mbela said that although the rising elephant
population had increased pressure on land utilization in some
African countries, relaxation of the ban of ivory trade could open
loopholes for poaching elephants.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks on Thursday while meeting Edward
Chindori-Chinga, the Zimbabwean Deputy Minister for Environment and
Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Chindori-Chinga said that Zimbabwe,
Botswana and Namibia had taken a joint stand to commercialize
their ivory stocks.
</P>
<P>
The position of the three neighboring countries will be
tabled for consideration during the forthcoming Convention for
International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES) meeting to be
held in Harare next June, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chindori-Chinga stressed that the three countries would sell
only legally acquired stocks to Japan on terms agreeable to all
CITES parties.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe currently has one of the highest elephant population
in Africa with the herds numbering more than 74,000.
</P>
<P>
Due to the increase in the elephant population, Zimbabwe
will be probably allowed to sell some of the elephant stocks and
ivory products.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Boost China's Rural Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Small rural towns in China are
no longer as economically backward and culturally undeveloped as
they once were, and are turning out to be important bases for
boosting rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
Presently, small towns account for one fourth of the country's
total GDP (the value of goods and services produced), and one
quarter of the State's financial revenues.
</P>
<P>
China has so far developed 55,000 small rural towns, which set
up over 50,000 specialized and wholesale markets and achieved an
annual trade volume of more than 450 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China as a whole has developed one million township-run
enterprises, each of which scores an annual output value exceeding
500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the small rural towns nationwide
employ a total of 150 million farmers who work for various
township-run enterprises, contributing over 70 percent to the
country's total rural output value.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the remaining years of this century, an annual
average of seven to eight million surplus rural laborers will be
employed by these towns.
</P>
<P>
Tian Shiyu, director of the Department of Village and Town
Construction under the Ministry of Construction, noted that the
mushrooming small towns have greatly boosted rural economic
prosperity and quickened the pace of the country's urbanization.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of small towns not only absorb large
numbers of surplus rural laborers, but also stimulate the
restructuring of agriculture. In addition, they play an important
role in preventing the random migration of the rural population to
big cities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 60 percent of the country's 20
million township-run enterprises are concentrated in the small
country towns.
</P>
<P>
In the developed areas there have emerged a large number of
enterprise groups with an annual output value exceeding one
billion yuan or several billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
These towns have distinguished themselves in economic
development, promoting industry, commerce, tourism and farm
and side-line products.
</P>
<P>
The farmers in the Zhujiang River Delta and the Yangtze River
Delta as well as in the provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Shandong,
Liaoning and Sichuan, have effectively quickened urbanization,
while giving priority to the development of Sino-foreign joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of small towns has also contributed
greatly to the cultural, educational and scientific undertakings
in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
In line with the State's goal of developing rural towns, China
will relocate another 30 million rural surplus laborers to small
towns over the next five years and give priority to developing
10,000 key small towns nationwide, in a bid to boost rural social
and economic development to a new high.

MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine presidential decree
today ordered the establishment of a committee to review cases of
overseas Filipinos given life imprisonment or heavier sentences by
foreign courts.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said he made the decision after the
Department of Foreign Affairs recommended presidential
intercession for possible commutation of death sentences passed to
overseas Filipino workers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos stressed that "there is a need to give more attention not
only to overseas Filipino workers who have been meted the death
penalty, but also to other Filipinos abroad who have been
convicted or sentenced to unusual punishments and life
imprisonment."
</P>
<P>
The inter-agency committee, to be headed by the justice
secretary as chairman and the foreign affairs secretary as
vice-chairman, will comprise the labor and employment secretary,
the Philippine overseas employment administrator, the overseas
welfare workers administrator and the solicitor general.
</P>

<P>
Yinchuan, December 6 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan have
developed desert utilization methods to help other countries in
the struggle against desertification.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China, where a
60.34-ha model experiment zone was set up three years ago, was the
first to benefit from the project. The dry and sandy zone has been
transformed into an oasis, with forest and grass coverage there
having risen to 85.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Results of the test showed that the supply of nutriments in the
experiment zone exceeded demand, and that the zone could sustain
development. Both Chinese and Japanese scientists said they
believe that the methods can be applied in northwest China and in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 210 million ha of desertified areas. The
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is hemmed in deserts on three sides,
and the desertified land makes up 32 percent of its total area.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Stock Markets Report Major Downslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's stock exchanges in
Dhaka and Chittagong witnessed a major downslide in the price
index throughout the week ending Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures published today, the Dhaka Stock
Exchange (DSE) marked a drastic fall of 366.2 points from the
balance of 3,033.36 in the previous week while the Chittagong
Stock Exchange (CSE) index declined by 156 points to 1,359.85.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the traded issues at the two exchanges
incurred losses on each day of the week and more than 50 percent
of the listed issues could not be exchanged due to the moribund
participation of buyers.
</P>
<P>
The recent downward trend was the result of major corrections
in the previously overheated issues, DSE Chairman Imtiaz Hossain
explained. He expressed the hope for the market to be firmer after
the corrections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, small investors in the curb market in front of both
stock exchanges have continued their agitation, demanding stable
and transparent stock dealings.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Issue 10,000-Lev Bank-note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB)
announced on TV Thursday that a big denomination bank-note of
10,000-Lev will enter the country's currency market on December 9.
</P>
<P>
The new note will help simplify payment, as the exchange rate
between Lev, Bulgaria's national currency, and foreign currencies
has fallen sharply, said the BNB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The largest face value of Lev has so far been 5,000.
</P>
<P>
By December 5, the Lev was reported to have devaluated again by
more than 70 percent, with the exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar falling to 420 from 260 a month ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the government will take measures to control the
devaluation of Lev because the country's foreign reserve has
decreased to 525 million U.S. dollars, the Bulgarian Telegraph
Agency quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition to putting more foreign currencies into the market,
the BNB will, in accordance with the Bank Law, strengthen
supervision over the operations of the commercial banks which are
allowed to deal in foreign currencies, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria had an inflation rate of around 220 percent at the end
of November. At present Lev is being devaluated by 30 percentage
points a day.

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Nurses at Lesotho
government hospitals have called off their month-long wage
strike, said sources reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday in Maseru, capital of the
kingdom, the Lesotho Nurses' Association (LNA) said the decision
was taken in the light of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle's appeal
and a pledge that their grievances would be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, nurses went on strike to support LNA's
demands for higher salaries and better working conditions,
including the provision of risk allowances for night duty and a
supply of adequate equipment and uniforms, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the LNA, the strikers had taken into
consideration that some of their grievances may not be met at
once due to Lesotho's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The strike caused serious disruption to the services at
government hospitals, with patients being transferred to less
active hospitals in outlying districts from overcrowded
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Some patients were even transferred by relatives to
neighbouring South Africa for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked kingdom within South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Highway Builders Seeking Funds on Overseas Stock Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Inspired by the recent
successful listing of Anhui Expressway Company Ltd. on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange, more Chinese road building companies are
expected to raise much-needed funds on overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
As the first Chinese road builder listed outside the mainland,
the Anhui Expressway, which raised 872.6 million Hong Kong dollars
last month in Hong Kong, has paved the way for other Chinese
companies to seek funds to accommodate the highway construction
boom, analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shui, chairman of the Anhui Expressway, told Xinhua that
he is satisfied with the performance of his company's stocks in
Hong Kong, and is confident about the firm's future on the market.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Wensheng, director of the Restructuring
Economic System and Legislation Department of the Ministry of
Communications, to issue shares on overseas stock markets is a new
decision made by the Chinese government to replenish the short
supply of funds needed for highway construction.
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that there is a shortage of funds has
prompted the government to be cautious in its commitment to inject
large amounts of money for the further development and completion
of China's highway network, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 65 billion US dollars of funds are
needed for China's highway construction in the coming five years,
and shortfalls will be as large as 15 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, minister of communications, said China hopes
that overseas investment can contribute about 10 percent of the
funds needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
While there have been three major sources of funding for
China's highway construction, including central and local
government investment, domestic and foreign loans and a few direct
foreign investments, the sources are not likely to expand
dramatically in the short run, so establishing new means of
funding is an urgent task, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
To do so, China began to probe the viability of raising road
construction funds by way of the country's stocks exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 and 1994, the Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway Company
Ltd. issued a total of 500 million legal-person shares.
</P>
<P>
In July, the Guangdong Expressway Development Company
Ltd. issued 135 million B shares for overseas investment in China,
raising 483 million yuan (58.192 million US dollars) of funds.
</P>
<P>
The following month, the stocks began trading on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange, thus becoming the first listed highway stock in
China.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Expressway Company Ltd. of Guangdong Province is
the second authorized company that plans to issue shares and be
listed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, several other Chinese highway firms have filed
applications for overseas listing. They include the
Chengdu-Chongqing Expressway Company of Sichuan Province, the
Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway Company, and the
Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway Company.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the Chinese government has always valued
the development of highways, as they are the most commonly-used
means of transport.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will set aside ten million yuan in the next five years to
encourage young scientists to work in western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy CAS President Bai Chunli, the money will be
spent on a program called "Light in the West," which was designed
to train 100 young science research groups in western China.
</P>
<P>
CAS has five research institutes in western China. At present,
50 percent of the researchers and 20 percent of the senior
scholars in the institutes are under the age of 45, including many
world-famous scientists.
</P>
<P>
However, the harsh living and working conditions in the west
will make it difficult to attract talented young people to
participate in the program, Bai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Light in the West" is CAS's first regional personnel training
effort. Under the plan, CAS will allocate two million yuan
annually to support some 20 science research groups, which will
focus their study on local development.

<HEADLINE> Qinshan Becomes Major Nuclear Power Base in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Qinshan Nuclear Power
Plant, the first of its kind completely designed and built by
China itself, has become an important nuclear power base for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the first phase of the plant, a 300,000 kw
prototype nuclear reactor located on the east coast of Zhejiang
Province, started in March 1985 and was completed in December
1991. The second phase of the project is now under construction,
and the third phase is in the preparatory stage.
</P>
<P>
Once the third phase is completed, the plant is expected to
have a designed generating capacity of 2.9 million kw to three
million kw, according to sources at the plant.
</P>
<P>
The first phase went into trial operation in 1993, and since
then it has been operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The power plant generated 1.7 billion kwh, 1.8 billion kwh
and 2.2 billion kwh of electricity and operated at 66 percent, 68
percent and 84 percent of its capacity in 1993, 1994 and 1995,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year it generated 2.8 billion
kwh, meeting the advanced world standards.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October this year, the plant had generated a
total of eight billion kwh and had changed nuclear materials twice.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great significance to
environmental protection. A sound waste-disposal system has
been designed for the power plant, and it has been functioning well
from the very beginning. The annual discharge of waste material is
far less than the amount allowed by the national standards.
</P>
<P>
The design, construction and readjustment of the first phase
have been successful, and the operation is safe and economically
efficient, according to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the first and second phases trained
a large number of technicians, and the project headquarters
plans to form its third nuclear power company with the staff of
the first two phases as the mainstay.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, during the first phase Chinese experts
trained 3,928 persons for Pakistan's Chashma Nuclear
Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, two 600,000-kw pressurized water
reactors will be installed in the second phase, which started in
July 1996 and is expected to be completed within 72 months. These
two units are scheduled to be put into operation in the years 2002
and 2003, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, China plans to introduce some softwares
regarding the design of nuclear power stations from abroad and to
consult with foreign experts when necessary, but the units will be
independently designed by Chinese engineers.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the second phase marks China's advance
in the independent building of nuclear power plants, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The third phase, the Qinshan Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor
Power Plant, will be built jointly by China and Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently-signed Sino-Canadian agreement, the
construction of the third phase will begin in January 1997 and two
700 mw nuclear power units will be installed in January and
October 2003, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Maradona "A Person in Danger", Says Psychologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer star
Diego Maradona is "a person in danger", said Jose Alberto Fredda,
president of the Argentine Association of Sports Psychology.
</P>
<P>
"Finished for soccer, he might suffer a definitive crisis of
his emotional stability. That is the reason he is a man in
danger," said the psychologist.
</P>
<P>
Fredda, quoted by the Telam news agency, said he didn't dismiss
the possibility that Maradona might down an overdose of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
However, psychologist said he didn't believe the soccer star
would fall into suicide.
</P>
<P>
"Maradona is a person with phobias. He is afraid of being
alone. He is afraid of the unconscious and feels the need of
having people around, although sometimes he would be better off
alone with himself," said the specialist.
</P>
<P>
The psychologist attributed Maradona's problem to the fact that
he rose too fast from his humble origins to become rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
"But his development as a sportsman and his extraordinary
psychomotor ability is not matched by a similar ability to
metabolize the sudden change in surroundings and life," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Fredda, Maradona is exposed to three possible
risks: a violent attitude toward the rest of the people, and
consequently the possibility of this violence to take him directly
to prison; a deep depression, or an overdose.
</P>
<P>
Fredda said that with the present situation of his friend and
agent Guillermo Coppola, who is in jail for illegal possesion of
drugs, Maradona "is worse off" now.
</P>
<P>
Jose Alberto Fredda was one of those who visited Maradona when
he was in prison in 1991 for possession of drugs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's 1st Light Rail System to Start Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's first Light
Rail Transit (LRT) system will start its commercial service in the
capital city of Kuala Lumpur on December 16 after nine days of
free public ride beginning Saturday, the system's concessionaire
holder, STAR Chairman Sallehuddin Mohamed, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The service will be provided on Phase I of the LRT system which
covers 12 kilometers and 13 stations with the fare ranging from 75
sen (about 30 U.S. cents) to 2.95 ringgit (about 1.18 U.S.
dollars), Sallehuddin told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The Phase I service, for which 17 train sets with 34 light rail
vehicles are to be commissioned, could move 16,000 passengers per
hour per direction at five-minute intervals, Sallehuddin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the free rides for the public would run from 6:00
to 24:00 and that passengers would be able to travel the
12-kilometer stretch within 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
STAR, which was given the concession in December 1992 to build,
own and operate Phase I and II of the LRT system, completed Phase
I five months ahead of schedule at a cost of 1.27 billion ringgit
(about 508 million U.S. dollars), said Sallehuddin.
</P>
<P>
Phase II is a 15-kilometer extension of Phase 1, costing 2.23
billion ringgit (about 892 million U.S. dollars) and comprising
Section A, to be completed by July 1998 before the Commonwealth
Games, and Section B, to be completed by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sallehuddin said the service frequency would be further
improved when Phase II is completed to allow two-minute intervals
and increased capacity of 33,000 passengers per hour per
direction. A total of 56 train sets with 90 light rail vehicles
would be in operation by then.
</P>
<P>
The company projected a 200,000-person daily passenger flow
with an average fare of 1.50 ringgit (about 60 U.S. cents) per
passenger for the first year of its operations.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian capital city is facing a serious traffic jam
problem and the LRT system is expected to help ease the burden to
some extent.

<HEADLINE> Qingdao City Attracts ROK Business People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Qingdao City in east
China's Shandong Province has become one of the most attractive
cities in China to investors from the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
By the end of September this year ROK business people had set
up 840 joint ventures in the city. They involve a contracted ROK
investment of 1.52 billion US dollars, one quarter of the total
ROK investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the boom in these joint ventures to
the city's geographical access to the ROK. The two sides are well
linked by air, ship and seabed cable.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao is one of five biggest ports in China and a key
international container transit harbor. Convenient transportation
facilities have created good conditions for the exchange of personnel
and materials between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the favorable investment environment makes the city an
appealing place, according to Wang Yan, head of the city's Council
for the Promotion of International Trade.
</P>
<P>
Some leading corporations from the ROK, such as the Hyundai Group,
the Samsung Group and the Ssangyong Business Group have made their
presence felt in the city.

YANGON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar today officially handed
over to the United States the remains of the U.S. Air Force C-47
crew and parts of the wreckage of the plane which had crashed in
Myanmar during the Second World War.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albania Sees Poor Economic Situation in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 is a difficult one
for Albania's economy as it declined somewhat in the process of
market-oriented reform.
</P>
<P>
The nation's gross domestic production growth for the year will
hardly be close to 1995's 13.4 percent, with financial deficit
expected to hit the mark of 260 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was expected to jump to 20-plus percent,
from 13.7 percent in 1994 and 5.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, mining and mineral processing
industries are examples of poor performance, with output of
chromium, the main industrial output of Albania, expected to reach
220,000 tons and chromium export 140,000 tons, both below those of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum yield could remain at 500,000-ton level, yet not
enough even to satisfy half of the national petroleum needs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade volume reached 800 million U.S. dollars in the
first nine months, equal to that of the whole 1995, but the
country already incurred a deficit as big as 400 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though corn harvest could register 70,000 tons this year, a
marginal increase from last year, wheat production would only be
300,000 tons, a 90,000-ton drop from 1995, due to decreased
growing areas and shortfalls of fertilizers, quality seeds and
irrigation equipment.
</P>
<P>
The country still needs to buy food and meat products abroad as
its total food production lags behind 1995's level 610,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the electric power generation would rise to six
billion kilowatts, one billion kilowatts up from last year, and
industries of construction materials and food processing would
also see a rising trend.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the unsatisfactory economic situation to
political struggles in the parliamentary and local elections and
to the difficulty in the nation's transition to a market-oriented
economy.
</P>
<P>
They predict that the Albanian economy could only rebound to
the level before the 1989 dramatic political change by the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Agriculture Minister Faces Corruption Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's governmental
corruption control body has filed legal cases against Agriculture
Minister Padma Sunder Lawati at the Appellate Court here for his
alleged involvement in fertilizer deal scandals, the local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)
Thursday accused Minister Lawati and other 11 senior officials of
carrying out financial irregularities in three fertilizer deals
separately, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The cases against them were filed based on the investigation of
the CIAA on three different deals of fertilizer import, a CIAA
official said.
</P>
<P>
The six-month long investigation by the CIAA has found that
Minister Lawati and other officials had abused their authority and
been involved in corruption, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the CIAA has demanded five years of jail term and 68.6
million rupees (over 1 million US dollars) in fines for the
minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Minister Lawati and other officials
were found having swindled some 31,500 dollars in a fertilizer
deal with a British company last January.
</P>
<P>
The minister was also found being involved in a scandal
concerning a 3 million dollar deal with an American supplier in
March 1996, he added.
</P>
<P>
Minister Lawati is the first cabinet member to be investigated
on corruption charges by the anti-corruption commission in Nepal
after the Supreme Court recently lifted the restriction to probe
into cases involving highest officials of the government.

TOKYO, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Japan is to provide an emergency
aid package worth 21.42 million U.S. dollars for refugees trapped
in eastern Zaire, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The decision came in the wake of the appeal of the United
Nations last month to gather some 300 million dollars in food,
medical and other supplies for Rwandan refugees and Zaireans
afflicted with armed conflicts in the region, the Japanese
national news agency Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
About 5.5 million dollars of the package will go to the Office

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Supply 35 Pc of World Rubber Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, one of the world's
largest rubber producers, is expected to supply 35 percent of the
global demand for rubber by the year 2005, an official said.
</P>
<P>
R. Susila, an executive of the Indonesian Rubber Producers
Association said Thursday in Medan, West Java, that the marketing
of Indonesian rubber will have bright prospects by the next
century, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the world rubber demand will outstrip its
production by the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, the world was short of 4 million tons of rubber
in line with the increasing demand for the commodity in North
America, Western Europe and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said last year, world rubber consumption reached a record
high of 5.91 million tons, surpassing global production of 5.87
million tons.
</P>
<P>
To capitalize on the world rubber market by the next century,
Indonesia needs to improve the quality of its rubber, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia exported 1.3 million tons of rubber in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which last year exported 1.63 million tons of rubber,
is now listed as the world's biggest rubber exporter.

SHANGHAI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- One section of the Yangtze
River channel near its mouth was having its course changed, as of
December 3, the Shanghai Marine Safety Supervision Bureau has
announced.
</P>
<P>
The change is necessary because the spread of shoals has
blocked navigation on an eight-nautical-mile Beicao (North Trough)
stretch of the river, which is China's longest.
</P>
<P>
The move meant that navigation markers also had to be adjusted
to fit the change in the channel, with five older lights being
removed and replaced by seven new ones.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslims Demand Independent Islamic State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 Muslims
rallied in a southern Philippine town for three days running to
Thursday, demanding the secession of Mindanao Island in the south
of the country, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said delegates presented some 20 resolutions
seeking the total independence of Mindanao to a three-day "Muslim
Consultative Assembly" in Sultan Kudarat in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the rally were quoted as saying that these
resolutions would be soon presented to President Fidel Ramos, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and various
separatist fronts in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the resolutions all expressed
non-recognition of the Philippine Constitution and asked the
government to allow the establishment of an "independent Islamic
state" in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Noel Detoyato, spokesman for the Army's Sixth Infantry that
sent a contingent to provide security for the assembly, declined
to comment on the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the military's only problem was the "traffic jam that
the assembly created."
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Hector Villanueva told a local radio station
that Ramos would study the results of the gathering "to see what
we can do."
</P>
<P>
Mindanao, home to most of the 3.5 million Philippine Muslims,
had witnessed nearly 30 years of war between government troops and
various Muslim separatist groups.
</P>
<P>
Peace returned to much of the island after the government
signed a peace deal with the then biggest rebel Muslim group, the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), in early September.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal, the Autonomous Region of Muslim
Maguindanao, now including only four provinces, will extend to
other 10 southern provinces three years later.
</P>
<P>
But the peace deal was opposed by both Christians on the island
and some radical Muslim separatist groups, including the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, at least 11 people were killed in renewed
fighting between government troops and MILF guerrillas.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Legacy Committee
of the United Nations Education, Science, and Culture Organization
(UNESCO) decided today to add five new natural sites to the list
of the World Legacy.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the committee's 20th meeting held in
the city of Merida, 2,500 kilometers east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The five new sites are the Barrier Reef of Belize, The "W"
National Park of Niger, the Okapi Wildlife Reserve of Zaire and
the Kamchatcka Volcanos and Lake Baikal of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Natural sites protected by UNESCO throughout the world total
107 with the five newcomers.
</P>
<P>
The Belize Barrier Reef is considered the biggest in the
northern hemisphere and illustrates the history of the evolution
of reefs, explained the committee.
</P>
<P>
The reserve also provides an important environment for
threatened species, such as sea turtles, manatees and the American
sea crocodile.
</P>
<P>
Lake Baikal and the Kamchatka Volcanos are located in the
southeast of Siberia, Russia, covering a 31,500-square-kilometer
area.
</P>
<P>
The 25-million-year-old lake, with the depth of 1,700 meters,

and is one of the most outstanding for biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
The "W" National Park of Niger is in a transition area between
savanna and clear forests, in a humid region needed for the
survival of several species of western Africa wildlife.
</P>

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
(EU) is Colombia's second biggest commercial partner, just after
the United States, the National Customs and Taxes Department
(Dian) says.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 15 EU countries have concentrated their imports
from the South American country in coffee, coal, flowers, bananas,
and iron-nickel ore, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Germany had become an exclusive buyer of Colombian coffee due
to tariff preferences granted to the aromatic grain under an
Andean preferences system framework, while Colombia imported from
Germany machinery and instruments.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's trade with Britain showed variety in past years and
Britain was now a big importer of coal and flowers.
</P>
<P>
France, Colombia'd third biggest trade partner in the EU,
mainly imported Colombian coffee, coal, iron-nickel ore, seafood
and aquaculture products.
</P>
<P>
Italian-Colombian trade stalled in 1996, after a three-year
growth in Italian imports, which reached 267 million U.S. dollars
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Spain, the EU country most closely linked to Colombia, imported
a variety of products, especially shrimp and coal.

<HEADLINE> New Immigration Accord Likely Between U.S., Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Cuba have
agreed to work on a new immigration accord under which Washington
would repatriate all Cubans who have landed illegally in the U.S.,
not just those intercepted at sea, a senior Cuban official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement, if reached, would represent a complete
reversal of a decades-old U.S. policy of accepting most illegal
immigrants from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The two sides just ended a two-day meeting focused on
immigration issues here.
</P>
<P>
Washington has told Havana that it is considering the
possibility of a new agreement, Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban parliament
leader and head of the Cuban delegation, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"It was a U.S. suggestion," he said, adding that "let's hope
this new agreement could emerge from the next round (of talks)."
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State John Hamilton, head of the
U.S. delegation, didn't go so far as to say the two sides have
reached an agreement on the forging of a new accord.
</P>
<P>
But he said Washington is prepared to return illegal Cuban
immigrants so long as Cuba is ready to accept them.
</P>
<P>
As a ploy to nurture anti-Havana forces, the United States had
encouraged illegal immigrants from Cuba. But it was forced to sign
immigration agreements with Havana in September 1994 and May 1995
after the U.S. shore was flooded by more than 30,000 Cuban rafters
in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, the U.S. ended a decades-old policy of
accepting Cubans rescued at sea, and agreed to issue at least
20,000 visas for legal Cuban immigrants each year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks were the highest-level contact between the
two hostile countries since the Cuban Air Force shot down two
small planes owned by U.S.-based anti-Cuban people in February.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were normally held every three to six months,
were delayed by the downing of the planes and Washington's
toughening of the trade embargo against Cuba after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Washington has imposed economic sanctions on the Caribbean
island nation since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The last immigration talks were held last November.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to continue their talks in three to
four months.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Indonesia's Car Policy to Go On: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will continue its
dialogue with countries opposed to its national car policy,
Industry and Trade Minister Tungky Ariwibowo said here Thursday,
according to official sources from the ministry today.
</P>
<P>
"I will hold bilateral talks with the trade ministers of
countries which are against our national car policy during the
World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Singapore," said
Ariwibowo.
</P>
<P>
He said the differences between Indonesia and the other
countries could be settled not only through the official WTO forum
but also through bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government ruled in February that producers of a
national car would be granted exemption of import duties and
luxury taxes. These taxes normally add about 60 percent to car
prices in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States and the European Union (EU),
protesting Indonesia's national car policy which they say breaches
international trade rules, filed complaints with the WTO in
October, demanding that Indonesia revoke its policy.
</P>
<P>
There is a 60-day consultation period with Indonesia before
they can request that an arbitration panel examine the case.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has just completed the second round of talks with
Japan to no avail, while its talks with the U.S. and EU are
expected to end this week.

<HEADLINE> Long History Of Concern For Wildlife In Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolians in north China
have treasured wildlife since ancient times and did not hunt
indiscriminately, according to a young Chinese scholar.
</P>
<P>
A custom of decrees about wildlife protection began to take
shape among the Mongolians in the eighth or early ninth century,
according to Wang Fenglei, a scholar at Inner Mongolia Normal
University.
</P>
<P>
Genghis Khan, in his "Grand Code", decreed that "Those who
light a fire on the soil when the grass begins to grow will be
executed together with their family members."
</P>
<P>
Wang believes that the code protected wildlife habitats, and
therefore wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Genghis Khan's successors also placed importance on wildlife
protection. Kublai Khan, the first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty,
adopted 23 laws, rules and regulations relating to wildlife
protection.
</P>
<P>
In the Yuan Dynasty, animals such as boars, deer, and some rare
birds were put under strict protection during a part of the year
when hunting was forbidden.
</P>
<P>
The protection of birds such as the swan and wild duck also
benefited agriculture, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Mongolians today place more importance on wildlife
protection. Five national nature reserves and seven regional
reserves have been set up in the region, which is mainly inhabited
by the Mongolian ethnic group.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Petroleum Consumption Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's petroleum
consumption for the first 10 months of this year averaged 883,130
barrels per day, up 10.3 percent over the same period last year,
local newspaper the Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand was quoted as saying that
the country's average consumption of oil-based products in this
period rose 10.2 percent over the corresponding period last year
to 723,750 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of diesel reached 306,250 barrels a day, up 14.2
percent, while that of fuel oil 171,340 barrels a day, up 3.7
percent. Benzene consumption was recorded at 118,290 barrels a

barrels a day, up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Longest River To Remain Open During Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts are making a
major effort to reduce the negative impact on navigation of the
gigantic Three Gorges Dam Project, especially during the
river-blocking stage, scheduled from 1997 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
During that period, vessels will have to use temporary channels
and locks that will have an adverse effect on navigation, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, river boats are expected to transport 4.3 million
passengers and over 13 million tons of goods a year, so local
water-transport authorities are taking steps to increase the
handling capacity of the temporary channels during the period, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 3,407-m-long temporary channels will have different
conditions because the water-volume varies with the seasons.
</P>
<P>
Faster vessels, like passenger ships and tourist boats, will be
allowed to pass through the channels unassisted, while other ships
will have to reduce their load, and some will require the
assistance of tugboats or winching stations, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
The navigation authorities have designed a dispatch network to
ensure smooth movement on the river, and some departments, such as
the police, port authorities, and the telecommunications
department, are busy trying to solve the blocking problem.
</P>
<P>
Lighthouses and mooring spots have been selected, and
departments are working on renovating existing vessels to make
them more suitable for operations during the blocking period,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
"In the long view, the Three Gorges Project is good for
navigation, because navigation conditions will be much improved
once the project is completed," said senior engineer Li Junlin, of
the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Since many treacherous places in the river will be covered by
rising waters after of the dam is built, ships of more than
10,000 DWT will be able to go to Chongqing, in the southwest,
something that only 3,000-DWT vessels can do now, he noted.

PRAGUE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel has
developed a slight pneumonia following surgery to remove a
cancerous lung tumor earlier this week, a chief surgeon said on

<P>
In Monday's operation, doctors removed a 15 millimeter long
malignant tumor along with half of Havel's right lung.

<HEADLINE> UN Leader Againsts Germany's Withdraw From UNIDO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Vice Secretary-General
of the U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
Karl Theodor Paschke, of Germany, said today that he did not agree
with the German government's plan to withdraw from UNIDO.
</P>
<P>
Paschke said that Germany's plan to withdraw contradicted its
stands to support the South-North policy, adding that the
reformed UNIDO would become a more effective supporter to the
industrial development of the third world countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany, a strong supporter of the United Nations, planned to
pull out of UNIDO because of deep budget cuts in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
German Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said last
month that shortfalls in the 1997 budget had forced him to opt for
withdraw, the first time Bonn would quit a U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the withdrawal plan would be announced by
the end of the year and would go into effect next year.

surviving a crisis when he was a game and 14-15 down.
</P>
<P>
Eyles had a more comfortable passage through to the

an outstanding attacking display, scoring heavily at the front
with drops and frustrating his opponent into an outburst of
ill-temper on the penultimate point.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Eases Water Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the coastal city of
Xiamen in Fujian Province, in east China, no longer have to use
bottled mineral water when they rinse their mouths out.
</P>
<P>
The city, one of China's first special economic zones, is on an
island surrounded by the sea, and has long been short of fresh
water. The city's barber shops used to have to give residents a
haircut without a wash during peak water-consumption times in
summer.
</P>
<P>
The city government invested a total 1.1 billion yuan (132
million US dollars) in a water control project, bringing water
from the Jiulong River, some 50 km from the city, to alleviate the
water shortage it has had since 1978.
</P>
<P>
It now has a record 500,000 tons of fresh water supply daily,
12 times the amount 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye Yinghui, general manager of the Xiamen Tap
Water Supply Company, the second phase of the project, which began
in May, 1995, will be completed before the coming peak season of
water consumption next year, increasing the water supply to
920,000 tons daily.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, the city is expected to put an end to the
fresh water shortages.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Chancellor Against Joining Military Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky said here today that he was against confining
debate about Austrian security to the military sphere.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky made the remarks this evening when talking with
members of the Association for Foreign Correspondents.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said the security issue involved many aspects, and it
would not solve any problem only by participating in a military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said Austria was obviously following a road to a security
system through coordination, adding that neutrality provided
Austria with many choices and would not prevent it from
participating in peace-keeping actions.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky ruled out joining certain military alliances or
giving up neutrality in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said he was waiting with "great interest" for NATO to become
a peace coalition rather than a defense system.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Private Businesses Lure Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 6 (Xinhua) -- People used to enjoy working
in state-owned units and shied away from private ones because of a
lack of welfare services including pensions and medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
But things have changed gradually, and thousands of jobless
people and those displaced by state-owned factories attended a job
fair on Sunday. All the employers represented there were from the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
The fair was held simultaneously in a dozen employment centers
in downtown and suburban districts of Shanghai. More than 3,000
positions, mainly for shop attendants, marketing personnel and
managers, were on offer.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly salaries offered ranged from 550 yuan to
650 yuan, while the average ages looked for among prospective
employees were between 35 and 45.
</P>
<P>
The fair was sponsored by several municipal departments
involved with labor, taxation, social security, industrial and
commercial administration, and reemployment.
</P>
<P>
Local officials expressed the hope that the fair would pave the
way for new ways to tackle the issue of reemployment. It showed
the increasingly bigger role now being played by private
businesses in China's economy, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, Shanghai is trying to improve
welfare services in the private sector, and when such problems are
solved it is expected that more people will be attracted to work
in private firms.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma Insists on Dividing Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukainian President Leonid Kuchma
said here today the division of the Black Sea Fleet must be
completed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Ukraine and Russia should have two independent
fleets in the Black Sea and no alteration should be considered.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma (lower house of the parliament) passed a
resolution today, urging Kuchma and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin to keep the fleet united.
</P>
<P>
The resolution has in fact reduced the mutual trust and
cooperation on the division of the fleet, Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
He added Ukraine and Russia have formed a strategic
partnership, which should be proved by concrete actions from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, founded three centuries ago by Catherine
the Great, served as a Soviet counterbalance to the U.S. 6th Fleet
in the Mediterranean during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine both claimed it after the 1991 Soviet
collapse, resulting in a dispute that hurts relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
They have reached a tentative agreement on dividing the ships,
but disputes linger over the status of the city of Sevastopol, the
fleet's main base.

<HEADLINE> Betel Nut Business Lucrative in Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 6 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in Wenquan Village, near
Qionghai City in Hainan Province, are now doing good business by
processing the betel nut, a tropical fruit with a somewhat bitter
taste.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, a major betel producer in China, currently has 16,000
ha of betel-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
Wenquan Village, in the eastern part of the province, is one of
the largest betel nut processing and distribution centers in
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s local villager Wang Zhaofeng first
introduced the technique of processing betel nuts from a
neighboring town. Since then more and more families have joined in
the trade.
</P>
<P>
Now 125 out of the total 585 households in the village
are engaged in the business. More villagers join them
during the busy seasons.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the village handles about 2,800 tons of betel
nuts annually, bringing in a total income of 25 million yuan, or
more than 1,000 yuan per capita a year.
</P>
<P>
Every day over 300 truckloads of the nuts are shipped from
other parts of the province to the village for processing.
</P>
<P>
Most of the end products are sold to Hunan Province, over 1,000
km north of Hainan, where the smoked betel nut is a favorite dish.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 three families in the village started a transportation
service, which has made it easier and speedier to transport
Wenquan-processed betel nuts to Hunan.
</P>
<P>
As betel nut consumption in Hunan and the number of betel nut
dealers from there are increasing, a special hotel for Hunan
betel buyers has been built in downtown Qionghai.

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Honduras signed today with
the United States an agreement to restructure part of its huge
debt with the latter.
</P>
<P>
Under the debt-restructuring agreement, which was signed by
Honduran Finance Minister Juan Ferrara and U.S. Ambassador James
Creagan, the U.S. agreed to condone 4.4 million U.S. dollars debt
to Honduras and Honduras was to manage 12 million out of its
170-million-dollar debt with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The payment of the debt would have a 17-year maturity term with
six years of grace. The restructuring of the remainder would be in
an additional term of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Honduras has already restructured its foreign debt with
Holland, Germany and several other nations, Ferrara said.
</P>
<P>
He noted Honduras might reduce its debt with the Club of Paris
creditors if it could reach an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador Creagan said he believed Honduras would be
able to sign the agreement with the IMF "because the leadership of
President Carlos Reina and his finance minister is extraordinary
to get ahead with the economic situation in the country."

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Chief Says China Plays Important Role in World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- UNCTAD Secretary-general Rubens
Ricupero said here today that China is playing an important role in
the world economy with a sustained and stable growth in the past 17
years.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero spoke highly of China's rapid development in economy
since 1979 in an interview with Geneva-based Chinese reporters at
the headquarters of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD). Ricupero is due to visit China on December
13-19 at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said, "It is a remarkable achievement for a country
with one quarter of the world's population to have kept an average
growth rate between 8 percent to 10 percent since 1979." The
achievement has set an example for other developing countries and
played a positive role in the world economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said the rapid progress in China and in other Asian
countries and regions was made under the circumstances that
developed economies such as the United States, Japan and some
European countries, were only at a slow pace. "It shows that
developing countries have seized the initiative of the world
economy to a certain extent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said that he would do his best to introduce China's
successful experience to developing countries, adding that the
experience of the developed countries was not always suitable for
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Ricupero said that the UNCTAD supports China's early admission to
the WTO. He said that China played a role of vital importance
during the eight-year negotiations of the Uruguan Round
agreement, adding that China's accession was in the interest of
all WTO members. He urged all sides concerned to be flexible in
China's early admission talks.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: UN Confirms Sarin at Iraqi Weapons Dump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. investigators have
found deadly chemical agent sarin at the site of an Iraqi weapons
dump blown up by American engineers during the Gulf War, the
Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
"They drilled into a rocket and sarin spurted out of that
rocket," Bernard Rostker, the Pentagon's coordinator for Gulf War
illnesses, said. "So sarin was present, and they did find a cache
of mustard gas."
</P>
<P>
Many Gulf War veterans said they believe that they were exposed
to chemical or biological weapon which caused their unexplained
illnesses with symptoms of memory loss, joint and muscle pain,
depression, skin rashes and chronic fatigue.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have
acknowledged a serious health problem exists and are conducting
extensive studies.
</P>
<P>
While focusing their studies on chemical weapons, they also
examine other possible causes include experimental vaccines,
parasites, environmental pollutants, and stress and psychological
factors.
</P>
<P>
Until recent revelations that U.S. troops blew up the Kamisiyah
dump in March 1991, the government had denied there was any
evidence that Americans might have been exposed to chemical or
biological agents.
</P>
<P>
Rostker said he had no doubt that there were chemical munitions
at Kamisiyah. The bunker contained chemical munitions and "we
destroyed the bunker," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is now asking some 20,000 troops who were in
the areas of the detonations to contact officials with details
of the events and any possible health problems.
</P>
<P>
Until the existence of the Kamisiyah chemicals was announced by
the Pentagon last June, the military had denied the existence of
any evidence that any Americans were exposed to chemical or
biological weapons during the war.

<HEADLINE> Elections in Yugoslavia Successful, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Assistant Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Thursday the recent elections in
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were "successful, democratic,
and lawful," as confirmed also by foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
There were satisfied and dissatisfied sides in all elections,
and they could not be repeated indefinitely until everyone was
satisfied, Jovanovic said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) has claimed victory
in the second round of elections for local authorities and
organized protest demonstrations over the past two weeks after the
government annulled the election result and called for a third
round of election.
</P>
<P>
"There have been much fuss and criticism from those who are not
pleased, not only with the results of the local, but also the
general elections," the assistant minister said. The leftist
coalition, comprised of ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, Yugoslav
Left and New Democracy, has won a majority in the federal
parliament elections early November.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said this was the very reason why some people hurried
to proclaim the results even before official results were
announced.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent demonstrations in Belgrade, Jovanovic
said any political organizations could present their feelings
through such rallies, but they must be peaceful and dignified and
that the feelings and belief of the majority of the population
must be respected.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, some protesters threw raw eggs on the
government and parliament buildings and on the buildings of the
pro-government newspapers. But most of the rallies have been
peaceful without any serious incidents.
</P>
<P>
"The government would like to deal with essential, vital
issues, and such demonstrations do not contribute to the
development of democratic processes," Jovanovic stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about certain reactions from abroad, Jovanovic said
one should primarily see whether support was given to peace,
stability, development and democracy, or simply to the opposition
at all costs.
</P>
<P>
Western countries are concerned about the recent development in
Belgrade and urged Yugoslav government to refrain from cracking
down the so-called democratic movement.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said he did not believe there was any reason or it
was wise to support the opposition, all the more so since they,
who are organizing the demonstrations, do not show a high degree
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
If there had indeed been any mistakes in the elections
procedures, they had been corrected through legal procedures, he
added.

<HEADLINE> New Funds Raised for Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- New financial pledges
were made today at a meeting for the 1997 programs of the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the
Near East (UNRWA).
</P>
<P>
The contribution, pledged by 27 countries including China,
totaled 133 million U.S. dollars, almost three times the amount
of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to provide educational,food, medical,
relief and social services to the more than three million
palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hansen, Commissioner-General of UNRWA, stressed the need
for more financial assistance for the region. the stability of
resources for the Agency was essential to helping the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that UNRWA needs more than three million U.S.
dollars next year to maintain the present level of services.
</P>
<P>
The UNRWA, created by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949, is one
of the United Nations organizations devoted to do relief work
with funds raised through voluntary contributions.

<HEADLINE> Canadian-led Military Mission May Not Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A new movement of some 400,000
Rwandan refugees returning home almost eliminates the need for a
Canadian-led military mission to Central Africa, Canadian Defense
Minister Douglas Young said today.
</P>
<P>
The air-drops of aid are now likely unnecessary, Young added.
</P>
<P>
Soon, as few as 100,000 refugees may be all that's left in
eastern Zaire and Tanzania, Young said.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, there was more than a million Rwandan refugees
there, which prompted Canada to initiate an international
humanitarian force into the region.
</P>
<P>
The latest returning of Rwandan refugees from Tanzanian camps
is apparently the result of an agreement with Rwandan to
repatriate its displaced citizens.
</P>
<P>
The agreement breaks up the last large concentration of
expatriate Hutus outside Rwandan territory.
</P>
<P>
"This is an absolutely phenomenal success without military
intervention," Young was quoted as saying by local media reports
today.
</P>
<P>
"Really, the Canadian initiative has been a major catalyst in
all this," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy stressed that the
humanitarian crisis is shifting from refugee camps toward
resettlement problems in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Canadian Minister for International Cooperation Don
Boudria announced that Canada will lead a multi-partite donor
mission to the Rwandan capital of Kigali next weekend.
</P>
<P>
The mission is designed to support integration of returned
refugees, Boudria said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- An American Airlines
jetliner ran into severe turbulence over Colorado today, injuring
at least 16 people, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen passengers and two crew members aboard Flight 1351
from Dallas-Fort Worth to Salt Lake City were injured, John
Hotard, spokesman for the airline in Fort Worth, Texas, was quoted
by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Passengers said the accident was like someone had planted a
bomb under the seat. Officials at the Salt Lake International
Airport said the injured suffered head, neck or back injuries and
lacerations. Ambulances were taking 11 of them to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed at 11:15 a.m. MST, five minutes ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine MD-80, with 69 passengers and five crew members
on board, was over Alamosa, Colo., at 24,000 feet when it ran into
the turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Hotard said there were no storms in the area but there had been
reports of turbulence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Another flight also ran into turbulence in the region and a
flight attendant was injured.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines Flight 1830, a twin-engine jet Fokker 100
with 97 passengers en route from Salt Lake City to Dallas-Fort
Worth, reported hitting clear air turbulence over Cimarron, in
northeastern New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks were mixed
today, struggling against a big increase in long-term interest
rates on the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which over the past two
sessions shed about 100 points, rose 14.16 at 6,437.10.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with its volume declining slightly to
483.12 million shares from 493.70 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.72 to 744.38, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 0.48 to 392.75.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.08 to 1,300.10, just 0.27 shy
of Tuesday's record close. The American Stock Exchange's market
value index rose 1.04 to 590.03.
</P>
<P>
Bonds fell sharply again this morning under the pressure of
profit-taking. As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond climbed to 6.50 percent from late Wednesday's 6.39
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department also gave mixed economic data. It reported
that workplace productivity fell 0.3 percent at an annual rate in
the third quarter, far weaker than the 0.2 percent estimated gain
reported last month.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the department said the number of
American workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits
declined by 8,000 last week, the first drop in three weeks due in
part to a shorter holiday work week.

<HEADLINE> UN Force in Angola to Be Extended 11 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today recommended that the UN peacekeeping
force in Angola be extended until the end of coming February.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission
(UNAVEM III) to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali intended to
phase out the operation then and complete the withdrawal of the
troops by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III consisting of 7,000 military personnel is the biggest
UN peacekeeping operation now and costs some 300 million dollars a
year. The current mandate expires on December 11, he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general noted that Angola has lived in relative
peace since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol on November 20,
1994 though the implementation of the protocol continues to
proceed in fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Angola government and the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to resolve the issue of
the return to Luanda of UNITA deputies to the National Assembly,
to establish the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation,
and to reach agreement on the special status of the leader of the
largest opposition party before January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
As several crucial tasks of the peace process are far from
complete, Angola will continue to need the stabilizing presence of
United Nations force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, the secretary-general recommended the
withdrawal of UN troops resume in February 1997.

LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind and his Egyptian counterpart Amre Moussa have
expressed grave concern over the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after talks with Moussa earlier
today, Rifkind said, "both Egypt and the United Kingdom are very
disturbed by the lack of progress on the Middle East peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that this process can not be taken for granted.
It needs to be given a new dynamic, a new momentum," Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Israeli government to make "substantial
progress" in creating more economic opportunities for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who was in London to attend the Peace Implementation
Conference on Bosnia, also voiced his concern, but said that he
still hoped that the Middle East peace process could still move
forward.
</P>
<P>
"I still believe that the situation is retrievable. We hope we
all can help push forward and save the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I entertain some hope in this direction and the situation, bad
as it is, is still retrievable," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Oil Production to Reach New High in 1997: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's oil production is
expected to reach a new high next year, with average production
rising by 210,000 barrels a day to 2.78 million, according to a
study of the Edinburgh-based oil consultant Wood Mackenzie.
</P>
<P>
The study forecasts that total North Sea output will grow even
faster to a record 6.47 million barrels a day as a result of an
estimated 6.0 percent rise in Norwegian production.
</P>
<P>
Part of the forecast increase of production for next year will
come from fields that were originally due to begin producing oil
this year, the study says.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 11 new fields are expected to open while three old
ones are expected to shut down.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that Norway will remain the largest North
Sea producer next year, to be followed by Shell, the Anglo-Dutch
group, British Petroleum and Exxon of the US.
</P>
<P>
However, the study says that UK oil production in the first
half of this year averaged 2.53 million barrels a day, well below
the consultant's forecast of 2.66 million barrels a day, and the
average production for the whole year will be flat, at 2.57
million barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Starts Test Flow Through Pipeline to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi oil has started
flowing through Iraqi-Turkish pipeline for six hours today to test
the metering system in line with the oil-for-food deal between
Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
In a short statement to Iraqi News Agency, Iraqi Oil Minister
Amir Mohammad Rashid announced tonight that the metering system
has proved to be operating successfully and a Dutch company which
filled the oil pipeline from Kurkuk in northern Iraq to Turkey has
informed the United Nations of the successful test.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is waiting for instructions from the U.N. that the limited
oil export for humanitarian purposes will formally start.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed with the U.N. an oil-for-food deal on May 20 this
year which permits Iraq to sell oil worth 2 billion dollars every
six months to finance the purchase of badly needed foodstuffs,
medicine and other humanitarian items for Iraqis suffering from a
six-year-old international economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was due to come into effect last May, but Baghdad
insisted on restricting the number of U.N. observers to monitor
the program, something which the U.S. rejected and used to block
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock facing the implementation of the agreement was
broken when Iraq declared that it accepted the remaining U.N.
conditions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada to Lead Donor Mission to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government
announced today that it will help lead a multi-party mission to
Kigali, Rwanda, next weekend to support reintegration of returned
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Canada convened a donors meeting in Geneva who
agreed on priorities set by the Rwandan government for the
peaceful integration of refugees.
</P>
<P>
They include the needs of women and children, housing, justice,
security, human resources development and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The Kigali mission, organized by Canada at the invitation of
the government of Rwanda, will translate these priorities into
action," Canada's Minister for International Cooperation Don
Boudria said in making the annoucement.
</P>
<P>
The mission's objective is to agree on an implementation plan
to re-establish in their home communities over 600,000 refugees
who have already returned from Zaire, as well as another 500,000
who are expected to return soon from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Many of the participants at the Geneva meeting are expected to
be part of the mission, including the government of Rwanda,
several donor countries, as well as United Nations and other
multinational agencies, Boudria said.

<HEADLINE> US Mortgage Delinquencies Decline in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Fewer homeowners in the U.S.
fell behind on their mortgages in the third quarter and the trend
could extend into next year, the U.S. Mortgage Bankers Association
said today.
</P>
<P>
The industry group said in a survey that mortgage delinquencies
fell to 4.16 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three
months ended September 30, down from 4.35 percent in the second
quarter. It was the third consecutive quarterly decline.
</P>
<P>
The Mortgage Bankers Association president Ron McCord said the
outlook is "a steady holding pattern or even a modest improvement
in delinquencies in the next several quarters."
</P>
<P>
McCord attributed the improvement to lower interest rates, a
stronger economy, job growth and a fall in loan-to-value ratios,
which shows homeowners have more equity built up in their homes.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of foreclosures started in the third quarter
fell slightly, but the percentage of loans in foreclosure climbed
to 1 percent of all loans from 0.96 percent in the prior quarter.
</P>
<P>
The foreclosure statistics reflect past credit problems -- such
as the rise in delinquencies in 1995 -- and should improve in the
coming months, he added.
</P>
<P>
Around the country, the Northeast experienced the largest
decline, with 4.24 percent of home loans in trouble, down from
4.49 percent. In the South, rates fell to 4.84 percent from 5.06;
Rates in the West declined to 3.40 percent from 3.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 22.5 million loans on one- to four-unit homes
encompasses about one-third of all residential mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes Extension of Haitian Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
welcomed the decision of the United Nations Security Council to
grant an extension to the UN Support Mission in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The extension "will provide the stability we need to move
forward on peace-building activities such as training the police,
improving the justice system and promoting economic development,"
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, Haiti "has undergone a positive
transformation" and "Canada...has played a significant role in
this evolution," Axworthy stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Canada will continue with its contribution of 750 troops who
will work to build on the progress that has been made to date,"
said Douglas Young, minister of national defense.
</P>
<P>
The UN decision follows the request by Haitian President Rene
Preval for a mandate extension. The Security Council authorized a
renewal of six months.
</P>
<P>
The mission's mandate will be to assist in the training of the
Haitian National Police, to maintain a climate of public security
and to provide assistance in strengthening Haiti's democratic
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Razali Stresses Commitments to Palestine Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Razali Ismail, president
of the current session of UN General Assembly, today urged the
international community to provide more tangible commitments to
the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the pledging conference for the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
(UNRWA), Razali said that the world cannot ignore the plight of
the Palestinian refugees who continue to suffer and live in
extremely difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the excellent working relationships that exist between
UNRWA and the host governments of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, the
closure and other related security measures by the occupying power
have affected the living conditions of the Palestinian refugees,
who make up 1.2 million or 49 percent of the population in the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The rate of unemployment has escalated and this continued
restriction on the movement of people and goods will worsen the
situation even further, he said.
</P>
<P>
To compound this already difficult situation, UNRWA has been
subjected to even more stringent checks by the occupying power,
which is selective in its recognition of the privileges and
immunities of the Agency, where the majority of staff are made up
of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to address the social-economic needs of the refugees
will only strengthen the forces ranged against the peace process
that feeds on desperation and cynicism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have been denied their rights and aspirations
long enough," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also praised UNRWA's work and commitment in bringing about
direct changes to the lives of the 3.3 million Palestinian
refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for almost five decades.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments to respond to the appeal to help UNRWA in
its important efforts to change the situation on the ground for
the long suffering Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Frankfurt Breaches 2,900 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
ended mixed on Thursday, with British shares closing marginally
up, Frankfurt hitting another new record high while Paris
suffering a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in London lost most of their early gains in
afternoon trading following a slump in gilts, with the FTSE 100
index up only 6.0 points at 4,051.2 at the close.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that Wall Street's opening losses also played a
part in subduing the market and offsetting the positive effect of
the sterling's sharp decline today.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares extended their recent rally after
Wednesday's dip and breached the crucial 2,900 level at the close
of the session, with the DAX-30 index up 43.84 at 2,909.91, above
the previous record high of 2886.98 set on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was encouraged by the dollar's rally this
week, which boosted Germany's export prospects. Meanwhile, today's
higher-than-expected unemployment figures also helped to ease
inflation worries, traders said.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, late pressure from bond weakness and Wall
Street's fall pulled the CAC-40 index into the red at the close of
the session, 16.15 points down at 2,292.50.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 leading British shares ended 6.0 points up at
4,051.2. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed 43.84 points higher at
2,909.91. In Paris, the CAC-30 index finished down 16.15 points at
2,292.50.

<HEADLINE> Planned International Fusion Reactor Won't Work: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The planned ten-billion
-dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)
probably won't work, according to a new theory discussed in a
report in the latest issue of Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
ITER, the project sponsored by the United States, Russia,
Europe and Japan, is billed as the world's best hope for proving
that fusion can be a reliable and efficient source of abundant
power.
</P>
<P>
"But that grand vision may be colliding with physical reality,"
said the news report. A new theory about plasma turbulence,
established by William Dorland and Michael Kotschenreuther at the
Institute for Fusion Studies of the University of Texas, "may be
bad news for ITER."
</P>
<P>
According to the two scientists, because of its size, ITER will
be more prone to turbulence than the small existing tokamaks, and
it won't benefit from stabilizing influences at work in the
smaller machines. The ITER plasma -- too large for beams to
penetrate and too massive to spin -- would be heated mainly by
fusion reactions, which would impart little velocity shear.
</P>
<P>
Because of these shortcomings, says Kotschenreuther, ITER
"wouldn't work, and by a substantial margin."
</P>
<P>
If construction is completed as planned before 2010, ITER will
be a building-sized, donut-shaped device that is threaded with
spiraling magnetic fields. The fields would cage million-degree
deuterium and tritium ions, long enough for them to fuse and
generate abundant power--enough, designers hope, to kindle the
would's first controlled, self-sustaining fusion burn.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Raps US for Being Insincere in Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The special adviser to Nigeria's
head of state on drugs and financial crimes has accused the U.S.
government of being insincere in its dealings with Nigeria on the
issue of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has done all it can to obtain US cooperation in
tackling the drug issue but it is regretful that the success
achieved so far is still not impressive to the US, said Adamu
Mohammed, the special adviser, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
"We approached them to sign agreements with us, to work with
us, to open up and give us whatever they have with regard to
crimes emanating from Nigeria, but rather than do just that, the
Americans, along with some of their European allies, preferred to
play politics and be insincere with Nigeria," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria is willing to cooperate with any
country in solving the problem of drug trafficking and drug abuse
"because we recognize that this is not a problem we can solve
alone."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the accusation by the special
adviser was made just a few days before a team of US officials is
expected to arrive next Monday to discuss drug trafficking and
financial crimes with their Nigerian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Recently the U. S. has again listed Nigeria among 30 countries
which it said are not doing enough to discourage hard drug
trafficking.
