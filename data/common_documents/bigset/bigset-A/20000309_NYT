OFFICER AND 2 FIREFIGHTERS DIE IN AMBUSH AT MEMPHIS HOUSE

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Two firefighters and a sheriff's deputy were
shot to death Wednesday when they were ambushed as they arrived at
a burning house where the body of a woman, apparently the wife of
the suspected gunman, was later found inside.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, identified as Fred Williams, a city firefighter,
was in custody Wednesday night at a hospital where he was treated
for wounds he received in an exchange of gunfire with police
officers after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Fleming, deputy director of the Fire Department, said that
Williams had returned to active duty only a few days ago, having
been on leave under an employee assistance program. Fleming
declined to say what problem had caused Williams to take leave. But
he believed that Williams knew the firefighters who were shot, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect this,'' said H.J. Pickett, the Memphis fire
chief. ``We're here to fight fires. You want to say it's part of
the job, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were unsure how the woman inside the house had
been killed. But neighbors and relatives said she was Williams'
wife, and her former husband, Herman Harrison, identified her as
Stacey Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said they received two emergency calls
from the quiet, upscale neighborhood shortly before 1 p.m. One,
apparently from the suspect, reported the fire, and the other, from
a neighbor, reported that shots had been fired. A sheriff's deputy
said that when the firefighters pulled up at the house, a man ran
out of the garage firing a shotgun and shouting: ``Get away! Get
away!''
</P>
<P>
   By the time a car from the sheriff's department pulled up a few
moments later, two firefighters had already been shot to death,
said sheriff's Deputy Don Wright. The driver of the sheriff's car,
identified as Deputy Rupert Peete, was fatally shot as he arrived
at the scene, and the car went crashing through a fence.
</P>
<P>
   The dead firefighters were identified as Lt. Javier Lerma, 41,
and Pvt. William Blakemore, both of Engine Co. 55. Williams was
assigned to a different firehouse, department officials said, but
may have worked with the victims at the scenes of previous fires.
</P>
<P>
   One other person was shot as well, a woman who happened to be
driving by the house. But her injuries were said to be not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis police officers arrived shortly after the slayings, and
their gunfire wounded Williams in the lower torso. Surgeons at the
hospital treated his injuries, which were not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Crews, director of the Memphis police, said he suspected
that the fire had been deliberately set. But it was unclear whether
it was set after Mrs. Williams was killed, perhaps an effort to
cover up her death, or whether it was solely a means of luring the
firefighters to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, Mrs. Williams' former husband, said she married
Williams about three weeks ago. The relationship was not working
out, he said, and he had tried to get custody of his 8-year-old
son, who was living at the house. The boy was in school when the
shooting broke out and was later taken to stay with Harrison's
sister.

MURPHY LEADS NOTRE DAME TO VICTORY OVER RUTGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you have won Big East player of the year honors,
your name should be spelled in lights outside Madison Square
Garden, not smeared with blood on the back of your jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy Murphy saw his stained jersey as a proper tribute after
he led Notre Dame to its first ever victory in the Big East
tournament _ a 74-62 brawl over Rutgers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``MU'' on his jersey highlighted in red, the willowy
left-hander got in the spirit of abuse he was subjected to by the
Scarlet Knights' big men. With Notre Dame leading by 11 points late
in the game, Murphy soared above the rim for a rebound, hooked the
ball down with one hand and let out a guttural yell that drew a
double take from Rashod Kent of Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time Murphy moved the 6-foot-6-inch 265-pound
bruising Kent. Instead, he went over and around the Scarlet Knights
to finish with a game-high 25 points, largely because the Scarlet
Knights sent him to the free throw line 14 times. He hit 12 of them
to go along with 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not sure whose blood it was,'' said Murphy, the
sophomore from Morristown, N.J., whom the conference coaches named
player of the year. ``You just have to go, make cuts and expect to
get hit. That's how the Big East is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish will face No. 2 seeded Miami on Thursday in
another physical matchup that Notre Dame needs to win to help their
cause for an NCAA tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be the best defensive team we face this year,''
said Notre Dame coach Matt Doherty. ``I mean they're co-champs of
the league. So we don't have nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite _ with a record of 18-13, Notre Dame needs a stirring
run to the Big East tournament finals to coax an invitation out of
the selection committee for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Basketball tournament. Syracuse, St. John's,
Connecticut, Miami already have earned invitations, as well as
Seton Hall after Wednesday's 85-65 rout of Providence.
</P>
<P>
   The conference tournament championship insures Notre Dame an
automatic bid; a defeat in the finals, however, leaves them at the
mercy of the selection committee. The Irish boast quality victories
- two over Connecticut, as well as St. John's and Ohio State _ but
were only .500 in league play. A loss in Saturday's final means
that the Fighting Irish would have 14 losses and, since 1994, no
college team in the nation has been invited with that many defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Murphy and his teammate's knowledge of the Big
East tournament play was extremely limited - in Notre Dame's four
previous appearances as conference members they were bounced in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   In Notre Dame's only game with Rutgers in Piscataway, Murphy,
was booed, heckled and harassed into one of his only poor
performances of the year. Kent banged on Murphy so persistently he
drew a technical, fouled out and scored 18 points on five of 16
shooting as the Scarlet Knights pasted the Irish, 76-51. The
Fighting Irish vowed not to repeat what Doherty considered their
worst game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good motivator that we got Rutgers as a draw. We got
embarrassed down there and gave us a sense of payback,'' said
senior guard Jimmy Dillon, who had 7 points and five assists.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, his backcourt mate Matt Carroll, and David Graves
dropped in long-range jumpers and helped open a 15 point first-half
lead that Rutgers (15-15) only was able to carve nine points with
1:38 left in the game. The Irish were seven of 13 from the 3-point
line and shot 51 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're making shots that gives Troy much more room to
operate,'' said Rutgers Coach Kevin Bannon. ``When you have to
worry about both that's when this is a team that could play with
anybody in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   For Murphy, the focus was on acquitting himself better before
his home folks. He admitted to being to emotional about returning
to New Jersey during the regular season and to the school that was
his second choice behind Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I made too much of playing against Rutgers,
going out there and playing against the whole team and trying to do
everything. They really got to me,'' he conceded. ``I just tried to
focus on the game plan today.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR UCONN'S EL-AMIN, IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With two minutes left to play Wednesday in what would be a 70-55
rout of Boston College on the first day of the Big East tournament,
Khalid El-Amin, the University of Connecticut's effervescent junior
point guard, sat on the bench celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin was animated as he laughed and smiled with teammates.
The smile used to be his signature, but for El-Amin and
Connecticut, the carefree smiles have been a lot tougher to come by
this season.
</P>
<P>
   After a dream-come-true campaign last season when the Huskies
won the national championship, defense of the crown has been so
precarious that coach Jim Calhoun has jokingly wondered whether the
subsequent grief has been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   UConn came into the tournament at 21-8, yet Calhoun found
himself apologizing for the record. The season has been uneven and
El-Amin has been a large part of the unevenness.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he was good. After the game, El-Amin was businesslike
and resigned about the team's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping for it to be another storybook season,'' he said,
``but you're not going to have that every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a storybook season, this one has teetered between
a bad dream and a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin led UConn to the national championship last March 29.
But 15 days later _ and one day after he was honored in his
hometown of Minneapolis _ El-Amin, then a 19-year-old sophomore,
was stopped for a traffic violation in Hartford, Conn. A small
amount of marijuana was discovered during a pat-down search.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin pleaded guilty in Hartford Community Court and agreed to
perform six hours of community service, including picking up trash
for the City of Hartford. In exchange, his record was wiped clean.
The following months were filled with apologies and what, to El-
Amin, must seem like suffocating scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as Connecticut began its title defense, a
Connecticut newspaper ran an article about possible NCAA violations
involving El-Amin. The story alleged that the UConn point guard
traded game tickets for use of a vehicle registered to a Hartford
man with a record of drug arrests. A UConn investigation into the
allegations produced no evidence of NCAA violations.
</P>
<P>
   In another episode, Jake Voskuhl was investigated in connection
with his use of a car and was cleared of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent incident involved the UConn players Tony
Robertson and Doug Wrenn, who allegedly tried to swap tickets to
games for merchandise at a mall. They were suspended from the team.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's victory, El-Amin admitted that the off-court
episodes drained his enthusiasm for the student athlete experience.
He was not as enthusiastic about being a college player as he had
been the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not,'' he said. ``I'm sorry to say I'm not.'' You
could tell he was bursting to say more. Wisely, he pulled back.
With the testy mood of the NCAA enforcement staff, its narrow
interpretations of arcane regulations and mounting tension
involving coaches, school administrators and players, the less
said, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going into depth about that,'' El-Amin said. ``That
would take days and weeks and I'm not going to do that. But I'm not
really happy about being a college student athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   How had the joy gone out of the game? Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young men's dreams have been shattered or could have
been ended by all the nit-picking that the NCAA has been doing,''
El-Amin said. ``That speaks for itself. Some violations are indeed
violations: A guy knows that he committed a violation. But others,
like I said _ the nit-picking things _ are like cat and mouse. All
this nit-picking, it shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun wondered how El-Amin could come back next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how he can stay next year _ children, a wife,''
the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are bright and they're talking more and more with
each other,'' Calhoun added. ``They've played against each other
since they were 12 and 13 years old. Yes, we're giving them a
$70,000 education and we're giving them a stage. They see the NCAA
sign a billion dollar television contract and they can't get a
loan, or work a job.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's game, Calhoun said that so much will depend on
El-Amin's energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about my energy,'' El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My energy,'' he said. ``If that's the case, we might as well
go to the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy.

SENATE PASSES BILL THAT INCLUDES MONEY FOR KANSAS CITY
INTERNATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 &HT;    c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A measure that passed the Senate on Wednesday calls
for $11.6 million in airport improvements at Kansas City
International Airport and may open the way for more nonstop flights
from KCI to Washington's Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The conference report releases federal funds to pay for most of
the cost of resurfacing concrete aprons around the terminals and
upgrading security in doorways leading from the terminals to
airplanes and to ground areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new money for us,'' said Russell Widmar, aviation
director for the city of Kansas City, which runs KCI. ``We're
excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The KCI projects are part of $40 billion in Federal Aviation
Administration spending nationwide in the next three years that the
Senate and House have debated for months. It is expected to win
House approval next week, said Steve Hilton, spokesman for Sen.
John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Widmar said some of the federal money would pay for the final
segments of a seven-phase program to replace concrete aprons built
in the early 1970s. And $4.6 million would pay for security,
including conversion of secured doorways to card rather than key
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also has about $38 million for improvements at eight
other Missouri airports, including $26.54 million for Lambert-St.
Louis International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri airports will be able to move ahead with ambitious
modernization programs,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft was sponsor of an amendment to the bill that would open
24 more slots at Reagan National Airport, which has tight capacity
restrictions. Half of those slots would be for flights from cities
beyond the current limit of 1,250 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The other 12 slots would be available for flights from cities
such as Kansas City that are within 1,250 miles. Two carriers _
Midwest Express and Vanguard Airlines _ have expressed interest in
adding nonstop service to Reagan National. Only USAir now offers
such service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those will be very hard slots to get,'' Widmar said. ``They
will be competitive among all the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Vanguard Airlines in Kansas City said it was
too early to say whether the airline would propose serving Reagan
National. Gate availability and landing fees at KCI will be among
factors in the decision, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A public affairs official of Midwest Express did not return a
call for comment on Wednesday, but Widmar said he had heard that
the Milwaukee-based airline would also be interested in serving
Reagan National.

TELLING TIME FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Better teams have lost to the Detroit Red Wings.
How the Kings play in their next four games could be a better
indicator of how good they really are.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there were issues in the Kings' 3-1 loss Tuesday night
at Staples Center. The power play went 0 for 5 and even let in a
short-handed goal. The top two lines did not respond to the
clamp-down style they will be seeing the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings defeated the Red Wings in their previous
two meetings, players acknowledge there is a greater sense of
urgency now with just 16 games remaining. And Detroit has won the
Stanley Cup two of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're looking at a point in the schedule that should tell
us a lot,'' captain Rob Blake said. ``New York, Calgary, Vancouver
and Anaheim. We don't have to win them all - even though it would
be nice - but we have to regain some of the momentum we had on the
last road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are 1-3-1 since winning four of the first six games on
the road. Blake said last Thursday's 5-2 loss to struggling
Carolina, ``still seems to be haunting us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings know that only tonight's opponent, the Rangers,
ranks are among the top eight teams in either division. And just
barely. They also know New York faced the Mighty Ducks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we did not have a full workout today,'' coach Andy
Murray said. ``They are playing back-to-back games and we thought
it was better not to use up the extra energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Murray met with Blake and several members of his top
two lines. Except for Jozef Stumpel's game-winning goal Saturday in
the 3-2 overtime victory over Nashville, both lines were shut out
the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Smolinski returned from a corneal abrasion on his left eye
to record his 35th assist vs. Detroit, but he does not have a goal
in the past 10 games. After scoring in a career-high 15 consecutive
games, Luc Robitaille has one shot in the past two.
</P>
<P>
   And Blake, who runs the power play from the blue line, was on
the ice when the Red Wings' Sergei Fedorov scored short-handed in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no excuse for that, we just need to work harder,''
he said. ``If we do what we're supposed to do, it's a 1-0 game and
anything can happen. Those are things we can't allow during these
upcoming games.''
</P>
<P>
   KINGS vs. N.Y. RANGERS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:30 p.m. at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net; KRLA-AM (1110)
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The Rangers were 0-5 lifetime at the Pond entering
Wednesday's game with the Ducks. They came in just a point ahead of
Montreal for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East. There
is great disappointment in New York that the team with the $60
million payroll isn't better. Free-agent signings Theo Fleury (14
goals, 56 points) and Valeri Kamensky (8 goals, 26 points, minus 9)
have not panned out. Monday, the Rangers had a chance to pick up a
point in San Jose but gave up a goal in the final minute in a 2-1
loss. The Rangers are 20-0-0 when scoring four or more goals,
1-25-7 when getting two or fewer.

SCHOOL DISTRICT COMPARISON GETS UPGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Although the state of Missouri has long
resisted ranking its public schools, an education reform group
today will issue its first report card aimed at comparing student
achievement in economically similar districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Education Evaluation Report is designed to show what
comparable districts can achieve with similar resources, said Peter
Herschend, president of the Missouri Partnership for Outstanding
Schools, which commissioned the study.
</P>
<P>
   Herschend said the report would provide valuable information to
Missourians, many of whom seem better informed about their public
schools' athletic performance than about academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is appropriate that patrons know how their schools are
doing in the most important aspect for which they exist,'' said
Herschend, co-owner and vice chairman of Silver Dollar City in
Branson and a member of the state Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The report clusters the state's 524 school districts into 20
groups, based largely on the number of low-income students and the
amount spent per pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the groups provide a benchmark for
district-to-district comparisons on indicators such as dropout and
graduation rates, student performance on state standardized tests,
and transition to jobs or higher education. The report also
includes percentages of minority students, student movement in and
out of the districts, attendance rates, student-teacher ratios and
tax-rate information for each district.
</P>
<P>
   But critics questioned some of the groupings and warned about
drawing too many conclusions from the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``No two school districts in Missouri are identical, and it's
really difficult to develop some comparison, because so many
factors come into play _ socioeconomic, size, location,'' said
Brent Ghan, spokesman for the Missouri School Boards Association.
``I know they tried to take that into account. I just don't know if
they've developed meaningful comparisons here. When you look at
some of the cluster groups they've come up with, some don't make a
great deal of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ghan questioned grouping the 5,646-student Normandy
district in suburban St. Louis with the 103-student Wyaconda
district in the state's most northeastern county.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to Wyaconda. It's nothing like Normandy,'' Ghan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report's supporters acknowledge some seemingly unusual
groupings.
</P>
<P>
   ``By grouping economically, they may not look and feel
intuitively the same, but according to their economic data they
are,'' said Angie Hull, communication coordinator for the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City district is grouped with the St. Louis district
in the smallest of the 20 clusters. ``They were subdivided out
because they were so, so different,'' Hull said. Other clusters
have from five to 17 districts.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows, for example, that Kansas City has a better
high school graduation rate than St. Louis, but that a higher
percentage of students in St. Louis go to college. Students in both
districts generally perform far below the state average on state
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Many other states have adopted report cards that make it easier
to compare public schools or districts.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the state mandates that all schools report uniform
information, such as test scores, student demographics, dropout and
graduation rates. The state posts the information in an
easy-to-read format on a Web site and makes hard copies available.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas also discourages using the information in the reports to
rank schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clearly wasn't our intention, but much to our
consternation, that's been the result,'' said Sharon Freden,
assistant commissioner for the Kansas Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, what it does is let the public in that school
district see if that individual school is making progress, not how
it compares with the school down the road or across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Using similar arguments, Missouri has long balked at ranking
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Outstanding Schools Act of 1993 requires local districts to
publish an annual report card on their performance. The law also
requires the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
to publish an annual comprehensive report on all districts.
</P>
<P>
   But the law specifically prohibits the state from using the
information to compare school districts, resulting in a complex
compilation of information that is difficult for the public to
analyze. The law also gives districts wide discretion on how they
assemble and present the reports, making comparison difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman said the law was
designed to provide the public with information to foster a richer
understanding of individual school performance without creating a
competitive or punitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The education community was fearful that the evaluation of
school districts would come down to one number, which would be
unfair because school districts are not and should not be reduced
to just a number,'' Bartman said. ``They're complex institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said he considered the partnership's evaluation report a
useful tool to identify schools that could then serve as models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure it's a useful tool for all other districts to
know which districts or school sites are doing poorly,'' Bartman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the report are quick to note that schools are not
ranked, but are instead listed by enrollment size.
</P>
<P>
   Still, readers can scan the groupings and quickly draw
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Herschend said he hoped the report would help districts identify
their strengths and shortcomings, create conversation among
teachers, parents and business and political leaders, and prompt
more local involvement in school improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The study is by far the largest undertaking for the 6-year-old
partnership, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group formed after passage of
the Outstanding Schools Act to serve as an advocate for school
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia-based partnership is funded by grants and donations
from businesses and foundations across the state and is governed by
an unpaid board of directors. In the past, the partnership has
produced public-opinion reports and newsletters highlighting
educational successes.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership used $120,000 in grants from the Kauffman
Foundation, the Hall Family Foundation and the Herschend Foundation
to commission the Center for Educational Policy Analysis at the
University of Missouri's College of Education to generate the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership hopes to produce the report annually and
eventually move to school-by-school comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the complete report will be made available at public
libraries and through local school districts or can be purchased
for $20 from the partnership by calling (800) 659-4044.

INDICTMENT SAYS VANOVER ASSISTANT AMONG PART OF CAR-THEFT RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 &HT;    c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City Chiefs kick returner Tamarick
Vanover's personal assistant was among seven persons charged as
part of a nationwide car-theft ring that specialized in BMWs,
Lexuses and other luxury vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment, unsealed Wednesday, alleged the seven
stole up to 50 luxury vehicles from North Carolina, retitled them
in Missouri and then sold them across the country. The development
is part of a related investigation of drug dealers who shipped
cocaine and marijuana to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, which a grand jury returned in late February,
does not mention Vanover.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vanover's personal assistant, Gregory E. Burns, was
accused in the indictment. Burns already is facing federal
drug-trafficking and weapons charges in a related case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Vanover pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the
sale of a stolen vehicle that crossed state lines. The stolen
vehicle that he sold to a friend in Florida _ a 1999 Ford
Expedition _ was not mentioned in the indictment. Vanover has
agreed to cooperate with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The recent auto theft indictment alleges that since January 1996
the ring stole more than $1 million worth of luxury sport-utility
vehicles and high-end makes such as Lexus, Mercedes, Infiniti and
BMW.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest auto vehicle theft case the FBI has been
involved in, in this area, in at least a dozen years, in terms of
the numbers of vehicles and people involved,'' FBI spokesman Jeff
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley, a Justice Department spokesman, added: ``It's a
substantial theft ring. As we allege, they operated this ring in an
almost machinelike fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns appeared Wednesday at two federal court hearings to answer
charges in the stolen car and drug cases. Accompanied by his
lawyer, Jacqueline A. Cook, Burns pleaded not guilty to all counts.
Afterward, Cook declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Court records filed in Burns' drug case show that in March 1998
he sold a 1994 white Lexus SC400 that had been stolen in North
Carolina to a cocaine customer in Vanover's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's indictment listed a 1994 white Lexus SC400 as among
the vehicles stolen in North Carolina. The indictment, however,
does not say the Lexus is the same car Burns sold.
</P>
<P>
   Another defendant in the car theft indictment was named in the
drug case. Marcus Hammond of Roswell, Ga., remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charged Angela R. Harper of Kansas City, who
was charged in the case earlier this month in a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers filed in support of those charges note that Kansas
City police stopped Harper in January 1998 while she was driving a
1997 Toyota 4Runner that had been reported stolen the month before
during an armed carjacking in Raleigh, N.C. She remains free on
bond, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants, Mark N. Hutton of West Palm Beach, Fla.,
and Desmond A.E. Jackson of Durham, N.C., are in custody in Florida
and Georgia, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Gyasi Ralemecca Edwards and Josephine S. Williams, both of
Durham, N.C., remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants conspired to steal
vehicles from North Carolina, sometimes from car dealerships, and
transported them to Washington, D.C., where their vehicle
identification numbers were altered. The vehicles then were
retitled in Missouri under the false numbers and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have recovered 20 of the stolen vehicles from
Arizona, California, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio,
Virginia and Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a large and continuing operation with tentacles in many
parts of the country,'' Lanza said. ``It was brought to a halt
after a two-year investigation and the cooperation of eight
agencies, most notably the Missouri//Kansas Auto Crimes Task Force
and the Missouri Highway Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest indictment stems from a 28-month investigation of a
large-scale cocaine and marijuana smuggling operation based in
Fresno, Calif. Court records show the ring smuggled more than 200
pounds of cocaine into Kansas City each month.
</P>
<P>
   At least 23 persons have been charged in the probe, while nine
have been convicted, including Vanover, and are now cooperating
with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Pollard of Kansas City, Kan., is expected to plead guilty
to drug-trafficking charges, his lawyer said recently.

STATE'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY INDEX HITS 8-YEAR LOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Rising home prices and interest rates last year
pulled the state's Housing Affordability Index to its lowest level
since 1992, the California Association of Realtors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The index - which measures the percentage of households that can
afford a median-priced home - fell to 37 percent in 1999, a
three-point drop from 1998, the association said. In contrast, the
national index was 55 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The index is the percentage of households that can afford to buy
a median priced home.
</P>
<P>
   Housing affordability has implications beyond simply home
ownership, said Leslie Appleton-Young, the association's chief
economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't continue to grow an economy when housing is not
available for an average household,'' she said. ``At some point,
companies find that they're unable to attract the caliber of worker
that they need in order to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's affordability index for single-family homes had
averaged more than 39 percent from 1993 to '98. In 1992, the index
stood at 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a combination of surging housing prices and last year's
interest rate hikes pushed the affordability index down across the
state, pricing many buyers out of the market, according to the CAR.
</P>
<P>
   A full-blown affordability crisis has already hit several areas
of the state, including the San Francisco Bay Area. According to
the CAR report, the Bay Area had a 27 percent rating in 1999; in
the city of San Francisco, the index was 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Appleton-Young said Los Angeles is still a few years away from a
similar housing crisis. Los Angeles County's affordability index
was 39 percent last year, equal to its 1998 mark. In Ventura County
the index was 41 percent, down from 44 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Kyser, chief economist with the nonprofit Los Angeles
Economic Development Corp., said 39 percent is far from ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're trying to attract firms into Southern California,
this is going to be a big hurdle,'' Kyser said. ``These numbers are
dramatic evidence that this is something we need to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Remedies for the current problem could require some tough
choices, according to Appleton-Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start to change people's thinking about what
housing is all about and what communities are all about,'' she
said. ``You have to allow for in-fill development where you have
higher densities than people may be used to, or have a
commercial-residential mix that may not be allowed under the
current zoning.''

KANSAS CITY WITNESSES EXPECTED AT FETAL TISSUE HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 &HT;    c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional hearing on the marketing of tissue
taken from fetuses at abortion clinics in Kansas and elsewhere will
be open to the public today, following assurances it won't
``degrade or incriminate innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Kansas City area witnesses who worked at the Overland
Park, Kan., clinic of Planned Parenthood of Mid-Missouri and
Eastern Kansas are expected to testify at a U.S. House subcommittee
hearing on extraction and sale of fetal tissue for research.
</P>
<P>
   Four other witnesses also are to testify about possible
violation of federal fetal tissue laws. Such organs can be donated
for research, but fees for removal and transportation are not
supposed to exceed actual cost.
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee's Health and Environment
Subcommittee will conduct the hearing, which some members sought to
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern was that the testimony might defame, degrade or
incriminate innocent people, with consequences that might range
from harassment to physical violence,'' said Dennis Fitzgibbons,
spokesman for subcommittee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgibbons said that concern has been eased, and that the
dispute over opening the meeting was never a Democrat vs.
Republican issue. Republicans disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely was a partisan dispute,'' said Steve Schmidt,
spokesman for subcommittee Republicans. ``They tried every tactic
at their disposal to close the meeting and keep the American people
uninformed. Under intense media pressure, they caved.''
</P>
<P>
   The key witness at the hearing is expected to be Miles Jones, a
Lee's Summit, Mo., pathologist who has operated a company that
removed and marketed fetal tissue at Planned Parenthood and other
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was subpoenaed but has given no indication he will appear,
Schmidt said. Failure to appear would subject him to being held in
contempt. Jones has not returned repeated phones calls from The
Kansas City Star for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee plans to show a replay Thursday of a hidden
camera interview Jones did with the ABC News show ``20//20''
broadcast Wednesday in which he discussed the profitability of
selling brains, livers, hearts and other organs from aborted
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a market force,'' Jones tells a ``20//20'' producer who
posed as a potential investor in Jones' company. ``It's what you
sell it for.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee also subpoenaed Dean Alberty of Lee's Summit, a
medical technician who worked for Jones and another company that
did fetal tissue marketing. Alberty told ``20//20'' he became upset
about the procedure and agreed to accept money from an
anti-abortion group to report back on possible illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying voluntarily to the committee will be Lynn Fredericks
of Lake Waukomis in Platte County. Fredericks said she was vice
president of surgical services at Planned Parenthood two years ago.
She declined to discuss her intended testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is to hear from James Bardsley, president of the
Anatomic Gift Foundation, which did fetal tissue extraction at the
Planned Parenthood clinic several years ago. Three medical experts
from Nebraska, Massachusetts and California are also on the witness
list.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is getting substantial attention from anti-abortion
and pro-choice groups. The National Right to Life Committee Inc.
issued a news release Wednesday demanding the hearing be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a right to know whether abortion methods are
being altered to obtain organs, whether live births sometimes occur
during such procedures and whether baby body parts are being sold
for profit,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of Right
to Life.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman for the New York office of Planned Parenthood
said the group was neutral on whether the hearing should be open
and is not opposed to rigorous investigation of any wrongdoing in
fetal tissue research.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are bad actors out there in the private sector who
are in fact profiteering, those individuals have to be identified
for the benefit of the true, legitimate value of fetal and organ
tissue research,'' said Adina Wingate Quijada, senior press officer
for Planned Parenthood.

A REPEAT EFFORT FROM SHAQ?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Now that he's flexed all those muscles, now that
he's shown what he can really do when he sets his birthday mind to
it, should the NBA be put on alert for an even more explosive
Shaquille O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal partied on his 28th birthday by scoring a career-high 61
points Monday night, an eye-opening performance even if it was
against the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers center is already being championed as the league MVP
this season, but he was a man who acted like he could raise his
game another notch on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Now the schedule brings another weak opponent - without a
legitimate big man - in tonight's game at Golden State. The
Warriors start 6-10, 250-pound Adonal Foyle at center. Is a repeat
performance possible? Opponents know one thing: O'Neal will always
be the focus of the Lakers offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go inside every night,'' said Lakers coach Phil
Jackson. ``That has to be the thrust of our offense. But it depends
how much a team collapses on him. If they send everybody in the
lane, then we have to use our outside game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal maintains he's not planning anything special for the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worry about scoring points before the game,'' O'Neal
said. ``If I get in a game and am feeling it - just like anybody
else on the team - you just keep on going to him. I'm not even
thinking about it. If it happens, it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so primary: Jackson, a former Knicks teammate of Bill
Bradley, was disappointed but philosophical about his old friend
being swept out of the Democratic presidential race by Al Gore in
the Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to Bradley on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill had an impact on this election,'' Jackson said. ``I think
Gore became a viable candidate through the competition he had to
face with Bradley - pulling out of Washington, going to Tennessee,
firing a lot of people on his staff and reorganizing his campaign.
He became quite a contender, and the machine overran Bradley and
his ability to be a populist candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the press' infatuation with (John) McCain as a populist
candidate sucked all the wind out of Bill's publicity or any kind
of press he might have been able to generate in the last three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not going to work, either, so we're going to be
stuck with two guys that have been bred and born to this position
in the world. People who really haven't had to go out and haven't
had a real job in their life. They haven't been part of the real
population of America, so that they've had to function like normal
citizens, with their normal cares and concerns. It's quite a
statement of where we are as a country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tidbits:: Jackson was surprised to learn the Lakers became the
NBA's first team to clinch a playoff spot on Tuesday's off-day:
``No, really? That's nice to know.''... The Lakers completed what
Jackson termed only their second full practice at their new
facility in El Segundo. O'Neal said he likes the place but is
missing one thing: ``I still need my own key so I can come shoot
when I want to.''.. Despite his scoring outburst against the
Clippers, O'Neal trails Sixer Allen Iverson in the league scoring
race by 1 points (29.7-28.2).
</P>
<P>
   LAKERS vs. GOLDEN STATE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:30 p.m. at Oakland
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Channel 9; KLAC-AM (570)
</P>
<P>
   Lakers (50-11) update: The Lakers have won 16 in a row,
stretched their lead over Portland to 3 games and became the first
team to reach 50 victories after their win over the Clippers on
Monday. Said coach Phil Jackson: ``That's always a significant
thing at this level. You hope to be the first to 50 and then get
those last 10 or 12 wins that will give you the homecourt
advantage.'' Guard Ron Harper said it doesn't matter much to him if
the Lakers end up with the homecourt edge should they meet the
Blazers in the playoffs: ``I don't care. I'll take my chances with
this basketball team anywhere. I think we have a good enough
basketball team that we can win in any hostile place.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden State (16-43) update: After meeting the worst team in the
West, the Lakers now draw the owners of the second-worst conference
record. The Lakers won the only previous meeting this year, 93-75.
It's L.A.'s first look at Golden State with guard Larry Hughes,
averaging 11.2 points since being acquired from Philadelphia in a
three-player deal Feb. 16.

CALIFORNIA LEADS NATION IN POPULATION GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILBURG  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Despite more than 2 million defections,
California continued to lead the nation in population growth during
the '90s, the Census Bureau is expected to report. A wave of
immigrants and a baby boom fueled a statewide gain of 3,333,694
residents in the 1990s. During the same period, the Census Bureau
reported, 2,170,790 Californians left the state for Las Vegas,
Phoenix and other U.S. destinations.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those defectors were from Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report, the last to be issued by the agency
before it officially begins its 2000 count April 1, covered the
period between April 1, 1990, and July 1, 1999. It was based on
bureau estimates and data supplied by other federal, state and
local agencies. The report is due Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, California gained a net 2,280,354 immigrants
from outside the United States, recorded 5,227,258 births and
logged 2,039,044 deaths. The state's 1999 population total of
33,145,121 was up 11.2 percent from the 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
   California has led the nation in population growth since the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   A boom in babies was a major growth factor in the Southland,
where recorded births in the six-county region outpaced recorded
deaths from 1990 to 1997 by an average of nearly three to one. For
example, Los Angeles County recorded 1,676,786 births during the
decade and 563,934 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County, which added 466,937 residents during the
period to hit a total of 9,329,989, posted a net loss of 1,560,687
domestic migrants. They are defined by the Census Bureau as people
who moved from the county, either to other areas of California or
other states. The net census figure is the difference between the
number of migrants who moved to the county and the total of those
who moved out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Los Angeles County saw a net influx of 902,097
international migrants, people who relocated from outside the
United States. The total included both legal and undocumented
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These figures are extraordinarily significant,'' said Marc
Perry, a Census Bureau demographer who prepared today's report.
``We've rarely recorded migrations and shifts of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said several factors contributed to the Southland's
demographic shifts, including increased legal and illegal
immigration, the passing of the World War II generation and the
post-Cold War recession that gripped the region in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Los Angeles County ranked third in the nation among
counties in terms of total population growth. Maricopa County,
Ariz., which includes Phoenix, ranked No. 1 with a gain of 475,787
residents and a 1999 total of 2,861,395, up 34.8 percent over 1990.
Clark County, Nev., which includes Las Vegas, ranked second with an
increase of 475,787 and a total of 1,217,155, up 64.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to Perry, Maricopa and Clark counties made most of
their population gains at the expense of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was among five Southland counties that posted net
losses of domestic migrants and sizable increases of new residents
from outside the United States. Only Riverside County bucked the
regional trend, adding 175,275 domestic migrants, most of them from
other areas of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside, in fact, ranked second in the state in county
population growth and fifth in the nation. According to Perry,
Riverside's growth mirrored that of the Las Vegas and Phoenix
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have areas that are newly developed, and where housing and
living costs are relatively lower,'' he said. ``Growth by itself
can become an industry. In places like Las Vegas, much of the job
growth has come in construction and related trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the outflow of Southland residents began in the early
1990s, when World War II veterans, many of whom were original GI
Bill homeowners in regions like the San Fernando and San Gabriel
valleys and the Long Beach area, began moving en masse to
retirement communities in rural California as well as the Southwest
and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The trend accelerated with the post-Cold War downturn in
Southern California's aerospace and defense industries, which
forced thousands of working-age adults and their families to
relocate in search of employment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Census Bureau data, the exodus of Californians
peaked in 1993, when an estimated net 430,000 domestic migrants
left the state. Perry credited an improving economy with cutting
the annual net loss of residents to 80,000 in 1999.

AS HEAD OF MORMON CHURCH PRAISES CALIFORNIA ON PROP. 22, STATE'S 
 GAY ADVOCATES SAY PASSAGE WON'T STOP MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worldwide leader of the Mormon Church said Wednesday he is
grateful to California's voters for approving a measure banning
same-sex marriage, as gay rights advocates gamely found a silver
lining in their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Tuesday's election approved Proposition 22 by 61 to 39
percent, a lopsided victory for those seeking to reinforce the law
that makes civil marriage legal only between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to do with core prejudice and not rationality, and
those of us who are gay know what a difficult thing that is to
surmount,'' said state Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco. ``But four out of 10 voters think gay marriage is OK. I
think there's great nobility in that outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure was sponsored by state Sen. William ``Pete'' Knight,
a Republican from Palmdale. Knight's supporters enlisted the help
of the Mormon and Roman Catholic churches early on and raised $10
million, compared with $6.6 million for the No on Knight campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Hinckley, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, said Wednesday that voters had upheld a ``moral
issue of great importance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anti-gay,'' Hinckley said at the National Press
Club in Washington, D.C. ``We are pro-family. We want to emphasize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glazier, communications director for the Protection of
Marriage Committee, said Californians should be proud of ``our
diversity and tolerance, but there are societal boundaries that
should be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   No same-sex couple in the United States can legally marry now,
and Proposition 22 does not change that. It pre-empts California's
acceptance of gay or lesbian marriages should they ever become
legal in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The No on Knight campaign argued that the measure was divisive,
intruded on gays' rights to equal protection and carried a hidden
agenda of overturning gains gays have made in domestic partner
benefits, adoptions and other rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But as it became clear Tuesday night that they had lost, many in
the campaign were saying the initiative started a conversation with
heterosexuals from which there is no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Proposition 22 tried to make their case with images
of lesbian and gay families who, they said, would suffer increased
discrimination if the measure passed. The campaign, which went to
the heart of people's deepest emotions about marriage and family,
was well under way in December when the Vermont Supreme Court ruled
that same-sex couples should have the same protections marriage
offers to heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about whether gays and lesbians should have
rights. We're talking about  &UR; how  &LR; they should,'' said Tracey
Conaty, press secretary for No on Knight. ``The voters aren't ready
to grant gay and lesbian couples civil marriage, but they are more
ready than ever before to recognize our families and to grant us
the same rights and responsibilities they enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a vision there that wasn't there before,'' Conaty
said. ``I didn't think I'd ever have anything to say `thank you' to
Pete Knight for.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kennedy, vice president of the Claremont Institute, a
think tank that says it works to preserve traditional heterosexual
families, said the majority of voters ``live and let live'' but
draw a line at conferring anything to same-sex couples that seems
like marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``California voters in the end seemed to have a good deal of
common sense about this,'' Kennedy said. ``Whether you're for or
against gay marriage, a `no' vote meant a possible redefinition of
marriage. In the end, I think people were not willing to redefine
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kennedy said, ``Voters never bought into the idea that
this was an anti-homosexual measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's critics said the measure would codify gays'
second-class status and could encourage further discrimination,
even violence against them.
</P>
<P>
   But Migden said she believes the state's domestic partner laws
are secure, as well as California's laws banning discrimination in
workplaces and schools based on sexual orientation. Migden
sponsored creation of the state's domestic partner registry, which
took effect January 1.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Community Churches throughout California will begin
a campaign Sunday to register 50,000 domestic partnerships by
year's end, said the Rev. Troy Perry, founder of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups vowed to hold proponents of Proposition 22 to their
word that they would not use the measure to undo benefits gays now
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they thought they could roll back human rights,''
Kennedy said, ``they'd be up against a Democratic Legislature, a
Democratic governor and many Republicans who are in favor of
domestic partner protections.''

BUSH HAS TOUGH FIGHT TO WIN STATE IN NOVEMBER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
California showed its political stuff in the Super Tuesday contest
this week _ and it wasn't necessarily what George W. Bush wanted to
see.
<P>
   Although Bush solidly defeated GOP rival John McCain, the Texas
governor finished a full six points behind Vice President Al Gore
in the state's so-called ``beauty contest,'' which ranked all of
the candidates regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   And exit polls and political observers say Bush has a lot of
work to do if he has any hope of winning the state in the November
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls show Gore running well ahead of Bush among the
moderate, centrist voters who will be crucial in November, as well
as receiving a strong mandate from his own Democratic base _
including women, union members, Latinos and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Those polls also show that three-fifths of California voters
approve of President Clinton's job performance and policies,
two-thirds believe the country is on the right track and 90 percent
are positively beaming about the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, the Voter News Service exit poll showed Gore
beating Bush in a head-to-head matchup, 51 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait, personally. I haven't even gotten started on
Bush,'' said Garry South, the Democratic campaign consultant who
helped shape Gov. Gray Davis' landslide victory over Republican Dan
Lungren in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats are sounding a little giddy, it's because
California is considered essential to maintaining their grip on the
White House in the fall. The GOP nominee, presumably Bush, doesn't
need the Golden State to win the election, but he'll have to spend
both time and money here as a strategic move, to keep Gore from
spending it elsewhere in crucial states the GOP does need, like
Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans insist they are conceding nothing in November _
certainly not California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed this week to do battle in California all the way to
November. But state Republicans have reason to be nervous about
that promise: His father, George Herbert Walker Bush, may have cost
the party crucial state legislative races in 1992 when he stopped
campaigning here early in the presidential contest and virtually
surrendered California to Democrat Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``(George W.) has to start, right away, defining the issues
toward the fall. He can't let Gore do it,'' said Matt Cunningham, a
GOP political consultant. ``He has got to make a case against
sleaze in Washington, and he has got to tie it into the campaign
finance scandals and the dishonor at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor appeared to do just that Tuesday night with a
speech that proclaimed ``the American people don't want a White
House where there's `no controlling legal authority,''' a reference
to Gore's explanation of his connection with a 1996 fund-raising
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The lively presidential contests brought voters out to the polls
in record numbers Tuesday. About 7.1 million votes have been
tallied so far, with another 700,000 to 800,000 absentee votes
still to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic about the way the election went,'' said
Secretary of State Bill Jones. ``The turnout will be about 55
percent, higher than I predicted. It's the highest percentage for a
primary election in 16 years and the largest number of votes ever
cast in a California presidential primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outpolled Democrats, collecting 54 percent of the
popular vote, compared to 43 percent for Gore, Bradley and fringe
candidate Lyndon LaRouche.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; McCain Voters
</P>
<P>
   Many of those GOP votes were from Democrats and independents who
backed Arizona Sen. John McCain, who collected 38 percent of his
support from outside the Republican party. Keeping those voters in
the GOP ledger is going to be tough for Bush to do.
</P>
<P>
   Those party-switchers ``were voting for McCain, not the
Republicans,'' said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster. ``Besides,
the very Democratic and independent voters who gave the Republicans
their advantage (Tuesday) are the very people that Bush has been
denigrating for months. How is he going to convince them that all
is forgiven?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's father held those voters in 1988 and his son can do
it this time around, said Steve Merksamer, a veteran GOP adviser in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to campaign the way he did initially _ as a
compassionate conservative whose message manifests tolerance and
inclusion,'' he said. ``If he does, he absolutely can beat Gore
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history is on the Democrat's side, however. Gov. Davis,
interviewed on television Tuesday night, said that Gore simply
needs to rewind the tape on the governor's own stunning win two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush deserves credit for making education a priority
... but the fact that he's not for a woman's right to choose will
affect a lot of voters,'' Davis said. On abortion, guns and the
environment, the Texas governor ``is on the wrong side of the
issues ... and California is an uphill battle for George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   With eight years of Democratic success to build on in
California, Gore is positioned for a winning effort in the state,
Maslin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is in strong shape in California,'' he said. ``To some
extent, Democrats have to make sure that we don't screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's also the matter of ``face time.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has been to California 65 times as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has made 11 trips here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are playing catch-up,'' said David Chai,
California spokesman for Gore. ``Al Gore, being here as much as he
has, has a very solid understanding of the issues Californians care
about, and he knows the state.''

PARENTS BECOME RELUCTANT ACTIVISTS AFTER SON'S BEATING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 &HT;    c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The mother and father of Pfc. Barry Winchell
often silently sit at their kitchen table, paperwork about their
son's murder piled between them.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless newspaper and magazine articles. Each tells
how their son's head was pounded by a baseball bat because other
soldiers thought he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   There are inch-thick printouts of military policy, which they
think should have prevented the death last July.
</P>
<P>
   There are legal papers, part of an effort to hold the Army
accountable for the murder.
</P>
<P>
   There are condolence letters, many from soldiers, many from
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a growing stack of requests from media and
activists, all wanting this south Kansas City couple to go public
with their grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all so overwhelming,'' Barry's mother said. ``Sometimes
Wally and I just sit here and stare at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of a son would have been devastating enough for Pat
and Wally Kutteles. But Barry was murdered. He was murdered on an
Army base, a place this military family viewed as a safe haven. And
because this high-profile homicide involved issues of
homosexuality, it challenges not only the military's, but also
society's homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not like you have someone die and you bury them and you
mourn,'' Pat Kutteles said. ``It becomes more complicated, and more
complicated and more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is forcing the couple into the role of reluctant
activists, pushing the military to rescind its ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy, which allows homosexuals to serve as long as they
stay closeted.
</P>
<P>
   Today their Washington lawyers are expected to announce the
couple's intent to file a claim under an Army administrative
process, not unlike a civil lawsuit. It is an effort, they admit,
that may be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   In angrier moments, the action is about vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want somebody to pay for this,'' Wally Kutteles said.
``Somebody has to be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the idea of another family enduring the same
pain is central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure that nothing happens to anyone else's
son,'' Pat Kutteles said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the military is taking steps to prevent harassment, it
is the lesser of the couple's targets.
</P>
<P>
   They are also taking on society itself.
</P>
<P>
   Inside their ranch house near Bannister Mall, one parent's words
often tumble over the other's as they form thoughts into a family
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try and change the attitudes, the environment on
the bases,'' Pat Kutteles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stop the bigotry,'' Wally Kutteles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, so that the bigotry is not allowed to exist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many days, the Kutteleses are exhausted _ from grief, from
wrenching gravesite photo sessions, from a schedule that has them
flying from Kansas City to Fort Campbell, Ky., where the trial was
held, to Washington to meet with attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has worked since the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep still comes hard, complicating everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very reluctantly doing all of this,'' she said. ``But, I
guess I have to keep at it to keep the issue in the forefront. I'm
doing it for Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, on what should have been their son's 22nd birthday,
Wally and Pat Kutteles attended a court-martial, seated a few feet
from the men accused of their son's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The small courtroom is part of Fort Campbell, a sprawling Army
base of more than 23,000 soldiers on the Kentucky//Tennessee
border. There, over several months, the parents learned the story
of their son's death.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers testified that the weekend Barry Winchell died was
a raucous one, fueled by daylong keg parties to celebrate the
Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Drunk from the revelry, Pvt. Calvin Glover attacked Winchell as
he slept on a cot in the barracks. Another soldier, Spc. Justin
Fisher, provided the bat, prodded Glover to strike and then washed
the blood from the weapon, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Glover and Fisher are in prison at Fort Leavenworth. Glover was
sentenced to life in prison, and Fisher was sentenced to 12 1/2
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial, the Kutteleses knew their son had been
harassed for months. But they had only suspected commanders did not
stop or discourage the harassment _ a violation of the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony, combined with stories from other soldiers on the
base, provokes the family to spin the mourner's tale of ``what
if'':
</P>
<P>
   What if officers hadn't led chants with gay epithets; what if
other soldiers had spoken out; what if Barry hadn't been afraid of
being expelled from his beloved Army by telling of the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   And what if Pat Kutteles hadn't urged Barry to join the Army.
Her father served during World War II in the Navy, two brothers
were in the Marine Corps, her husband and a surviving son were in
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled when Barry wanted to go into the military,''
she said. ``I still have a hard time with that, that what I wanted
for him is what killed him.'' MORE

CLINTON FIGHTS FOR CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With congressional support for China's entry into
the World Trade Organization eroding day by day, President Clinton
warned Wednesday that rejecting Beijing now ``would be a mistake of
truly historic proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sent legislation to Congress to grant China permanent
normal trade relations with the United States, Clinton made it
clear that he considers China's admission to the world trade body a
top priority of his last year in office and vital to U.S. economic
and foreign policy interests.
</P>
<P>
   Calling China's WTO entry the best opportunity since President
Nixon's groundbreaking trip to Beijing nearly three decades ago to
force further political liberalization in China, Clinton said, ``We
can work to pull China in the right direction, or we can turn our
backs and almost certainly push it in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade legislation would end the contentious annual fight
over China's trade status, but it also lifts the curtain on what is
sure to be one of the most hard-fought battles this year in
Congress, pitting business supporters against labor and
environmental critics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress will not vote on China's WTO entry, which is
expected later this year, rejection of the trade measure would be a
humiliation for Clinton on his last major foreign policy effort. It
would prevent U.S. companies from benefiting from trade concessions
_ like tariff cuts and the opportunity to buy large chunks of
Chinese firms _ that U.S. negotiators obtained last November in
exchange for U.S. approval of China's entry to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Leading business organizations, especially in the high-tech
industry, are waging an all-out effort to gain passage, while labor
unions, led by the Teamsters and United Auto Workers, are fighting
just as hard against it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aimed to rebut a growing chorus of critics from both the
left and the right who warn that China should not be rewarded with
freer trade even as it threatens to invade Taiwan, clamps down on
Internet speech and moves backward on labor and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing normal trade status with China ``won't free a single
prisoner or create a single job in America or reassure a single
American ally in Asia,'' Clinton said. ``It will simply empower the
most rigid anti-democratic elements in the Chinese government ...
Our friends and allies would wonder why, after 30 years of pushing
China in the right direction, we turned our backs now that they
finally appear to be willing to take us up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated his insistence that the trade pact his
administration negotiated presents ``a one-way street'' for the
United States into potentially the world's biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   The pact would open key Chinese industrial sectors, including
telecommunications, automobiles and agriculture, granting enormous
access to a wide range of U.S. businesses. Clinton warned that if
Congress rejects the measure, foreign competitors will gain those
advantages instead and lock out U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton emphasized the foreign policy implications at stake
were even greater.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging China's recent backsliding, Clinton argued
that economic liberalization has already forced the government into
the ``dilemma'' of choosing either further economic and political
freedom, which `'risk unleashing forces beyond their control,'' or
greater isolation, which he said could push China's leaders toward
more internal crackdowns and outward belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this agreement, China has chosen reform, despite the
risks,'' Clinton said. ``It has chosen to overcome a great wall of
suspicion and insecurity to engage the rest of the world. The
question for the United States, therefore, is do we want to support
that choice or reject it, becoming bystanders as the rest of the
world rushes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, even opponents viewed the trade measure
as a pretty sure bet to pass the House and certain to clear the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few weeks, the Chinese government's threats to
invade Taiwan, its attempts to control use of the Internet and its
failure to reach agreement with the European Union on entering the
WTO have undermined congressional support and emboldened opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we may have lost a few Democratic members just on the
basis of the recent comments on Taiwan,'' said Sacramento Democrat
Robert Matsui, who is leading efforts to round up Democratic
support in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable, when you think about it, for them to make
that provocative statement about their willingness to attack Taiwan
in the middle of all our discussions on WTO,'' Matsui said. ``It's
kind of foolhardy and maybe worse than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui said labor unions are ``working this thing hard,'' posing
problems for members as the November elections approach. ``We need
an early vote, that's key,'' Matsui said. ``The longer it drags
out, the more problems occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also rattled China supporters, including
those within his own administration, by sending mixed signals about
the China trade measure. Labor leaders meeting with Gore in New
Orleans last month said Gore told them that he would negotiate a
tougher agreement with China if he became president.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Gore clarified his position, writing a letter of
reassurance to the National Association of Manufacturers that he in
fact supports the administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is now pushing for a vote as early as April
in the Senate, which normally would vote after the House in an
effort to gain some momentum for a House vote by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a vote as early as we possibly can,'' said
Covina Republican David Dreier, who is leading the drive for the
pact among House Republicans. Asked when that was, he said, ``When
we have the votes.''

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT MAKES PITCH TO USE DODGERS LOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Desperate to replace the now-abandoned Belmont
Learning Center, Los Angeles education officials have found a nice,
open, empty spot downtown to build a new school - Dodger Stadium's
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A corner of it, actually, is all they want for Dodger High.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Los Angeles Unified School District said
Wednesday that Dodgers Lot 23, part of the stadium's outer ring of
parking, could easily hold a school for 2,000 students on 16 acres.
</P>
<P>
   That would go a long way toward replacing the more than 4,000
student seats lost when the school board voted earlier this year to
abandon the Belmont Learning Center, a $175 million high school
built atop a dangerous oil field. Together with several other
downtown sites, including the Ambassador Hotel and the school
district's own headquarters, the Dodgers lot could provide the
space needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites will provide smaller and better schools, faster
than Belmont ever could have been completed,'' said Howard Miller,
the district's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming the Dodgers can be persuaded to part with the
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers spokesman Derrick Hall said it was too soon to comment
on the proposal. The organization just received a letter from
Miller on Tuesday expressing the district's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still new to us,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he had a brief phone conversation with Dodgers chief
executive officer Bob Daly to begin discussions about the site.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified already has run into stiff opposition over
its efforts to find land for building badly needed schools. North
Hollywood residents still are protesting the district's proposal to
build a high school on the site of the Robinsons-May department
store chain headquarters on Laurel Canyon Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Miller emphasized that the district only was interested in a
16-acre piece of the 300-acre parking lot, not the entire stadium.
Since many of the students who would have attended Belmont live
close by, the site makes too much sense not to consider, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is so perfect for us, from everything we know, we
have to look at it,'' said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   He will present the idea to school board members today at a
meeting of the board's facilities committee. Even before the
meeting, however, several board members praised the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids could leave their densely crowded neighborhoods and have
a more peaceful place to study in the hills,'' said board member
David Tokofsky, chairman of the facilities committee. ``There's
room for the city, the board, the parks and the Dodgers owners to
come together around some of the extra space up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on sales of other large parcels in the area, the Dodger
Stadium site might be worth about $9 million, said Ed Palmer,
associate vice president in the downtown Los Angeles office of
Grubb &AMP; Ellis, a commercial and industrial real estate firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat of a unique situation, considering it sits
within the Dodger Stadium confines,'' said Palmer. ``There is not a
lot to compare that with.''
</P>
<P>
   But the site would pose several problems. Most notably, it would
eliminate some parking at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But several board members said the district might be able to
compensate by building a parking garage. And unlike other potential
school sites located near industrial properties, they said the lot
would rest between relatively benign neighbors - parkland and a
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is dealing with traffic, but that can be
managed,'' board member Caprice Young said. ``And there's nothing
that goes on at a ballpark that goes against family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Los Angeles City Council belatedly entered the
Belmont debate. At the urging of Councilman Mike Hernandez, the
council passed a motion that calls for the city to withhold key
funding and building permits for new school construction in the
Belmont attendance area if the council is dissatisfied with the
district's plans to replace Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The motion also calls for the school board to reconsider the
fate of Belmont, the nation's costliest school. Despite the
threatened sanctions, the school board has vowed to reject any
attempt to resuscitate Belmont. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ is what killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Barry's death, his parents had only a shadowy familiarity
with the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. It represented more of a
media catch phrase than anything.
</P>
<P>
   Now they understand it is only a policy and that the military
stands firmly behind its court-upheld right to reject anyone for
military service.
</P>
<P>
   The military has reissued and clarified regulations stating
harassment of gays is not allowed, and other rules governing who
and what can initiate an investigation to decide if someone is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the American public to think that we just created
all of these policies because of his death,'' said Maj. Pamela
Hart, spokeswoman for Fort Campbell. ``It is preposterous for
someone to think that we had no structure in place, but we have
clarified it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense's inspector general is examining the
level of harassment at 38 military installations, both in the
United States and abroad. The inquiry includes all military
branches, military officials say, with a report due to Secretary of
Defense William Cohen on Monday. And anti-harassment training has
begun on many bases, including Fort Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the murder itself, but the Kutteleses' willingness to
speak about it that pushed the military response, said Michelle M.
Benecke of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a Washington
group that monitors the military's policies about homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have already made a big difference,'' Benecke said. ``For
six years, SLDN asked the military service leaders to send a strong
message against harassment, but no steps were taken until after the
Kutteleses began to speak publicly about their family's
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Korean War veteran, Wally Kutteles speaks especially well
to other veterans, Benecke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is supposed to be an Army of the people,'' Wally Kutteles
said. ``And if it is, then all Americans should be able to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaining the ability to speak about the murder has been a painful
journey for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   For four months they refused to speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   That stance changed after coverage focused on the murder as a
hate crime, but not on Barry, their son.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they allowed The New York Times to visit their home.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared on ``60 Minutes'' and national morning television
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair photographers came to the house on Monday, preparing
for a large article in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kutteles spent hours taping media interviews at Fort
Campbell to be aired with the announcement of their intent to
challenge the Army.
</P>
<P>
   At some levels, each interview reignites the pain as they
retouch their grief, their growing distrust of military justice and
their current activism.
</P>
<P>
   More unsettling have been the articles and news reports they do
not agree to give.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kutteles went to her son's grave one day, hoping for some
quiet time. She found a photographer hired by Time magazine,
clicking shots of the tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the instances when they are ``blindsided,'' as
Pat Kutteles says.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she stopped for gas at a convenience store. She
filled her car, stepped inside and asked for a pack of cigarettes
to fuel the chain-smoking that returned when her son was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching into her purse, she spotted a Rolling Stone magazine
propped in a rack near the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   And with that one glance, the anguish slipped into her day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a reality check that just jerks you right back,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She knew the magazine had an article about Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, there are new revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of photographs recently arrived in the mail. One shows
graffiti on a wall at Fort Campbell after the murder, a sketch of a
baseball bat with the inscription, ``Gay Whacker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just cried when I saw it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kutteleses know Barry can be a sympathetic victim, even to
people adamantly opposed to homosexuals, because it is unclear
whether he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   That is another very private issue that still goads the family.
</P>
<P>
   They insist that it really doesn't matter, that it is enough
that Barry was killed because people thought he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether Barry's murderer was gay. During the
trial, a psychiatrist testified that Fisher secretly dressed in
women's clothing for years, prompting speculation that his hatred
originated from unresolved feelings about his own sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing stops the speculation about Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Their son's self-described lover is doing interviews in national
magazines. Calpernia Sarah Addams is a man but lives and dresses as
a woman. In pictures, Addams appears voluptuous, with heavy makeup.
He refers to himself as a ``female impersonator.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry had a girlfriend for years, until a breakup several months
before the murder. His parents searched their love letters, some of
the personal belongings the Army returned after Barry's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no indications that he was gay,'' Wally Kutteles
said. ``They were love letters, just love letters.''
</P>
<P>
   To them, their son was Barry, who they still sometimes called
``Bear Bear,'' a childhood nickname.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Bear,'' a Jack Russell terrier, runs through their
home as they sort the piles of paperwork that stream through their
new fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kutteles flips through her schedule for the coming months.
There will be more meetings with lawyers, a speech at a gay rights
rally in Washington, another in Chicago, a panel discussion in
Philadelphia and, always, more media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Tallying each event, she begins to mentally commit to the
activist role that is now hers.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is involved in all of the decisions. But it is she
who carefully clips all the news articles. It is she who usually
answers the telephone when reporters call and she whom the cameras
tend to dote on, seeking to capture a mother's grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it is harder now,'' she said. ``When it first
happened, you are in such a state of shock. But now, well, I still
have times when I feel like he should be walking through the
door.''

SENATE CLEARS WAY FOR VOTE ON STALLED JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (Subs 5th graf to update on Gore's plans to be in Washington for
vote) 
 (bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Wednesday to end debate and move
to a final vote on two of President Clinton's nominees for federal
appeals court posts in California whose nominations have been
stalled for years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, moved aggressively to
block a rebellion in his party in order to fulfill his promise to
have a floor vote on the two nominees, Judge Richard A. Paez and
Marsha L. Berzon.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have been nominated for seats on the 9th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which covers California and
several other Western states. The Senate is expected to narrowly
confirm both, probably on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both nominees have come to symbolize the angry and divisive
politics behind judicial nominations. Paez, of U.S. District Court
in Los Angeles, was first nominated to the appeals court seat more
than four years ago, setting a modern record for the time a nominee
has waited for a final vote. Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer, was
first nominated more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two nominees are expected to win the approval of all 45
Democrats and at least six Republicans, including Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. At the
request of Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, Vice President Al
Gore changed plans to campaign on Thursday in Minneapolis and flew
back to Washington to be available if there was a tie vote on Paez.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Democrats campaigned to save the nominees, charging
that Republicans had purposely slowed the process of confirming
federal judges in the hopes of keeping as many seats vacant as
possible in the hope that a new Republican president would be able
to select the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch disputed that charge. Lott agreed to a vote on the
nominations by March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee, said he believed the Republicans had tried to
kill the nominations by preventing a floor vote because they would
be reluctant to vote against a Hispanic candidate in an election
year.

<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock glanced at his depleted
lineup, and a single thought came to mind. ``I'm looking at a crowd
of about 4,000 back in Kalamazoo,'' Hitchcock said. ``I wouldn't
want to be going into the playoffs with this lineup. Right now, I
see early golf times.'' Maybe the Brad Lukowich-Roman Lyashenko-Jon
Sim line convinced him. Maybe it was his goalie tandem of Manny
Fernandez and Marty Turco. Or maybe the simple math of subtracting
nine regulars from his lineup because of the early-morning arrest
of usual goalie Ed Belfour, injury and flu finally sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account that nine, one looked pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars said they were more than happy to take the point that
came with their 3-3 tie with a surging Vancouver bunch last night
at Reunion Arena. The Canucks are 6-3-3 with 16 points in theirpast
12 games. ``To get a point with everything that happened
\Ryesterday\S, with the flu and everything, losing guys, it's
good,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``We'll take it and move
on.'' Even coughing up two third-period goals didn't seem to bother
the Stars too much. Considering the day they had and the lineup
they skated, who could blame them? The day began with news that
Belfour had been arrested and wouldn't play. He wasn't scheduled to
start. Backup Manny Fernandez was. But they didn't have a backup,
so Turco was called up from Kalamazoo, Mich. Stars players and
coaches talked about it yesterday morning then tried to put it
behind them for the game. ``We faced so much adversity this year
that what can you do,'' said Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor, who
started the game playing wing on the third line and finished the
game playing defense alongside Sylvain Cote. ``Guys that were in
this room still had to go out and play the game.'' The list of
players who weren't was long and impressive. The injury list grew
to include winger Mike Keane (back) and center Guy Carbonneau
(wrist) along with the regulars: winger Blake Sloan (ankle), winger
Jere Lehtinen (ankle), center Joe Nieuwendyk (shoulder), center
Brian Skrudland (chest) and defenseman Shawn Chambers (knee). The
flu prompted the Stars to send captain Derian Hatcher and winger
Scott Thornton back from morning skate in hopes they'd be ready for
the game. Only Hatcher could go, and he didn't last the entire
game. He left in the third period with a strained right Achilles'
tendon and plenty of flu symptoms. He's listed as day to day. Only
the Stars could dress eight defensemen and be left rotating two
defensive pairs by the end. ``It seemed like everybody they played
was on defense,'' Canucks winger Alexander Mogilny said. ``So you
had to play against five defensemen pretty much.'' Which seemed to
be working for the Stars until the third period. Well, that and
Fernandez kept bailing them out. But the 3-1 lead the Stars took
into the period didn't last long. Vancouver got goals by Harold
Druken 79 seconds in and Mogilny at 9:41 of the period to wipe out
the Stars' lead that had taken two periods, two power plays to
create. The Druken goal was especially hard to swallow as Fernandez
had come out to play the puck. He lost. Druken scored into what
amounted to an empty net. Fernandez said he felt a little naked
without Belfour on the end of the bench. ``I didn't think I was
going to say this, but it's like an extra confidence when he's on
the bench,'' Fernandez said. ``It feels a lot better. It felt weird
today, all in all. I think I put a little too much pressure.'' He
finished with 23 saves, and Vancouver goalie Garth Snow had 33.
Snow didn't look good early, but he got better, including stopping
seven shots in overtime. The Stars were all over him early. Brett
Hull opened scoring at 9:30 of the first period. It was Hull's
first goal since Feb. 25, his 20th of the season and the 606th of
his career. He's four goals away from tying his father, Bobby, for
eighth most goals. Stars winger Grant Marshall flipped the puck in
off Canucks defenseman Chris Joseph's stick and past Snow at 18:16
of the first period. The referees sent the play upstairs to be
reviewed, and it was called a goal. Jon Sim then scored on the
power play. The shot came from Sergei Zubov from the point. Sim
tried popping it in. The puck went into the air so Sim took a
baseball swing and scored that way at 17:30. They weren't happy to
cough up the lead. But considering Hitchcock called it the
``worst'' of the makeshift lineups he's had to use this season, he
wasn't complaining too much. ``That was one of those times you get
a point and you're happier than hell,'' Hitchcock said. ``All in
all, missing that many hockey players and to play that hard and
quite frankly that well against a team on a roll is a happy point
for us.'' nn

 MARRIAGE NEEDS VIGOROUS DEFENSE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The fear here is that government is getting too
complicated, especially after Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Proposition 22 passing, it now becomes vital for the
government to prevent fraudulent marriages by determining that each
prospective married couple contains one bona fide representative of
each of the two major genders. As anyone who spends much time in
San Francisco knows, a cursory visual inspection won't do the
trick.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the Department of Motor Vehicles will be assigned
to handle the job, creating a subdivision of the smog-check
program. Certified walk-in inspection stations will advertise,
``Sex Chex _ You pass or you don't pay.''
</P>
<P>
   And because sex-change operations do occur, married couples will
be required to get a sex check every five years to make sure
they're not polluting the marriage pool.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER PROBLEM could arise from the voters' passage of
Proposition 12, a $2.1 billion bond for water quality,
environmental and park projects.
</P>
<P>
   Niccole Bilotti was reading her state voter information booklet
and noticed that the argument against the bond was: ``The truth is
the govt. will use the vast majority of this money ... to buy more
land for insects, rats and weeds that your family will never get to
see or use.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilotti voted yes on 12, taking the leap of faith that our
government will allow us at least some visitation rights to the
insects, rats and weeds that will be purchased with our hard-earned
tax moneys.
</P>
<P>
   THE CENSUS can be confusing, too.
</P>
<P>
   First the bureau mailed out the census forms with an extra digit
in each address. Which means that many people won't receive their
form until their next life.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Sheehan received his letter. ``It said I was going to
receive a form in about a week, and it will be important to
complete and return the form. Enclosed was an envelop addressed to
Census 2000. No clue as to what I was to put in the envelop. Am I
to save the envelope for `about a week'? Hope you have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, I think you're supposed to take your scissors and
carefully cut the extra digit off the address on that envelope and
mail it back, so it can be recycled. But that's just a guess.
</P>
<P>
   THE ELECTIONS did help simplify the political situation in one
respect. Now Gore and Bush can finally stop the senseless and
monotonous trashing of their party rivals and start the senseless
and monotonous trashing of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Elections are a party in S.F., and Ed Moose threw an FDR party
on election day at his North Beach restaurant. Revelers included
Jean Stapleton, who is playing Eleanor Roosevelt in a one-woman
show here in S.F., and Jan Katten, one of FDR's two surviving
nieces.
</P>
<P>
   Guests ate Hooverville Stew and passed the hat, chucking in
nearly $2,000 for St. Anthony's Dining Room, and everyone gathered
'round the bar to talk politics.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown mentioned to a group of his admirers, ``George W.
Bush is the only national candidate in my experience who probably
reads the sports section first.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE W IS searching the sports pages for a running mate. With
Jesse Ventura's popularity, it makes sense for Bush to look to the
world of sports to fill out the old ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan would make a good VP. Even though he endorsed
Bill Bradley, Jordan is now a political free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Mark McGwire, a good guy who enjoys enormous public
popularity? McGwire plays baseball seven months out of the year,
but as Al Gore has demonstrated, VP is only a part-time gig.
</P>
<P>
   What a ticket: W and Big Mac. A hot dog and a hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, McGwire is too nice a guy for the job. And not
terribly sophisticated politically; at least he wasn't years ago
when he played for the Oakland A's. He went to vote one election
day and got turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know you had to sign up first,'' Mac said.
</P>
<P>
   INTERESTING theory put forth by one of the revelers at Moose's:
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ran for the nomination at the urging of Demo insiders,
who knew Bradley couldn't win but knew that Gore needed a worthy
foe, much as a boxer in training for a big fight needs a good
sparring partner.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders knew it would be dangerous for the GOP to get all
the ink during the primaries as Bush and McCain battled it out
while Gore was on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's primary attribute, polls show, is that people recognize
him, and it was vital to keep him in the public eye. Thus the bid
by Bradley, who kept Gore sharp without injuring him.
</P>
<P>
   As a theory, this one is either half-baked, or poached in a
creamy dill sauce.

   VETERAN LAWMAKER ROUTED
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years in Congress representing eastern Los Angeles
suburbs, Rep. Matthew G. Martinez was soundly defeated Tuesday in a
primary challenge from a fellow Democrat, state Sen. Hilda L.
Solis. In unofficial returns, Solis had 63 percent of the vote, to
28 percent for Martinez, a result whose lopsided nature surprised
even supporters of the 42-year-old challenger and reflected the
continuing emergence of a new generation of Hispanic politicians in
California. Martinez, 71, known as Marty, was the only member of
Congress who lost in Tuesday's primaries around the country. He had
faced primary challenges in the past in a district that includes
towns like El Monte, Baldwin Park and Alhambra and remains safely
Democratic in November, but this contest was especially bitter,
dividing the local Hispanic elected establishment. Solis, with
backing of local unions, maintained that Martinez had grown out of
touch, and just hours before conceding, he called her obnoxious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES D.A. STUMBLES
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Gil Garcetti, as district attorney of Los Angeles
County the head of the largest local prosecutor's office in the
nation, fall short of a majority in his re-election effort, he came
in second. Garcetti got a little more than 37 percent, to 38
percent for Steve Cooley, one of his deputies. That means they will
face off in November, with Garcetti struggling because of criticism
that he has been slow in handling a police corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   THIS BIRD WON'T FLY
</P>
<P>
   The people of Orange County, just south of Los Angeles, voted in
surprisingly strong numbers for a ballot measure that appears
likely to kill the prospect of building what would have been one of
the largest airports in the region. By 67 percent to 33 percent,
they backed Measure F, which requires that the county government

   ONLINE AND ON TRACK
</P>
<P>
   More than 17,000 Democrats in Arizona cast ballots through the
Internet in the first two days of a primary billed as the first
binding online election. An hourlong failure caused by online
traffic congestion prevented voters from casting ballots early
Tuesday afternoon, and at least 100 voters required technical
assistance because outdated Web browsing software would not allow
them to vote. But by the end of Tuesday, more than 13,000 Democrats
had voted online, officials said. The rate fell Wednesday, after
news that Bill Bradley would drop out of the race. Arizona
Democrats with Internet access can cast ballots through Friday, at
any time of day, and those without access can vote at polling
places Saturday.

   OHIO COMEBACK
</P>
<P>
   Back from political oblivion, Mary Rose Oakar, an Ohio Democrat
who in the 1992 elections lost her seat in the U.S. House after
eight terms and later pleaded guilty to election law abuses, was
effectively elected by Democrats to a seat in the Ohio House on
Super Tuesday. Oakar defeated three primary rivals for the
nomination in a legislative district that includes part of her old
working-class congressional district. Oakar, who will be unopposed
by Republicans in November, lost her congressional seat after the
House banking and post office scandals broke in 1992. She wrote
more than 200 House bank overdrafts and circumvented election law
by funneling contributions through the House post office.

MEMPHIS _ This was no Elvis sighting. This was the real deal, start
to finish. His Cougars, Clyde Drexler bragged, finally kept the eye
of the tiger right through the final horn. As a result, The Streak
is as dead as The King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Clyde said, looking relieved, ``I might get my hug.''
</P>
<P>
   After the University of Houston succumbed to Louisville on
Saturday, having started horribly and concluded listlessly to
complete Drexler's second regular season with a humbling 11-game
skid, athletic director Chet Gladchuk suggested to Clyde's mother,
Eunice Scott, that her famous son needed a warm embrace to help
keep his dauber up.
</P>
<P>
   Mom, however, is an advocate for tough love. She replied that
none would be forthcoming until the Cougars found a way to beat
somebody. Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   We must assume she was kidding. Wasn't she?
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The Cougars got Drexler off the hook Wednesday.
Pyramid power paid off for them _ again _ in the form of a 77-75
victory over Marquette in the first round of the Conference USA
tournament. Since Jan. 8, a span of 60 days that probably felt like
60 years to everybody who cares about the battered Houston program
Drexler is so selflessly attempting to restore to a modicum of
prominence, UH is 2-0 in Memphis' arena and a very unlucky 0-13
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only other game the Cougars have claimed since the
millennium was by a single point at home against Tulane, which
happens to be their Round 2 opponent today. Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won much lately,'' Gee Gervin said in response to a
question about how he and his teammates would respond to their
newfound, uh, momentum. ``We're hungry for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once all season have the Cougars put together back-to-back
victories _ they beat TSU, Rice and Valparaiso successively in
Houston in early December _ but they've come tantalizingly close
too many times to count.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler's frustration with their inability to stay strong down
the stretch boiled over last week when a 15-point halftime lead
over Southern Mississippi was blown in a 67-65 loss. Afterward,
Clyde questioned the Cougars' heart for making good things happen
with the outcome hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams with no heart find ways to lose, and we have no heart to
step up and win games in the last three minutes,'' were his exact
words that night. Three days later, another flat tire near the
checkered flag doomed UH against Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Against Marquette, however, the Cougars unflinchingly withstood
every threat and never coughed up the lead that Gervin's
three-point play gave them with just under eight minutes gone in
the first half. The Golden Eagles kept the heat on, but in a
startling script rewrite, the Cougars played for the ``W'' instead
of playing to avoid the ``L'' at the end. Shots dropped on a series
of crucial possessions, each of which could have proved fatal with
a misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in shades of UH disasters past, Gervin and Bernard Smith
chased made free throws with misses to keep Marquette in striking
distance, ensuring the dark clouds of doubt over the UH bench would
keep roiling until a successfully completed inbounds pass with 1.8
seconds left permitted the clock to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations, based on empirical evidence, had to have been low,
for both Drexler and the Cougars. Yet somehow the terrible weight
of the past wouldn't be allowed to drag them down. UH hadn't won a
postseason game of any kind since defeating TCU in the Southwest
Conference tournament in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when everybody thought Pat Foster was a bum because he
couldn't get the Cougars out of the first round of the NCAAs? Or
when Guy Lewis got beat up for failing to win a national
championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``This team had a lot to overcome mentally,'' Drexler conceded.
``I'm really proud of the way they were able to hang in. We finally
made a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   If not exactly a statement. Marquette, at 15-13, isn't anything
special. That the Golden Eagles were unable to erase one-point
deficits on nine occasions was at least as much an indictment of
their own deficient wherewithal as it was evidence the Cougars have
truly turned a meaningful corner. But as desperate as Houston's
plight had become, with a school-record 21 losses already indelibly
attached to Drexler's legacy, any sign of life is to be construed
as a major step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of how next year should be the year for UH to
blossom, given its promising incoming recruiting class.
Nonetheless, to go into the season beaten down by the weight of a
dozen defeats in a row wasn't going to be a healthy situation for
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   A mother and her son included.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
RUDY Tomjanovich was flipping channels on the TV recently when
suddenly the pictures and the faces became so familiar that he put
down the remote control and became caught up in the old moment.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charles Barkley wearing the uniform of the Phoenix
Suns, and there were Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Sam Cassell
and Mario Elie doing amazing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those classic sports channels, and they were
showing Game 7 of the Phoenix series in the second championship
season,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I got caught up in it and started to
watch it, to appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we all remember Mario's shot that won the game. But
I was sitting there, and I started to see all the other little
things that made it possible. Loose balls, an extra pass on
offense, a hand on a ball on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching, and I'm thinking, `One free throw in the right
place by them, and all this could have not taken place.' It's
amazing how fast it's all happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What is equally amazing is that Rudy T, the reluctant head coach
at the time he succeeded Don Chaney in February 1992, has now
signed a contract extension that will keep him on the job through
2005. Which speaks to the respect he has earned from within the
Rockets organization and the stature he has achieved outside it,
all while attracting little notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Any time somebody starts listing the coaching geniuses on their
blackboard or telestrator, the familiar names are offered.
</P>
<P>
   There is Ayatollah Pat Riley and an approach that has grown
increasingly iron-fisted in his three incarnations in LA, New York
and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Brown is usually regarded as a basketball gypsy, roaming
from town to town spreading locker-room wisdom like Johnny
Appleseed.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, the guru, has six championship rings in his trophy
case, not a single one of them without Michael Jordan, and now he
may be moving toward another, with Godzilla _ in the form of
Shaquille O'Neal _ trampling a path.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson still gets acclaim in some corners as a nutty
professor with all of his wild lineups and tactics, but he has
never taken a team to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, managing to stay just out of the spotlight are a couple
of guys named Rudy T and Jerry Sloan, who just happen to have more
tenure with their current teams than any other pair of coaches in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're similar in that we don't necessarily like the
notoriety,'' Tomjanovich said. ``All the other stuff that goes
along with having this job, I do because it's part of it. But if it
were just about basketball, I'd be in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the shoemaker's son from Hamtramck, Mich., has changed
somewhat as a result of his success, because success does that. But
what has not changed are his core beliefs about playing the game,
about starting it all with defense, about teammates making
sacrifices and yet allowing the disparate personalities on a club
to keep their individual identities while committing to the common
goal. It's how he won two championships in his first three full
seasons on the job and how he has quietly carved out a reputation
as one of the coaches everybody wants to play for and have
represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Tomjanovich led a group of CBA wannabes and
European castoffs to the bronze medal at the World Basketball
Championships in Greece, it was not just the X's and O's and
results that overwhelmed the hierarchy of USA Basketball, but his
demeanor and the way his team played for him.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he'll lead the Olympic Dream Team this summer. And
why it was the right move for owner Leslie Alexander to keep this
team in his hands as the Rockets try to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich is so familiar, so comfortable here that we
sometimes fail to put his accomplishments into proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens is the career leader in coaching victories, won
one title in Seattle, coached the U.S. to Olympic gold in 1996 and
is in the Hall of Fame. Chuck Daly won two NBA titles in Detroit,
coached the 1992 Olympic team to gold and is in the Hall of Fame.
Rudy T has two titles and will be on the sidelines in Sydney. He is
compiling a Hall of Fame resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about those things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he has other problems. Like teaching these young
Rockets what it means to give it up for each other, to buy into his
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, it's an awesome task to try to do it all again from the
ground up,'' he said. ``But I watched that game on TV from '95, and
I remember the feeling. I want to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   So he stays and believes. In the past and the future.

GALAXY SEEKING NEW HOME?

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the start of the 2000 Major League Soccer
season just nine days away, the Galaxy's long-term future at the
Rose Bowl appears to be shakier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy and Cal State Dominguez Hills officials confirmed
Wednesday they have talked about the team building a stadium on the
Carson campus. The 30,000- to 35,000-seat soccer-specific stadium
would be constructed on the site of the 1984 Olympic Velodrome.
</P>
<P>
   The $50-60 million facility also could house a training center,
perhaps featuring six or more fields that also could be used by
U.S. Soccer's National Teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy opens the 2000 MLS season March 18 against Colorado
at the Rose Bowl, where it has played for four years. The team's
Rose Bowl lease expires after this season, but it holds an option
for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't solidified anything yet, but we are fortunate that
we have the kind of land available for this to happen,'' said
George Pardon, Cal State Dominguez Hills vice president of business
and administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next month is really going to determine what happens,''
Galaxy General Manager Sergio Del Prado said. ``The support we get
at the start of the season will determine it, and also what we're
able to work out with the Rose Bowl in terms of making it more
attractive for our fans. But obviously, we would love to have a
soccer-specific stadium. But the economics have to make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Bowl General Manager Darryl Dunn said he isn't resigned to
losing the team yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to do what's best for their franchise,'' he said.
``You have to respect that. But hopefully, they would look at our
positive attributes before they make a decision (to leave).''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy owner Philip F. Anschutz took a helicopter ride over the
campus a month ago. It is located near the junction of the Harbor
(110), San Diego (405) and 91 freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday, U.S. soccer officials unveiled their plans for a
National Training Center. They are accepting bids to construct and
service a permanent training facility for all of U.S. Soccer's
National teams.
</P>
<P>
   If the Galaxy and Cal State Dominguez Hills can reach agreement,
officials said Anschutz would build a stadium and also make a bid
for the U.S. Soccer training center.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon said architects hired by the Galaxy have surveyed 40 to
50 acres of the university's campus that would be needed for the
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we met, about three weeks ago, they brought a
master plan architect and we talked about availability, how much
land we had to offer and how this could work for them,'' said
Pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether it works from their perspective, but
we're hopeful. People here are embracing the idea. The only people
objecting are those who use the velodrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon says the velodrome doesn't generate any revenue for the
university. He said the university spends roughly $10,000 a year to
help maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon said Cal State Dominguez Hills would make money on a
soccer stadium, because the Galaxy would lease the land from the
university.
</P>
<P>
   If the parties can reach an agreement, Pardon said he expects
the Galaxy would begin construction quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read an article that said Anschutz would like a stadium
built in 18 months,'' said Pardon. ``I would speculate once they
have a design, it's costed out and the framework is put forward, we
could go through this in a timely manner once environmental studies
and other necessary studies are completed. It also has to be
something the community wants, and we think it does.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rose Bowl also would love to keep the Galaxy, Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the history of soccer here, we would love to be the
permanent home of the Galaxy,'' he said. ``We know they have
concerns about the size of the Rose Bowl, but there are sports
architects these days that can do incredible things to develop an
intimate atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rose Bowl can't offer the new training facility the
Galaxy desperately needs and wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the space for soccer in the city of Pasadena is
lacking,'' said Dunn. ``If there was space in Pasadena for us to
use both our resources we would love to work something out with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said there is no animosity between the Rose Bowl and the
Galaxy, nor has there been since Anschutz purchased the franchise
in the fall of 1998.

CARTER'S LEGEND GROWS WITH ANOTHER GAME-WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a cushion of 324 days before Vince Carter's
next birthday, the Clippers appeared to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   So, like graffiti on a masterpiece, the NBA's biggest joke
thought it had rallied from Shaquille O'Neal's 61-point birthday
party by defacing Carter's critically acclaimed road show.
</P>
<P>
   Hah, these are the Clippers and this is March Badness.
</P>
<P>
   All Carter did was pen another chapter in his growing legend by
dropping a 3-pointer at the buzzer Wednesday to give Toronto a
95-94 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This foiled art depreciation happened before 18,176
rubberneckers at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   After Toronto erased a 14-point, fourth-quarter hole, rookie
Lamar Odom dropped a pair of free throws with 1.5 before extinction
to give the Clippers' a 94-92 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors' now have a franchise-high, seven-game winning
streak. Carter, the NBA's newly anointed acrobat out of hell,
answered his 35-point effort vs. the Trail Blazers by scoring 23
points (12 in the fourth quarter) on 9-of-21 shooting. He had 51
points vs. Phoenix in the first game of the streak.
</P>
<P>
   Clipper Tyrone Nesby, Carter's date for the evening, showed up
prepared and produced 21 points. He also left Carter wide open on
the final play.
</P>
<P>
   Odom bagged 16 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists while running
the point. Maurice Taylor had 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting, while
Michael Olowokandi checked in with 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a 6-point, 5-rebound deliverance by Olowokandi - and a
1-for-6 shooting effort from Carter - the Clippers led, 21-18,
after the first quarter. Nesby (9 points) and Taylor (8) took over
in round two, and the Clips led, 51-43, at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto went up, 65-64, with three minutes left in the third,
but consecutive steal-and-dunk plays by Nesby and Derek Anderson
gave the Clippers the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Their greatest advantage (86-72) happened when Anderson nailed a
3-point jumper with 9:01 to play.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Clippers sprayed a little graffiti on what had
been their own masterpiece. Charles Oakley finally brought the
Raptors even at 90 by making a 20-footer with 1:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Former Long Beach State head coach Joe Harrington
(1987-'90) is in his second season as an assistant with the
Raptors. Toronto's head coach, Butch Carter, was an assistant for
the 49ers under Harrington, who won 53 of the 89 games at LBSU. ``I
love it and I've learned so much about basketball,'' Harrington
said of coaching in the NBA. ``To be around guys like Vince
(Carter) and Tracy (McGrady) is a privilege.'' ....Clippers point
guard Troy Hudson (gastritis) extended his streak for not suiting
up to t hree. ... Aside from having only a dozen victories, the
Clippers had added incentive in their attempt at defeating Toronto.
The Raptors' lottery-protected pick in the 2000 NBA Draft - which
would be the 18th selection as the standings fall right now - had
belonged to the Atlanta Hawks, who traded it (along with their own
No. 1 pick) to the Clippers in last summer's Lorenzen Wright
sign-and-trade deal. More Raptors' losses mean a higher selection
for the Clips. ... Veteran point guard Haywoode Workman turned down
an offer to sign with the Clippers last off-season, then had his
agent tell the Clips to pass when the Milwaukee Bucks put him on
waivers last month. The Clippers did, choosing to avoid bringing in
a player who didn't want to be here. Workman was claimed by the
Raptors, who've played him 42 minutes in the six games he
participated in prior to Wednesday night. He might be starting for
the Clips, but the Raptors entered the game as the fourth playoff
seed in the Eastern Conference.

NETS DEFEAT TRAIL BLAZERS, 115-103 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Wednesday was the type of day that has
often seemed reserved for professional basketball franchises
outside New Jersey. It was a day when everything from doctors'
reports to jump shots fell favorably for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Jayson Williams receiving clearance to compete in
full-contact practices as soon as Thursday, and it ended with the
Nets walloping the powerful Portland Trail Blazers, the league's
second-best team, by the almost inconceivable score of 115-103.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off their five-game Western Conference trip, the Nets
blitzed one of the league's elite defensive clubs for more points
than any other opponent this season, a full 25 above Portland's
average allowed. And in a game they led by as many as 26 points,
the Nets became just the fifth team to defeat the Blazers (46-14)
by a double-figure margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows everybody that we're legit, and that on any given
night we can be the best team in the league or we can be the worst
team in the league,'' said Kendall Gill, one of five Nets players
to score in double digits with 14 points. ``The trick for us is to
stay at a consistent level. This was a totally legitimate win. They
had all of their people, and we went in there and did what we had
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The shocking performance continued a stretch of basketball that
can safely be called the Nets' best of the season. In winning 6 of
their last 11 games, the Nets have defeated playoff-bound Miami,
Minnesota, Charlotte and now Portland; they lost close games to the
stalwarts, Utah and San Antonio. And in what can only be a great
sign for Coach Don Casey's club, the Nets (25-36) play 8 of their
next 12 games at Continental Arena, where they have won 5 of their
last 6 contests and are 18-12 over all.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Nets visit Milwaukee, which at 29-32 is tied with
Orlando for the Eastern Conference's eighth and final playoff spot.
It is one of three meetings the clubs have remaining this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way these guys play in their hearts and their minds,
we have as good a chance as anyone,'' Casey said, referring to his
team's shot at qualifying for the postseason. ``It's just that
we're paying for past sins. So we're trying to create a better
spiritual atmosphere so those sins will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's return would certainly generate enthusiasm, even
though it will be a while before he can make key contributions.
After undergoing a series of strength tests, the charismatic
center, who has been sidelined since breaking his right leg last
April 1, was cleared to practice just hours before Wednesday
night's tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be back and to earn my money,'' said Williams,
who also underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept.14.
``And it's exciting because I really don't know how I'm going to
play. I'm waiting to see. It's like playing poker.''
</P>
<P>
   A quirk in the Nets' schedule gives them five days off between
home games on March 12 and March 18, so Williams is hoping to get
in enough practices to be ready for the March 18 game against
Milwaukee. He said stipulations in the Nets' insurance policy will
limit him to a maximum of eight minutes of play in each of the
first six games.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams is already envisioning himself in the Nets'
rotation, Michael Rowe, the team's president, said the club had no
timetable for his return to game play. ``Our coaches will evaluate
his competitiveness over the next six or seven practices,'' Rowe
said. ``Then, he'll have another examination to make sure there's
no swelling or pain, and a decision in consultation with our
doctors will be made.''
</P>
<P>
   With Williams on the bench in a suit, Stephon Marbury led the
Nets with a near triple-double performance of 24 points, 13 assists
and 7 rebounds. After scoring more than 30 points in five of the
past nine games, he began the contest by passing almost
exclusively. With his teammates shooting well, Marbury tallied 8
assists in the first 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles was brilliant in starting the Nets off hot, making
three of four 3-point attempts in scoring 13 of his 15 points in
the first seven minutes. Behind him, the Nets took a 30-25 lead
after one quarter and rolled from there.
</P>
<P>
   Things went so swimmingly for the Nets, who led by 61-47 at
halftime and by 94-70 after three quarters, that Jamie Feick, their
brutish rebounder, attempted a couple of 3-pointers. With the game
well in hand, the 6-foot-8-inch center canned his first 3-pointer
since joining the Nets last March with 1 minute 44 seconds left.
The basket, which gave the Nets a 112-93 lead, felt good to Feick.
So he drilled another one on the Nets' next possession to add a
season-high-tying 16 points to his 8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on with the 3-point jokes,'' said Feick, who now has 11
career 3-pointers. ``I used to shoot the three in high school and
at Michigan State. I shot it in the NBA too. Look at the stats.
It's not in the game plan here, though.''

negotiating contracts that shield these workers from INS scrutiny.

Munich. ``The Long Journey Home,'' a selection of stills from the
4,000 feet of film Fulton shot, is being published next month by

   NY-UNDERGROUND (New York) _ In most mythology, the underworld is
a serious and not necessarily pleasant place. It's a place you want

New York subway rider, who, let's face it, wants out. Even today,
when a vast capital improvement program has made the subway system
significantly cleaner, safer, more efficient, more comfortable and
even more attractive than it has been in decades, life underground
resists cheeriness. So when a bright, playful design element
blossoms in our municipal netherworld, it deserves notice, even
gratitude. By Peter Edidin.

27TH DISTRICT BATTLE UNDER WAY
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER HAMM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Los Angeles _ The November congressional campaign is already in
high gear between incumbent Rep. James Rogan, R-Pasadena, and
challenger state Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena, even before the last
ballots in Tuesday's primary have been tallied.
</P>
<P>
   The rivals, who will meet in the Nov. 7 general election, had a
free ride in this week's primary because neither faced opposition
from within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   But both were pointing to Tuesday's results as a sign of failure
by the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff called it a ``stunning defeat'' for Rogan, who received
47percent of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally shocked,'' said Schiff, who received 49percent
of the votes. ``I figured (Rogan) would have to have a substantial
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rogan, who represents a district in which registered voters
are 44 percent Democratic and only 37 percent Republican, said he
was also surprised, pleasantly so, because his support Tuesday
extended beyond the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   He said the results prove voters are solidly behind what he
calls his ``issue-based campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This election shows that voters stand behind honest
representation in Washington, not partisan politics,'' Rogan said
Wednesday. ``Adam Schiff's dreams of being this great savior of the
district who was just going to ride in to a victory is obviously
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted he might have the most votes in the primary after
late absentee ballots are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, a two-term congressman and former Municipal Court judge,
drew national attention when he served as a House impeachment
manager during the Senate trial of President Clinton last year.
Critics of the impeachment process vowed to raise campaign
contributions and drive Rogan from office in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be one of the most closely watched congressional races
in the country,'' said H. Eric Schockman, a professor of political
science at the University of Southern California. ``If Schiff does
win, it really does start chipping away at the Republican
scorecard.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a Republican stronghold, the 27th District has seen its
registered voters becoming increasingly Democratic in recent years.
The district includes Burbank, Glendale, Sunland, Tujunga, Pasadena
and nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff has raised nearly $1.4 million in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan has collected $2.5 million and spent much of it on
fund-raising, establishing a list of contributors he can call on in
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   A large Democratic voter turnout for the presidential election
in November could be a factor in the Schiff-Rogan contest, said
Stanley W. Moore, a political science professor at Pepperdine
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a powerful election tide for Gore, I think Rogan
will leave,'' said Moore.

CARTER'S LEGEND GROWS WITH ANOTHER GAME-WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a cushion of 324 days before Vince Carter's
next birthday, the Clippers appeared to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   So, like graffiti on a masterpiece, the NBA's foremost punch
line attempted to rally from Shaquille O'Neal's 61-point birthday
party by defacing Carter's critically acclaimed road show.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the Clippers and this is March Badness. They don't
seem eager to study their play book, but they certainly can read a
script.
</P>
<P>
   And all Carter did was create another Michael Jordan
impressionist painting by dropping a deep 3-pointer at the buzzer
Wednesday to give Toronto a 95-94 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This foiled art depreciation happened before 18,176
rubberneckers at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we could go for a 2 or a 3, but I was going for a 3,''
Carter said of his battle plan when the Raptors broke their huddle
trailing, 94-92, with 1.5 to play. ``If I miss it, everybody will
be mad. If I make it, we celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, once again, the Clipper bannedwagon (31 defeats in their
last 34 games) careened into the nearest ditch.
</P>
<P>
   After Toronto (35-25) erased a 14-point, fourth-quarter hole,
rookie Lamar Odom dropped a pair of free throws with 1.5 before
extinction to give the Clippers that 94-92 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after a pair of strategy-shuffling timeouts, an unguarded
Carter received the inbound pass from Tracy McGrady and promptly
extended the Raptors' winning streak to a franchise-high seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to switch everything so we could stop the lob
inside,'' said Clippers interim coach Jim Todd, attempting to
explain why Carter was so lonely above the 3-point arc. ``We were
going to switch any screens and any cross screens.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Raptors didn't screen. The Clippers switched anyway,
with Tyrone Nesby - who guarded and outplayed Carter for three
quarters - running at McGrady, who wouldn't have had time to
receive a return pass and fire before the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured he (Nesby) was going there for reason, because there
must have been someone behind me,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Your witness, Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got all messed up,'' said Nesby, who shared team-high
scoring honors with Derek Anderson at 21.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the NBA's newly anointed acrobat out of hell, scored 23
points (12 in the fourth quarter) on 9-of-21 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Odom bagged 16 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists while running
the point. Maurice Taylor had 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting, while
Michael Olowokandi checked in with 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (12-49) led after each of the first three quarters,
and took their biggest lead (84-72), when Anderson nailed a 3 with
only 9 minutes between his team and victory.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Clippers sprayed a little graffiti on what had
been their own masterpiece. Charles Oakley finally brought the
Raptors even at 90 by making a 20-footer with 1:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Former Long Beach State head coach Joe Harrington
(1987-'90) is in his second season as an assistant with the
Raptors. Toronto's head coach, Butch Carter, was an assistant for
the 49ers under Harrington, who won 53 of the 89 games at LBSU. ``I
love it and I've learned so much about basketball,'' Harrington
said of coaching in the NBA. ``To be around guys like Vince
(Carter) and Tracy (McGrady) is a privilege.'' ....Clippers point
guard Troy Hudson (gastritis) extended his streak for not suiting
up to three.

DUCKS LET ANOTHER GET AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks seem intent on making it Christmas
all season long -- they certainly have caught the spirit of giving.
In their lastest third-period disaster it was Guy Hebert in the
role of Santa Claus as he gave up two soft goals and the New York
Rangers went on to defeat the Ducks 4-3 in overtime before 13,565
at The Pond on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim dominated the game, outshooting New York 39-22, but they
couldn't overcome yet another shakey performance by Hebert, who
like the Ducks is making inconsistency an artform.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert had already allowed a floater by Radek Dvorak to beat him
on the stick side in the first period, but Ducks responded to take
a 3-2 lead into the final 1 1/2 minutes of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   It look as if it would be a mere formality for Anaheim to wrap
up its sixth win in six games against the Rangers at The Pond. But
then Jan Hlavac's sharp angle shot from the bottom of the left
circle somehow went under Hebert's arm to tie the game at 18:40.
</P>
<P>
   With one point already given away, the Ducks then allowed Brian
Leetch to walk down the slot and beat Hebert on glove 29 seconds
into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a helluva game, I can't say anything bad about the
way we played,'' said Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg. ``It's
certainly a heartbreaking loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg seemed leery to say much about Hebert's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other goalie (Mike Richter) stood on his head,'' he said.
``We have to come up with bigger saves.''
</P>
<P>
   By squandering the lead and the game, the Ducks lost a chance to
pick up a point on eighth-place San Jose, which remains four points
ahead of the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give up points like that,'' said Ducks center Tony
Hrkac, who gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead in the first period. ``One
minute left, you have to keep them down. Maybe in a year or so we
won't make these mistakes, but we need the points now.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly bent on self-destruction the Ducks fell behind 2-1
early in the second period. But Anaheim responded with two goals to
take a 3-2 lead after 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Richter on the top of his game, Anaheim needed to crash the
net and that is just what it did. On the Ducks' second power chance
of the night Paul Kariya, returning from a seven-game absence due
to a foot injury, made a nice backhand pass to Fredrik Olausson at
the right point and his shot was deflected in the slot by Steve
Rucchin for the center's 15th goal of the season at 6:45.
</P>
<P>
   Richter denied Jeff Nielsen, Mike Leclerc and Hrkac on one
flurry in front of the New York net midway through the period, but
there was little he could do to stop Teemu Selanne from scoring his
26th goal of the year at 12:08. Rucchin put a shot on net after
Pavel Trnka aggressively held the puck in at the left point and
Selanne outbattled Brian Leetch for his own rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outshot New York 10-6 and controlled play most of the
first period, but they left the ice with little to show for their
efforts as the Rangers tied the game 1-1 with 35.2 seconds left in
the period on a suspect goal by Radek Dvorak.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who shutout Nashville on Sunday, was beat stick side
from the top of the right circle on a shot -- yet another in series
of soft goals that have plagued the Anaheim goalie this year.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes earlier, Richter made a huge save on
Rucchin to keep the Rangers within a goal. After taking a cross-ice
pass from Selanne, Rucchin appeared to have the New York goalie
beat with his one-timer from the right circle, but Richter slid
across the crease and just got his pads on the shot.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied, 1-1, another Anaheim weakness reared its
ugly head. The league's worst penalty killing unit gave up its 55th
goal of the season at 4:43. The Ducks failed on a chance to clear
the puck and it soon wound up behind Hebert when Michael York found
Adam Graves alone in front of the net. The verteran winger took his
time and beat Hebert with a perfect shot on the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame attention was rightfully centered around the return of
Kariya, but it was Anaheim's fourth line that gave the Ducks a 1-0
lead at 7:11. Taking advantage of a turnover at the New York blue
line and some good corner work by Nielsen, Tony Hrkac scored from
the edge of the crease when his shot bounced off Mike Knuble and
into the New York net. It was just the fourth goal of the year for
the veteran Ducks center.

THE INS AND OUTS OF NCAA TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who's in, who's out, winners and losers, picks and
pans - it's the season (and postseason) in 1,000 words, starting
with predicted NCAA Tournament bids.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10: Stanford's the No. 1 seed in the West if it beats
Arizona tonight. (If not, the Cardinal could lose its top spot.)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is the No. 2 seed in the West if it beats Stanford
tonight. (If not, the Wildcats will get shipped out as a No. 3.)
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's in for the first time since 1995, probably as a seventh
seed.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA needs one victory to clinch - presumably, it comes tonight
against Washington State - and probably is headed for a No. 7 or 8
seed.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State has just 16 Division I wins and ziltch on its
nonconference resume, so the Sun Devils must sweep Cal and Stanford
this weekend to get a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Coast Conference: Duke is the top seed in the East and
will play in Winston-Salem, N.C. Maryland's in, North Carolina's
in, and Virginia clinches a bid if it beats N.C. State in the first
round of the ACC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic-10: Temple's a No. 2 seed if it wins the A-10 tourney,
a No. 3 seed if it doesn't. Either way, the Owls are the one team
!ital!no one wants to play. Just ask Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's also in. St. Bonaventure and Xavier probably aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten: The winner of the league tournament (assuming it's
Michigan State or Ohio State) is the top seed in the South and
probably plays in Nashville, Tenn. The loser's a No. 2, perhaps in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, Purdue and Illinois are locks. Wisconsin's deserves a
bid based on nonconference victories over Texas, Temple, Marquette
and Missouri. The Badgers could be a No. 9 or 10 seed, which makes
them a possible first-round foe for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   SEC: The nation's best conference should send six to the
tournament. Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky and Louisiana State
(another team to avoid) will be high seeds. Vanderbilt's probably
in that No. 8-10 range and also could draw UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's fate depends on suspended star Chris Porter; if the
Selection committee doesn't expect him to return, it could drop the
Tigers to a No. 7 or 8 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12: Texas, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Kansas and surprising
Iowa State are locks. Missouri, which lacks good wins, probably
needs a victory in the conference tourney. Yes, the bland Big 12
could get six bids.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA: Cincinnati is the No. 1 seed in the Midwest and
probably will play in Cleveland. Louisville has 18 wins and tough
schedule to boost its seed. DePaul needs a win in the C-USA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Big East: Syracuse, Connecticut, Miami, Seton Hall and St.
John's, the hottest of the bunch, are in. Notre Dame (17-13) and
Villanova are out, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain West: Utah's the only lock from this rookie conference,
which does not have an automatic bid this season. UNLV probably
needs a few wins in the conference tourney.
</P>
<P>
   Western Athletic: Tulsa is the trendy pick for a few upsets -
this year's Gonzaga. Jerry Tarkanian's trying for his first
tournament appearance with Fresno State. Southern Methodist also
has a case. Odds are, one of the two will get in.
</P>
<P>
   West Coast: Gonzaga's in, of course, and Pepperdine should have
nothing to worry about. The Waves' schedule will score major points
with Selection committee members, who saw the botched call against
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   All-American team: Iowa State's Marcus Fizer, Cincinnati's
Kenyon Martin, Notre Dame's Troy Murphy, Louisiana State's Stromile
Swift and Indiana's A.J. Guyton.
</P>
<P>
   Second-team: Ohio State's Scoonie Penn, Michigan State's Mo
Peterson, Duke's Shane Battier, Texas' Chris Mihm and Fresno
State's Courtney Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Player of the Year: Martin is the best player on the No. 1 team,
and his numbers are superb: 19.5 points, 10 rebounds and 3.57
blocks per game. But the Bearcats would be a top-25 team without
him.
</P>
<P>
   No one combines production and value like Fizer, a 6-8 junior
who's averaging 24.8 points in Big 12 play. The Cyclones were
picked seventh in the Big 12 in the preseason. Thanks to Fizer, who
has scored at least 30 points in five consecutive games, they won
the regular-season title.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year: Iowa State's Larry Eustachy has been
brilliant, guiding the Cyclones to their first league title since
1945. But the pick here is LSU's John Brady, who guided the upstart
Tigers (25-4, 12-4) to the SEC West title.
</P>
<P>
   All-Pac-10 team: Arizona's Loren Woods, Michael Wright and Jason
Gardner, Arizona State's Eddie House, USC's Brian Scalabrine,
UCLA's Jason Kapono, Stanford's Mark Madsen and Casey Jacobsen,
Oregon's Alex Scales and A.D. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Just missed the cut: UCLA's Earl Watson, Arizona's Gilbert
Arenas, USC's David Bluthenthal, UCLA's Jerome Moiso, Cal's Sean
Lampley and Stanford's David Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 freshman of the Year: It's a fabulous group, no doubt.
Jacobsen, Kapono and Arenas were consistently good. But for
excellence and impact, they can't top Gardner, who averaged 12.9
points, 4.9 assists and 37 minutes at the toughest position, point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 Coach of the Year: Arizona's Lute Olson or Stanford's
Mike Montgomery? Give it to tonight's winner.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 Player of the Year: It was Woods until he got hurt. House
has the best numbers (22.9 ppg) and the best game (61 points) of
the contenders, and he's pushed his team beyond expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one problem: He's the mouthiest, dirtiest player in
the league. House went so far as to grab Arizona guard Gilbert
Arenas' groin several times in a recent matchup - for the purpose
of inhibiting Arenas' off-ball movement.
</P>
<P>
   One courtside observer saw House do it, while another heard
Arenas complain to the officials. After the game, Arenas confirmed
it. Naturally, House denied it.
</P>
<P>
   So let's give the Pac-10's top prize to one of its best
citizens, Stanford senior Mark Madsen, who plays hard, not dirty.
Madsen might be the nicest guy in the league. When UCLA's JaRon
Rush took the court for warmups Saturday - his first game in three
months - Madsen immediately extended a hand and welcomed Rush back.

WAITING IS THE HARD PART FOR PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pepperdine basketball players surely know how John McCain
felt as he waited for the votes from Tuesday's primaries to be
tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   Or what it was like to be Michael Clarke Duncan in the days
before the Academy announced its Oscar nominees.
</P>
<P>
   For Jan van Breda Kolff, Pepperdine's first-year coach, this
week must feel kind of like that moment 26 years ago between his
proposal of marriage and wife Betty's reply.
</P>
<P>
   For four days more, the Waves are doomed to college basketball's
purgatory, suspended between grace and everlasting regret.
</P>
<P>
   They earned the benevolence of the 10-member NCAA Tournament
selection committee by winning the West Coast Conference
regular-season title outright but are being made to suffer for
having narrowly failed to beat Gonzaga in Monday's WCC tournament
final.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' 69-65 overtime victory against Pepperdine earned
them automatic entry into the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves ought to crash the postseason gala as one of the 35
at-large teams by virtue of their 24-8 record, which includes
regular-season victories over tournament-bound Louisiana-Lafayette
and Gonzaga, an Elite Eight team in 1999, and RPI-boosting losses
against Auburn, UCLA and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all worried today,'' van Breda Kolff said Wednesday
about securing an at-large berth. He allowed himself a small
chuckle. ``You can ask me again in a few days. But right now I'm 99
percent certain we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff gave his players Tuesday and Wednesday off, so
naturally they've been doing a lot of surfing. Not in the swelling
waves of the Pacific below campus, mind you, but on the Internet
where various so-called experts have seeded Pepperdine anywhere
from No. 9 in the South to No. 11 in the East to a No. 12,
destination unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the result of too many hours holed up in a hotel
meeting room, but the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee has shown
a puckish streak in the past. A wink-wink-nudge-nudge scenario this
year would have the Waves being shipped out to Nashville, one of
the South sub-regional sites and van Breda Kolff's address until
last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny ... for the past month my assistant coaches have
pulled up (mock) Tournament seedings on the Internet and lately it
seems that our seeding keeps changing, but we always end up in
Nashville,'' said van Breda Kolff, who coached at Vanderbilt for
six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He was unceremoniously let go from the university - his alma
mater, no less - at the end of the 1999 season after averaging 17.3
wins a year. Van Breda Kolff's son, Jan-Michael, is a senior at
Vanderbilt and he keeps hearing the Waves are Nashville-bound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls me, laughing, and says, `Wouldn't that be
unbelievable?''' said the elder van Breda Kolff, who would prefer
not to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather the focus be on who we're playing, not where we're
playing,'' said van Breda Kolff, who landed the Pepperdine job in
April.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Malibu, he promptly installed a high-octane
brand of basketball, complete with a full-court press that
perfectly complemented the nine returning lettermen he inherited
from Lorenzo Romar, who left to become the head coach at St. Louis
University.
</P>
<P>
   The lapping Waves opened with a two-point win over Long Beach
State, a probable NCAA Tournament participant, and finished with 16
victories in their final 19 games. Their Ratings Percentage Index -
the tournament admission equivalent of the SAT - is in the high 30s
or low 40s, depending on whose calculations you endorse.
</P>
<P>
   (Pepperdine has reason to be suspicious of the RPI after winning
two games against conference caboose Loyola Marymount in
mid-February and watching its RPI drop while Cal saw its RPI rise
after suffering a 51-point defeat at Stanford the same week.)
</P>
<P>
   The Waves did everything to get into the NCAA Tournament but
crisply execute their offense in their final few possessions
against Gonzaga Monday night. They deserve an at-large bid, if for
no other reason than to keep the two-month conference schedule from
appearing as expendable as tonsils.
</P>
<P>
   A snip here, a cut there and college basketball loses much of
its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, to presume the curtain will rise on Pepperdine's NCAA
Tournament scenario is to set the stage for yet another Vitalean
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Cal was bloodied by the dagger last year, failing to make the
64-team cut despite posting regular-season victories over Arizona,
North Carolina and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   How deep was the wound? More people probably remember the
Bruins' first-round loss to Detroit-Mercy in the NCAA Tournament
than the Golden Bears' victory over Clemson in the final of the
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Gonzaga beat Clemson during the regular season but
San Francisco, with nary a quality win on its regular-season
ledger, won the WCC Tournament and advanced to a first-round NCAA
Tournament date while the Bulldogs stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Those Bulldogs were as worthy of an NCAA bid as these Waves,
which is why there is no joy in Malibu just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until dusk on Sunday it'd probably be better for
Pepperdine fans to err on the side of gloom, especially given that
only six times in the 45-year history of the WCC has two of its
teams marched in the NCAA postseason parade.
</P>
<P>
   If the Waves don't expect too much from the NCAA Tournament
Selection Committee, they're liable not to be let down. That said,
we'll be chagrined if Pepperdine isn't in.
</P>
<P>
   Why, it'd be the biggest crime committed against the program
since referee Ruben Ramos waved off Craig Lewis' putback of a David
Lalazarian three-point miss that would have sent Pepperdine's game
at UCLA into overtime back in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves deserved the chance to play on then, just as they do
now.

NORTHRIDGE SURPRISES WEBER STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. - This is a knockout tournament, and the Cal
State Northridge men's basketball team had the heavy punches, the
speed and the stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Bye-bye, Weber State. So long, defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who had never played the Wildcats in the Big Sky
tournament, made their mark Wednesday night in a 73-68 win in front
of 3,522 surprised fans at Dahlberg Arena.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (19-9) advanced to Friday night's semifinal against
top-seeded Montana, the tournament host. The Wildcats (18-10) limp
back to Utah after losing in the first round for the first time in
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Matadors) are just a good team,'' said Weber State's
Harold Arceneaux, the two-time Big Sky Player of the Year who had
26 points. ``I can't beat around the bush; they've probably got the
best talent in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which made it to the tournament semifinals for the third
time in four seasons, simply ran WSU into the ground in the second
half for its fourth consecutive win. Northridge used an 18-5 run
out of halftime to take a 52-40 lead and control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Andre Larry had eight of his 20 points in the
flurry. Larry made 8 of 11 shots, including 4 of 6 on 3-point
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to go home early like we did last year,'' Larry
said, referring to CSUN's 91-90 first-round loss to Montana State.
``This year we've got a lot of fire in us.''
</P>
<P>
   That fortitude was strong in the first half, when Arceneaux
appeared to be on his way to a 40-point night. The 6-foot-6 forward
outscored CSUN himself 8-6 in the first four minutes, and Weber
State took a 13-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But CSUN held and rallied to tie the game at 17 at the 12-minute
mark. A dunk by Larry made it 19-17 and WSU realized this wasn't
the same Northridge team that disintegrated in the second half of
the teams' first game, a 113-92 Wildcats win in Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   Arceneaux and Eddie Gill combined for 70 points that night, and
afterward CSUN coach Bobby Braswell vowed the Wildcats hadn't seen
``the real Northridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Braswell was right. Despite the early Arceneaux
explosion _ Braswell said the Matadors were failing in their
``Arceneaux awareness'' _ he and Gill ended up making a combined 10
of 29 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Gill had a miserable game to possibly end his career
</P>
<P>
   1 for 13 from the field, five points, eight turnovers, five
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know (Weber State) doesn't sub Harold and Eddie much,''
Braswell said. ``Part of Eddie's poor shooting has to do with the
fact he played 39 minutes. He didn't get a break until he fouled
out. We wanted to keep defensive pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was done in part by CSUN point guard Markus Carr, who
destroyed Gill on the offensive end with a career-high 23 points,
and reserve Craig Calloway, a freshman who had seven quality
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gill wasn't the only first-team all-conference player in the
tank. CSUN center Brian Heinle missed all seven of his shots in the
first half. But Heinle's fortunes changed a bit in the opening
seconds of the second half; he rattled in a 12-footer that gave
Northridge a 35-34 lead. Weber State never led after that.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle made up for his 2-for-13 night with six rebounds and four
assists. Also strong on the boards was senior forward Hewitt Rolle,
who had seven rebounds in 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northridge played a great game,'' said WSU forward Shawn
Moore, who missed both his shots and was scoreless. ``Northridge is
a great team. No excuses. We just couldn't hang with them in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first men's quarterfinal, third-seeded Northern Arizona
held off No.6 Portland State 77-75. The Vikings (15-14) had a
chance to tie the game at the buzzer, but guard Ivan Garner's
10-foot shot bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   NAU (18-10) plays No.2 Eastern Washington (15-11) in the other
semifinal Friday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Public that favors gun control held hostage by NRA
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After just about every notorious new, senseless shooting spree _
most recently the death of that six-year-old girl, those five shot
by a Pennsylvania man in anti-white rage _ my wife asks how many
more must die before we get sensible gun control. The question is
only rhetorical, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be because the answer is already in: the numbers do
not matter because the powers resisting gun control simply don't
care about them. There is no elusive, magical body count out there
that will trip legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   If there were, we would have comprehensive control now, instead
of our current mishmash of laws. After all, year in and year out,
we lose more of our folks to gunfire than most other comparable
democracies combined.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton keeps pointing out, last year we lost some
4,700 children in gun deaths _ more than the child gun deaths in
the next 25 countries altogether. Even that can't unstick beholden
members of Congress from gun-lobby money and the votes promised
with it. (Or stiffen the craven against the threat implied to those
who disdain it.)
</P>
<P>
   So, although the public overwhelmingly, though inchoately,
supports gun control and has for decades, the nation remains
hostage to the National Rifle Association's permanent hysteria _
any control is a step toward federal storm troopers kicking in your
door and snatching your guns! _ and hostage to the big money and
the power politics that support the hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the current stand-off. The House and Senate passed
mild-to-meaningless controls last year, but there were signal
differences over one feature that could really matter: provisions
to close a loophole that allows sales at gun shows without
background checks. The Senate version plugs the loophole. The House
version pretends to.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference is necessary to resolve the
differences, and the president recently called in leaders of both
chambers and urged action. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the key
player, said no.
</P>
<P>
   (The NRA remains bee-busy in the state legislatures, too. It was
instrumental just days ago in killing a bill in Georgia that would
have held adults liable for negligently leaving firearms where kids
could get to them easily.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, just like my wife, recently asked, ``How many more
people have to get killed before we do something?''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, when it is expected to, dutifully tsk-tsks over gun
victims, but in truth it doesn't really give a hoot about them. If
it did, it would be trying to prevent gun crime. Instead, its
response to every new gun outrage is only to call for putting
someone in prison, though that is self-evidently not a deterrent
and is cold comfort to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of fussing in the political atmosphere about
victims' rights. The most important right is the right to be given
a fair crack at not becoming a victim in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   On average, we're sacrificing 13 kids a day to keep the NRA
happy. It's political paganism.

   WASHINGTON _ ``A lot of people turned back,'' recalls trail
guide Jim Frush, who last August led Al Gore and his son, Albert
III, on a 16-mile trek to the snow-encrusted peak of Washington's
Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Frush shared his recollections in a 30-second TV spot that was
aired to promote Gore's bid for the White House. It featured
personal photos of Gore and his then 16-year-old son, loaded down
with heavy backpacks, as they scaled the 14,410-foot mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it _ safely,'' Frush says in the campaign ad.
``Strength of character, perseverance, grace under pressure. These
are qualities you look for in a mountaineer, or even better, in a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the climb, Gore had left town without, as is usual,
informing the press of his travel plans. Subsequently, the vice
president said he had sought privacy because this was a strictly
personal family trip aimed at bonding with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Some seven years before the Mount Rainier trip, Albert III also
served as a Gore campaign prop. That was at the 1992 Democratic
National Convention when, in an emotional speech, Gore listed the
life-threatening injuries that his 6-year-old son had suffered on
April 3, 1989, when he let go of his father's hand and darted in
front of a speeding car as they left the Baltimore Orioles' season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to his family life, Gore claims the right to pick
and choose what should be made public and what should stay private.
</P>
<P>
   Some seven years after his accident, young Gore, by then a
student at St. Albans School, was caught smoking an illicit
substance in a secluded part of the campus known as the Bishop's
Garden. As their punishment for breaking the school's honor code,
Gore and two of his 13-year-old classmates each were given two-week
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the school officials' response, Gore and his wife,
Tipper, abruptly cut their ties to St. Albans, from which Gore had
graduated and where he continued to work out after moving into the
nearby vice-presidential residence. Sidwell Friends, another
prestigious Washington prep school, where at the time President
Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, was enrolled as a senior, promptly
agreed to admit Albert III to the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Before that transfer took place, the vice president had called
several editors, urging them to respect his son's privacy. (A brief
account of the incident had run in a school newspaper, without
citing names. Another rule-breaker was the son of a prominent
journalist.)
</P>
<P>
   No other press accounts appeared, although the incident was
later raised obliquely in some stories as a counterpoint to the
widespread charge that the press had gone over the top in reporting
about Clinton's escapades with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Gore privacy pendulum swung back again from
his publicized family outing on Mt. Rainier. In his Harlem debate
with Bill Bradley, Gore was asked why, while sending his children
to elite private schools, he opposed vouchers that would allow some
poor families do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the question, Gore replied: ``You know, you can leave
them out of this if you want to.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Always having to say you're sorry
 &HT;    For release March 12, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're old enough, you likely will remember Billy Eckstine's
soulful rendition of ``I Apologize'' which begins, to paraphrase:
``If I told a lie, if I made you cry, from the bottom of my heart,
I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that song ought to be brought back as this appears to be
the Year of the Apology. Seemingly, everyone is apologizing for
something or being asked to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to deliver a cluster of apologies today on
behalf of what are called sins of the Catholic Church over the
centuries. Expected among them are apologies regarding the
Holocaust, Crusades, Inquisition and religious wars against other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of apologizing and I wonder who is around to feel
soothed about it _ other than the pope. Certainly not the Jews who
still lay great blame for the Holocaust at the indifferent feet of
Pope Pius XII. And certainly not Italy's gay community, which is
quite upset that gays are not included in the pope's index of
apologies and is demanding that he add it.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, legislators are calling for Gov. Parris Glendening
to apologize for the state's history of slavery. In North Carolina,
Duke University students want an apology from CBS basketball
analyst Billy Packer for sexist remarks. And in Florida, a
legislator has agreed to apologize to the full House of
Representatives for failing to show a child support debt on his
financial disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the really big-time apologies:
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, the baseball pitcher, apologized to practically
every one in the world who was not white Anglo-Saxon. Darryl
Strawberry apologized for snorting more cocaine. John McCain
apologized for terming his North Vietnamese captors and torturers
``gooks.'' (I wouldn't have but I wasn't running for president.)
George W. Bush somewhat apologized for speaking at Bob Jones
University. He really didn't apologize for being there, instead
said he was sorry for not speaking out while there about racial and
religious injustice at the racially and religiously unjust
university.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida tried to defend his brother's
appearance there, he likened speaking at Bob Jones University to
speaking at a synagogue. Sixteen legislators expressed rage and
demanded an apology from the governor. As of this writing, none is
forthcoming; perhaps the pope can include it in his congregate
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   There are more apologies floating around than there are dragon
flies.
</P>
<P>
   The coach of the New York Knicks basketball team last month
apologized to a Miami Heat player for tackling him in a playoff
brawl in 1998. And the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts has
apologized for using paid aides to babysit her newborn child.
</P>
<P>
   How far do we take these apologies, and does it really change
anything?
</P>
<P>
   Shall the Egyptians be made to apologize for enslaving the
Hebrews? Shall the descendants of David be made to apologize to
Goliath's kin; the oaf had kids, didn't he? Then there's that Jews,
Judas and Jesus thing.
</P>
<P>
   And something else that needs apologizing for: In two
dictionaries I researched (Oxford English and Webster's New World),
first definition for ``apology'' is to DEFEND an idea, religion,
philosophy; a vindication from accusation or aspersion. Second
meaning is reference to an acknowledgement of fault.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't enough to confuse people I don't know what is.
Therefore, even the lexicographers owe us an apology.

 &HT;    Did you hear the one about the kid with the shaved head?
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ A friend of mine told me this story the
other day. An employee told him, and she heard it at the bank. All
three people believed it to be true, because that's how it was
related to them:
</P>
<P>
   A mother and her 5-year-old daughter were in a Lufkin store. I
won't say which one. The mother turned around, and the child had
disappeared. The mother wisely went to the front of the store and
told the manager, who promptly locked the doors. They began to
frantically search for the little girl. Finally they searched the
bathroom. They found the girl with her head shaved, wearing a
completely different set of clothes than she had originally worn.
Luckily, she was unharmed, except for the shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption was that someone was attempting to kidnap the
girl by changing her appearance and then planned to spirit her out
of the store.
</P>
<P>
   My friend wanted to know if we had reported this in the
newspaper. I said we would check into it, though I had a strong
suspicion about what had happened. Turned out I was right.
</P>
<P>
   The story is an urban legend. There is not a shred of truth to
it. A police department spokesman said this particular legend has
been floating around Lufkin for several months, with slight
variations. A colleague wisecracked that all that was missing from
this version was that besides a shaved head, the kid's kidney
should have been missing.
</P>
<P>
   This urban legend is especially gripping because it plays off
every parent's worst nightmare: losing a child. It does happen, of
course, though more often than not a angry ex-spouse is to blame.
And the fact that children, sadly, do disappear lends a slight
amount of credence to this story. Happily, this version is
completely bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Out of curiosity, I found a Web site (there are many) that
collects urban legends. It took me just a few seconds to find a
legend on that site that bears strong resemblance to the story
above:
</P>
<P>
   ``A small girl was abducted away from her parents at Disney
World. The distraught parents were taken to a surveillance room
filled with monitors to look for the child. Almost at the point of
giving up, the mother recognized the child's shoes when a strange
woman attempted to leave the park, child in hand. The reason the
shoes were all that were recognized is the child's hair had been
cut and dyed, and she'd been dressed as a little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The footnote below reads, ``No child has ever been abducted at
Disney World or Disneyland. Sometimes this one takes place in other
amusement parks, or even supermarkets.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another urban legend that passed our way a few weeks ago.
It's one I've encountered several times over the years. I received
a fax from a reader who said he had heard the Federal
Communications Commission was about to ban all religious
programming on television and radio. He was understandably upset
and wanted to alert the public so letters of protest could be sent
to the appropriate agencies and elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of this also have made the rounds for years; this urban
legend seems to have come to life during the heyday of obnoxious
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who brought the lawsuit that
restricted organized prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   There is no truth to the story that the FCC wants to ban
religious programming: not then, not now. You can go to the FCC's
Web site and read statements from FCC officials assuring the public
that nothing of the sort is being contemplated. For one thing, it
would unquestionably be a violation of the Constitution to have
such a ban. Again, there's not a shred of truth to this legend, but
that doesn't stop it from popping up every few years. And it
doesn't stop the FCC from periodically being swamped with angry
letters from outraged citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, I went to the Web site, downloaded a stack of
material and sent it to the reader with a note explaining that this
is an urban legend and asking him to reconsider publishing the
letter. He thanked me and, one hopes, is no longer concerned with
this bogus issue.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that strange things don't happen. But when you
hear a bizarre story from someone who heard it from someone else,
whose third cousin swears her best friend's brother-in-law was an
eyewitness to this horrific or amazing event, be skeptical. And if
you have Internet access, you can search for ``urban legends'' and
often as not discover yet another version of the same grisly or
strange story that's making the rounds in your town.

 &HT;    Past can be deceptive when gauging candidates

   AUSTIN, Texas _ The best indicator of future performance is past
performance, or so the human-resources gurus tell us. While that
may be true in most hiring situations, it ain't _ to quote Gershwin
_ necessarily so when it comes to picking a president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For Exhibit A, I submit a fellow who was derisively called ``the
senator from Pendergast.'' In his day, Harry S. Truman was
dismissed as a bourbon-swilling, poker-playing lightweight bought
and paid for by the Pendergast machine in his native Missouri. He
was picked as a running mate to the ailing Franklin D. Roosevelt in
1944 and, of course, became president the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys,'' he told reporters immediately after FDR's death, ``if
you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know whether you fellows
ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me yesterday
what had happened, I felt like the moon, the stars and all the
planets had fallen on me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was thought to be easy pickings in the 1948 elections. Most
professional pols and the newspapers gave up the plain-spoken
Truman for dead in the face of Republican challenger Thomas E.
Dewey, who had built a name for himself busting organized crime in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that the professional pols and the newspapers were
just wrong, and Truman claimed four years in his own right.
Somewhere in there, the senator from Pendergast disappeared,
replaced by a president who tackled tough decisions and damned the
political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   There would be hell to pay, he was advised, for firing Gen.
Douglas MacArthur. The dismissal of the popular _ but insubordinate
_ general touched off calls for impeachment. There could be only
one commander in chief, and it was the elected head of government.
Truman knew what he had to do and did it.
</P>
<P>
   When Truman decided to integrate the armed forces, the joint
chiefs _ and most of the country _ winced. That decision was among
the first to crack the segregationist wall that had long divided
us.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B, I submit, is Lyndon B. Johnson. As the senior senator
from Texas and as Senate majority leader, LBJ was a conservative's
conservative who never met a special interest he didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have expected that a conservative senator from a
Southern state would have been at the forefront of transforming
American society? The War on Poverty, the Civil Rights bill and the
Voting Rights Act were willed into being by a president who used
his considerable powers of persuasion and mastery of the
legislative process to make things happen. And he knew all the
while that doing these things would cost Democrats their dominance
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   This master politician did it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like Truman, LBJ was not fully appreciated in his day. Like
Truman, he became president at a time of profound national grief,
following a more glamorous figure whose popularity was magnified by
his death.
</P>
<P>
   A re-examination of the Johnson presidency, spattered by
bloodshed in Vietnam, is now under way, and LBJ's stature should
rise by any objective measure.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit C is Richard M. Nixon. Who would have expected a
politician who built a career on Red-baiting would open the
diplomatic door to China? This is the same Red baiter who
negotiated detente with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have expected a conservative Republican to foster the
concept of affirmative action? Indeed, who would have expected a
conservative Republican to impose wage and price controls to cool
an inflationary economy? His was the first administration to
recognize the importance of ecological protection to create an
agency devoted to it. The Environmental Protection Agency was a
product of the Nixon presidency.
</P>
<P>
   During the Nixon presidency, the voting age was lowered to 18,
and the first steps to eliminating the draft were taken.
</P>
<P>
   No one could or should have expected those accomplishments to
issue from a Nixon presidency. The Watergate scandal will forever
stain Nixon's memory, but his behavior as president was at times
counterintuitive.
</P>
<P>
   We are nearing the end of the first round of choosing the next
president. Naturally, there is a lot of comparison of records and
the eternal search for their portent.
</P>
<P>
   While those are worthwhile examinations, they don't deliver the
whole story nor are they accurate predictions of what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Just witness the senator from Pendergast.

 &HT;    Party politics at the precincts
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In 1996, the delegates to the Republican State
Convention snubbed Texas Gov. George W. Bush and chose instead to
have State Republican Chairman Tom Pauken lead their delegation to
the Republican National Convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Only a quick gavel on Pauken's part prevented their excluding
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison from the delegation because she's
against outlawing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was Christian conservatives months earlier had packed
the precinct conventions that are the beginning step in delegate
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Many Texans may not know it, but most of the people who actually
run the Republican and Democratic parties are chosen through that
process, which begins this year after the polls close March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's troops have made no organized effort to re-take the party
levers from the religious conservatives. It's too big a task.
Besides, says party spokesman Robert Black, it's unnecessary. At
least since Susan Weddington replaced Pauken as chairman, the party
``is completely in Bush's corner,'' Black said. And Bush has cozied
up to religious conservatives in other states in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a brief primer on how the parties choose their officials
and delegates to the presidential nominating conventions:
</P>
<P>
   First, you choose which party's process to participate in by
voting in that party's primary. You can't participate unless you've
voted.
</P>
<P>
   After the polls close at 7 p.m., the precinct conventions begin,
usually at the polling place. Delegates are selected to the next
level convention _ county conventions for counties wholly within
one state senatorial district, and senatorial district conventions
for those that are not.
</P>
<P>
   The county and senatorial district conventions, on April 1, will
select delegates to the state conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The parties' state conventions are in June _ the Democrats on
June 9-10 in Fort Worth, and the Republicans on June 15-17 in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   At the state conventions, the parties select state chairs and
other officers, representatives to their national committees and a
male and female state committee member from each senatorial
district.
</P>
<P>
   They also write party platforms and pass resolutions on a
variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the presidential selection process that the parties
differ.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   Texas has 124 delegates and 124 alternates to the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia beginning in late July. Ninety
of each are divided equally among the state's 30 congressional
districts. They are allocated according to the results in the
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Within the congressional districts, if a candidate wins a
majority, he gets three delegates and alternates. If no one gets a
majority, and two candidates receive more than 20 percent, the
leader gets two of each, and the second-place finisher gets one.
The delegates are selected in state convention caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   There are 34 at-large delegates and alternates. If a candidate
wins a majority statewide March 14, he gets them all. If no one
gets a majority but two get more than 20 percent, the leader gets
two-thirds of the delegates and alternates, and the second-place
finisher gets one-third. In this case, the leader gets 23 and the
runner-up 11.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Texas has 231 delegates and 32 alternates to the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles in mid-August. The Democrats'
system is a complicated hybrid aimed at reflecting the popular vote
but also encouraging precinct participation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sign in at their precinct conventions according to
their presidential preference or as uncommitted. Delegates selected
there also sign in by presidential preference at the county or
senatorial district conventions, and again at the state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Of the total, 127 delegates and 21 alternates are allocated
among the state senatorial districts based on Democratic turnout
for president and governor in the last two elections. The actual
delegates are awarded based on the March 14 vote. They will be
chosen in senatorial district caucuses at the state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remainder, the state convention will select 42 at-large
delegates and six alternates pledged to particular presidential
candidates. There also are 37 unpledged delegates, including the 15
Democratic National Committee members and Texas' 17 Democratic
congressmen, plus 25 pledged delegates and five alternates, who
will probably include some mayors and other Democratic bigwigs.

 &HT;    Woe to fiery McCain: popular vote isn't 'til fall; now it's all
party
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Republican campaign of 2000 stirs echoes of
the Democratic race of 1968. Parallels are strained by changes in
the process, but semblance remains.
</P>
<P>
   In '68, anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy electrified the
country with a popular movement that stunned the establishment.
People still talk about it _ how McCarthy rose from the
grass-roots, how Lyndon Johnson read the winds and decided not to
run, how Bobby Kennedy seized on McCarthy's theme before being
gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy. Kennedy. It's almost an afterthought: When all was
said and done, Vice President Hubert Humphrey took the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, no one should have been surprised, just as they
shouldn't be surprised about the now-clear outcome of this year's
GOP race. The machine willed it.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone was talking of John McCain, while his poll
numbers commonly showed broad-based national popularity, the Bush
campaign had the machine _ governors (including Arizona's),
congressmen, party chieftains, the evangelical right.
</P>
<P>
   The money _ that too. That money, which at first made things
look too easy for Bush, almost made his campaign too difficult,
scaring off contenders who might have split McCain's
anti-establishment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievably, their funds compromised by hand-to-hand battle
with McCain, Bush's people were talking this week of the need for
$10 million in quick cash. This is like Dennis Rodman saying he
needs another nose stud.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters need no reminding, but they were hoping
against a brutal reality: This isn't a popular election. That's in
November. This is a partisan election.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels with 1968? Back then, not every state had a primary,
and many primaries were nonbinding. Vice President Humphrey, who
didn't announce his candidacy until April, decided not to enter the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he worked his weight with party delegations while the
other hopefuls slogged it out.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, results like this: McCarthy won the nonbinding
Pennsylvania primary by a tremendous margin, yet after Humphrey
romanced the Democratic Party regulars at the state convention, he
had the support of two thirds of the delegates. The popular vote be
damned. It became known as the ``Pennsylvania railroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the present: In the state of Washington on Feb. 29, Bush
claimed what, aside from his South Carolina ``firewall'' victory,
may have been his most crucial win. Among registered Republicans,
he won by 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But in the popular vote _ the nonbinding, open ``beauty
contest'' _ the state was still counting absentee ballots Wednesday
(they could be postmarked on election day), and McCain had closed
within only 3,577 votes, with more to count. Indeed, McCain still
has a chance of winning that vote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Humphrey disdained the primaries and played the back
room to his ultimate benefit. Bush has played the back room like
few candidates since. He had to sweat out primaries, yes. But
because of his early backing and strong party identity, he will
sweat no more for the nomination. The rest of the proceedings,
including Texas' vote next Tuesday, are formalities.
</P>
<P>
   In '68 Humphrey said, ``The nomination will not be decided by
the primaries, even though the primaries will be important
psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. He won his nomination far from the rabble and the
snow-covered streets. It wasn't so easy for Bush, who had to get
his boots wet, but W.'s anointment by the Republican machine has
worked to make a whole lot of primaries irrelevant, just as it did
in 1968.

 &HT;    Florida teen confidently counsels 'CosmoGirls'
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Michael, we need to talk.
</P>
<P>
   About your stint as an advice columnist in this month's
CosmoGirl! magazine.
</P>
<P>
   About the pitfalls of writing for teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   About why guys would rather go on a date with Helen Gurley Brown
than talk about their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may find this hard to believe,'' Michael Rodan, a Jupiter
18-year-old, writes on page 36 of CosmoGirl!, which calls itself
``the cool new magazine for teens,'' ``but most guys are pretty
straightforward _ so there's no need to look for hidden meaning
behind everything we say or do.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped readers from logging onto www.cosmogirl.com
to tell Michael what for. ``You sucky suck suck,'' wrote one
teed-off teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I got negative responses because I said, `You need
to leave guys alone.' They did a little male-bashing,'' he says.
``But about a third agreed that you need to have fun while you're
young and enjoy relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Benjamin School senior also fielded some online offers of
dates, or at least gushy e-mails, ``but everyone at school knows
that I'm taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael met Alyssa, his girlfriend of eight months, last summer
at Northwestern University's National High School Institute, where
he was studying journalism. That's also where he made the contacts
that led to the CosmoGirl! gig. A magazine editor who talked to the
students in class later e-mailed all the guys asking if they'd like
to write for CosmoGirl!.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I'd never heard of CosmoGirl!,'' Michael says. (The
magazine has just begun its second year of publication.)
</P>
<P>
   But he was familiar with CosmoGirl!'s older, sassier sister,
Cosmopolitan. ``The name `Cosmo' is overwhelming. I thought, `Oh my
God, they want me to write for them?'''
</P>
<P>
   He submitted a few story ideas and some embarrassing moments for
the monthly ``Ouch!'' column (''humiliating stories that will make
your hair curl!'') that weren't mortifying enough for publication.
But the editors agreed that his ``We need to talk'' topic had legs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael writes: ``A guy who really cares will want to know if
there's anything he can do to make things better. Just pick things
that are truly important to you. And if there are so many problems
between you and your guy that you feel the need to keep having
these `discussions,' then maybe you should stop talking to him
altogether and find someone new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was actually a tough one to tackle,'' says Michael. ``I
feel that I have beyond-novice experience with women. ... And it's
a teeny-bopper magazine, so I can write about this without getting
too deep.''
</P>
<P>
   He's learned one lesson about communicating with women, or at
least teen-age girls: Don't be so brutally honest.
</P>
<P>
   If he had the article to write again, ``I would definitely play
to what they want to hear a little bit more, instead of saying what
I truly felt,'' says Michael, who will attend Vanderbilt
University. ``Guys do want to talk about the relationship, not
every single day, but just to make sure everything's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   HE'S GOT LOWDOWN ON HANDLING 'HOTS'
</P>
<P>
   Now that 18-year-old Michael Rodan is a published advice
columnist, we thought we'd ask the CosmoGirl! writer for his
thoughts on these time-tested riddles of the teen-age heart.
</P>
<P>
   I have the hots for this guy in my math class. How can I tell if
he likes me?
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll hang around you more often. He'll start looking at you
in class. He'll definitely start cracking jokes with you.''
</P>
<P>
   And watch for the tell-tale emissary. ``He'll send a friend to
talk with you to see if you like him. He'll do one of those
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do I get the feeling that all my boyfriend ever thinks about
is sex?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that's all he's thinking about. Just kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to this: Many teen-age guys are more comfortable
with their bodies than their emotions, and would rather take action
than sit around talking about feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood hits him, and he has to do something,'' Michael says.
``Instead of playing out a romantic scene, it turns to sex.''
</P>
<P>
   I just got dumped by my guy. He says he wants to ``just be
friends.'' What would you advise?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooohhf. All guys do that as a safety, even girls do it too,
to keep the waters clear so when you see each other in the hallway
or at the mall, you don't have that animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three weeks to a month and a half, things will fade away.
It's kind of a buffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you truly want a friendship with your ex, you might as
well give it a try, Michael says. ``Some can do that, and some
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   I met this guy at a party last week. He took my number and said
he'd call, but I still haven't heard from him. Why do guys say
they'll call and then they don't?
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys typically say that because girls want to hear that type
of commitment. But guys can become easily sidetracked. We'll
finally find (the number) under a pile of clothes two weeks later,
and we'll be too embarrassed to call back then.''

 &HT;    Former employee turns out agreeable book about his New Yorker
days
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Tina Brown became editor of the New
Yorker in the summer of 1992, one of her first hires was Alexander
Chancellor. His stated mission was to edit the Talk of the Town
section, the short ``casuals'' in the front of the book whose
desired effect Brendan Gill once likened to a cloud of blue
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor was an old Fleet Street cohort of Brown's. He agreed
to a one-year contract and told Brown he wanted to write a book
about his experiences in America. She was agreeable, as is the
resulting book.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, in common with many of his countrymen, likes America
but seems rather frightened of it, as if at any moment the Indians
will sweep over the settlement walls and start scalping.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of those urbane, vaguely Tory, seen-it-all Brits who
doesn't get riled about anything; a raised eyebrow constitutes a
shattering comment.
</P>
<P>
   The eyebrow gets a workout, because Chancellor had a rocky
trial. Part of the problem was that he had rarely read the New
Yorker, so didn't have a real sense of its peculiar rhythms. He
gives the distinct impression that Brown was as glad as he that he
chose to go back home after his year.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor doesn't come right out and say that so-and-so is a
dreadfully overrated hack. Instead, he lists their vitae in a way
calculated to render them absurd, as in, ``Ms. Angelou was black.
She had been raped by her mother's boyfriend when she was eight
years old and struck dumb for five years as a result. After giving
birth to a son at sixteen, she had started out on a varied career
as a nightclub singer, dancer, actress and writer. She had
published several volumes of autobiography and several of verse ...
If these were not qualifications enough to be chosen as the
presidential troubador, there was the clinching fact that Maya
Angelou had spent much of her childhood in the care of her
grandmother in the town of Stamps in Arkansas, Bill Clinton's home
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Condescension has its limited uses, but it bespeaks an
unwillingness to really engage with the people or literary material
at hand. Still, Chancellor has a knack for the journalistic quick
cut: William F. Buckley's house in the East 70s ``was furnished
with all the heavy opulence of an Edwardian brothel.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has a very interesting take on Brendan Gill, the longtime
New Yorker writer who, despite his personal joie de vivre, tended
to subtly cut everybody down to his own size when writing about
them, even if they were actually much bigger than he.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor's take on Tina Brown is not at all condemnatory and
rather affectionate. A bit of a diva, but also vulnerable, Brown
never felt secure in her job, always worried that Si Newhouse would
bounce her.
</P>
<P>
   Compulsive, forever in search of the hot, new thing _ a trait
that deformed the magazine _ abhorring anything she termed ``wet,''
Brown regularly tore up the Talk of the Town just before presstime,
leaving a desperate Chancellor scrambling for substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor hated this weekly emotional hazing but didn't say
anything about it. That was left to Hendrik Hertzberg, who told
Chancellor that Brown had given him responsibility without
authority and that he was going to speak to her about it.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Brown announced that she had given him
responsibility without authority and would stop it forthwith. ``She
was, in other words, insensitive, but not at all uncaring.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor noticed that Brown didn't really seem to like America
at all, leading a friend to say, of course not, she'd never been
there, i.e. anyplace outside a limousine in New York or Los Angeles
_ a point well taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Times in America'' is entertaining, and, I think,
accurate, especially about the sundry differences between American
and English journalists: ``She liked to turn them into celebrities
and feed their vanities with extravagant compliments and bouquets
of flowers. At the same time she would grumble privately about
their big-headedness and dwell upon the virtues of the flexible
British journalist who would quickly and competently turn his hand
to anything in return for no more than a modest fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``British journalists are not permitted to give themselves airs.
They are too numerous, too dispensable, and too despised ...
American journalists, are, on the whole more diligent,
conscientious and high-minded, as befits their exalted concept of
their constitutional role, but they consequently lack the cheerful
solidarity and subversive urges of their colleagues across the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is in the self-deprecating manner of one of
Alistair Cooke's ``Letters from America,'' but Chancellor's voice
lacks Cooke's urbanity; he's unpretentious and ``matey'' but
doesn't have the authoritative tone that might have made for a
stronger book.
</P>

 &HT;    Visually stunning `Mission' a space odyssey fit for 2001
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It is almost 2001, so perhaps it is time
for a new ``Space Odyssey.'' Director Brian De Palma, who built a
career on homages to Alfred Hitchcock, has shifted toborrowing from
Stanley Kubrick. But just because his foray into science fiction,
``Mission to Mars,'' lacks originality does not mean it is without
merit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, see if this sounds familiar: A team of astronauts embarks
on a lengthy space voyage, runs into mechanical difficulties that
require exterior repairs, aided by the voice of the ship's
omniscient computer.
</P>
<P>
   The space jockeys reach their destination and make discoveries
that imply the existence of a higher intelligence that inspired
life on Earth. They solve a puzzle posed by the otherworldly
beings, and then one of the astronauts opts for a rebirth that will
presumably begin the life cycle again. Details vary, but in its
overall story arc, the resemblance of ``Mission to Mars to 2001: A
Space Odyssey'' is unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, ``Mission'' is stunning. The depiction of
weightlessness, whether dancing bodies, floating blood pellets or
helixes of M&AMP;Ms, is as convincing as ever captured on film. The
rocky terrain of Mars _ as played by the outskirts of Vancouver,
British Columbia _ is both beautiful and forbidding. And when the
land suddenly becomes animate and transforms itself into a
mysterious facial totem, the effect is truly awesome.
</P>
<P>
   If only there weren't so much cliched dialogue and so many
bone-headed actions by these highly trained, best-and-brightest
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay by Jim Thomas, John Thomas and Graham Yost leans
to fevered exchanges like: ``Jim, are you sure you want to do
this?'' ``I'm not sure about anything anymore.'' When the
Mars-bound, rescue-mission spaceship springs a couple of air leaks
and begins losing cabin pressure, heroic, brooding Jim McConnell
(Gary Sinise) doesn't bother to put on his helmet. This presumably
is for dramatic effect, so that he can almost expire from lack of
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   When Woody Blake (Tim Robbins) becomes adrift in space _ as
someone always does in these movies _ and his crew member wife,
Terri (Connie Nielsen), goes to save him, you can bet that common
sense will give way to emotions. And just in case you do not know
how to react, there is Ennio Morricone's heavy-handed and celestial
music score to guide the way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these wince points, there is an intelligence at work
in ``Mission to Mars,'' and not just from the Martians. Like
``2001,'' the time spent aboard ship is steeped in the mission
minutia and hardware of science fact, all the better to persuade us
of what the team finds on Mars. And who would not want to believe
that there is intelligent life out there, willing to make contact,
to connect with mere humans and share the secrets of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   As in most space flicks, the muted acting takes a backseat to
the special effects. This is the inevitable consequence of
performing while encased in a thermal suit and space helmet. The
``Mars'' cast does well enough in a low-key way, even when they
have an extraterrestrial encounter.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the first of this year's interplanetary movies to
land, with ``Red Planet,'' ``Titan A.E.'' and ``Battlefield Earth''
still to come. Those with no interest in what could be lurking
beyond our world may be excused from attendance. Those who are
drawn to the ride, and do not mind an experience more geared to
wonder than terror, will find it in ``Mission to Mars.'' Plus, the
movie should do great things for M&AMP;M sales.

 &HT;    Rich prose style, good intentions, but a drab memoir
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mary Gordon has created the print
version of a well-crafted still-life painting _ rich in detail,
clever in structure, keen in some of its insights.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it's still like staring at a bowl of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed author and professor's life is too boring to
justify a memoir. Even she was bored through much of her childhood,
and observations to that effect take up much of the book.
</P>
<P>
   To tie something as random as the human experience into a
narrative, Gordon uses geography and sense of place as her central
theme. Hence the title, ``Seeing Through Places: Reflections on
Geography and Identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The device is especially relevant here; she lived many years in
her grandmother's unwelcoming home, rarely feeling like more than a
guest. Self-doubt, fused with a strong sense of Catholic guilt,
seems impossible to overcome. And becoming a woman, creating an
authorial voice, becomes Gordon's eventual triumph, though she
retains the guilt and self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   That voice is the book's strongest quality. Gordon's declarative
sentences flow candidly as she describes her mother's alcoholism,
her father's lack of career and her extended family's tendency to
squabble. Few adults show her any warmth or acknowledge her
emotional needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weekends were devoted to helping clean the house. There was
no joy in it; it was a grim battle against dirt and disorder,'' she
writes. ``No modern products were employed. Ammonia burnt my eyes
and hands, Bon Ami cleanser, shaken from the gold can with the
chicken only half out of its egg, got under my nails.''
</P>
<P>
   The detail helps re-create the scene in full sensual stereo,
even if it's only elevator music.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon takes these detailed youthful observations, then dissects
them with adult wisdom. When her grandmother collapses, it's the
neighbor who brings her to the hospital. ``Everyone pretended to be
grateful to her, but it was a family that made no real place _
though they were capable of simulating a false one, or perhaps an
anteroom, a vestibule _ for strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Honest moments such as these show Gordon's best and worst. In
concept, the idea of a memoir by a thoughtful, relatively ordinary
person makes sense _ consider all the lame material from jurors and
dietitians to the stars or the self-important, uncritical histories
of famous men.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the good intentions just do not command enough
interest. The mother-daughter relationships, the observations of
the priests who would often visit Gordon and the worry over whether
she deserves a house in Cape Cod don't stimulate. And they aren't
particularly revealing of anything global.
</P>
<P>
   I'm leaving the door open to the possibility that Gordon's
fellow middle-aged, Catholic, New York intellectuals identify with
her and will find this book particularly revealing or interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I'm holding out that possibility, but I'm not rereading the
book.

 &HT;    Cart Wars still at the forefront on PGA Tour
 &HT;    By Alan Tays
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. _ Two golfers. Two disabilities. Two courts.
Two rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all together, and it comes out to one puzzling scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin walked into the interview room at the Tournament
Players Club at Heron Bay on Wednesday and said he was ``looking
forward to now just playing golf and hopefully letting this
gradually die down.'' It was his first public comment since the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court in San Francisco on Monday refused to overturn a
lower court's decision allowing him to use a golf cart on the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, meanwhile, club pro Ford Olinger lost his appeal to
use a cart in local qualifying for the U.S. Open. The 7th U.S.
Circuit Court upheld a lower court's ruling that allowing Olinger
to use a cart would change the nature of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has a circulatory disorder in his right leg. Olinger has
a degenerative hip disorder. Both sued in 1998 for the right to use
a golf cart in competition, a practice ordinarily banned by both
the PGA Tour and the United States Golf Association, which runs the
U.S. Open. Each cited the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in
support of his case.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Martin can continue to play the PGA Tour, including
this week's Honda Classic. But if Olinger wants to try to qualify
for this year's Open, he'll have to walk, as he did in 1999, when
he shot an 88 and failed to advance to sectional qualifying. He
rode a cart in 1998 Open qualifying after obtaining a temporary
restraining order against the USGA, but shot an 83 and failed to
advance. After Martin won his initial court victory in 1998, the
USGA allowed him to ride a cart in Open qualifying that year and
the next, saying it would honor the court ruling even though it
applied specifically only to the PGA Tour. Martin says he will try
to qualify for the Open again this year and hopes to be able to
ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they won't challenge it,'' Martin said. ``(But) I bet
they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would the USGA fight Olinger in court, yet allow Martin to
ride?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a great question,'' Martin said. Olinger could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   In Far Hills, N.J., the USGA declined comment until it has had
time to review the Olinger ruling. The PGA Tour similarly declined
to comment on the Martin case until after next week's meeting of
its Policy Board in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he was driving to a speaking engagement Monday
afternoon when he heard the news. He had just completed his flight
from Eugene, Ore., to Orlando. Few people had the number of his
tour-issued cell phone, so he was surprised when he had several
messages. One was from his father, telling him he had won the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said fellow players have been mostly supportive, as have
fans. ``I haven't heard one thing negative from the gallery,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has played in five events this year, making three cuts
and earning $51,015, almost $38,000 of it from his best finish, a
tie for 17th at Tucson. His year has been an adventure so far. In
the Bob Hope tournament, he was paired with Tour Policy Board
chairman Dick Ferris, who while testifying against Martin in 1998
made the infamous declaration that carts are allowed on the Senior
Tour because it is more about nostalgia than competition. In Los
Angeles, he accidentally stepped in a sprinkler hole. ``It was
absolutely the worst day of my life physically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to play about 25 events this year, a number he should
have no trouble achieving because as an exempt tour member, he is
eligible to accept an unlimited number of sponsor's exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take exemptions two years ago when I first got this
(court victory) because I hadn't made it out here yet,'' he said.
``I didn't want to take advantage of the situation. Now that I have
made it, I've felt free to take exemptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin typically drives his cart from tee to green. ``A lot of
times there will be a guy going around with me and I will park it
somewhere near the green and then he takes it around the back to
the next tee box or wherever is appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the deterioration in his right tibia has slowed
since he has been allowed to ride. ``I got some X-rays a couple of
months ago and it hasn't deteriorated any more than it was a couple
of years ago,'' he said. ``Probably because I am riding.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the PGA Tour declined comment, its former general
counsel characterized the Olinger and Martin rulings this way:
``One (Olinger) is well reasoned, the other (Martin) is not,'' said
attorney Gary Crist of Jupiter. ``On the one hand, you have
activist judges interpreting the statute as saying there should be
some form of social engineering. On the other, you have
conservative judges, strict constructionists, if you will,
believing that the governance of golf should be left to the
governing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step _ if there is one _ in both cases is for the
losing side to appeal to the Supreme Court. There is no guarantee
the court would agree to hear such an appeal, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Olinger appeals his case,'' Crist said, ``that could remove
from the PGA Tour the obligation to appeal the Martin case.'' A
Supreme Court ruling in one case, however, would not be binding in
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Martin believes the tour will appeal to the Supreme Court.
Understandably, he hopes the court refuses to hear an appeal.
``Honestly,'' he said, ``driving a cart in golf _ surely there are
more important things that they would hear.''

 &HT;    Childhood friend of Anne Frank shares memories
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Writing in her diary as she hid in the
attic of her Amsterdam home, Anne Frank lamented that Hannah Pick,
her good friend and neighbor, was no doubt already dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna always wanted to be very, very famous,'' Hannah
Pick-Goslar recalled Wednesday night for about 100 students and
parents at the Meyer Jewish Academy in suburban West Palm Beach.
She lives in Israel and is visiting the area as a guest of the
Anti-Defamation League of the Palm Beach region.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a folding chair, sipping from a cup of water and
speaking in a gentle, matter-of-fact voice, Pick-Goslar, 73,
recalled Anne Frank and her own Holocaust experience.
</P>
<P>
   She told of how they met in a grocery store, shortly after the
Pick family arrived in Holland from England, and of how they did
their homework together on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   After the Nazis invaded Holland, Anne and her family
disappeared, and Pick-Goslar was told they had fled to Switzerland.
Only when she herself was a prisoner in the Bergen-Belsen camp did
Pick-Goslar learn the Franks had been in hiding, the Swiss story
only a lie to divert the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   She and Anne called to each other across a camp fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am nobody anymore,'' she remembered Anne saying to her in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was not the same Anne I had known,'' she said. ``It was
a broken little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, 1945, Pick-Goslar was freed. By then, her friend
had died of typhus, but the diary survived to make Anne Frank the
most famous of the Holocaust's millions of victims.

Red Planet. But yikes! When they get there, three of four crew
members are wiped out by a huge whirlwind worm. In comes the rescue

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Serious novelists like to say that fiction is a
moral concern, and perhaps it is. But right and wrong exist on one
plane, and good and evil on another. It is easier to take measure
of the forgivable than of the ineradicable. Evil, if you believe it
exists, is somehow beyond human reach and yet it is all around us,
resistant to all purgatives. For Graham Greene, it was in the
nature of things that there be no grace without evil, the renewal
of the one reinforcing the presence of the other. Try as we might,
we can never rid ourselves of ourselves. Those who have seen the
artistically exquisite movie version of Greene's novel ``The End of
the Affair'' understand this better than they could have before _
understand, in particular, how deeply he penetrated the psychology
of desire and obligation, betrayal and guilt. (Skube, Atlanta

 &HT;    PEN awards are mightier (and more numerous)
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The PEN American Awards have announced
two new major literary awards. The PEN/Nabokov Award for $20,000
will honor writers of ``enduring originality and consummate
craftsmanship.'' In other words, James Patterson need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   The PEN/Architectural Digest Award for $10,000 will be for
Literary Writing on the Visual Arts. Both awards will be announced
in April and will join the 16 awards administered by the PEN
American Center for excellence in writing and letters.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO ...
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln is undoubtedly the most venerated American
president, and Frank Thompson adds yet another volume to the
lengthy bibliography. ``Abraham Lincoln: Twentieth Century Popular
Portrayals'' (Taylor, $26.95) surveys Lincoln as reflected through
the acting prism of Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey, Walter Huston and
Sam Waterston, among others. Thompson covers not only film and
television but also theater. All in all, bountifully researched and
well-written, with a filmography that extends to 100 pages and many
fascinating stills.
</P>
<P>
   REST IN PEACE ...
</P>
<P>
   Norton has published ``Saving Grace,'' a collection of
photographs of female sculptures found in cemeteries (and people
think modern publishing is too monolithic ...).
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson's black-and-white photos are nice, but the forms
depicted are often truly beautiful, if bereft grieving is your
thing. All the sculptures are to be found in European cemeteries
such as Pere Lachaise in Paris, Highgate in London and Monumentale
in Milan. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a typically lofty
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS CREEK ...
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida Press has had a tidy little success
with its excellent ``Max &AMP; Marjorie,'' a collection of the letters
between Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and Max Perkins, her editor at
Scribner's.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher solicited blurbs from people such as Michael Korda
and had the book chosen for special attention by Barnes &AMP; Noble.
Its 4,000-copy first printing was quickly exhausted and the second
printing is now in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting statistic: University presses publish 17 percent
of all books printed in the U.S. but account for under 2 percent of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of brilliant segues, Barnesandnoble.com has announced
it will no longer sell ``Mein Kampf'' to customers in Germany,
where Nazi literature is against the law. Amazon has also stopped
selling the book to German customers.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of Barnes &AMP; Noble is owned by the German firm
Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE ...

one in all the great bestsellers.'' _V.S. Pritchett

 &HT;    PREGNANCY HAS CHERIE BLAIR'S IMAGE AS 'SUPERWOMAN,' 'WORKING
MOTHER' POSITIVELY GLOWING
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 11 And Thereafter.

<P>
   LONDON _ Before her death, it was Princess Diana who beguiled
the nation, indeed the world.
</P>
<P>
   But now another British woman is moving precariously close to
filling the much-beloved princess' shoes: Cherie Blair, wife of
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs' domestic life has long appealed to the public. The
world was captivated, for example, by photographs of a scruffy
Cherie Blair bringing in the milk in her wrinkled nightshirt the
morning after her husband's election. But interest in the pair
soared to new heights last November when it was announced that
Cherie Blair, aged 45, was pregnant with
</P>
<P>
   her fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Blair baby has become the most talked about
pregnancy since those of Princess Di.
</P>
<P>
   It also has many celebrities here enthusiastically reciting the
virtues of late motherhood in the British press. Iman, the
44-year-old model wife of singer David Bowie, himself age 53,
recently gushed that she is to be a mother again.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Princess Di, though, Cherie Blair finds herself cast not
as an archetype of a charitable, yet jet-setting, young beauty, but
that of an older mother struggling to juggle career and family
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Already well-known around the world as a working mother, many
women are able to identify with Cherie Blair as she embarks on
another round of breastfeeding and sleepless nights, while still
working towards her long-time goal of becoming a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pregnancy is going to bring a new challenge,'' Maggie Rea,
an attorney and family friend, told The Daily Telegraph. ``But I am
sure she will handle it fantastically well. She is very fit and
well, and has already proved she can cope with motherhood, a
career, and supporting her husband too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair seems to have fared better than her friend, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who has often expressed regret in public over
having had only one child.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs already have three children: Euan, 15, Nicholas, 14,
and Kathryn, 11.
</P>
<P>
   But the expected birth in May of the first child in 150 years
fathered by a sitting British prime minister is sure to drastically
change the public and private lives of Britain's first couple.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the New Labour Party machine is not unaware of the
kick it will give Tony Blair's ``family man'' image with a general
election still more than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, whose own actor father, Tony Booth, abandoned the
family for another woman when she was 21 months old, is likely to
become even more protective of her own family. Already Cherie
Blair, who does not give press interviews, goes to great lengths to
shield them from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Blairs seem to have adopted an almost royal-like
attitude to being left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week Tony Blair vowed to do ``whatever it takes'' to
protect the privacy of his family and prevent intrusion into the
lives of his children.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge came just after the family's lawyers sought _ and
were granted _ an injunction preventing The Mail on Sunday(CQ)
newspaper from publishing material based on a book about the family
by Ros Mark, 30, who worked as the Blairs' nanny from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherie and I are absolutely determined, no matter how unusual
our own lives may be because of the nature of my job, that our
children have as normal an upbringing as possible,'' Tony Blair
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, interest in the Blairs and their soon-to-be-expanded
brood is not likely to wane any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair has come to epitomize the successful woman of the
21st Century with her seemingly tranquil home life, glamorous
social life, and esteemed career as a barrister focusing on
employment law.
</P>
<P>
   Only last June she was made a recorder _ a junior part-time
judge. Within three years she could be eligible for a full-time
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``She certainly seems to have it all, and she's become a
powerful role model for little girls across the country,'' said Sue
Holmes, a secretary and mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   Like Princess Di, Cherie Blair receives hundreds of letters a
week. At the same time, she promotes the Malcolm Sargent Cancer
Care for Children, one of the princess' favorite charities.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the princess, Cherie Blair's wardrobe is heavily
scrutinized. Over the past year many pundits here have referred to
her as ``an excellent ambassador for British fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, experience has taught her to look her best.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, attention was distracted from the purpose of her
husband's visit to South Africa when the press criticized her on
the front pages as looking ``dowdy'' in a green floral dress.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the princess, though, Cherie Blair seems to have trained
her husband well. Tony Blair calls himself a ``nappy-changing new
man'' who doesn't mind staying up at night with a new baby. A
government spokesman said he will take paternity leave when his
fourth child is born _ though it will likely be less than the
maximum three months unpaid leave now allowed under government
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known how long Cherie Blair will take off, although _
in typical superwoman fashion _ she was back at work within two
days after the birth of her youngest, Kathryn.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The view from Buddy MacKay's office is of the White
House. Behind his desk is a map stretching from the southern United
States to the tip of South America.
</P>
<P>
   This is Kenneth H. ``Buddy'' MacKay's world. For the past year,
the former Florida governor has been President Clinton's special
envoy to the Americas _ a territory covering the entire Western
Hemisphere, including Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The job has taken MacKay, 66, to an average of two countries a
month _ listening to their leaders and communicating their problems
on at least a weekly basis to the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, communications break down.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time MacKay participated in a news conference in Chile
speaking through an interpreter. The first question was
particularly tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa! That one was high and inside,'' MacKay quipped, hoping
to get a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone stopped and got very quiet,'' MacKay recalled. ``The
Chilean interpreter didn't have any idea what I was saying. I said,
'That's baseball.' He didn't have any idea what baseball was.''
</P>
<P>
   With the news conference rapidly disintegrating, MacKay tried
explaining the sport. Someone suggested he use a soccer analogy.
MacKay didn't know one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a good lesson that day,'' he said. ``Our culture
really is different. Some things we take for granted, they don't
have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although MacKay is trying to learn Spanish, he described his
linguistic ability as ``rough and slow.'' Even so, he said the
people he deals with appreciate his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to judge my success in this office by how well
I speak Spanish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising aspects of the past year, MacKay
said, is the lack of interest and information about the importance
of Latin America among U.S. business and government leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to try to get this country, and our government, to
face north and south for our future instead of east and west.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, much of his time has been spent lobbying Congress to
approve a $1 billion military aid package to Colombia and to pass a
trade bill expanding the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI).
</P>
<P>
   It's a return of sorts. MacKay spent six years in the House of
Representatives where, among other posts, he served on the Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia aid is necessary, MacKay said to counter the
alliance of guerrilla groups with the powerful drug cartels and
organized crime that threatens to plunge one of South America's
oldest democracies into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said Miami has already experienced an influx of business
and government leaders from Colombia, fleeing the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Colombia destabilizes, we will get not only the leadership,
but a large number of immigrants, and that is tough on our
economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging he's concerned about a recent Human Rights Watch
report linking the Colombian military to right-wing paramilitary
groups, MacKay said many of the cases in the report may be related
to prior Colombian regimes and may not reflect the current
political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   His other legislative priority, the CBI expansion bill, is
important to the United States because the Caribbean countries have
become such a large trading partner, MacKay said. Since the
original CBI was passed in the 1980s, U.S. trade with the region
has increased six-fold, becoming the United States' sixth-largest
trading partner and exceeding our combined exports to Russia, China
and India.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay's biggest long-range effort is to lay the foundation for
a hemispheric Free Trade Area for the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the FTAA was first endorsed at the 1994 Summit of
the Americas in Miami which MacKay _ then Florida's lieutenant
governor _ played a major role in organizing. Under FTAA, tariff
rates across the entire hemisphere (except Cuba) would be lowered
and eventually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay also is working hard to have a U.S. city _ Miami and New
Orleans are top contenders _ picked as the permanent secretariat
for the Americas, a role similar to that of Brussels for the
European Union. Other major candidates include Mexico City and
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay foresees a future in which the United States, despite the
overwhelming size of its economy, plays a major, but not dominant,
role in a hemispheric community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a community of the Americas much like the
European community. It's more than just trade agreements; it's far
more than that,'' he said. ``I see our role as more of a
partnership and less of being the bully on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the administration job meant leaving Florida for awhile.
MacKay and his wife, Anne, live on the same floor of a building in
downtown Washington as another Floridian, Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, MacKay _ who was the Florida Clinton-Gore
chairman in 1992 and 1996 _ said he hasn't seriously looked past
the November election. If Vice President Gore is elected and asks
him to serve in the next administration, MacKay said he's
available.

approve a $1 billion military aid package to Colombia and to pass a
trade bill expanding the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI).
</P>
<P>
   It's a return of sorts. MacKay spent six years in the House of
Representatives where, among other posts, he served on the Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia aid is necessary, MacKay said to counter the
alliance of guerrilla groups with the powerful drug cartels and
organized crime that threatens to plunge one of South America's
oldest democracies into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said Miami has already experienced an influx of business
and government leaders from Colombia, fleeing the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Colombia destabilizes, we will get not only the leadership,
but a large number of immigrants, and that is tough on our
economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging he's concerned about a recent Human Rights Watch
report linking the Colombian military to right-wing paramilitary
groups, MacKay said many of the cases in the report may be related
to prior Colombian regimes and may not reflect the current
political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
   His other legislative priority, the CBI expansion bill, is
important to the United States because the Caribbean countries have
become such a large trading partner, MacKay said. Since the
original CBI was passed in the 1980s, U.S. trade with the region
has increased six-fold, becoming the United States' sixth-largest
trading partner and exceeding our combined exports to Russia, China
and India.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay's biggest long-range effort is to lay the foundation for
a hemispheric Free Trade Area for the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the FTAA was first endorsed at the 1994 Summit of
the Americas in Miami which MacKay _ then Florida's lieutenant
governor _ played a major role in organizing. Under FTAA, tariff
rates across the entire hemisphere (except Cuba) would be lowered
and eventually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay also is working hard to have a U.S. city _ Miami and New
Orleans are top contenders _ picked as the permanent secretariat
for the Americas, a role similar to that of Brussels for the
European Union. Other major candidates include Mexico City and
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay foresees a future in which the United States, despite the
overwhelming size of its economy, plays a major, but not dominant,
role in a hemispheric community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a community of the Americas much like the
European community. It's more than just trade agreements; it's far
more than that,'' he said. ``I see our role as more of a
partnership and less of being the bully on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the administration job meant leaving Florida for awhile.
MacKay and his wife, Anne, live on the same floor of a building in
downtown Washington as another Floridian, Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, MacKay _ who was the Florida Clinton-Gore
chairman in 1992 and 1996 _ said he hasn't seriously looked past
the November election. If Vice President Gore is elected and asks
him to serve in the next administration, MacKay said he's
available.

<P>
   If you doubt that Al Sharpton's image has softened, listen to
John McCain: ``Neither party should be defined by pandering to the
outer reaches of American politics, and the agents of intolerance,
whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left, or Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone else, this would be a devastating insult. For
Sharpton, it's progress. He used to be lumped with David Duke and
decried as a preacher of hate. Now he has been promoted to
Robertson's level and deplored merely as an ``agent of
intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is reveling in the role of New York's Democratic
kingmaker. Hillary Clinton and Bill Bradley journeyed to his Harlem
headquarters to kiss his ring, and Al Gore met with him privately.
(``Hillary Clinton and Al Gore both have to come up here and see
me. What does that tell you?'' Sharpton gloated recently.)
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Soundbite organized the Democratic presidential debate
at the Apollo Theater and was given the honor of asking the first
question. He led the marches and rallies that followed the recent
acquittal of the cops who shot Amadou Diallo, and his call for
nonviolence ``Let us not throw one brick'' got him anointed
``peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine calls Sharpton's Diallo activism ``his finest
hour.'' This compliment may not be as effusive as it sounds, given
that so many of Sharpton's other hours have been spent inciting
violence, shouting slurs and defaming innocents.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation of Sharpton may seem like a new story, but
it's not. This is not Sharpton's second act. It's his fifth. Every
couple of years the media discover the New Al Sharpton usually in a
story headlined ``The New Al Sharpton'' and every couple of years
Sharpton tarnishes that polish.
</P>
<P>
   A boy preacher and teen civil rights activist, Sharpton emerged
as the voice of New York City's black poor in 1986. After a black
man died fleeing a white mob in Howard Beach, Sharpton marshaled
the protests that prompted the appointment of a special prosecutor.
He squandered what goodwill he'd earned with white New York a year
later when he thrust himself forward as spokesman for Tawana
Brawley, the black teen who claimed to have been abducted and raped
by five white men. Sharpton labeled a suburban prosecutor named
Stephen Pagones as a culprit and dared Pagones to sue. Even after a
grand jury concluded that Brawley fabricated her story, Sharpton
refused to renounce his vile accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Al Charlatan disgraced himself again. A car carrying
Hasidic Jews struck and killed a black child in Crown Heights.
Sharpton fanned the riots that followed the boy's death by railing
against ``diamond merchants'' at his funeral. His signature chant
was (and is) ``No justice, no peace.'' (Sharpton, of course, was
the model for the race-baiting Rev. Bacon in ``Bonfire of the
Vanities.'')
</P>
<P>
   The preacher's first rehab occurred in 1992, when he took a
hiatus from his job of rabble-rouser to enter the Democratic Senate
primary. He traded track suits for three-piece suits, though he
kept his beloved, James Brown-inspired ``process.'' Gov. Mario
Cuomo, seeking to buttress his black support, gave Sharpton a prime
speaking slot at the state convention. The media swallowed
Sharpton's professed reinvention: ``A New Sharpton: The Maturing of
a Maverick,'' headlined a New York Times profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Respect for Sharpton,'' declared USA Today. He took 15
percent of the primary vote, including the majority of black votes.
Sharpton repeated in 1994, taking 26 percent of the vote against
Sen. Daniel Moynihan in the Democratic primary. Once more, the
press love-bombed him.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sharpton came undone again. In 1995 he organized
demonstrations against a Harlem store called Freddy's, denouncing
the ``white interlopers'' who owned it. One of Sharpton's
protesters went on a shooting rampage in the store, then burned it
to the ground. Eight people died. Sharpton restored the shine when
he ran for the 1997 Democratic mayoral nomination. He won 32
percent of the vote in the primary and came within 1,000 votes of
forcing a runoff with Ruth Messinger. Again, the press observed the
``Remaking of the Rev. Al'' and applauded the more temperate
Sharpton
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton sabotaged himself anew. Pagones had sued him for his
false Brawley accusations, and the case finally reached trial in
1998. In August 1998, Sharpton was found liable of defaming Pagones
and ordered to pay him $65,000. Sharpton still wouldn't apologize
to Pagones or admit that Brawley made up her story. A month later,
he flipped the bird to his critics by sharing the stage with
reprehensibles Khalid Muhammad, Malik Shabazz, and Leonard Jeffries
at the Million Youth March
</P>
<P>
   But you can't keep Al down.
</P>
<P>
   When Amadou Diallo was killed in February 1999, Sharpton rushed
to comfort the Diallo family. Then he stage-managed weeks of
protests at police headquarters, arranging for everyone from David
Dinkins to Susan Sarandon to 100 rabbis and rabbinical students to
be arrested. Al was back. The pols began making their pilgrimages
to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But take this to the bank: The new new Al Sharpton won't last
either.
</P>
<P>
   The cracks are already visible: During Bradley's visit to
Sharpton headquarters, Nation of Islam allies surrounded and
threatened a black city councilman accompanying Bradley. During
Hillary's visit to HQ, a Sharpton comrade (and a member of his
board) warmed up the crowd with anti-Semitic comments as the first
lady waited backstage. Sharpton may have learned to temper himself,
but he won't steer clear of bad eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton credits his current respectability to the overdue
recognition that he's the heir to Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse
Jackson. (He is obsessed with this: He points out that he is 13
years younger than Jackson, who is 13 years younger than King. He
takes every opportunity to compare himself to his heroes. King, he
says, was also sued for defamation.) Sharpton does deserve praise:
He is one of the only champions of America's poorest and most
woebegone citizens, and he has served them devotedly for three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   It's important not to make too much of the current Sharpton
vogue. Sharpton cites his rising voting percentage as evidence of
his expanding influence, but this is a numerical mirage. Though his
percentages have increased, Sharpton's vote totals have not. He won
roughly the same number of votes in 1992, 1994, and 1997. The only
reason his percentages rose is that turnout fell. In each election,
he won about 130,000 votes in New York City. (He also won about
30,000 non-city votes in his 1992 and 1994 statewide runs.)
Sharpton commands a sizable group of followers -- about one-quarter
of New York City's black voters and a few Hispanics, but it's not
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is kingmaker not because he is getting stronger, but
because the rest of the New York Democratic Party is so weak.
George Pataki's and Rudy Giuliani's success has ripped the guts out
of the party. The Democrats who held it together have vanished.
Cuomo, Dinkins, and Ed Koch are gone. Moynihan is a national
figure, not a local one. Hillary Clinton is an outsider. Old-time
New York liberalism is discredited.
</P>
<P>
   In the rickety shack that remains, Sharpton is the strongest
force, the only consistent and vigorous opposition to Giuliani.
Sharpton's block of votes may be stagnant, but at least he can
deliver them, which is more than any other Democrat can do.
(Sharpton can also derail a campaign by putting demonstrators on
the street against it.) This is why all Democratic candidates must
pay homage to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's rehab also depends on the media's love affair with
him. He claims Jesse Jackson, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and James
Brown as surrogate fathers, and he is a close friend of Don King.
In other words, the reverend can put on a show. Sharpton never saw
a camera he didn't mug for. Reporters in New York prize him, so he
always has a platform. The local cable news channel, New York One,
is so Al-friendly that it's known as the ``Sharpton News Network,''
says political scientist Fred Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who benefit most from Sharpton's respectability are
Republicans. Rudy Giuliani is delighted that Sharpton has become a
power broker. Sharpton alienates New York whites, especially Jews,
at least as much as he mobilizes poor blacks. Sharpton's support of
Hillary will swing thousands of white votes to Giuliani without
costing Rudy a ballot none of Sharpton's people would have voted
for him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is a slow-moving target for national Republicans, too.
McCain's attack on Sharpton may mark the beginning of a long
presidential campaign barrage. George Will just took a shot at him.
So did the Weekly Standard. As the campaign continues, Sharpton may
become the Bob Jones of the left. Republicans will ask,
high-mindedly, why Al Gore is associating with such a hatemonger.
Brawley footage will be recycled. Sharpton will be invited to
Sunday morning talk shows. He will be in heaven.

INTERNET PROVIDERS TRY TO MAKE FREE ACCESS PAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With announcements last week by Lycos and NBC Interactive that
they would join the list of companies offering free Internet
service, it became clear that the free-access movement is a trend.
But what remains less clear is whether the trend will alter the
financial fundamentals of the Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements by Lycos, the fourth-most-visited site on the
World Wide Web, and NBCi, a popular news and entertainment site
part-owned by General Electric's NBC, followed similar
announcements of free Internet service in January by Excite(AT)Home
and Juno Online Services. And just before those announcements,
Kmart said it had a deal with Yahoo to provide free Internet access
through a new shopping site called BlueLight. Even ``The Simpsons''
is offering free Internet service through www.thesimpsons.com, the
TV show's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero, the largest of the free service providers, says its
registered user base has reached 3 million _ which would rank it
with the top tier of commercial Internet access providers, like
Earthlink and Microsoft's MSN, although well back of America Online
and its 20 million paying subscribers. (America Online and
Microsoft both charge subscribers $21.95 a month. Earthlink charges
$19.95.)
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for free Internet service, users typically must view
a continual barrage of advertising, usually in a narrow bar that is
ever-present on the screen. For the providers, the idea is to
recoup the cost of the service through those ads and through online
product sales. One provider, WorldSpy, carries no advertising but
counts on all its revenues coming from purchases that subscribers
make through its site.
</P>
<P>
   But critics also point to the sticky matter, perceived or real,
of privacy: Sites that offer free Internet access typically require
subscribers to divulge a certain amount of personal and demographic
information, and the subscribers usually must agree to allow the
site to trace their activities on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To some analysts, the increase in Internet companies that offer
free access is the next logical step in the commercial evolution of
the Internet, following naturally behind the advent of so-called
portals, or gateway sites, and free e-mail. But other analysts and
company executives contend that the free Internet services will
appeal only to the most value-conscious consumers, those willing to
overlook disadvantages that might keep the bulk of Internet users
ready and willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with the research firm Jupiter
Communications, says that there is too much brand loyalty among
Internet consumers who already pay for access, and too little
advertising to carry the revenue burden for the free services.
``There simply aren't enough ads,'' Wigder said.
</P>
<P>
   She is among the analysts who say that many consumers are simply
unwilling to be a captive audience to advertisers. A recent Jupiter
study predicted that by the end of 2003 only 13 percent of Internet
users would receive access to the network through a free provider.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, America Online is in no hurry to embrace the trend.
The company gets nearly two-thirds of its revenues from monthly
subscription fees, which amounted to $1.1 billion in the company's
most recent financial quarter. Free access, America Online
executives predicted, will alienate consumers with its tradeoffs
and the lack of customer service and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe there are viable business models today,''
said Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services. Last
year, America Online began offering free Internet service in
Britain through its Netscape brand, but company executives contend
that market bears little resemblance to the one in the United
States, where telephone lines (used for modem connections) are
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   If America Online were to make such a move in this country, it
might involve its CompuServe brand, which the company considers its
service for the budget-minded. ``There might be an emerging segment
that looks something like TV,'' Schuler said, referring to cable
television's tiers of free and pay services.
</P>
<P>
   Juno, which was one of the earliest providers of free e-mail,
already offers tiered service. For $9.95, subscribers get
around-the-clock customer service; the free service has none.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Earthlink, the second-largest service provider,
express little interest in considering free Internet service.
``Currently, we don't feel it's a sustainable business model,''
said Kirsten Witt, a company spokeswoman. ``We wouldn't be able to
offer the service and support that, at this point, is what our
customers say they want.''
</P>
<P>
   If the nation's largest Internet service providers see
themselves as above the free fray, however, smaller, regional
providers may not fare as well, Wigder said. These smaller, ``mom
and pop'' operations typically do not have the money to invest in
providing their own information and entertainment material, she
said, which gives consumers less reason to shell out $200 or so a
year to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, most online access services charged by
the minute, like long-distance telephone services, with bills
sometimes totaling $100 a month or more for active users. But these
days, even the pay services have been retooled as flat-fee
services, in which some revenues come from advertising and
electronic commerce. The free-service providers see themselves as
simply taking that evolution to the next logical step.
</P>
<P>
   Within the industry, the beneficiaries of the free-service trend
include companies like 1stUp, which act as the behind-the-scenes
network operators and manage the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   1stUp, based in San Francisco, is the company behind AltaVista's
free service and Excite(AT)Home's FreeLane, and has already signed
up some four dozen other corporate clients. They include The Denver
Rocky Mountain News, which offers free Internet access through
1stUp, as well as special-interest portals like Gay.com, Senior.com
and Afronet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Spinway.com, another start-up based in San Francisco, made news
in December with the announcement that it would provide
BlueLight.com's infrastructure. At the same time, Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia Inc. announced it would spend $13 million for a 5
percent stake in BlueLight.com. And in its announcement of free
service last week, NBC Interactive said it was taking a minority
stake in Spinway.com, which is operating the free service.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Katz, chief executive at 1stUp, acknowledges that free
Internet service is not for every consumer _ particularly those who
object to Web sites' collecting data about them. But he defended
the company's business model and said his service is a viable
alternative for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we are giving consumers a choice,'' Katz said. And he
said he considered the advertising on 1stUp sites no more intrusive
than television advertising, which the public accepted long ago.
``Sure, it's noticeable,'' he said, ``but it doesn't get in the
way.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Privacy advocates were relieved last week when DoubleClick Inc.,
the Internet's biggest supplier of banner advertising, announced
that it would put a hold on its plan to link personal identities
and other information to anonymous data it collects about Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   Some of DoubleClick's competitors were just as relieved. As
privacy groups and legislators began to look past DoubleClick and
into the broader business of companies that serve ads on behalf of
Web site publishers, those competitors had been bracing for more
intense scrutiny of their own data-gathering practices.
</P>
<P>
   One company in particular, 24/7 Media, escaped the public
flogging endured by DoubleClick, even though it had planned _ and
still plans _ to implement a data-gathering technique almost
identical to the method that earned DoubleClick the wrath of
privacy advocates and investors. Indeed, early last year, long
before DoubleClick announced its plans, 24/7 Media began developing
technology to marry offline data about consumers' spending habits
with data compiled about their online viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   To advertisers, the combination of the two databases promises a
much greater chance of presenting advertisements to people who will
respond to them. That is considered essential at the end of a year
in which advertisers have watched ``click through'' rates _ the
average percentage of Web surfers who click on any single banner ad
_ fall below the 1 percent mark, compared with about 2 percent in
1998. In view of that drop, advertisers have become less willing to
pay high advertising rates for banners, forcing Web site publishers
to scramble for other sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Which is perhaps why advertisers, publishers and the advertising
networks said little about possible privacy objections last year
when the new ad-targeting approach was developed.
</P>
<P>
   But to make that approach work, the advertising networks must
first match consumers' identities with anonymous data gathered
online as the consumers surf the Web. The online data is gathered
by means of ``cookies'' _ tiny files that are placed on users' hard
drives when they are served ads or visit Web sites. Each cookie
contains a tracking number, and since the number identifies a
computer, not a specific user, it is considered anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   That anonymity ends the moment a site or an advertiser matches a
cookie with a name, which can happen whenever a user enters
personal information on a Web site, by, for example, registering a
piece of software or entering a contest. Once a consumer's identity
is known, a site or advertising network can get reams of data about
that consumer from an offline data company like Acxiom _ or in
DoubleClick's case, from its Abacus division, which tracks the
offline buying habits of millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of 24/7 Media, the company has an agreement with
Naviant Technology Solutions, which processes online product
registrations for computer companies like IBM, among others. When a
consumer registers a new computer online, he or she is given the
option of receiving relevant product offers and a cookie is placed
on the computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Naviant has placed 24/7 Media's cookies on registrants' hard
drives at a rate of ``well over a million per month,'' said C.
Andrew Johns, 24/7 Media's chief financial officer. That gives the
company a database of more than 15 million cookies that it has
matched with individual names, which it can now use to direct ads
to specific people based on their offline personal data _
everything from age and zip code to retail purchasing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Before the flap over DoubleClick's plans, Johns had predicted
24/7 Media would combine the offline and online data by the end of
July, ``with full disclosure'' to users of the company's intentions
when Naviant collected the data, and the chance to ``opt out,'' or
decline participation in the program. On Thursday, however, he said
the company had decided to join DoubleClick and wait ``until there
is clear definition about guidelines in the industry'' before
starting the program.
</P>
<P>
   Like DoubleClick, 24/7 Media argues that some uses of offline
data to target customers on the Web would be acceptable to privacy
advocates. For example, they argue that while advocates oppose
actually mixing information from the two kinds of databases, they
would not find it objectionable to merely use cookies to link a
computer with a specific person's offline consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong,'' said Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a
Washington-based newsletter. Hendricks said such a practice was
also a privacy invasion, because consumers who disclosed their
identities to particular Web sites would not expect that
information to be used by advertisers to build profiles for
purposes of sending advertisements anywhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clearly is a major privacy concern, and will keep this
issue alive,'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and the Federal Trade Commission continue to
investigate online privacy _ and as the industry pushes for
self-regulation _ more subtle nuances about the methods of
advertising networks will almost surely be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Schmitt, an analyst with Forrester Research, says the
advertising industry's hopes for self-regulation may not survive
such scrutiny. In the past year, he said, advertising networks have
been under increasing pressure to make ad campaigns more effective.
</P>
<P>
   That situation, Schmitt said, has resulted in publishers
increasingly passing information about their users to the ad
networks. He cited one particularly egregious example involving an
unnamed advertising network that he had spoken to _ ``not
DoubleClick,'' he said _ and an online credit card company.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card company, he said, passed along the names of
people whom it considered high credit risks, so the network could
report on their online surfing habits and help determine their
creditworthiness. ``The credit card company could base their
decision on whether the person spent their time on the Black
Entertainment Network, or whatever,'' Schmitt said. ``Pick your
poison.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns, of 24/7 Media, said there are no such practices at his
company. Michael Griffiths, chief technology officer of MatchLogic,
an advertising network that is a unit of Excite(AT)Home, said his
company does not match personal information with cookie data, even
though it collects both types of data.
</P>
<P>
   Engage, an advertising network that is a unit of CMGI and
includes the Flycast and AdSmart advertising companies, states on
its privacy page that it ``does not store any personally
identifiable information or even combinations of data that can be
potentially personally identifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the prospect of someone either not telling the
truth, or not being aware of a privacy violation within their
company.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, such examples are anathema not only to
advertising networks, but to online media companies like America
Online and Yahoo, which have the potential to track their users'
activities and match them with registration data to yield rich
personal profiles. Both companies say they do not mix their users'
personal information with their click patterns, and both companies
portray themselves as leaders in the online privacy effort.
</P>
<P>
   But these companies face guilt by association in an atmosphere
of diminishing user trust. While consumer distrust has not yet
shown signs of affecting any site's visitation levels, it could
yield something equally unpalatable: government regulation. The FTC
has already released several reports highly critical of Web privacy
polices in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all sitting on a heck of a lot of information on your
Internet use,'' said Andrew Shen, policy analyst with the
Electronic Privacy Information center, who also serves on an online
privacy advisory panel for the FTC ``It's an endemic, industry-wide
problem, and relying on the FTC to just look into it isn't going to
solve the problem.''

COMPAQ OFFERING A HOME COMPUTER WITH A FASTER CHIP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first home computer with a one-gigahertz chip, which can
process data 17 percent faster than the top consumer chip now on
the market, will be offered for sale on Thursday, the Compaq
Computer Corp. said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Houston, said the new system was being
marketed primarily to computer game players seeking highly
detailed, fast-moving graphics. The systems will be known as the
Presario 5900Z series of desk-top computers.
</P>
<P>
   The gigahertz Athlon chip is made by Advanced Micro Devices,
which also makes what had been the fastest chip for home computers,
the 850 megahertz Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Advanced Micro cut prices on its chips for home
computers by as much as 29 percent, but not the 850 Athlon, which
continues to carry a list price of $849, according to Merrill
Lynch's weekly report on chip prices.
</P>
<P>
   The price cuts generally matched those made earlier in the week
by the Intel Corp., the industry leader. Intel's fastest chip for
PC's has a speed of 800 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   Many existing desktop computers have chips that operate at
faster speeds than the rest of the computer can fully utilize.
Compaq said it had designed the Presario 5900Z line to maximize the
benefits of the faster chip.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said a system with 128 megabytes of random access memory,
a 30-gigabyte hard drive and a 17-inch color monitor, but not a
printer, would sell for $2,499.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An international plan to create the Internet's
first democracy is plagued by skepticism, conflicting goals and a
lack of accountability, which will make it nearly impossible for
the Internet's new oversight organization to hold a fair election
in September, according to a report released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by two influential public interest groups, stopped
short of recommending that the organization, the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, postpone its September board
election.
</P>
<P>
   But the report urged Icann to make major improvements in its
plan to let individual computer users around the world help elect
half the board's 18 members. Otherwise, the report said, Icann
risks losing the legitimacy that it needs to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is clearly not ready for prime time,'' said Jerry
Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, which wrote the report with Common Cause, both public
interests groups based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, interim chairwoman of Icann, called the report
``sensible.'' But she said remedies, if any, would not come at the
risk of delaying the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message from them is go slow,'' Dyson said of the
report's writers. ``And our basic message is we have got to move
forward,'' she said in a telephone interview from Britain. ``We
agree with you that it is experimental and we are putting in as
many checks and balances as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Icann's current voting plan would allow any Internet user over
the age of 16 who has an e-mail and postal address to participate
in the international election of a special council, which in turn
would appoint the remaining nine members to the 18-member board.
The other nine members, representing various commercial
constituencies, were appointed last fall by the interim board led
by Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report said the main problems with the plan were a lack
of clarity about Icann's mission and a lack of controls to keep the
special council from being swayed by special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until these fundamental concerns are fully addressed, this
election will not be able to confer the consent of the governed
onto Icann,'' the report said. ``Instead, the initial election can
only be viewed as an experiment in democracy that must be
re-evaluated if it is ever to confer legitimacy.'' The report
recommends that Icann change its rules to allow for direct
elections of the nine additional board members.
</P>
<P>
   But Dyson said that would not happen. ``That decision has been
made,'' she said. ``I think the board is very open to iterative
improvements as we go along. But we are moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups that issued the report will officially present their
findings to Icann at its board meeting this week in Cairo. Although
the report lays out widespread skepticism and criticism, Berman
said it was intended to be a constructive way to help Icann and
other interested parties debate the issues and reach a consensus on
how to improve them.
</P>
<P>
   Their main message, the report's authors say, is to place the
goal of holding effective elections ahead of the goal of completing
them by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a way to do these elections in a way that would be
fair and efficient,'' said Scott Harshbarger, president of Common
Cause. ``We are urging them to take some time and take the
opportunity to use Cairo to really discuss this.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was commissioned through a grant from the Markle
Foundation last year. Markle officials, who have committed $1
million in grants to help advance public interest in Internet
governance issues, said they would not take a position on the
report, although the group was pleased with its depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short time they not only thought through some very
difficult issues, but they really succeeded in getting input from
key constituencies, including nonprofits, academics and industry
groups, international advocates and experts in democracy and voting
systems,'' said Andrew Shapiro, a senior adviser at the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was selected by the Clinton administration in late 1998 to
oversee the system for assigning Internet addresses, or domain
names _ a system previously run by federal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The organization initially operated under the direction of an
interim board appointed by a small group of Internet founders and
insiders. Its main mandate was to introduce competition into the
business of registering domain names and to build a membership that
represents Internet users around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year and a half, however, most of its
organizational energy has focused on creating so-called
``supporting organizations'' of business groups that will provide
the bulk of financing for the nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Those constituencies _ representing such commercial interests as
Internet service providers, intellectual property interests, and
registrars of domain names _ were officially agreed upon last year,
and nine board members to represent them were elected last fall by
the supporting organizations.
</P>
<P>
   So the last big task for Icann's interim board is to create the
at-large constituency to elect the board members who will replace
the interim board and work alongside the business representatives
selected last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But with a limited budget and just a few employees, Icann has
been torn by tension between groups pushing it to move faster and
others urging it to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The debate this week in Cairo will probably be no different.
Under pressure by both its own bylaws and by people pushing for
representation of noncommercial interests, Icann started a Web site
(www.members.icann.org/) last week, where computer users can
register to become at-large members of the nonprofit group. Those
registrations, however, are tentative, with the understanding that
final details about exactly who qualifies, whether they will be
required to pay a fee and how their voices will be counted _
through a direct election or a council _ will be resolved in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   While Friday's report recommended specific changes like those
involving election procedures, Berman and Harshbarger said in
interviews that Icann needed to answer even more fundamental
questions before a vote proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they said, Icann needs to define its mission more
clearly and adopt language that limits its scope of power.
</P>
<P>
   While Icann's official mission is to oversee the operations of
the domain name system, one of its first policy decisions last year
was to lay down rules for resolving so-called cybersquatting cases,
which involve disputes over the use of trademarks in domain names.
That has caused widespread confusion about the scope of Icann's
power, Berman said.

AS PAPER ENDURES IN A DIGITAL AGE, PRINT SHOPS GO ONLINE TO MOVE
IT  FASTER

   Christopher R. Wilder had less than 24 hours to prepare a
presentation. He composed it on his laptop, uploaded it to a new
Web site, Nowdocs.com, and ordered 15 bound copies, complete with
20 color illustrations. Two hours later, the package was on his
doorstep. Total cost: $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convenience is terrific, and the price was right,'' said
Wilder, an executive with the Knowledge Capital Group in Austin,
Texas
</P>
<P>
   Then there was G. Christopher Hargett, president of Meridian
Research, a market research firm in Memphis, Tenn. He used
Mimeo.com, another new print-and-deliver company, to convert a
28-page black-and-white report from electronic form to print, and
to send three copies to an out-of-town client. It cost around $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it cost more or less than Kinko's, but I
didn't have to leave my desk,'' Hargett said.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the Internet replacing paper with electrons. Study
after study has shown that e-mail, Web pages and such are
generating more paper, not less. Now it seems they are creating a
greater need for the printing and delivery services they were
supposed to make obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses require physical documents that arrive on time,''
said Melissa Shore, digital commerce analyst at Jupiter
Communications. ``And that means paper and people.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, no one suggests returning to the old practice of
print-and-distribute _ create a brochure or report, make scores of
hard copies and ship them out. The Internet is switching that to
distribute, then print _ create a document electronically, send it
out in bits and bytes and let recipients make hard copies as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But this new approach brings its own problems. If the
recipient's computer is incompatible with the sender's, the
document can get garbled. And recipients have to really want to see
a lengthy document to scroll through pages of text, let alone print
it out _ not a great prospect for a marketer making a pitch or a
publicist distributing press kits.
</P>
<P>
   So it was probably inevitable that someone, somewhere, would see
a lucrative opportunity in adding physical distribution back into
the electronic equation. And now, several companies have done just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Internet start-ups, including Nowdocs.com, Mimeo.com and
Reprint.com, accept documents in electronic form, print them and
deliver them to as many recipients as the customer will pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., hoping to get into the game, has been keeping a
running list of new entrants. At last count there were 40 names,
``and more get added every day,'' said Larry G. Wirth, vice
president for strategy at Xerox's graphic arts group.
</P>
<P>
   Copy shops like Kinko's are jumping in with similar services.
Web-based printing brokers like Noosh.com now handle large print
jobs from start to finish. Office supply chains like Staples and
Office Depot, most of which already own delivery trucks and offer
printing services, are considering similar Web-linked
printing-and-delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them are looking to blend dot-com technology with local
delivery service,'' said David Kaplow, vice president of the
Internet Research Group, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the companies that make copiers and printers
want to capitalize on the budding trend. ``We are poised to enter
the market at any time,'' said Timothy Andree, a Canon vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. has taken a stake in Mimeo.com, and is
including that company's services in its print services package.
``The Internet-enabled printing space is emerging rapidly, and
hooking up with Mimeo accelerated our entry,'' said Kriss
Kirchhoff, Hewlett's general manager for digital workplace
services.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox is nosing around for a partner, too. It, like other
established companies, views the newcomers as customers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms may compete with us, yes, but they also can be
excellent customers for our equipment and services,'' said Frank D.
Steenburgh, a senior vice president at Xerox, which sold
Nowdocs.com its copiers and printers.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of adding delivery to printing service is not new,
of course. Bowne &AMP; Co., for one, has long offered such services to
large clients. ``The dot-coms would like to think they're inventing
a new wheel, but large players have done this for years,'' said
Robert M. Johnson, Bowne's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But while the dot-coms salivate over large corporate clients, it
is the myriad smaller businesses with occasional needs for printing
and delivery that are their most attainable market.
</P>
<P>
   Such customers may not be easy to land. ``Our biggest
competition is our own potential customers,'' said Jeff Stewart,
chief executive of Mimeo.com, which has been in business since
1998. ``They are used to driving to Kinko's, or sitting in front of
the printer or copy machine. We have to change behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the dot-coms have to find these customers. One way is to
be featured on other Web pages. Nowdocs.com, for instance, is
listed on OfficeClick.com, which has a directory of services for
office managers. Mimeo.com has a link on Hewlett-Packard's page.
But the main form of outreach remains so-called viral marketing _
in effect, word of mouth (or mouse).
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kristie Royce, president of the training firm KLR
Associates, has used Nowdocs to print and deliver training manuals.
She recently persuaded the National Speakers Association to run a
blurb about Nowdocs in its newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a raving fan, and I'm telling everyone to try it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts worry whether such accolades will yield enough
customers before the companies' financing runs out. ``The question
is, will people find them?'' said Darcy Fowkes, an analyst for the
Aberdeen Group, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The other question is: How will each company set itself apart
from the growing pack?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the print-and-deliver start-up companies allow customers
to e-mail or upload documents to their Web sites, or even create
documents on the sites. Most provide electronic previews of how the
printed documents will look. Most will store the electronic
documents so that customers can reorder copies. Most offer a
variety of colors and bindings for the finished pieces. Most track
the documents from receipt to delivery.
</P>
<P>
   And most guarantee rapid delivery. Nowdocs.com and Mimeo.com
have both set up shop in Memphis, in the shadow of Federal Express'
main hub, so that customers can file documents late in the day and
still get them sent out that night via FedEx. Nowdocs also runs
printing operations in 13 other cities, in which it guarantees
two-hour delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of ourselves as a blend of the best of Kinko's and
Federal Express,'' said Brad Adamske, president of Nowdocs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Later deadlines certainly are a selling point. Geoffrey A.
Garbacz, a co-founder of Independent Research Associates, sends
confidential documents throughout the country. But he is in Little
Rock, Ark., and ``Airborne and FedEx stop taking deliveries at 4
p.m. around here,'' Garbacz said. ``With Mimeo.com, I can go work
out, have dinner, get home, send a document at 8:30 p.m., and it
still goes out that day.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the competition promises to be fierce. Although the
dot-coms have jumped into the market first, many of the older
latecomers already have their distribution routines down pat. Many
also have long-standing customer relationships, and deep pockets
for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Kinko's, for example, already has Kinkonet, which accepts print
jobs electronically, and the company is about to introduce free
software that will give customers an electronic preview of the
finished product.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kinko's is ready to add delivery options. It has more than
1,000 copy shops in the United States that it just hooked together
with high-speed data transmission lines, enabling Kinko's to move
documents around rapidly. In addition, the company has signed an
agreement with America Online. AOL gets to put demonstration
centers in Kinko's stores, while AOL customers are showered with
Kinko's banner ads and hot links to Kinko's electronic services.
Kinko's also acquired Liveprint.com, which offers document-creation
software online.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the brand and the distribution, and we've invested in
infrastructure, technology, everything to make sure we have a true
clicks-and-bricks solution,'' said Charles R. Morrison, Kinko's
vice president for product marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are finding less capital-intensive ways to enter
the business, without printers and delivery trucks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sidona Systems, an Arizona company that owned Reprints.com,
tried a ``desktop-to-doorbell in 70 minutes'' approach a few years
ago, but could not make a profit. Sidona has since been bought by
Incunet.Com, a Phoenix investor group, which will soon reintroduce
the service. But this time Reprints.com will not do its own
printing or delivery. It will accept the documents electronically,
format them, give customers an online preview of how they will
look, then let the customers choose from a list of geographically
dispersed print shops that can handle the job. Reprints.com's
service will be free; its money will come as commissions from the
printers that the customers choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to own equipment, we don't have to worry about
billing, and our expansion is not limited,'' said Dan Blackledge,
Incunet's information technologies manager.
</P>
<P>
   For the early entrants, the growing competition is a blessing as
well as a curse. ``A year ago, you had to convince investors this
was a viable business,'' said Adamske of Nowdocs, which recently
went public. ``Now there's enough activity so that investors are
calling me.''

GAUGING THE LIMITS OF QUANTUM COMPUTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Six years ago, Dr. Peter Shor, a researcher
at AT&AMP;T Labs, galvanized an obscure area of computer science when
he published a recipe by which a computer based on the principles
of quantum mechanics could break the cryptographic codes protecting
data transmissions over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, top researchers around the world have joined forces
to further explore how the power of the strange rules that prevail
in the submicroscopic realm of the atom can be harnessed in a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Many government and corporate research labs like Microsoft
Research, International Business Machines and AT&AMP;T Labs, either
already have a quantum computing group, or, like NASA's Ames
Research Center and the Hewlett-Packard Corp., are thinking of
starting one.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious group in New York has even begun a quantum
computing start-up, called MagiQ Technologies, with a stated goal
of building a ``quantum Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At a weeklong quantum computing conference last month at the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute here, researchers from
universities and corporate labs gathered to discuss advances in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Talks centered on algorithms for quickly solving problems
thought infeasible for ``classical'' computers, understanding the
limits of the computational power of quantum computers, various
approaches to building a practical device and methods for
correcting computational errors.
</P>
<P>
   The week culminated in a series of presentations to the
Information Technology Office of the Defense Department's funding
agency, which is considering a program for financing quantum
computing research.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the participants celebrated the advances in this
technology, which go far beyond speculations of just a few years
ago, they acknowledged that researchers were still far from
understanding either the potential or the limits of the technology
and even further from building a practical device.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the researchers said they were lured to the
field, not by the possibility of a quantum computer on every
desktop, but as a gateway to a better understanding of the bizarre
world of quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary or ``classical'' computer stores information in
units called bits (0s or 1s), typically represented by electrical
currents or voltages that are either high or low. A quantum
computer, however, stores information by using the states of
elementary particles.
</P>
<P>
   Classically, the electron in a hydrogen atom, say, can be in a
high or low energy state. But in the weird world of quantum physics
the state of the electron is not just high or low but a weighted
combination of both simultaneously: what physicists call a
``superposition'' of states. As a result, a quantum bit in some
sense contains more information than its classical counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, as the number of quantum bits grows, the
amount of information required to describe it grows exponentially.
Classically, since each electron can be in one of two states, a
system of 200 hydrogen atoms will be in one of 200 states. Quantum
theory, however, says that the system at any moment is in a
superposition of all of those 200 possibilities at once.
</P>
<P>
   Because 200 is a huge number, far larger than the estimated
number of particles in the universe, scientists question how the
universe can manage to even keep track of its own natural
processes. But the fact that it can hints at an enormous resource
for computing power.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a tiny system of 200 atoms, it is as though nature must
keep 200 pieces of scratch paper on the side, each with a number
written on it,'' said Dr. Umesh Vazirani, a professor of computer
science at the University of California at Berkeley and a
co-organizer of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But this vast storehouse of information is difficult to tap.
According to the theory of quantum mechanics, a scientist cannot
look at an electron without jarring it out of its delicate
superposition and collapsing it into a single one of its two
classical states according to the weights.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of devising quantum algorithms for solving
problems is to harness this vast and hidden information processing
power despite the inability to access all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their potential power, Shor said in his presentation,
quantum computers will not necessarily perform all tasks more
quickly than classical computers. A working quantum computer, he
said, is likely to perform each operation more slowly than a
classical computer.
</P>
<P>
   Only for certain problems where researchers have discovered
methods of exploiting this vast pool of stored information to
extract an answer in far fewer steps _ methods impossible on a
classical computer _ will it be possible to speed up the
computation.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of this are Shor's algorithm for factoring numbers into
their prime components, a process that enables the cracking of
codes, and an algorithm by Dr. Lov Grover, a Bell labs researcher,
for searching a very specialized type of database.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers, including Shor, are trying to find quantum
algorithms for other problems, believed to be beyond the reach of
classical devices. Others are working on quantum cryptographic
schemes to replace existing schemes in case a practical device is
built.
</P>
<P>
   Vazirani's presentation highlighted research on the limits of
quantum computers. For example, Grover's algorithm allows a
database to be searched in the square root of the time required by
a classical computer.
</P>
<P>
   This square root speed-up is the best that can be achieved,
according to work by Vazirani and others. Their result suggests, he
said, that the hardest problems in computing may forever be beyond
the reach of quantum computers.
</P>
<P>
   Vazirani pointed out, however, that such limits might be a
blessing in disguise because it raises hopes that new crytosystems
can be developed that quantum computers cannot break.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Isaac Chuang, a physicist at the IBM Almaden Research Center
in San Jose, Calif., described several competing technologies for a
working computer. In one of those, he reported, researchers have
managed to perform Grover's database search algorithm using as many
as four quantum bits. All the proposals, however, face difficulties
in scaling up to a practical device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main challenge in building a quantum computer,'' Chuang
said, ``is that you want to isolate it from everything in the
external world, yet, at the same time, be able to manipulate it at
high speed.''
</P>
<P>
   A major difficulty with running a quantum computer, the experts
say, is correcting the errors that build up during a calculation.
States stored in memory will get jostled inadvertently, for
example, and operations will be applied to the wrong quantum bit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Gottesman, of Microsoft Research, reviewed techniques
for correcting some of the errors that occurred while computations
were in progress. Beginning with a startling breakthrough by Shor
and colleagues, he said, researchers have outlined how to restore
quantum states that have been stored in memory but have partly
collapsed due to inadvertent observations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, research by Gottesman and others has shown that
errors in the computations themselves can also be corrected, as
long as there are not very many of them. He and others are trying
to develop error correction techniques that are more efficient and
that can accommodate larger numbers of errors.
</P>
<P>
   These researchers seem not to be disheartened by the many
barriers to a desktop quantum computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the value of a newborn baby?'' asked Richard Josza, a
professor of computer science at the University of Bristol in
England. ``Now, it can't do anything. But the potential is
limitless.''

National park digital guides cover nuances from every angle &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would be hard to find two more utterly different
places than Yellowstone National Park and the Okefenokee Swamp: one
majestic, the other dark and brooding.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, the most magical places I have ever seen, and
I haven't seen nearly enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   Maptech, whose reproductions of Geological Survey maps of North
Georgia we discussed some time ago, has produced a series of
National Park Digital Guides for all 54 national parks. I've been
tracing on one of them the places we saw at Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   I'm parked now overlooking the Hayden Valley, not far from the
Lake Hotel, in the hour before dawn. Our son, an outdoor
photographer, was working in the park, and he brought us to that
spot at just that time. I cannot remember the last time I saw land
illuminated by starlight; it may have been 50 years ago, when
coyotes yapped and sang around our house just as they do now in the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   The park maps have all the advantages of Maptech's standard
topographical maps _ you can measure distances as the crow flies or
along a path, and when you have laid out your distance line you can
switch to a profile view that shows how much uphill and downhill
you'll have to contend with. You can zoom in and out, mark up a map
with a trail you want to hike and print it out.
</P>
<P>
   The maps also have a lot of text; there are guides to services
in the park you're looking at, plus discussions of the flora and
fauna, history, climate and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The Okefenokee is included on the CD-ROM in Maptech's terrain
Navigator series that also covers the Georgia coastal area. All the
same goodies are here, even the profile views, although there isn't
much profile to the Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to find Billy's Island, the turnaround point in our
epic motorboat adventure. The problem with outboard motors like
those they rent in the swamp is that they steer exactly opposite
the way one steers a car. It takes a while to remember which way to
twist the throttle to run it up or shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect there's an alligator that hangs out not far from
Billy's Island who still has nightmares about our encounter; I can
only hope we didn't stunt his growth. He was only about 3 feet long
when we met; he was minding his own business, sunning himself on a
partially submerged log.
</P>
<P>
   A close-up photo was in order. With the captain at the helm and
his lady in the bow, the idea was to run up the motor briefly, then
shut it off entirely and glide soundlessly as close to the 'gator
as we could. I maneuvered the boat around to line up with the log,
the memsahib positioned herself up front, and I put the motor in
gear. Unfortunately, instead of shutting it down, I twisted the
wrong way and put the pedal to the water, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The poor 'gator awoke to the sight of a motorboat roaring toward
him at breakneck speed, a woman's legs flailing in the air over the
gunnels. Fortunately, the memsahib stayed with the boat, and the
'gator was long gone when we replaced him on top of the log.
</P>
<P>
   The map of the swamp wouldn't help my seamanship, but it would
certainly make venturing beyond Billy's Island a lot nicer. In the
meantime, it's great fun just to scroll around the swamp and
imagine that water like a black mirror, with the birds overhead,
the reptiles watching you pass in the heavy silence. We'll do it in
kayaks next time. A motorboat is almost an insult to the place.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The fire began when a cigarette ignited the couch. Within
minutes flames leaped to the drapes and the fire raged until,
deprived by closed windows and doors of the oxygen needed to
flourish, it subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the smoldering fire continued to raise the temperature in
the room, bringing furniture, papers and candles close to their
ignition points. Arriving some time later, firefighters burst
through the door, and oxygen-rich air poured in with them.
</P>
<P>
   The room appeared to erupt into flames _ a phenomenon called
``flashover'' _ as the smoldering fire revived and, in rapid
succession, papers, candles and other furnishings ignited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have flashover, you generally lose the structure and
lives,'' said Dr. Kevin McGrattan, a mathematician with the
Building and Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   This fire was hypothetical, created on a computer program that
McGrattan and his colleagues, Dr. Ronald Rehm and Dr. Howard Baum,
designed to simulate the behavior of fire in a building in precise
three-dimensional detail, and to evaluate systems for detecting and
extinguishing the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Fire Dynamic Simulator, the program is to be posted
soon for distribution on the Web site of National Institute of
Standards and Technology (fire.nist.gov). The program is the most
sophisticated and powerful of its kind, said Dr. Richard G. Gann,
senior research scientist at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   As part of continuing official investigations, researchers at
the laboratory have already used the computer model to reconstruct
fatal fires that occurred in Washington and Brooklyn in 1998. The
researchers have also used the program to predict the performance
of ceiling sprinklers in fires and to explain why a sprinkler next
to one already active fails to open in proper sequence, a
phenomenon known as sprinkler skip.
</P>
<P>
   Structural fires cost the American economy about $128 billion
annually in property damage, maintaining fire departments and
insurance. On average each year, 4,000 civilians die and 40,000 are
injured in fires, primarily in their homes; among firefighters, 80
to 90 die and 80,000 to 90,000 are injured. Nearly 75 percent of
fire fatalities occur in flashovers, Gann said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, fire codes and designs aimed at preventing such
losses were based on the accumulated wisdom of firefighters, basic
mathematical calculations and laboratory tests of materials, Gann
said. But in the 1980s, researchers at the laboratory began
developing a computer program that would model the behavior of fire
in an enclosed space, using data on the type, amount and ignition
temperatures of whatever flammable materials were present. The
model drew on abundant data from tests of ignition temperatures and
burning times of new materials.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with another model anticipating the behavior of people
in the presence of fire, this so-called ``zone'' model gave
specialists a powerful tool for determining the layout of
evacuation routes, as well as the placement and timing of fire
alarms and sprinklers in buildings, railroad cars and planes.
</P>
<P>
   First released for use on a desktop computer in 1983, it is also
widely used by fire investigators, said Richard W. Bukowski, a
senior engineer at the fire research laboratory, who helped create
the ``zone'' model.
</P>
<P>
   But the model provides only a one-dimensional view of a room,
showing the vertical distribution of hot and cooler air, not its
horizontal movements. Unable to model the flow of air, it cannot
anticipate the behavior of fire in more complicated spaces, like
rooms with exposed beams or odd shapes. Although it can make rough
calculations about the changing intensity and size of the fire over
time, the program cannot determine its location in a room.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Dynamic Simulator solves those problems by dividing a
room into cubes six inches on each side, McGrattan said. Using the
staggeringly complex equations of computational fluid dynamics, it
then maps in three dimensions the fire and the flow of heated air
through the room.
</P>
<P>
   Heat causes materials, like wood, candle wax or fabrics, to
release gases, which then fuel the fire in the presence of oxygen.
(Thus, water puts out a fire by cooling, not drowning, it, while
depriving a fire of oxygen smothers it.) The dynamic model takes
days to run through its calculations, making it less user friendly,
if more precise, than its predecessor _ but it has already proved
its worth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McGrattan ran the program before the test burning of
an actual building at the Underwriters Laboratory. The experiment
was designed to examine the workings of roof vents, sprinklers and
draft curtains, which hang from the ceiling of large buildings,
like warehouses, and are designed to funnel smoke from a fire
inside the building toward the vents.
</P>
<P>
   The computer model predicted that the draft curtains and, to a
lesser degree the roof vents, would actually interfere with the
working of sprinklers by delaying their opening and by blocking the
full distribution of water from them. Draft curtains and roof vents
are frequently required in existing fire codes, which are developed
locally, and sometimes by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But a model unified national fire code now under development for
large buildings would drop the demand for draft curtains, McGrattan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The model has also explained a number of flukes in the behavior
of fire alarms and sprinklers. For example, in fire tests in a
basement with exposed ceiling beams, the sprinkler farthest from
the fire consistently ignited before those directly over the
flames.
</P>
<P>
   A computer simulation revealed that the beams were acting as a
conduit and were channeling heat from the fire to the distant
sprinkler so fast that the sensor on the nearest sprinkler never
became warm enough to activate it.
</P>
<P>
   The model showed that in sprinkler skip, water from one
sprinkler cools the heat sensor on its neighbor so that the second
sprinkler is not activated, thus increasing the possibility that
the fire will spread. Adjusting the sensitivity or placement of the
sprinklers solves the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A similar computer model developed in the late 1990s
demonstrated that under specific sea and wind conditions, burning
the oil spilled from a tanker caused less environmental damage,
despite the smoke and air pollution, than removing it after it has
washed ashore. Experiments confirmed the model, and since then
spilled oil has been burned at sea off Alaska in 1998 and after an
oil tanker, the New Carissa, foundered off Coos Bay, Ore., in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Simulations now play an equally crucial role in developing,
designing and testing new kinds of fire codes, based not on
requirements for number and placement of exits, sprinklers,
extinguishers and the like but rather on fire safety goals.
</P>
<P>
   These performance-based codes set specific goals for fire
safety, including the amount of time needed to warn and evacuate
the building's occupants, and the efficiency of the smoke detection
and sprinkler systems, but leave up to the design team the how to
meet those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bukowski estimated that these codes, being developed in Japan,
Australia, New Zealand and parts of Europe, can cut the cost of
fire protection in a new building _ now set at 15 percent or 20
percent of the construction cost _ by a third, while improving
safety. The fire research laboratory is working on a model
performance-based code of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fire Dynamic Simulator cannot yet predict when
flashover will occur because of the sheer complexity of calculating
the interactions of hot and cold air, radiant temperatures and the
ignition points of multiple materials over a long period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire modeling is like predicting the weather,'' McGrattan
said. ``We're pretty good in the short term, but not in the longer
term. We can predict the first couple of minutes of a fire
successfully, but after that, things become more dicey.''
Nonetheless, he said he expected in the next five years to be able
to ``confidently predict for any given room what the flash point
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the progress made in bringing their models to fire
engineers, the researchers admit that firefighters are reluctant to
embrace the technology, preferring in most cases to rely on their
experience and traditional methods. Still McGrattan expects
computer simulations to be widely used in training, because they
can provide a clearer view of fire than video cameras or eyes
blinded by smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory also
hope within four years to have built a control panel that has
embedded in it a ``zone'' model for tracking the progress of a fire
in a building in real time. Sensors monitoring temperature,
occupancy, smoke alarms, sprinklers, ventilation and other systems,
would relay information back to the program, which would also have
an inventory of material in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Constantly updating its data, the computer would determine the
location and intensity of a fire, as well as movement, and feed
that information directly to firefighters, in all likelihood saving
lives and reducing injuries.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Pentium chips fast, but Celeron might be better buy &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When is the best time to buy a computer? It's when you
need one.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the questions I get by phone and e-mail, that's the most
common. And there are dozens of cliched _ and unsatisfying _
answers to the question. My favorite is to wait until the computer
you own won't perform some vital task _ either won't run a program
that you need, or runs it so slowly that it's unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   But the real truth with computers is that most people buy a
computer when they get the craving, very much like buying a car.
The old one still runs, still gets you to work, but _ with obvious
exceptions _ most of us do not wait until the wheels fall off the
old car. It's the same with computers.
</P>
<P>
   We are coming into some confusing times when it comes to buying
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that new chips are coming from Intel.
There'll soon be even faster Pentium III chips, and also _ probably
next month _ Intel will bring out a new version of its popular
lower-priced junior brand chip, the Celeron. The Pentium III chips
will be fast _ with the state of the art at 866 megahertz and
increased to 933 megahertz later in the year. And they'll be
relatively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Celeron chips won't be as fast _ with a top speed of 600
megahertz _ and not just because of the clock speed (that's the 600
megahertz part).
</P>
<P>
   I hate to throw numbers around _ someone could get hurt _ but we
need them to tell this story. One of the factors in how fast your
computer runs is a thing called bus speed. That's the speed the
chip is able to use when transferring data. Think of the bus as the
pipeline that connects the chip and the computer. The faster that
pipeline _ the speed also is measured in megahertz _ the better the
computer is at wringing all the speed out of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Celeron chips use the old bus speed of 66 megahertz. The new
Pentium III chips work at bus speeds of 100 to 133 megahertz. That
means that a 600-megahertz Pentium III chip will run much faster
than a 600-megahertz Celeron chip, maybe 30 percent faster.
</P>
<P>
   All that being true, I'm guessing that you know what the next
shoe to drop is. You are thinking that the Pentium III is the best
buy. And _ if you're in true need of blazing speed, if you spend a
lot of time with graphics, if you are designing a nuclear submarine
in the basement _ that's right. It's also right if money is no
object. Go ahead and pop for the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're like me and tend to use a home computer to log on
to the Net, play a few games (they are power-hungry, but the
600-megahertz Celeron will run them just fine, especially if you
get a high-end video card to go with it) and to write letters _
then a Celeron is worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some people in the industry think that Intel actually
did too good of a job in designing the Celeron (and the new one is
even better because of a new chip technique that is important but
almost impossible to explain in the space I have left). The Celeron
runs so fast and sells for so little that some folks think that
Intel is losing a lot of Pentium III sales to that computer.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of price differential can you expect between the
Celeron and the Pentium III? I'm guessing that the new chips will
be about $300 apart (the spread will vary based on the speed of
each chip, but that's close).
</P>
<P>
   And since the Pentium III tends to go into higher-end machines,
the actual price difference when you consider the end price of the
PC may be higher.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you have PC lust now that it's turning spring, at least
consider looking at the new Celeron chip in March.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Celeron chip PC over one with Pentium III

People share recollections, large and small &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a few months ago, just as 1999 was becoming
2000, that people were putting things in time capsules and sticking
them in the ground. Folks in Wyandotte, Mich., placed pictures, a
community calendar and seeds from the local garden club. Students
from a high school in Hartford, Conn., created one with a T-shirt,
a cafeteria menu and a letter to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drawbacks with time capsules is they are mostly
filled with artifacts, pieces of pop culture that show future
generations how our time was accessorized. They tend not to tell
too much about how people really think.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.randomaccessmemory .org, tries to do that, to
be a kind of national diary. The site, Random Access Memory: an
Experiment in Collective Recollection, offers people the chance to
publish their memories. Registration is required, but the
information needed is minimal, and it is free. So far, 853 people
have made almost 1,978 entries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the site's main page, Random Access Memory is
designed to be a ``backup archive for your personal memories, for
recollections important or trivial. We encourage you to use this
site spontaneously. If you suddenly remember the sled you played
with as a child, or the sweet, eggy cake your mother fed you dipped
in tea, sign in and record the memory at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The site stores the entries and lets registered users search
them by date, subject or name. People wanting to maintain a low
profile can register under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a peek into our national psyche offered by a search for
the word ``television.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollywolly, 1959: ``Watching the black-and-white version of
Scrooge every Christmas Eve. Having to get up to change the
channel!! I shudder to think about it now. Ringing the operator to
make a phone call and then when we did get our dial phone, you had
to wait for the people on our `party line' to hang up!! Bringing a
nickel and two pennies to school every day for ice cream time.
Getting our first color television.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, 1968: ``I remember my parents watching, for hours, long
funeral services on our black-and-white TV. I realize now that this
was the year of Robert Kennedy's and Martin Luther King's deaths,
but at the time I thought that funerals were regular television
programs and wondered why my parents liked to watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quasilove,1982: ``In our kitchen, my father and I watch the
space shuttle launch. We have no television. The story is that he
broke it before I was born. But somehow now it projects and my
father and I watch the space shuttle launch against our kitchen
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   A search on the word ``cookies'' turns up these slices of
American pie:
</P>
<P>
   Enigma, 1990: ``I had a few pounds of roast beef in my pants. As
well as some cookies and a hard-bound book about Jim Morrison. We
were hungry but had no money. So we thought we would just go into
the grocery store and get some food. Or as the grocery store called
it ... steal some food. Of course we got caught since I had so much
(stuff) in my pants and the other guys refused to carry anything in
their pants. I was first out the door and was almost gone when Jeff
said my name in a voice that sounded pathetic. I turn and see some
woman with her nails dug into his forearm and her legs wrapped
around his ankles. I told him to come on ... we should get out of
there. At this point I realize we are not getting out of there so I
give up. Back inside, upstairs we wait for the police. They are all
so serious, so right, so stupid. They have no eyes. Too bad they
have mouths and hands. When the police get there it is even
worse.''

Help with your taxes &HT;    By Frances Katz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service: The friendly IRS Web site opens with
the newsy Digital Daily. When we checked in, it was reminding
America that ``more than 1.6 million taxpayers who failed to file
tax returns for 1996 risk losing about $2 billion in refunds if
they don't get their late returns to the IRS'' this year. We
thought that sort of procrastination was illegal or something. The
site offers forms that can be filled in on-screen and then printed
for mailing. www.irs.ustreas.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Waste Basket: Just for fun, look here to read about what the
government does with our hard-earned money. The site is by a
watchdog group called Taxpayers for Common Sense, which monitors
proposals for federal land giveaways, boondoggles, corporate
handouts and budget gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   www.taxpayer.net/TCS/wastebasket/wbindex.html
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block: When we looked, H&AMP;R Block, the granddaddy of tax
help, told us it was having ``difficulty handling everyone trying
to use our online tax program'' and was not accepting new users for
the $9.95 service. As it turned out, the site was also dealing with
a glitch that let some visitors view other people's financial data.
Yikes! The company promised to be back up soon, though, and as an
alternative was offering its downloadable software free, along with
a coupon for $10 off at an H&AMP;R Block office.

</P>
<P>
   HD Vest Online: It's free to fill out your 1040 on this site and
zap it to the IRS. The catch? Goodbye, privacy. After you're done,
the service uses your financial information to target you with
advertising and offers. And ``if you choose to withhold the
requested information, you will not be eligible to take advantage
of certain hdvest.com services such as the free tax-calculation
program or other services.'' So there. www.hdvestonline.com/
</P>
<P>
   TurboTax: Intuit-owned TurboTax for the Web offers online
preparation of the shorter 1040EZ form for free and other forms for
$9.95 each. There's an exception, though. Returns with adjusted
gross incomes under $20,000 will also be done free, Intuit says. As
is true with most such sites, you need not do all the work in one
sitting. The site remembers who you are and lets you pick up the
process where you left off.

</P>
<P>
   123: This site confused us by proclaiming ``Online Tax Prep for
Free'' on the opening screen, then introducing the fees: $5 for
printing returns, $9.95 for an e-filing. Where does the ``free''
part come in? Oh, that's for free access to the site, ``including
FREE return calculation.'' We are still scratching our head.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
The future's bright for Future Man &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Now seems the ideal time to be a futurist.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium came with nary a bug. Technology stocks buoy the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the human being known as FM-2030 (Future Man) sound
frustrated today, even as the clear sun reflects into his
stark-white Biscayne Bay condominium?
</P>
<P>
   ``My body is at the repair shop, so unfortunately I had to
borrow this body, just so I could interact with you,'' says FM, the
name he uses in casual conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. It's future humor.
</P>
<P>
   To FM, his body is a 4 million-year-old anachronism, a primate's
body meant for swinging on trees, an inefficient and altogether too
fragile thing attached to a small, modern organ called the brain
which can ``look out billions of light years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, ready to gallop across the solar system,'' he says,
though his sick pancreas, ``a stupid, dumb, wretched organ,''
barely allows him to walk across the room.
</P>
<P>
   FM-2030 will not stay frustrated long. He's too busy
anticipating the day when scientists thaw his frozen body later
this century and transform him into a ``post-biological'' organism.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas like this _ the same ones he's been transmitting in
classes at Florida International University and his books _ still
excite him, after nearly four decades of provocative predictions.
</P>
<P>
   He teaches a class on the future, a subject he is so obsessed
with that he has taken on the persona of a futureman, a person
living decades from now. He speaks like a futureman, acts like a
futureman, thinks like a futureman and keeps it going 24 hours a
day. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for some interesting dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday, this gentle man who rolls his R's when he
calls people ``dear,'' pounds on the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are turning reality upside down, and we are saying that
death need not be final,'' he tells his class.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a loose black jacket with rolled sleeves over a black
shirt, he's about to show a short film on cryogenics to 28, largely
well-educated, adult students. Cryogenics, freezing the body until
science finds a way to cure what ails it, is but one subject FM
addressed in five weekly three-hour sessions at Miami Beach's
Wolfsonian Museum that ended last week. The inevitable end of
marriage, family, capitalism, socialism, poverty, religion and
automobile travel all took time to explain to a group of students
still very much living in the present.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE REQUIRES IMAGINATION
</P>
<P>
   Describing the future, a space FM inhabits and romances,
requires imagination, he says. One has to stretch his mind, for
example, to comprehend the ``Santa Claus Machine,'' which FM says
will work like the copy machine, only it will reproduce the
molecular structure of three-dimensional objects. This, combined
with free energy from the sun, will provide limitless resources and
eliminate competition.
</P>
<P>
   Without competition, capitalism and socialism, we will die of
irrelevance. This is, of course, the short version. But it's a good
example of his thought process: technology, already in its
formative stages, will radically change human nature once it
becomes a commonplace part of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   And because the rate of change will continue to increase,
current logic will not apply to future realities.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it in even simpler terms, the whole world will
change.
</P>
<P>
   FM's students say they're initially stunned by their prof's
ideas. But as the class goes on and they begin to analyze his
logic, they begin to appreciate the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right on in many ways,'' said Nancy Lipoff, 61, who took
the class with her husband and several friends. ``On the other
hand, for people who believe in religion and believe in tradition
and believe in preserving things for our children and
grandchildren, he doesn't fit into that mold at all.''
</P>
<P>
   No, molds do not interest FM. Though he lived in 12 or 13
countries by the time he was 17, he says has no nationality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I belong to the whole planet, and I embrace the whole
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   His ancestral origins? ``For that, you'll have to talk to my
ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   Official records _ which list him as FM, Twenty Thirty _
indicate he's 69 years old, but he won't confirm.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto, his former employment at the United Nations, mentioned in
the forward of a book he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What about the rumors that his family of international diplomats
includes former heads of state? ``I have no family,'' says FM,
explaining that networks of close friends, companions and lovers
replace traditional modes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Without the need to produce babies inside the body, children
will have multiple mothers and fathers from multiple gene pools, he
once wrote. Children from these ``mosaic births'' will be raised by
groups which might or might not be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IN A NAME?
</P>
<P>
   He knows you won't necessarily agree with him. Then again, no
one would have believed him 100 years ago if he insisted he didn't
belong to a tribe, he says. So please, ``allow me to define myself
the way I see myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he began doing in the mid-1960s, when his name was
FM Esfandiary and he began teaching about the future at the New
School for Social Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Names convey ancestry, ethnicity, the past, nationality and
religion, he says, reading from his 1989 book ``Are You
Transhuman?''
</P>
<P>
   FM wanted to evoke the future with his name. And like the world,
it will evolve. ``I will change (the name) again right before
2030,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the future is essential or one risks riding on
Interstate 95 in a horse and carriage, to use one of his favorite
analogies.
</P>
<P>
   During class, one student who is particularly skeptical of FM's
vision insists his own name is FM-2020 ``because I'm 10 years
behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   FM laughs. ``I switch on the future in total context, and that's
too much future for most people,'' he says later.
</P>
<P>
   BETTING ON A BRIGHT FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Still, FM is confident, even if his timing is premature. If he's
wrong, it's a shame for humanity, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But FM is betting his money on a bright future. He's arranged to
pay $100,000 to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation of Scottsdale,
Ariz., to preserve his body in liquid nitrogen when his body no
longer works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why risk being in the last generation to die before anti-aging
solves the life span problem?'' reads the company's pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that occurs 30, 50 or 100 years after his death, FM
plans to relish his golden years for centuries, if not millennia _
even if he has no money when he wakes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me don't give a damn. I'll be so glad that I'm
back.''

Resources aid in LAN-making Home network within reach &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Here's background on why we're taking up this space. We're
problem solvers. We investigate, figure things out, learn _
sometimes the hard way _ teach and bring new technology to the
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: We don't know it all, but we can point you to a sea of
information and help navigate. We'll teach you to fish by tapping
the Internet, reference books, your instincts and common sense to
get the most out of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You've asked lots of questions about networking two, maybe
three, home computers and sharing files and a printer. The
technology's there. Why not make sharing easier than playing pass
the floppy or Zip? Turn Dad's printer into the ``family'' printer?
Share an Internet connection? That's why we're devoting this column
to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You'll be creating your own LAN, or Local Area Network.
Impressive. If you've never heard of a LAN or need to know basic
network-speak, cruise to the Miramar Systems Inc. Networking 101
link (www.miramarsys.com
</P>
<P>
   /home/net101.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You must decide the size of your network and how much you
can spend. Some options include Ethernet, phone wire and wireless
networking. There's even a nifty power outlet deal. A quick
tutorial on Ethernet: It's a tried-and-true method of data
communication that requires a chunky cable, fatter than a phone
wire, connected from each computer Network Interface Card into a
hub (where you park devices on a LAN so they can chat). You'll have
to jump through some internal network hoops to share an Internet
connection. A place to start is the NETGEAR site (netgear
</P>
<P>
   .baynetworks.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There's the obvious, which is using your phone line. To
find out about AnyPoint from Intel, surf to www.intel.com/anypoint.
A slick wireless option is the Airport for the Macintosh
(www.apple.com/airport/). We love Macs. Wireless is where we're all
headed. No more tangles.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Breathe, Jacki. Bear in mind that wireless is costlier. A
reliable and fast wireless PC solution would be Proxim (www.proxim
.com/). Or, hey, you may like the idea of plugging into a power
outlet to create a network. No NIC installs or hubs. For
quick-and-easy, go to Intelogis (www .intelogis.com). You can share
a printer, files and an Internet connection within minutes, all at
around $200.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: For a good list of home network kits, try ZDNet
(www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2226069,00.html).
Kits have it all. Hardware and software, for as little as $90. And,
yep, you can shell out more, too. Prices vary depending on how
cutting-edge the network option, the ``plug-and-playishness'' of
the kit, who installs NICs, the type of cabling and the hub size.
The possibilities are all over the map.

Search the world for long-lost friends &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that it seems almost everyone in the world is
online, with an e-mail account and a Web page, one task is easier
than ever _ finding a friend from years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find directories and search engines made for just that
task. With any luck, you can track down that high school
sweetheart, college roommate or the fellow who borrowed that book
and never returned it.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point for your search is Switchboard.com, a
search engine that helps you find an e-mail address, as well as
telephone numbers and even street addresses. So head to
www.switchboard.com/ and select the link called People Search. Once
there, you enter as much information as you have. The only
essential item is a last name. So you could _ foolishly for sure _
search the nation for all the Smiths. You can already see that it
will help if the person you are searching for has a fairly unusual
last name. But if you can narrow the search by supplying the city
and the first name, your search should be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet people-finders work the same way. But there's a
good reason to bookmark every search engine of this type you can
find. Since there isn't a master list of all Internet users, each
search engine will have a different group of names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   So go next to Bigfoot.com, another longtime people-finder
located at www.bigfoot.com/. One really handy search feature here _
besides the one described above _ is the ability to find out a
person's name and address by entering an e-mail address. This
feature only works with those who have created a profile on
Bigfoot, so don't be disappointed if your search doesn't return any
information.
</P>
<P>
   One must in your list of people-finders is PeopleSearch.com. It
truly is different from the other sites. For one thing, this site
at www.peoplesearch.com/ uses multiple search engines to find a
person. That search is free; simply look for the link labeled Free
People Search. For another, just in case you have tried all the
other search techniques and still can't find the person, there's
even more help available. You'll pay for that help, starting at
$39, but there are times _ when a person has changed his or her
name because of marriage or just because the world is crawling with
people with that same name _ that you may need the help.
</P>
<P>
   Web pages are an excellent way to locate a person. And even if
your friend doesn't have a Web page of his own, there's a good
chance that another Web page may mention them. Businesses, schools
and social organizations often maintain directories that, at the
least, contain e-mail addresses and names of members. So use a
search engine _ AltaVista (www.altavista.com) is my choice for
searches like this because it does a good job of searching the body
of the page _ and simply enter your friend's name. Let's suppose
the name is Martha Smith. Enter it this way in AltaVista: ``Martha
Smith'' (include the quote marks). That is how you tell the search
engine to return only pages that contain those two names in that
exact order. If you don't do that you'll find every Martha, every
Smith, a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check the newsgroups. This is a subset of the Net where
people post messages according to topic areas. To find out if your
friend has left a message there (it will contain an e-mail address)
use this page _ which contains a variety of newsgroup search
engines _ at www.lycos.com/computers/internet/newsgroups.html.

Get allergy alert at Pollen.com &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trees are blooming. Bushes are budding. For a certain percentage
of the population, the signs of spring provoke a pressing question:
``Is it safe to go out of the house?''
</P>
<P>
   A newly launched Web site hopes to make spring and fall a little
easier for allergy sufferers. Using your ZIP code, Pollen.com
generates a free local forecast of probable pollen counts for the
next four days. It classifies the days in the forecast as low,
medium or high risk, and lists the plants most likely to be
releasing pollen for the length of the forecast. (Last week, for
instance, it ranked Decatur's Courthouse Square as medium-to-high
risk, with maple, alder and cedar tree pollen causing the most
trouble.) If you register _ which is not required to obtain a
four-day forecast _ Pollen.com will also send you e-mail alerts
warning when certain types of pollen are expected to reach
troublesome levels locally.
</P>
<P>
   The site is the creation of a Pennsylvania company called
Surveillance Data Inc., a private research concern whose
subsidiaries specialize in environmental modeling and manufacture
pollen-counting equipment. The company claims that its proprietary
computer models put the site's usefulness ahead of similar ones
such as the very informative National Allergy Bureau
(www.aaaai.org/nab/default.stm), which reports pollen counts but
does not predict them. Relatively new, Pollen.com has an
uncomplicated design, offers several links to allergy information
sites and is refreshingly free of advertising.

DOCTORS AND PATIENTS SAY THE INTERNET HAS CHANGED THEIR 
RELATIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Victoria Schlesinger had a puzzling rash on her face,
so she visited her doctor to ask what it was. The doctor told her
she might have lupus, but declined to elaborate.
 &HT;    ``She said, `Let's not talk about it until we know,'''
Schlesinger said, a remark that only served to terrify her. ``I
walked out of there thinking, `This can't be good.'''
 &HT;    Schlesinger, 31, the chief counsel for the Teligent
communications company in Vienna, Va., had never heard of lupus and
was too intimidated to press her doctor for more information. But,
like more and more patients in recent years, she also knew she had
another resource. She went to her computer, typed in ``lupus'' and
clicked.
 &HT;    The Web sites that popped up were unsparing in their details
about the disease, which is caused when the body's immune system
attacks a patient's tissues and organs. While lupus can range from
very mild to life threatening, Schlesinger found descriptions that
emphasized the grim outcomes.
 &HT;    ``I will tell you, I was pretty shocked,'' Schlesinger said. ``I
looked up this thing they thought I had and I saw things like,
`survival rates.'''
 &HT;    She turned out not to have the disease. But partly because of
her doctor's dismissive remarks, she also ended up changing
physicians.
 &HT;    In interviews, doctors and patients say the Internet has
profoundly changed their relationships. With an estimated 100,000
medical Web sites, patients can look up any disease, drug or
medical condition in seconds. When a doctor so much as mentions a
possible diagnosis, many patients rush to their computers to learn
more about it. When a doctor suggests a drug, patients go online to
find its side effects. And when they arrive at their doctor's
office, more and more patients are bearing pages of information
printed from Web sites.
 &HT;    ``It's a massive revolution,'' said Dr. Rita Charon, a
specialist in internal medicine at Columbia University's College of
Physicians and Surgeons. ``It altogether shifts what goes on when a
patient comes in with pages of downloaded stuff and half the time
the doctor looking at it has never seen it before. There's a whole
new set of emotions present.''
 &HT;    The situation is complicated by time constraints on doctors who
are part of managed care groups, said Prof. E. Haavi Morreim, an
ethicist at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine.
 &HT;    ``A lot of patients come in with this sheaf of papers,'' Morreim
said. ``A lot of it may be completely irrelevant, or it may be bad
information _ who knows what you're getting off the Net. Now the
physician has to spend a lot of time sifting through this stuff and
explaining. The physician either resents spending the time or truly
doesn't have the time. Then the patient may feel he is being given
short shrift.''
 &HT;    Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, a general practitioner from Portland,
Ore., who is president of the American Medical Association, said
that while ``we do support patients having access to good,
reliable, information,'' the problem is that the information on the
Internet varies from sound to irresponsible. ``Right now, anybody
can put anything on the Internet,'' Reardon said.
 &HT;    In a statement the medical association warns, ``The AMA is
greatly concerned that a substantial proportion of information on
the Internet might be inaccurate, erroneous, misleading or
fraudulent and thereby pose a threat to public health.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Reardon said, doctors are going to have to adjust.
``I think this is the wave of the future,'' he said.
 &HT;    Web sites include those sponsored by responsible groups like the
National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association as
well as ones run by purveyors of herbs and supplements or of
unproven treatments like coffee enemas for cancer.
 &HT;    They include sites put up by hospitals and medical centers
looking for business and by individual doctors, some of whom
provide links to articles in medical journals and others who say
they have secret cures. They also include countless chat rooms for
patients, their families and the worried. More sites are added each
day, like one to be available soon run by a company formed by the
American Medical Association and six doctors associations.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As Schlesinger discovered, those who search for medical
information soon find themselves buried in it. And some find
themselves duped, doctors say.
 &HT;    Some fields, like plastic surgery, are almost magnets for
misinformation, doctors said. ``There is so much plastic surgery on
the Net,'' said Dr. I. Kelman Cohen, a plastic surgeon at the
Medical College of Virginia of Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond. ``Look younger, look beautiful, have a peel at lunch and
go out shopping in the afternoon.''
 &HT;    One highly educated woman went to see a doctor who advertises
widely on the Internet that he does plastic surgery. The man is
actually an oral surgeon, Cohen noted. ``He says he is board
certified, but he doesn't say in what,'' Cohen said. The woman
wanted plastic surgery for her eyelids. Cohen said she ended up
needing a skin graft from his group to repair the operation by the
oral surgeon.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Many patients check out the Internet before they go to their
doctors, deciding sometimes what they think their condition is or
what drugs they need or what drugs they would refuse to take.
Doctors can be taken aback.
 &HT;    ``Some doctors deal well with it, some don't,'' Reardon said.
 &HT;    Some doctors make no pretense of being interested in the
Internet data of their patients. Dr. Albert Kligman, a dermatology
professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, says he
knows what is about to happen when he sees a patient carrying in a
pile of printouts from Web sites.
 &HT;    ``They say, `Doctor, I have a few questions,''' Kligman said.
``Then they take out about 200 of them. I tell them: `I only have
12 minutes. I can examine you or I can answer your questions. Make
up your mind.'''
 &HT;    Other doctors say that even though they may become frustrated
when patients look up every symptom, every diagnosis, every medical
test and every drug on the Internet, the information can sometimes
do more good than harm.
 &HT;    Dr. Michael Lockshin, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for
Special Surgery in Manhattan, said: ``I've had a bunch of people
say, `I've been chasing down my symptoms, and this is what I think
it is, and my doctor hasn't paid attention to me.' About 50 percent
of the time when I see patients like that, they're correct.''
 &HT;    But more often doctors say they are peeved by the new demands
being placed on them, frustrated in their efforts to convince
patients that a prescription drug is not a poison or that a new
treatment detailed on the Internet is not proven and annoyed when
patients tend to believe that the information from the Web is right
and their doctor is wrong.
 &HT;    ``If they take a drug and they have a lousy response to it, they
will go to a Web page that says it's a poison,'' said Dr. Alan
DeCherney, an infertility expert at the University of California in
Los Angeles. ``You send them to the reputable pages, but they don't
want that. They don't listen because it's not what they want to
hear.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Some patients and their families, however, tell a different
story.
 &HT;    Erin Goldstein, legal recruiter for the McCormick Group in
Arlington Va., said the Internet was the first place she turned
when doctors diagnosed a brain tumor in her mother last year.
 &HT;    ``I was feeding in keywords as fast as I could,'' Goldstein
said. It was terrifying, at first, she said, adding: ``Everything
you read says, `prognosis very poor,' `traditional protocols
showing little effect.'''
 &HT;    But, she said, when her mother's biopsy results came back,
Goldstein at least knew what they meant, and she was able to focus
her Internet research.
 &HT;    ``It didn't take me quite as much by storm,'' she said. ``I
think you get panicky when you don't understand.'' Her father,
Goldstein said, ``wanted to defer to the doctor's expertise, but
that really wasn't sufficient for me.''
 &HT;    Armed with her Internet research, she said, she peppered her
father with questions: ``Why did the doctor choose this over that?
I know there are these five protocols. Why aren't they doing a
different surgery? Why why why why why?'' She also questioned
doctors she found on the Internet. ``I go to doctors online to sort
of hone the information I have read,'' Goldstein said.
 &HT;    She stayed in touch with relatives of other brain cancer
patients through Internet chat groups, finding their experience and
expertise immeasurably helpful.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cathy Flanagan, a 35-year-old lupus patient in Manhattan, said
she regularly went to the Internet to learn about her disease and
to share experiences with others who were taking the same drugs and
who, like Flanagan, had a particularly severe form of lupus.
 &HT;    ``Some of the medications we take have horrible side effects,''
Flanagan said. ``It's nice to be able to chat with someone else who
has it.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Others say they turn to the Internet to learn what their medical
test results mean. When John Franz, a 42-year-old engineer who
lives in Moorestown, N.J., discovered that he had an unusual
pattern of blood cholesterol, he immediately turned to the
Internet. He went to his doctor to discuss his research, but Franz
said, ``He didn't think it was important.'' So Franz changed
doctors.
 &HT;    ``Patients now have an active role,'' Franz said. ``With managed
care you almost have to. It's up to you now, and if the doctor's
not going to support that, you don't have to be involved with
them.''

FINDING, AND JUDGING, ADVICE ONLINE 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Medical experts say the most trustworthy Web sites are those run
by the federal government, like http://www.nih.gov, and by national
organizations like the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those sites, however, experts say there are guidelines
and even Web sites that can help individuals decide whether to
trust an electronic site.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association suggests checking the source of
the information and the financing for the site in judging its
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs include sites that seem to be promoting products
or that offer miraculous treatments or cures. The association also
says to check how often the information is updated and who reviews
it.
</P>
<P>
   Other advice comes from Dr. Ragnar Levi of the Swedish Council
on Technology Assessment in Health Care, who recently analyzed the
problem of determining the quality of information on Web sites.
Writing in the current issue of the magazine Skeptical Inquirer,
Levi notes that a Web site by the Health on the Net Foundation, a
nonprofit group in Geneva,
http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/HONcode(underscore)check.html, provides a
checklist of questions that can help people assess a site's
credibility.

A CREDIBILITY GAP IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest buzzphrase circulating among politicians and computer
industry executives these days is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. Poor people and minorities, or so the thinking
goes, are in danger of being shut out of what promises to be the
most important mode of gathering and exchanging information, and
what is emerging as a common way of making and spending lots of
money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, there is a growing recognition among those
dealing most closely with the issue that the term digital divide,
while clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for
politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a
complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that the nation is actually facing a
multitude of digital divides, not one limited to race or income or
education. While it is true that millions of people are still
without access to computers or the Internet, those who are counted
as connected fall along a spectrum: Some are dialing into the
Internet through antiquated rural phone lines that cannot handle
high data speeds, while others use ultra high-speed connections
from both work and home. Millions of others are getting their
connection only occasionally from public libraries, classrooms or
community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a busy time for those in the digital
bridge-building business. First, Vice President Al Gore visited a
San Francisco nonprofit group to deliver a speech on the divide.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson opened a branch of his
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Silicon Valley, with the goal of closing
the divide among the poor. The same day, Jackson delivered a speech
at the University of California at Berkeley in which he pronounced
access to technology ``the newest stage of the civil rights
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, results of a survey conducted by National Public
Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government corroborated earlier studies that
found that at higher income levels there is virtually no racial
gap. More good news: Of those who bought computers in the last two
years, about one-third are from low-income or minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the survey found a persistent racial divide among
low-income households when it comes to computer ownership and
Internet access at home.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings may not spell out the problem as much as help
reveal its thorniness. It helps to start by looking at the ways in
which people connect to the Internet. Plenty of people have
connections at work, but some of them are not wired at home. In
addition, connecting to the Internet from work, a library or school
is quite different from connecting from the privacy of one's living
room. Experts say that the only way to fully appreciate the Web is
to experience it and that the most useful experience, unfettered by
the constraints of an institutional setting, comes with using the
Internet from home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a high-speed cable modem connection gives a
Web surfer a far different view of cyberspace _ one that's
lightning quick and rich with sound and motion _ than that seen via
a slower link from a traditional modem.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, much of the digital bridge-building has focused on
schools. At first blush, the gap there doesn't seem especially
alarming. According to Market Data Retrieval, a company that has
surveyed the nation's public schools, 94 percent of schools in
wealthy districts have access to the Internet, compared with 84
percent of schools that serve poor populations.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are deceptive. ``Those numbers fail to address
the nature of those connections,'' David Gollaher, chief executive
of the California Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit group in La
Jolla, Calif., told a group of health care experts who gathered
last week at Berkeley to discuss the digital divide and e-health
(industry shorthand for the delivery of health information and
services on the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the poorer schools, Gollaher said, connect to the
Internet using a relatively slow 56 kilobit-per-second connection,
which may be fine for sending e-mail but prevents a large
population of potential users from experiencing the full scope and
power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gollaher later said it was not until he got a high-speed
connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the
Web. ``They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio
stations online,'' he said. ``Many of the uses they prefer are uses
that depend on high-speed connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital
divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a
greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and
have-nots, though the two are often connected.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR survey disproved that claim with a finding that among
households of all income levels, 57 percent of whites under the age
of 60 have Internet or e-mail access from home, compared with 38
percent of blacks. In households where income is less than $30,000
a year, the study found, 34 percent of whites have access from
home, compared with 19 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   That divide narrows drastically when online access takes place
outside the home, especially in the workplace. ``The gap largely
disappears everywhere except at home,'' said Molly Brodie, a vice
president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who oversaw the NPR
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you start to look a little deeper, you see that the
biggest problem is at home,'' said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of
management at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a 1998
study with results similar to those in the NPR survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can understand what it can do for you
unless you use it,'' she said of the Internet. ``You have to try
it, then you can see the meaning it can have in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting to the Internet from outside the home makes having
such an experience more difficult, she said. ``I just think it's
very hard to do that when you have a 30-minute limit, or when you
have to wait in line, or with others around.''
</P>
<P>
   David Greenbaum, a researcher at Berkeley who works with
community groups in Oakland to address the digital divide, suspects
that the problem of access from home might be one of cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One premise that underlies all of this is that if someone had
the right kind of access at home, they'd be much more involved in
the whole wired and online world,'' Greenbaum said. ``But if they
already had the impulse and interest to be part of that world, then
they'd have the kind of motivation to have a machine at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the NPR survey found no significant difference
between whites and blacks at low-income levels when it came to
owning other home electronics, like cable television and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said that at a recent digital divide conference in
Oakland, a number of people asked: ``Why is it people are willing
to spend $500 on a big wide-screen TV? How can we instill that same
kind of economic pull to a desire to being online?''

ONLINE `NAPSTER' SERVICE SCARES MUSIC INDUSTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the local alternative rock station listed the 300 top songs
of the millennium in December, Adam Campbell, a freshman at the
University of Oregon, decided it would be nice to own the entire
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, using the fast Internet connection in his dorm
room and a new online service called Napster, Campbell had
retrieved 275 of the tunes _free. They sit nestled on his computer
hard drive along with 800 or so other songs he has accumulated the
same way. ``That's three days of continuous music,'' he notes with
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry is already disturbed about how easy it is to
copy music via the Internet without paying for it. But in recent
months Napster has greatly magnified the threat. Acting like a
music search engine, the software makes it easier to find and copy
a far wider array of music. It also makes it easier for individuals
to offer their own music collections to others.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, created last year by a 19-year-old college dropout, has
spread so quickly among college students, traditionally the most
avid consumers of recorded music, that the resulting glut of
digital traffic has overloaded university networks. Dozens of
schools, including New York University and the University of
California at Berkeley, have banned students from using the service
_ not because of copyright issues but to protect their networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Napster is by no means just a college fad. Every day, about
a million otherwise law-abiding adult citizens are demonstrating no
compunction about using the service to get free what they would
have to pay for in a record store. And their numbers are growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America filed
a lawsuit against Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.,
seeking damages and an injunction that would effectively shut down
the service. Napster argues that it is not liable for music piracy
since the service does not keep any of the music files on its own
servers. The company says that its software simply allows people to
share information. And many of the songs that are traded have been
authorized for copying by the copyright holders.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry says it has no plans to prosecute
individual users of Napster, although copyright experts say the
industry would have a very strong case. The ``fair use'' doctrine
of copyright law gives consumers the right to make copies of CDs
they own for their personal use, and plenty of music fans make
tapes or even create a duplicate CD for friends without punishment.
But Napster complicates matters because it makes copying possible
at a much greater order of magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of that case, the popular embrace of
Napster has sharpened fears among record industry executives and
some artists that the Internet will undermine the control of
copyright holders over the distribution of their music.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the case is being closely watched by television
and movie executives, who see it as a glimpse into the future of
their own industries. While high-quality video files are currently
too large to be sent quickly over most Internet connections,
high-speed, or broadband, services will soon expose other media to
the opportunities and threats posed by digital distribution.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, a technology known as MP3 has allowed
computer users to compress music into files that are close to CD
quality yet small enough to travel quickly over the Internet. But
there has not been an easy way to find such music and then make it
available to others.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of people use free or inexpensive ``ripping''
software to convert their CDs to MP3 format so they can trade music
with friends or listen to their own music on their computers.
Partly because it is probably illegal and partly because it
requires some technical expertise, few take the trouble to make
those MP3 files available for others to download.
</P>
<P>
   Napster essentially gives everyone who uses the software access
to all the MP3 files on everyone's computers that they are willing
to share. Napster's own servers simply compile a giant, constantly
updated index of all the music available from its users. Users
simply type in the song title or name of the artist they are
looking for, and Napster generates a list of other users who
already have it. (A search Monday for Korn, Santana, and the
Beatles song ''Hey Jude,'' for instance, each yielded more than 100
results). Clicking on one of the selections automatically copies
the file from one user's hard drive to the other's. By linking
thousands of personal computers into a kind of pirates'
cooperative, Napster creates an enormous and continually expanding
library of song titles from which its users can pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got Napster, it was just crazy,'' said Campbell of the
University of Oregon, who had previously sought MP3 files on Web
sites or from friends by e-mail. ``It's much more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster's supporters argue that the music industry needs to
adapt to the digital world and must accept that it cannot continue
making huge profits from traditional retail sales of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say that because the music business is structured the
way it is structured, that's the way it should always be
structured?'' said Stewart Alsop, a well-known venture capitalist
in Silicon Valley who is considering investing in the company
recently formed by Napster's developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I believe the new model is a better way for artists to
operate, that is a moral justification for feeling good about
investing in Napster,'' Alsop said, ``even though technically what
they're doing is facilitating illegal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The record industry counters that if copyrights are not
protected on the Internet, artists will have no incentive to create
new work. Moreover, the Recording Industry Association of America
sees a crucial distinction between Napster and previous copying
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between you sharing a CD with a friend
versus opening up your entire CD collection to everybody in the
world to take whatever they want,'' said Carey Sherman, the
industry association's senior executive vice president and general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But within the music industry there is also a growing
recognition of a cultural battle that cannot be won in the courts.
If today's teen-agers are growing up with the perception that music
is something that can be had free, the industry fears, copyright
laws will become effectively unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible disconnect out there between what is
normal behavior in the physical world versus the online world,''
Sherman said. ``There are people who think nothing of downloading
entire CD collections on Napster who wouldn't dream of shoplifting
from Tower Records. There's just a massive education program that's
needed here for people to understand what goes into the creation of
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Napster users argue that slashing CD prices might be a
better defense than lawsuits and consumer education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think the record companies need the money,''
said Raquel Poy, 18, a freshman at the State University of New York
at Albany. She was using Napster to download James Brown's ``Play
That Funky Music, White Boy'' while conducting a telephone
interview last week. ``If I were to go out and buy a CD every
single time I wanted to listen to something, I would go completely
broke. They charge so much for CDs that something like this is a
godsend. They should either lower the price of CDs or make this
legal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The industry recognizes that suing consumers for copyright
violations would be counterproductive, which is why the recording
industry aims at services like Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fastest ways to turn potential customers off is to
say they're all a bunch of thieves,'' said Pam Samuelson, a
copyright law expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
``You start hating your customers and your customers are going to
start hating you back, and that doesn't bode well for your ability
to attract them to buy more stuff from you. It makes them more
inclined to infringe rather than buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Napster makes no money at this point, interested
investors say there is potentially significant value in the large
base of music fans the service has already attracted. For example,
Napster could collect subscription fees from its users or persuade
record labels to use the service as a marketing vehicle, or it
could become an e-commerce outlet for CDs and other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   As a computer science student at Northeastern University in
Boston last year, Shawn Fanning conceived of Napster as a way to
get his roommate to stop complaining about how hard it was to find
the MP3 files he was looking for on the Internet. His solution was
a cooperative model.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software, which is downloaded free from the
service's Web site, automates the whole process of cataloging,
indexing and enabling the transfer of music files, even though its
own computers hold no music files at all.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning, who was nicknamed Napster in junior high school because
of his ``nappy hair,'' is trying to turn the service into a
business, financed with money from his uncle and other investors,
including Eileen Richardson, a veteran venture capitalist who is
acting as the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Napster prevails in the association's lawsuit, its
business model is vague. Paradoxically, its potentially most
valuable product would be the data it aggregates on consumers'
musical tastes and listening habits _ a potential marketing gold
mine for the very record industry that is suing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson argues that Napster actually spurs CD sales by
enabling users to sample artists with whom they might not otherwise
be familiar, often resulting in the purchase of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has declared a desire to work with the industry to
promote new artists, but that may not be likely at a time when many
record executives liken the service to the getaway car at thousands
of crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The motley crew of staff members at Napster's headquarters in
San Mateo prefer to compare the program to the early days of the
VCR. When the movie industry tried to prevent Sony from selling its
Betamax machine because it could be used to make illegal copies of
videocassettes, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Sony, because
the machine could be used for a legitimate purpose. In the end, the
spread of VCRs resulted in enormous extra profits for the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a few of the MP3 files traded with Napster's
assistance have the blessing of their copyright holders. But the
overwhelming majority of Napster's users would appear to be acting
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Napster is supposed to remove the accounts of those
it knows to be distributing copyrighted material. But the company
argues that it is not responsible for what its users do with its
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are going to do what consumers are going to do,''
said Elizabeth Brooks, the company's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto investors. Several high-profile Silicon Valley venture
capital firms have expressed serious interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, most Napster users say they simply do
not believe they are doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Werner, 37, of Oxford, Conn., says he uses Napster to get
digital files of the records that he bought in the 1970s but can no
longer play for lack of a turntable. ``I bought the right to listen
to King Crimson 15 years ago,'' Werner said. ``I'm just making a
digital copy of what I have in my closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff, a 43-year-old Napster user from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.,
asked that only his first name be used because he knew that, say,
listening to the Grammy-winning Santana single ``Smooth'' on MP3
instead of paying $5 for it might be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how illegal is it, really?'' wondered Jeff, who owns a
small office-cleaning business. ``Is it illegal if you go three
miles over the speed limit? We used to have a road here and the
speed limit was 55, and that was crazy. There was never any
traffic, and everybody went 70, and finally they just changed the
speed limit. So yeah, you're breaking the law, but how big a law is
it?''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Books, cars, and mutual funds are already hawked
online, so why not pitch a congressman or two?
</P>
<P>
   That's the aim of about a dozen new Web sites calling themselves
``democracy portals'' and hoping to turn politics into a lucrative
e-commerce application.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of politicians already have sites of their own, to raise
money and to turn out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the democracy portals are drawing users with their own
polls, news stories, and bipartisan e-mail debates. And they are
developing high-tech plans to sell their access to potential voters
to the candidates and political parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when all politics is marketing, election pros love the
formula.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Voter.com of Boston has signed promotional
agreements with everyone from the Democratic Leadership Council and
the AFL-CIO to the Christian Coalition and the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A rival, Grassroots.com, is targeting local races around the
country, with advice from former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu
and a content deal with the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other entrants include SpeakOut.com, Vote.com, and Voxcap.com.
</P>
<P>
   These for-profit companies all declare they want the Internet to
be an engine of public discourse. But by tracking voters' interests
and e-mail addresses, the sites also expect to build up databases
better than those kept by any political organization to date.
</P>
<P>
   The portals won't share their data with outsiders, but they will
make use of the information as middlemen, their owners say,
channelling e-mail pitches from candidates to users who have
expressed interest in certain causes.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to help candidates better target supporters and lower
the cost of campaigns _ blending the lofty goal of increasing voter
participation with a big dose of dot-com commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a cost of thousands of dollars, the services the Web
companies could provide to candidates would be far cheaper than the
television and radio ads that dominate campaigns today. And in
theory they would allow a deeper discussion of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the public, there's a tremendous frustration with the
existing tools'' of politics, said Justin Dangel, Voter.com's
25-year-old founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Television spots are too brief and expensive to allow candidates
to talk about complex matters like health care and education, he
said, while much news coverage focuses on campaign tactics, not
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``No campaign in America will tell you they're happy with the
level of distribution of their issue information,'' said Lawrence
Purpuro, who oversees online efforts for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Purpuro has signed deals with several of the independent portals
since December, in hopes of reaching potential voters who might not
register themselves on sites run by the RNC or the Republican Party
itself.
</P>
<P>
   While the party has a database of 120 million voters, it has
e-mail addresses for just a small fraction of them, Purpuro said,
and needs to build up its electronic contact list to cut its
communication costs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, e-mail has reduced the RNC's fax budget from $25,000 to
$7,000 a month, he said. ``We've made it clear we need to go
digital or die, but how we get there is unclear,'' Purpuro said.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and parties have made broad use of the Internet
since the 1998 election cycle, and major Internet and media
companies pump a massive amount of political news and analysis onto
their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the political sites draw mainly hard-core party
loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the new portals hope to attract more of the swing
voters who decide most elections, then summarize and deliver their
views to politicians and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Celmer, one of the investors in SpeakOut.com, calls it ``the
aggregation of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The packaging of information on electronic visitors begins when
users log in. Many online companies are keen to collect credit card
and Social Security numbers, but the democracy portals often ask
for a person's ZIP code, party affiliation and whether they are
registered to vote, all of which can help politicians target
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Next, many of the portals ask users to specify a few issues they
care most about, such as civil rights, the environment, or crime,
and suggest that users take a brief quiz on each area. The data
amount to a rough ideological and demographic profile of each user.
</P>
<P>
   After providing the information, visitors to Voter.com can then
call up a section called ``My Officials,'' customized by ZIP code.
A user from Dorchester, for instance, would see links to officials
from President Clinton down to the local state representative,
Democrat John A. Hart.
</P>
<P>
   These links don't generate revenue, but Voter.com collects fees
from politicians who want to display more information about
themselves. Currently these include Hillary Clinton, running for
Senate from New York, and Jon Gordon, seeking a congressional seat
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats pay several hundred dollars a month. That's
hardly a significant outlay; Gordon said he plans to spend $1
million if he wins his party's nomination, primarily on broadcast
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Voter.com thinks it can make money on volume, hoping to sign
up virtually every one of thousands of candidates seeking state or
federal office this year. That could generate enough revenue to
make it profitable by 2001, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Other revenue sources include building home pages for candidates
and collecting online contributions, in return for a percentage of
the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who once lived in Natick, said television ads are still
more important than exposure on the Web, but that may change in
several years. ``The big opportunity here (online) is to reduce the
targetting cost,'' of reaching swing voters who might not go to the
polls otherwise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Voter.com hopes to provide its services to people
running for local councils and school boards, a market it estimates
at more than 100,000 candidates nationwide. To help build trust
across party and ideological lines, it has hired executives like
Randy Tate, former head of the Christian Coalition, and Craig
Smith, former manager of Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to turn politics into e-commerce worries observers like
Michael Cornfield, a political scientist at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   He's made ``a little antsy'' by what he calls ``the
commercialization of citizen communications.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cornfield said he doubts most of the sites will draw much of
an audience. ``For all but a handful of junkies, politics is an
occasional interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses aim to prove him wrong, by showing they can
expand the market for political talk and lowering communications
costs for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we're solving is making political communication
more efficient,'' said Voter.com's Dangel.

CMGI'S LATEST CATCH: A WEB SITE TO LAND FISH BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BETH HEALY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Check out the latest catch in CMGI Inc.'s net: GoFish.com, an
online seafood marketplace, where a fisherman in Thailand can sell
shrimp to an American grocer.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI is making a $12 million venture capital investment in the
year-old company, which is Maine's leading Web business and a
frontrunner in the move toward Web-based seafood sales. CMGI is
based in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The deal wraps up GoFish's second round of financing and gives
it a big headstart over rivals, with a total of $41 million in
venture backing since August.
</P>
<P>
   For CMGI (at)Ventures, this is a pure B2B play, and the money's
coming from the firm's new $1 billion business-to-business fund.
CMGI partner Marc Poirier points out that the wholesale seafood
market is $80 billion strong in the United States and Europe alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that's well-suited to the Internet,'' Poirier
says. ``It's information-sensitive and it's time-sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI expects no less than for GoFish to be the number one online
seafood market for wholesalers. Their advantage, he says, is their
management and history as a credit-rating service to the seafood
business. Chief executive Neal Workman has been in that arena since
1985, when he founded a collection agency for New England
lobstermen. Last year, he decided to turn his SeaFax Inc. into a
Web business, and to expand from credit checks to handling the
actual buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   The company's focus is at the high-price end of the seafood
business. That means crab, shrimp, live lobsters, salmon, and
scallops. The site brings fisherman from Thailand to Equador to the
table with importers and exporters, supermarket chains like
Hannaford Brothers and Stop &AMP; Shop, and large restaurant groups.
</P>
<P>
   GoFish provides real-time prices on seafood. It also offers
credit checks and a collection service to guarantee that sellers
get paid. Since going live in November, $2 million worth of sales
have been conducted on the site. Daily visits to the site exceed
1,300.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to grow those numbers quickly, as it adds
auctions and receivables financing (courtesy of investor GE
Capital) by summer. The draw for users, GoFish says, is to save
money and time.
</P>
<P>
   Explains David Weatherbie, chief operating officer at GoFish:
``Seafood is sourced all over the world, and it can change hands
four to six times before reaching the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``On our site, you can have access to key market
information on pricing and supplies _ information you need to make
important business decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   As with all good ideas on the Web, one is never alone. Nipping
at GoFish's heels are sites like fishmonger.com and
GlobalFoodExchange.com. The latter just hooked $12.2 million in
seed financing, led by Charles River Ventures in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Every VC figures he or she has found the best of the players in
a given field. Charles River partner Jonathan Guerster says they
liked GlobalFood Exchange because ``we'd rather back the bigger
category.'' He thinks GoFish may be too narrow a business model.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's Poirier stands behind the GoFish pick: ``I think they're
far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   They and hundreds of other seafood-related companies will get to
strut their stuff this week at the International Boston Seafood
Show. The world's biggest gathering of fish industry folks will be
at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center from Tuesday
through Thursday.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOLORES KONG   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've read their advice in best-selling books or heard it on
television or radio. Now, you can log on to financial advisers' Web
pages to find their latest words of wisdom, plus information about
their upcoming public appearances, favorite Internet links, even
their theme songs and movie ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Using their names plus a .com for their Web addresses, everyone
from author Suze Orman to ``Wall Street Week'' host Louis Rukeyser
to economist Ed Yardeni now has a home page.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, self-promotion is inherent in having an Internet
site named after yourself. And some of the pages are a little thin
on content, while others may be too technical for the average
investor. In an age of celebrity, though, these sites may be giving
the public exactly what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   And with everyone talking about the Internet and the stock
market and investing, the sites may also be giving the public what
it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any personal finance site that can teach an investor any
important lesson about planning for (the) future is of great
value,'' said Dan Burke, a senior analyst who rates online
brokerages for Gomez Advisors, of Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which on its own site, www.Gomez.com, bills itself
as the ``e-commerce authority,'' has not assessed financial
advisers' individual sites. But Gomez has rated sites for banking,
brokerage services, home buying, insurance, and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   With any financial advice or information from the Web, though,
consumers and investors need to remember that they must do their
own research and weigh the merits of what's being said _ and why
it's being said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial advisers' sites usually fill you in on their
latest books and newsletters and let you know about TV appearances,
radio broadcasts, or speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Most also allow you to e-mail a personal finance or investment
question, and they may feature some quirky personal information
about the advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are some useful features on the various
sites, such as online calculators, economic data, and links to
information about everything from charitable giving to college
savings to the latest market news. Plus you get insight into the
person's thinking about IRAs, taxes, and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't necessarily find all the sophisticated tools and
information that are offered on a comprehensive site, such as
www.Quicken.com or Microsoft's www.MoneyCentral.msn.com.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a roundup of some of the financial advisers' sites:
</P>
<P>
   --www.andrewtobias.com _ One of the best parts is a
sophisticated mutual fund calculator that lets you estimate the
bite that taxes and expenses take out of a mutual fund investment
in a taxable account, based on the fund's real-world costs.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, author of ``The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need''
and other books, writes an almost-daily online column. Recent
topics include the difficulty of short-selling (in the context of a
stock he recommended and still owns) and saving for children's
college educations.
</P>
<P>
   --www.suzeorman.com _ With a different photo of Orman on almost
every page, plus information about her books, tapes, and upcoming
speaking engagements, this site appears primarily geared to those
who are already fans of her bestsellers, ``The Courage to Be Rich''
and ``The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom.'' But Orman, a certified
financial planner, does provide useful links to other sites that
offer information about charitable giving, mutual funds, credit
counseling services, life insurance, and retirement planning.
</P>

   --www.jonathanpond.com _ The least technically advanced and
slick of the sites reviewed, this one, by the nationally known
Boston-based financial planner and public television and radio
commentator, promises ``to give you the best and most up-to-date
financial guidance.'' Primarily, the site provides information
about his books, videos, newsletter, and public TV appearances. But
Pond also answers e-mail questions on such topics as the danger of
jointly holding property and 401(k) vs. Roth IRA. And there are
useful links to college and estate-planning sites.

to company conference calls and stock market news, excerpts from
Brinker's Marketimer newsletter, and a listing of all the radio
stations that carry his show. Brinker also offers an online
discussion group, a list of the states that don't tax income,

REVENGE OF THE RETAIL GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The upstarts at Amazon.com, the Web's biggest retailer, still
can't resist taking jabs at the online efforts of the nation's
biggest retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them? During the past two Christmas shopping
seasons, traditional merchants have bumbled online, irritating
consumers with frequent site crashes, delivery problems, and Web
stores as cluttered as suburban yard sales.
</P>
<P>
   But this may be the year the laughs end. There are signs the
brick-and-mortar retailing giants have begun to figure out the Web
and are ready to give their online-only rivals a cyberspace
spanking.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers have ``smelled the coffee,'' said Seema
Williams, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The recent online successes of Gap Inc., outdoors-goods retailer
REI, and even Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. are starting to get noticed in
the electronic marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Although virtual businesses still top the charts in many
categories, old-line merchants such as Victoria's Secret, Office
Depot Inc., and Best Buy Co. Inc. posted large visitor growth rates
at their Internet stores in December, according to a survey by
Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Even some traditional retailers that have had online problems in
the past can no longer be ignored. With powerful brands, they drew
large crowds of online shoppers last year. And they didn't have to
spend millions on advertising to get consumers to recognize their
names.
</P>
<P>
   It may be mammoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc., until recently a
sleeping presence online, that poses the biggest threat to
Internet-only retailers, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see the big discounters and mass
merchandisers come online,'' said Todd Canfield, an analyst with
Gomez Advisors. ``I would be concerned if someone like Amazon was
not worried. And the smaller players and those behind the curve
should be more worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some stumbles, many old-line retailers showed surprising
strength during the 1999 holiday season, said Mike May, an analyst
with the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. ``They
emerged online, and in some cases, surpassed industry watchers'
expectations,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is not yet stiff enough to still the sniping of
the online leaders, however. In a video appearance at a Harvard
Business School conference last month, Jeff Bezos, the cherubic
founder of Web giant Amazon.com Inc., said rival Barnes &AMP; Noble had
a better chance of building a chain of hardware stores in the past
than a thriving Internet bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that ``both sell books, so they must be similar''
does not fly in the new economy, Bezos maintained.
</P>
<P>
   For years, executives at many of the nation's largest retail
chains have boasted that they could easily make the transition to
the Web. They argued that strong brands, large customer bases,
marketing experience, and existing supplier relationships gave them
an edge over Internet-only firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can catch up very quickly,'' said Terry Burman,
chief executive of Sterling Jewelers Inc., which plans to create an
e-commerce site some time in the future. ``I don't think the
learning curve is very steep.''
</P>
<P>
   The virtual retailers don't buy it. They contend the lumbering
old-line merchants failed to grasp electronic commerce from the
start. As recently as two years ago, some big retailers were still
pooh-poohing the idea of selling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce evolved much quicker than anticipated. And in
categories like computers, books, and music, online sales picked up
so fast that traditional retailers were forced to speed up their
e-commerce efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even migrating to the Web have been items that were never
thought to be easy sells online because of their bulkiness,
expense, and touch-and-feel requirements. Shoppers can now purchase
refrigerators from Sears.com, Anne Klein dresses from
Neimanmarcus.com, and sleigh beds from furniture.com.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, Forrester predicts that online retail sales will
skyrocket to $184 billion, or 7 percent of all US retail sales,
from only $20 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers want a big chunk of those online sales.
And some have already become the leaders in their categories.
</P>
<P>
   Superstore operator PetSmart Inc., for one, had online revenue
of $7.8 million the fourth quarter of last year. Rival pets.com, a
virtual retailer backed by Amazon.com, had sales of $5.2 million in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales figures are incomplete or unavailable, some
analysts rate traditional retailers Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit
City Stores Inc. as the top consumer electronics sellers on the
Web. Amazon.com probably ranks third in the category.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap and a host of catalog companies lead the apparel market
online. Although the Gap does not release its online sales figures,
Canfield, the Gomez Advisors analyst, believes its aggressive
tactics will soon make it the dominant Internet clothing retailer.
Competitors include Lands' End Inc., Spiegel Inc., L.L. Bean Inc.,
and J. Crew Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As latecomers to the Web, most traditional retailers still lag
behind their Internet-only rivals in performance. Their online
stores are clunkier _ and many don't offer features such as Web
pages personalized to an individual consumer's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual retailers continue to make advances. For example,
parents who shop at SmarterKids.com Inc., a Needham, Mass. online
education store, can type in information about their children _ and
out pops a list of games or toys tailored to their kids' needs and
learning styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worried'' about traditional toy retailers, said
Albert Noyes, executive vice president of SmarterKids.com. ``Let's
assume they do catch up, and I'm confident they will. But it will
be 2001 or so before they get around to the educational (market).''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the most basic level, old-line merchants have discovered
the transition to cyberspace can be wrenching. Some manufacturers
have fought to keep their products offline or have tried to claim
the Web as their own selling space. Store employees finger the
Internet as an enemy that will siphon away their sales commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they can just quickly become an Internet
presence,'' said Scott Segal, chief executive of ijewelry.com, an
Internet-only jewelry retailer. ``It's really a sense of arrogance.
It's because they don't know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual retailers acknowledge their old-line rivals may have
more experience in distributing merchandise to their stores. But
that does not necessarily translate into the know-how to pack and
ship orders, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions are catalog retailers such as Eddie Bauer and
L.L. Bean. Because they have the fulfillment side of the business
down to a science, they are adapting quickly to the Web and have
scored high ratings from online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for traditional merchants has been the high
market values placed on Internet-only retailers, which keeps them
flush with cash. Investors recently have cast more critical looks
at unprofitable virtual merchants _ but not Amazon.com, which still
has nearly 10 times the market value of Barnes &AMP; Noble's bn.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bn.com executives say they plan to be profitable in the last
quarter of 2001, while some analysts estimate that Amazon.com will
make a profit in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that they (Amazon.com) have actually given a
date,'' sniffed Steve Riggio, vice chairman and acting chief
executive of bn.com, a joint venture between the nation's biggest
bookseller and publisher Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bn.com, Amazon.com has expanded beyond books and compact
discs into a hybrid Wal-Mart of the Web. In three years, it has
become an auction site, a toy seller, an electronics retailer, and
a landlord for other online businesses. Eventually, Amazon.com's
Bezos _ who started with books _ says he wants to sell everything
online, except live animals and guns.
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional retailers are not going to cede their
business to the likes of Amazon.com without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart and other big chains are getting more serious about
strengthening their Web sites. Last week, Wal-Mart announced it was
hiring Jeanne Jackson, former chief executive of the Gap's
successful Banana Republic, to head its e-commerce division. The
world's largest retailer also is moving its Internet unit to
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we're the Wal-Mart of the Web,'' said Wal-Mart
spokeswoman Melissa Berryhill.
</P>
<P>
   Other old-line merchants are starting to ``get it'' by
experimenting with different business models and cleaning up their
sites, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Bloomingdales.com confounded online shoppers
with blinking lights and a busy Web design. Today, the flickering
lights are gone _ and the department store's online aisles are now
clear of clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., which has struggled in the old world, has
decided to bring what it does best to cyberspace. At its Internet
store, consumers will find stoves, sewing machines, and cordless
drills.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking another way to tap into the Web, Sears recently
announced that it would team up with Carrefour SA, the world's
second-largest retailer, to create the industry's largest supply
exchange on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap is one of the few traditional retailers that managed to
knit its offline and online operations early in the game. Internet
shoppers, for example, can return purchases to regular stores. In
eight of its stores, customers can now use interactive kiosks to
check out the Internet clothing assortments.
</P>
<P>
   Online shoppers can locate any Gap store on the ground with a
few mouse clicks, while offline customers will find the Gap's Web
address on shopping bags and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco retailer has added several goodies to its Web
store, including a customer wish list and a clearance section. It
is now developing a feature that will allow customers to pick out
the perfect pair of pants.
</P>
<P>
   Bn.com, in the meantime, has begun testing a 24-hour delivery
service in New York. If expanded nationwide, the company could gain
ground in its race against Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kratz, a 29-year-old public relations employee from New
York, has been won over by the service. Last week, bn.com delivered
her order for the novel ``Disgrace'' in 24 hours, giving her enough
time to read it for her book club meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When she bought her first book online, Kratz bypassed Amazon.com
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnes &AMP; Noble is a name I'm more familiar with,'' she
explained.

Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes/``Live at the Greek''
(Musicmaker.com)
<TEXT>
<P>
   The show had moments; the album is a record-breaking event. The
Internet-only ``Live at the Greek'' became the largest-selling
custom CD and paid download ever when it was released recently.
Fans may either purchase a premade 18-track double-CD version or
create their own custom album of newly recorded, classic Zep and
vintage blues tunes recorded by Page and the Crowes during sold-out
shows at the Greek last October. The compilation featuring two
hours of music can only be purchased online at musicmaker.com.
</P>
<P>
   So how is it? Surprisingly good. At the Greek, it was easy to
overlook how tightly the Crowes played and how carefully the band
followed Page. Here, in energetic standouts like ``Heartbreaker,''
``You Shook Me'' and the terrific ``Out on the Tiles''/``Whole
Lotta Love'' medley, the band fires on all cylinders while the
usually sloppy Page is straight to the point. 3 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
The The/``NakedSelf'' (Nothing)
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial Matt Johnson's innovative ninth project is a
spare, stripped-down return to places previously explored on the
band's 1981 ``Burning Blue Soul'' disc. Johnson's songcraft remains
strong; his 1986 ``Sweet Bird of Truth'' still stands as one of the
most pungent antiwar songs and the new album's gently observational
``WeatherBelle'' and the dense ``ShrunkenMan'' are some of the best
songs tTantiwar songs and the new album's gently observational
``WeatherBelle'' and the dense ``ShrunkenMan'' are some of the best
songs the eccentric Brit has cut in his long career. ``NakedSelf,''
The The's first album in five years, is a lean, potent rock record
with a kick. 3 stars &QL; 
_ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Suba/``Sao Paulo Confessions'' (Six Degrees)
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite corners of international music is samba from
Brazil. Another favorite is trip-hop from Bristol, England. When
Bristol and Brazil come together, as they do on this gorgeous disc,
I must make my own Sao Paulo confession: I'm infatuated. Somehow,
no one figured out how complementary these sounds from opposite
hemispheres could be until this Slavic ex-pat in Brazil's largest
city did the honors. The result is exotic and spooky, danceable in
a swayingly soulful way, deeply grooving and implacably cool in the
face of heat. Think James Bond at Carnival. The only bad thing
about this disc is there won't be another: Suba died in an
apartment fire shortly after finishing the album. At least he left
us this gem. 3 1/2 stars

AC/DC/``Stiff Upper Lip'' (Elektra)
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years after brothers Malcolm and Angus Young formed
AC/DC, the leather-lunged Aussies continue to outlast musical
trends by sticking to simple, old-fashioned hard rock. On their
17th album, little has changed _ and fans will cheer.
Straight-ahead metal 'n' flash is the order of the day on such
roaring riff-rockers as the great title track, ``Meltdown'' and
``Hold Me Back,'' which sound as if they've all been around at
least since ``Highway to Hell.'' All hail rock 'n' roll. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eliane Elias/``Everything I Love'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   As the title implies, Elias' latest finds her collecting some of
her favorite standards from composers Irving Berlin and Cole Porter
and jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie and Charles Mingus. It's not as
predictable as it sounds, though, for two reasons. First, Elias
often digs deep in the catalogs for songs that haven't been done to
death. And second, the Brazilian pianist rotates between two trios,
featuring the veteran team of drummer Jack DeJohnette and bassist
Marc Johnson on nine songs, with new-generation bassist Christian
McBride paired with drummer Carl Allen on four other tracks. The
rotating trio concept works exceptionally well, inspiring Elias
(appearing tonight through Sunday at the Jazz Bakery) to stretch
and scale some improvisational heights. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
John Scofield/``Bump'' (Verve) &QL; 
Bill Frisell/``Ghost Town'' (Nonesuch)
</P>
<P>
   Onetime Miles Davis sideman Scofield is no stranger to funk,
especially after appearing on some of the late trumpet legend's
grooving-est early '80s albums. On his new record, the always
reliable guitarist brings elements of funk, groove and jazz
together in a dozen originals that benefit from a slight Latin
tinge. Set-opener ``Three Sisters'' has a nice New Orleans feel
(when it comes to funk, there's no getting away from the Meters)
while the thoughtful ``Chichon'' (Spanish for ``bump'') goes for a
more atmospheric sound. The alchemy continues with standouts
``Fez'' and the wah-wah drenched ``Blackout.'' In stores Tuesday. 3
1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   Although he's cut a string of wonderful collaborative records in
recent years, ``Ghost Town'' is Frisell's first solo release and,
predictably, it's a winner. The reflective jazz guitarist and
composer here takes on originals and covers of new and old
favorites with characteristic understatement. Rounding out such
originals as the six-minute ``Ghost Town''/``Poem for Eva'' are
welcome interpretations of the Hank Williams standard ``I'm So
Lonesome I Could Cry,'' John McLaughlin's beautiful ``Follow Your
Heart'' and a remarkable reading of the Gershwins' ``My Man's Gone
Now.'' 4 stars &QL; 
_ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Various/``Asian Travels'' (Six Degrees)
</P>
<P>
   Asian Underground, which blends traditional South Asian sounds
with U.S./Euro techno, ambient and dance club tracks, represents
another delightfully unpredictable mix of sounds from disparate
corners of the musical universe. This 10-song compilation zips over
the top of this bubbling subgenre in nice fashion, getting
two-for-one props by showcasing songs by pioneers, remixed by other
pioneers. There's stuff here like Fun Da Mental's ``Ja Sha Taan,''
which crosses the ecstasy of traditional Qawwali vocals with dance
loops, remixed for maximum effect by Transglobal Underground. Other
notables: Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan with Michael Brook; Banco de Gaia;
Shankar; a Talvan Singh remix of Ghoom Charakhana; and State of
Bengal's remixes of DJ Cheb i Sabbah and Delirium. By no means
definitive, the disc nonetheless offers a tantalizing glimpse of
another fascinating musical melange. Try a taste; it's like a bowl
of vindaloo curry in London's East End. 3 stars

Jeffrey Osborne/``That's for Sure'' (Private Music)
</P>
<P>
   While r&AMP;b singer Osborne hasn't been away as long as Steely Dan,
this album, like the Dan's new effort, returns Osborne to the kind
of music he was making at the peak of his chart powers in the
mid-'80s. Osborne has always been one of our top ballad singers,
and he hasn't lost his touch here on his first album of new
material in nearly a decade. The dozen cuts (10 by Osborne) are a
satisfying mix of silky midtempo percolators and smooth ballads
revolving around the power of love. The album closes with a treat
for longtime fans _ a seven-minute live version of his LTD hit,
``Love Ballad.'' Osborne's is a voice that still matters. 3 stars

Supreme Beings of Leisure/`'Supreme Beings of Leisure'' (Palm)
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing lazy about this sleek, dance-minded debut. The
band's sly mix of brisk pop-tronic grooves, a funky-chic '60s
sensibility that borrows from Shirley Bassey, Shankar and Lalo
Schifrin, oddball instrumentation and occasional samples, makes for
a consistently enjoyable noise. Highlights include ``Never the
Same,'' ``Golddigger'' and ``Strangelove Addiction,'' all of which
have received deserved airplay lately. Take a leisurely gander at
these beings. They're supremely sublime. 3 stars &QL;

<P>
   Parents and other caring adults, here's your opportunity to tell
that special youngster what he or she means to you on this special
day dedicated to kids.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Fire Boys and Girls organization is asking all adults
to celebrate its fourth annual ``Absolutely Incredible Kid Day'' on
Thursday by writing a letter to those special children in their
lives. It only takes a few minutes but it could leave a lasting
impact on the life you touch.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few hints for getting started. You could open the
letter with a question: Do you know what I like about you? I like
it when ... Or you can begin with a favorite poem or a famous quote
that has meaning for you.
</P>
<P>
   Write from your heart and be sincere. And don't forget to write
a letter occasionally to this person; it will open the lines of
communication and promote better self-image for the child.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Fire Boys and Girls group has also had a book published
called ``Letters From the Heart.'' The book features letters from
previous years written by adults to the children most important to
them. The book retails for $11.95 and is available in local
outlets. It can also be ordered by phone: (888) 254-3329. For

BABIES SOAK UP KNOWLEDGE FROM VIDEOS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Young children are like sponges; they absorb just about
everything, including language.
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers are especially absorbant because they are just learning
how to express themselves verbally. For parents wanting their child
to learn another language, this is an opportune time. And now there
are videos available for just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babyscapes'' Educational Video Series will be releasing its
third and fourth videos Tuesday. The titles include ``Miracle of
Mozart, Teaching Your Child Numbers &AMP; Shapes in Spanish'' for
youngsters 8 months to 5 years old and ``Miracle of Mozart,
Teaching Your Child ABCs in Spanish!'' for children 18 months to 5
years old.
</P>
<P>
   This series, the brainchild of Keri and Steven Mann of Las
Vegas, came about after the birth of the couple's second son.
``When my second son was 6 months old,'' Keri recalls, ``I was
looking for a subject that would visually stimulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most child development experts agree that the first year of life
is the most crucial for developing the brain and that's why infants
need a lot of different stimulation, Keri adds.
</P>
<P>
   So, not finding what they wanted, she and Steve decided to
create their own videos. The first video, ``Baby's Smart Start,''
for kids 3 months to 5 years, was released in 1996. This video
emphasizes black, white and red images set to classical music.
Video two _ ``Celebration of Color'' for ages 8 months to 5 years _
followed in 1998. Its focus is on primary colors, also set to
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   By the third video, the Manns decided to use the music of Mozart
exclusively, having experimented with Brahms, Beethoven, Grieg,
Bach and others on their first two tapes. ``(We discovered) Mozart
aids in receptivity and retention,'' Keri says.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also discovered that there is a demand for Spanish
language tapes. ``There is a tremendous demand for Spanish,'' Steve
says. ``Not only for English speakers but for Spanish speakers,
too.'' But right now the emphasis is on the young ones. ``A baby
can learn two or three languages by the time it's 3,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Miracle of Mozart, Teaching Your Child ABCs in Spanish''
video features colorful graphics that are easy for a toddler to
track. Little eyes will follow a train that carries all the letters
of the alphabet and view a factory where little wooden people build
and paint the letters. And they will learn how to say each letter
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Miracle of Mozart, Teaching Your Child Numbers &AMP; Shapes in
Spanish'' focuses on the six basic shapes: diamonte (diamond),
circula (circle), triangulo (triangle), estrella (star), quadrado
(square) and rectangula (rectangle).
</P>
<P>
   Little ones will see colorful shapes coming out of the water or
being made in a factory. And not only will they enjoy the gentle
music of Mozart, but they will also listen to a soothing voice
narrating on each tape. According to Steve, ``The graphics keep
your attention when they keep repeating.''
</P>
<P>
   Next in the works is a tape on phonics. ``Videos will age as
kids age,'' Keri says. ``It's not just entertaining, it's
educational too.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggested retail price for each video is $14.95. All four videos
are available by phone (888) 441-5437 or by visiting the Babyscapes
Web site at www.babyscapes.com. &QL;

JAZZ GUITARIST JOHN SCOFIELD GETTING A `BUMP'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inventive jazz-funk guitarist John Scofield admits it: ``I love
organ too much.''
</P>
<P>
   For his latest disc, the aptly titled ``Bump,'' Scofield expands
the syncopated grooves he developed on 1998's ``A Go Go,'' an
adventurous collaboration with acid-jazz organ trio Medeski, Martin
and Wood. Previously, he worked with organist Larry Goldings on
several albums.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, don't expect the gospel-tinged feel of a
Hammond B-3 or funky clavinet bubbling away in the background.
Scofield says the rhythm instrument simply works ``too well'' in
his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to change the whole sonic thing this time,'' he
explained. ``It made a big difference. I'm glad I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scofield is certainly no stranger to funk. In the early '80s, he
recorded and toured with the pioneer of jazz-funk fusion, Miles
Davis, appearing on ``Star People,'' ``Decoy'' and ``You're Under
Arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's happy to see deep, churning grooves come back into
style at the start of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been into funk, and right now, the James Brown,
Sly Stone, Miles Davis `Bitches Brew' tradition of the late '60s
and early '70s is so alive in young bands,'' Scofield, 48, said.
``At this particular time in history, there's no generation gap _
for me anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Scofield is considered one of the ``big three'' influences in
contemporary jazz guitar, along with Pat Metheny and Bill Frisell.
But the Dayton, Ohio, native is perhaps the most directly
rock-oriented of the trio and his distinctive, jagged tone stems
partly from the use of effect pedals. On the new album's ``Beep
Beep,'' for example, he experiments with various effects, tweaking
out playful squeals and snarls over percolating beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities are endless,'' Scofield said.
</P>
<P>
   A masterful soloist, the guitarist studied at the Berklee School
of Music in the early '70s, playing around Boston before signing on
with the Billy Cobham-George Duke band and cutting a live album
with Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker at Carnegie Hall. He later
recorded with Charles Mingus and joined the Gary Burton quartet and
Dave Liebman's quintet.
</P>
<P>
   His nearly two dozen solo albums include projects with such
well-known players as Charlie Haden, Jack DeJohnette, Joe Lovano
and Eddie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   To vary the feel of the dozen original compositions on ``Bump''
(in stores Tuesday), Scofield called upon a number of young
musicians to bring beats and bass lines in various rhythm-section
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Eric Kalb and percussionist Johnny Durkin come from the
New England funk outfit Deep Banana Blackout, bassist Tony Scherr
and drummer Kenny Wollesen play with the postmodern jazz quartet
Sex Mob, and sample maven Mark De Gli Antoni plies his trade with
Soul Coughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bump'' (Verve) was produced by Lee Townsend, with whom
Scofield has worked on his last half-dozen records, as well as his
joint album with Metheny, ``I Can See Your House From Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scofield's flexibility allows him to move from a project like
``Bump'' to another with drummer Billy Higgins, saxophonist Kenny
Garrett, bassist Christian McBride and pianist Brad Mehldau; to jam
with bands like Govt. Mule and Moe; to pursue an unusual side group
with Steve Swallow and Bill Stewart; and to join a New Orleans jam
session with members of the Meters and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band
horns.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he was in Britain appearing with the Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra to perform contemporary composer Mark Anthony
Turnadge's ``Blood on the Floor,'' conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The composer knew about me and asked me to play,'' Scofield
said from Birmingham. ``It was influenced by jazz and Stravinsky
with a little room for improvisation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Philharmonic will perform the Turnadge piece
this year, but without Scofield, who will be on the road with his
new band, the guitarist said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Scofield will be touring with a rhythm
guitarist, Avi Bortnick, who was recommended by Bay Area guitarist
Charlie Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a master at rhythm,'' Scofield said. ``He switches off on
electric and acoustic and uses a lot of pedals like I do. We're
just working out all the things we can do.'' &QL;

&HT;     NOT ALL CAREER COUNSELORS ARE CREATED EQUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Career coaching is like a prescription drug: If
you use it properly, it can be wonderful; if you take it for the
wrong reason, it can be useless. And if anyone promises you a
miracle cure, hold on to your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they call themselves coaches, counselors, advisers or
gurus, people who get paid to offer career advice can help you help
yourself. But first, you have to pay attention to the cardinal rule
of business: Hire the right people.
</P>
<P>
   Many well-intentioned counselors will talk about how you should
find your passion, then figure out how you could make money
following that passion. As any soap opera fan will tell you,
though, passion has its pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   You need some passion in your life, whether it's for
relationships or travel or food or money or whatever else. If your
career saps so much energy that you have a passion for absolutely
nothing, including work, get help or get out.
</P>
<P>
   Your career should certainly be something you enjoy _ something
that gets your adrenaline pumping, at least once in a while. Make
sure you're good at it, or have the potential to be. The greatest
job in the world will quickly turn ugly if you don't have the
talent.
</P>
<P>
   But should it be your passion? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're doing something because you have to instead of
because you want to, your passion for it is almost certainly going
to diminish. You might make your career more satisfying, but you'll
sacrifice one of life's pleasures in the process. That's a heavy
price.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for outsiders to underestimate how much grunt work is
involved in any job. Actors spend hours getting made up and waiting
for others to finish their scenes. Doctors have to conquer the
insurance industry as well as diseases. Entrepreneurs must put a
lot of energy into ordering supplies, figuring out finances and
drumming up business.
</P>
<P>
   Before you see a career counselor, think about what jobs out
there might suit your passions and interests. Then talk to people
who have those jobs so you can discover the drawbacks as well as
the pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Realize, too, that all this talk about passion can be part of a
sales pitch. After all, if counselors make you feel that you ought
to be passionate, but you aren't, that's an awfully compelling
argument for hiring them, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Define success on your terms, not a counselor's. Some people
would rather put in their eight hours and go home to a life without
pagers or cell phones or thoughts about work. There is nothing
wrong with that. Your No. 1 goal should always be to have a good
life, and only you can decide the importance of work in that
picture.
</P>
<P>
   What do you hope to gain from career counseling? Obviously you
want something to change, but try to focus on specific items rather
than a general malaise. If all you really want to do is complain, a
career counselor won't be much help.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have trouble getting along with your boss or co-workers?
Are you unhappy, but you really don't know why? Counselors with
strong backgrounds in psychology might offer the most help.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to change careers, but have no idea what else to go
into? Some counselors specialize in aptitude tests and in knowing
what kinds of jobs are out there besides the obvious ones.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of becoming an entrepreneur, find a counselor
with experience in starting a business _ and not just a career
counseling business. Warning: Starting your own business to escape
a lackluster career is a path to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Do you just want help job hunting or getting promoted? Many
counselors offer the basics, but try to find someone with expertise
or connections within your industry. Avoid anyone who demands large
upfront fees.
</P>
<P>
   How important is money to you? If your main source of
unhappiness is that your job just won't pay the bills, find a
counselor with financial expertise. Maybe better budgeting and
investing will make your current job more acceptable. Maybe you
need help negotiating with your current employer.
</P>
<P>
   Are you uninspired? Maybe you do need someone who talks of
passion and loves exclamation points. Just because they turn my
stomach doesn't mean they'll turn yours.
</P>
<P>
   In all these cases, make sure you have looked within your
industry and checked the library and the Internet before seeing a
counselor. If you are having trouble with someone, maybe you can
get advice from someone else who gets along with that person. If
you are having trouble finding a job or getting promoted, maybe you
need a mentor or a better network and not a counselor.

 &HT;     SUV CULTURE GETS A TASTE OF THE 70s  
 &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The most important number the morning after the
primary was on the sign of a gas station where I sometimes fill my
tank. It said $2.06.9.
</P>
<P>
   I could swear the sign said $2.01.9 just two days before. High
test was going up faster than Amazon.com stock did, and regular was
following close behind at $1.86.9.
</P>
<P>
   These are the numbers Al Gore should watch, not polls. That is,
if he wants to be president instead of a guy pounding nails into
homes for the poor with Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Jimmy Carter? Remember gas lines?
</P>
<P>
   Green and red flags, odd and even days, lines of dozens of cars
waiting at the pumps. These are the things that can break a
president, not Social Security or education policy.
</P>
<P>
   The hell with old age and kids. We're Americans, and we've got
to get in our cars and drive _ now. Heaven help any politician who
gets in the way, or is linked with $100 fill-ups for our precious
SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bright young kids in the San Francisco Bay Area who
work on the information superhighway don't even remember 1973 or
1979 when real superhighways were cleared of cars for lack of gas.
Heck, they don't even remember the recession of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   These dot.com kids think stocks always go up, and plenty of
gasoline is always available to pour into their Saabs and Land
Cruisers so they can head for Tahoe to spend their stock options.
Or whatever they do.
</P>
<P>
   With a gas shortage in the offing for California and perhaps the
nation, the kids should know how gas lines work. OK, kids, think of
gas stations as Web sites with too many visitors _ sites to be
accessed only after hours on line.
</P>
<P>
   Disco wasn't the only thing that was invented in the '70s. The
powers that be also came up with a system for dealing with gas
shortages, and believe me, it sucked worse than disco.
</P>
<P>
   I use that objectionable verb ``sucked'' not just because of the
disco reference, but because of siphoning, a form of orality all
too many of us became familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, gas shortages. One company started selling siphons that
didn't require mouth-to-hose contact. Locking gas caps were
invented. Gas was so precious no one robbed cars for the stereos,
and not just because they were eight-track.
</P>
<P>
   On odd and even days gas stations flew red or green flags
indicating that gas could be sold only to those with license plates
ending in odd or even numbers. I seem to remember that personalized
plates were categorized as odd, which they usually were.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, abuses occurred. People would switch plates, or steal
plates, just to get gas. Whatever they did, though, they had to
wait in long lines, pay high prices and not take trips farther than
the nearest grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who had Land Rovers in those days lived in
Kenya, but we had other cars that guzzled gas and constantly
required fill-ups. We didn't call them SUVs. We called them
American cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 I lived in Boston, which has a decent public transit
system, so when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
decided to punish nations that backed Israel in the Mideast War
they didn't punish me.
</P>
<P>
   Those who needed cars were hurt, though. Boston used to have the
highest rate of car theft in the nation, but that year thieves were
giving cars back.
</P>
<P>
   By the gas shortage of 1979, I was living in California, and
this is where a gas shortage really hurts. I had an old pickup that
got 11 miles to the gallon and I worked as a dispatch messenger for
a newspaper, which meant I had to drive hundreds of miles a week.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: I just used the pickup to go to the pump on odd days
and siphoned the gas into my 70 mpg motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend car-to-motorcycle refueling for anyone with a gas
guzzler who doesn't like waiting in lines, as well as motorcyclists
with pathetic four-gallon tanks.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the schizophrenia. We're Californians, so we're angry
at anything that interferes with our right to fill up our monster
SUVs and drive. But we're also Northern Californians, so our social
consciences tell us that Americans have been spoiled by low gas
prices and the delusion that they'll never have to economize on
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the two halves of us can get together and hate the
oil companies, which seem to have rigged the system, especially
against California.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there's another thing about the summer of '79 that
young SUVers will find incredible. It was the summer of the Honda.
Everyone wanted a Honda Civic, and there was a waiting list of
months before you could trade in your American car for one of those
gas-sipping babies.
</P>
<P>
   I still drive a Honda and until recently I felt pretty small
next to Ford Explorers and Lincoln Navigators. In fact, the car is
so small I'd be looking somewhere below their gas caps.
</P>
<P>
   Now I look at their gas caps and laugh. But I'm not sure 35 mpg
is enough.
</P>

`EYES' RATES A CLOSER LOOK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Confronted with an often visually alluring but removed tale of
sexual jealousy and obsession, reviewers of Stanley Kubrick's
``Eyes Wide Shut'' for the most part offered assessments that tread
a fine line between expressing disappointment while not questioning
Kubrick's ``genius.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something ironic in critics offering essentially snap
judgments on a work of art that Kubrick labored for years to
produce, but the filmmaker often got early mixed reviews on his
films only to have them end up on all-time-best lists. Now with the
release of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' on DVD, everyone has a chance to give
the film the look it deserves _ without the hype about sexual
titillation or its married stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   (The film originally received an NC-17 rating, but Kubrick had a
couple of digital figures inserted to hide the offending actions
and placate the ratings board. The original version played in
Europe but is not part of the new disc.)
</P>
<P>
   The DVD release coincided with the one-year anniversary of
Kubrick's death and contains interviews with Cruise, Kidman and
director Steven Spielberg, who was a friend of Kubrick's. The
Cruise and Kidman segments predictably go over Kubrick's obsession
for retakes, which the pair confirms. (Under the interviewer's
ineffectual questioning, we're lucky we learn anything.)
</P>
<P>
   Kidman, in defense of Kubrick, offers: ``Stanley was always
waiting for something to happen. Always looking for something that
surprised him or piqued his interest. It was about exploring all
facets of it so he could go into the editing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple that observation with a story that Spielberg told about a
conversation he had with Kubrick, who was asking what Spielberg
thought of the 1980 film ``The Shining,'' starring Jack Nicholson.
Spielberg, who at the time did not much care for the film, notes
that Kubrick immediately saw through his hemming and hawing, and
asked him what he thought was wrong. Spielberg pointed to
Nicholson's performance, which he thought was over the top. Kubrick
then asked him to name his five favorite actors, and Spielberg
reeled off names like Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart. But when his
list didn't include James Cagney, Kubrick pointed out that
!ital!that was the difference between them. He considered Cagney,
who was known for his larger-than-life performances, a great actor.
</P>
<P>
   And when you watch ``Eyes Wide Shut'' a second time and are able
to savor Kidman's out-there performance, stop watching the naked
people (and there are lots of them) and watch the unique way that
Kubrick tells a story, the film takes on a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg notes that ``The Shining'' is now one of his favorite
films and he has watched it 25 times, which reminds us that snap
judgments aren't always right. That isn't to say that ``Eyes'' is
perfect, but as Spielberg says, ``Nobody could shoot a picture
better in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that in the future, ``Eyes'' might be more highly
regarded than it was last summer. &QL; 
______
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' from Warner Bros., including interviews with
Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Steven Spielberg, is $24.98 on DVD. &QL;

&HT;     DOCTORS GETTING MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT PATIENTS WHO SMOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dr. Michael Schrom does not keep the usual staple
of magazines in his waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Schrom, who is passionate about getting people to stop smoking,
refuses to subscribe to any publication that accepts cigarette
advertising, ruling out most of the popular reads like People, Time
and Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   At his Manning Boulevard office in Albany, there is a collection
of Smithsonian, Architectural Digest and New York State
Conservationist magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to read the riot act to smokers
and then have the Marlboro man staring them in the face in my
waiting room,'' said Schrom, an otolaryngologist at the Capital
District Ear, Nose and Throat Service.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against smoking has always been helped by
individual physicians like Schrom, who have worked to educate
patients about the dangers of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   More physicians are growing increasingly militant about their
stance against tobacco, which kills 400,000 Americans each year.
Some heart surgeons have been known to give their patients three
months to quit _ or seek treatment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors aren't yet willing to go that far, and some studies
have shown that many physicians are unwilling to discuss smoking
with their patients at all, citing time constraints from managed
care and the fear of alienating people.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study revealed that while 70 percent of smokers see a
physician each year, only half are urged to quit, and less than 20
percent are given advice on how to quit or information on effective
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think physicians are necessarily among the worst
offenders about not encouraging smoking cessation but we don't go
far enough,'' Schrom said.
</P>
<P>
   But as few as three minutes of a physician's time can almost
double the rate of quitting among his or her patients, and the more
time spent with smokers, the higher the rates of quitting,
according to Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the Center for Tobacco
Research and Intervention at the University of Wisconsin Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are still afraid to bother their patients about
it,'' said Dr. John A. Van Deloo, a family practitioner in
Schenectady, N.Y.. ``Some patients are antagonistic.''
</P>
<P>
   David Mulligan, the former Massachusetts Department of Public
Health Commissioner, believes physician involvement is vital in
getting people to give up smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are community leaders,'' said Mulligan, who worked with
doctors in Boston to implement a smoking ban in restaurants.
``Having them at the forefront of this issue is the key to
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet physicians acknowledge they can only do so much.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wilson, acting chairman of the medicine at Ellis
Hospital in Schenectady and a longtime opponent of smoking, has
been unable to convince his own mother to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally gave up because it wasn't worth the arguments,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said doctors have to weigh how much to push the cigarette
issue with their patients, especially if it means losing their
attention on other important health matters, such as taking
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some physicians don't want to introduce that tension into the
relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schrom, who deals with head and neck cancers, has no plans to
tone down his position on smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the riot act to smokers,'' he said. ``I've never had to
take out the voice box of a someone who doesn't smoke, I never had
to remove the tongue of someone who doesn't smoke, I've never had
to remove the jaw of someone who doesn't smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be just as happy if they'd ban that weed from the face of
the Earth,'' he said.

 IF YOUR SON IS SUICIDAL, GET ON A PLANE AND GO HELP HIM

 c.2000 Dr. Joy Browne. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: We have a 23-year-old son who lives in another
state. For the first 20 years of his life he was the ``perfect
child.'' The last three years show a complete reversal _ he dropped
out of school, drank to excess, got speeding tickets, stopped
attending church, pushed his girlfriend up against a wall and even
made an ``attempt at suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time he gets his life on track, he seems to exhibit
self-destructive behavior. My wife wants to fly back to Denver to
``help him,'' and I am saying that at 23, he has to help himself. I
have told him repeatedly that he needs help _ Alcoholics Anonymous,
a shrink and/or treatment for what sounds to be numerous ongoing
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Please tell me if we should go to Denver to help our son through
this health crisis or just continue to make the suggestions that we
know he should be following and hope that he starts listening. I
have a potentially suicidal son, a wife who is crazy with worry and
me who knows he needs immediate help but doesn't know what to do!
F.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I'd follow your heart on this _ not your head. It
sounds as if your son is in acute distress so get on a plane to go
and show your moral support, if nothing else. You'll have some
face-to-face information, and you may be able to get him into some
kind of treatment program in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   If he is suicidal, Alcoholics Anonymous is a good, long-term
solution, but not a short-term solution. He likely needs to be
hospitalized and put on medication. Certainly he needs to be seen
by a professional. You'll be able to assess the situation and
accomplish these goals much better in person, rather than over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like your son experienced some kind of traumatic event
that triggered this situation. I always worry when someone says
they have the perfect son or daughter because that's simply not
true. There are no perfect children and there are no perfect
situations, which means something knocked him off course. Whether
he's having a delayed teen-age rebellion or something more
specific, your son seems to have been derailed a couple of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a short-term solution, I'd get on that plane and see what you
can do to help your son.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: My mate never leveled with me until 10 years into
the relationship and subsequent marriage about his secret urges. I
was shocked, confused and hurt when I walked in on him wearing my
silk negligee, a wig, full makeup, heels and a great big smile on
his face.
</P>
<P>
   There had been times when I had wondered about his
deceitfulness, but I was quite naive about the whole thing. Coming
home and finding a man in full drag is not my idea of being turned
on. Could you gather some input from other spouses suffering with
this problem?
</P>
<P>
   Please try to explain why these men feel compelled to wear
women's clothes. I believe it is their duty to explore where they
are ``coming'' from if they expect their mate to understand. C.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You may be asking the wrong questions. Finding out how
other people deal with the situation may be helpful. You could go
online _ the Third Sex Society deals specifically with tranvestism
_ to find out how other people cope. But what you really want to do
is figure out what YOU want to do about it. We don't run our lives
by consensus. We figure out what's important to us and make our
choices accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear when this occurred. However long ago, you're
obviously committed enough to your spouse _ even with this
uncomfortable revelation _ to stick by him, if only for this
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The person who can tell you the most about why he does this is
your spouse. Whether or not he's willing to do this is unclear. As
for cross-dressing, it's not all that uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   In our society we allow women a huge latitude to cross-dress. At
this moment, you may be wearing blue jeans, a baseball cap and
sneakers. Not so long ago these were considered strictly male garb.
Now it is not only OK, but perfectly stylish for women to wear
clothes once worn exclusively by men.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that we don't allow men a whole lot of latitude in
this area. I am not saying, however, that it's fine to cross-dress
because this behavior is clearly upsetting to you. So start with
your feelings: Is there anything specific about his behavior that
you consider acceptable? For example, if he did this when you
weren't around, would that make you feel comfortable? Does he do
this in public and is that part of the issue _ that you feel other
people will find out and you'll be embarrassed? If you could figure
out a little bit more about what your concerns are, you may be able
to address them with your husband.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of him understanding why he does this, he will most
likely tell you that he doesn't know. Whether it stems from his
childhood is unclear. For better or worse, this is where he is
right now. The likelihood is that he is not going to change his
behavior unless he really wants to. You need to decide where your
perimeters are and what you're willing _ and not willing _ to
accept.
</P>

BOTH SIDES OF GARY SINISE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gary Sinise is making tea.
</P>
<P>
   Room service has just delivered a large tray with several
containers and cups, and Sinise makes a loud rattle of finding the
hot water and the bags and getting the tea brewing. The process
goes on for several minutes, but once the liquid and leaves are
finally together in the delicate pot, Sinise is ready to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, buddy,'' he says, leaning back on the sofa. ``Go ahead,
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sinise is clean-shaven, short-haired and dressed neatly
in new jeans and a casual blue shirt. He looks much more like the
heroic good-guy astronaut he plays in ``Mission to Mars,'' the
big-budget science-fiction adventure opening Friday, than the
scuzzy, gun-running nasty he created for the action thriller
``Reindeer Games,'' already in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And thank goodness, because the muscular Gabriel from ``Reindeer
Games'' would be scary, even if he were having tea in an elegant
suite high up in the Essex House on Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I scared myself,'' Sinise says of Gabriel. He has that slight
one-sided smile he uses in movies, and his expression suggests
amused amazement that he could seem so creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Sinise is much easier to like and trust in ``Mission to Mars.''
He plays the leader of a rescue mission sent to the Red Planet
after an earlier crew meets with ... well, serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   After playing unpleasant types in three films over the last few
years _ a kidnapper of Mel Gibson's son in ``Ransom,'' and a
double-dealing military man in ``Snake Eyes'' _ Sinise was glad for
a change.
</P>
<P>
   ```Mission to Mars' is just a straight-up heroic, courageous
astronaut,'' he says of his role.
</P>
<P>
   The space movie reunites Sinise with Brian DePalma, his ``Snake
Eyes'' director, in a film that has plentiful special effects, many
involving the actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough shoot,'' Sinise says. ``Tough physically,
because we had to do a lot of physical stuff _ hanging on wires,
and wearing these space suits, all that kind of stuff. We're in the
space suits 50 percent of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinise had some of his preparation for the role of an astronaut
out of the way, however, thanks to his previous role in ``Apollo
13.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Houston and doing all that stuff for `Apollo 13,'''
he says, ``all that was real helpful on `Mission to Mars.' Going up
in the zero-gravity jet _ all that was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinise hopes the big visuals won't overshadow the script and
characters in ``Mission to Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good story,'' he says. ``I think you really grow to
care about these people and what they're trying to do _ and what
ends up happening to them at the end of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' combines elements of three of the most
famous space films ever: ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' for its
authentic scientific feel; ``Apollo 13'' for its emotional
involvement; and ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' for the
fantastical elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hopeful, positive, life-affirming kind of story,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie is also mildly frightening in places, and Sinise
still has not decided whether to let his three children, two girls
and a boy ages 11, 9 and 7, see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm debating whether I should bring them to the premiere or
not,'' he says. ``It's PG-13, but there's some scary stuff in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll never see `Reindeer Games,''' he says of that R-rated
movie, which offers violence, nudity and harsh language, much of it
involving Sinise. ``They'll have to be a lot older.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinise, who turns 45 this month, has been married to theater
actress Moira Harris for 19 years. His family is one reason he does
not make more movies. Being at home is too important to him right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maneuvered things in such a way that I have enough money
that I can support the lifestyle I have, which isn't too eccentric
_ so that I don't have to go to work constantly to support a whole
big bunch of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to work, I want to be sure it's stuff that I like
and I'm going to get something from it as an actor _ or with people
that I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Being picky may have kept Sinise from reaching major-star status
_ something he would like _ but it has not hurt his considerable
acting reputation, which followed him from the stage when he
finally started doing movies at age 36, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest advice to any director is, `Cast Gary Sinise,'''
said ``Reindeer Games'' director John Frankenheimer. ``He makes you
look good. I mean, the guy _ with Frederic March, Raul Julia and
Angela Lansbury _ is one of the four finest actors I've ever worked
with.''
</P>
<P>
   After having made the Emmy Award-winning cable movie ``George
Wallace'' starring Sinise, Frankenheimer wanted the actor to star
in his big-screen film ``Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   The studios said no, Sinise wasn't a big name. The film
eventually starred Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he got an Oscar nomination as Lt. Dan, the
embittered legless Vietnam veteran in ``Forrest Gump,'' Sinise had
made his mark in theater.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after graduating from high school, the then-18-year-old
Sinise and some friends began Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater in the
basement of a church. A quarter-century later, the now-famous
theater is housed in an $8 million building. Alumni of the company
include John Malkovich and Joan Allen, both twice Oscar-nominated,
and John Mahoney (``Frasier'').
</P>
<P>
   Sinise was the theater's artistic director for seven years. Two
years after staging an award-winning production of John Steinbeck's
``The Grapes of Wrath'' (which he still hopes to film one day), he
directed and co-starred with Malkovich in a well-received film
version of ``Of Mice and Men.'' Two years later came ``Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six years since, Sinise has played mostly character parts
in supporting roles. Even his leads in two TV movies, ``Truman''
and ``George Wallace,'' are what he calls character roles.
``Truman'' brought him an Emmy nomination, and ``George Wallace''
won him an Emmy and a Golden Globe.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Mission to Mars,'' Sinise may be seen this year in two
films that he shot in 1998, if they ever open. He did his work in
both in just six days each. One is a science-fiction film called
``Impostor.'' The other, ``Bruno,'' was directed by Shirley
MacLaine.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, this spring Sinise returns to Chicago and the
Steppenwolf stage to star in a new production of ``One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest,'' a play he has wanted to do for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since there was a major production of
it,'' he says, adding with a laugh, ``probably because the movie
was so good. The theatrical experience is very different.''
</P>
<P>
   When tickets went on sale early last month for ``Cuckoo,'' which
opens April 16, patrons lined up around the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ``Mission to Mars'' does for his career, it may be a
while before we see Sinise playing another major villain. He didn't
want to do Gabriel in ``Reindeer Games,'' but when he read the
script, wheels began turning.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, what can I do with it that's going to be different from
the last one I played?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every character has his point of view, and you have to see the
world from that perspective.'' he says. ``If you're playing Adolf
Hitler or whatever. Otherwise you can't do it with any honesty or
reality. You play George Wallace, you have to try to understand,
`OK, what's drivin' this guy? Why is he doing the stuff he's
doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when he played Stanley Kowalski in ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' at Steppenwolf, Sinise says, he was
attracted by Kowalski's animal qualities, something he figured he'd
never be able to do onscreen. Gabriel offered him that chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more of an animal than (the bad guys in) `Snake Eyes' or
`Ransom,''' the actor says. ``Those guys are a little slicker. I
saw Gabriel as kind of a rocker. I decided to give him a stringy,
long-hair look. Put a tattoo up here.''
</P>
<P>
   He also gave him some pretty good biceps, something that has
brought a lot of comment. Sinise was surprised and a little
embarrassed by the attention his arms got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time when you see me acting, you don't see me in a
tank top or with my shirt off. You don't really know what's going
on,'' he says, grinning again. ``It doesn't take me that long to
pump up like that. I stay in pretty good shape. I've always had
arms that ... '' He stops abruptly, looking sheepish. ``Why are we
talking about this?''

KUBRICK CLOSES WITH DROOPY `EYES' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `EYES WIDE SHUT'
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick was one of film's great directors. From ``Paths
of Glory,'' ``Dr. Strangelove'' and ``2001'' to ``A Clockwork
Orange,'' ``Barry Lyndon'' and ``Full Metal Jacket,'' his
immaculate movies were as artful as they come.
</P>
<P>
   But his final film, while artful, is a long, listless swan song
that assumes a profundity it doesn't merit.
</P>
<P>
   Like a great painting, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is remarkable to
behold. It's another of Kubrick's amazing inventions on a British
soundstage, where the expatriate American could tinker to his
heart's content. (``Eyes Wide Shut'' was in production for more
than two years.)
</P>
<P>
   But you don't stare at a great painting for 159 minutes nonstop,
and at that length, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' seems almost as inanimate.
</P>
<P>
   Edited with glacial slowness, scenes drone on beyond any
reasonable narrative function. Such bloating poorly serves a
sexually charged plot in need of purposefulness, not inertia.
</P>
<P>
   Married actors Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a loving,
upscale married couple in Manhattan who are troubled by carnal
temptations.
</P>
<P>
   A suave, older European tries to seduce her at a party. She
confesses a sexual fantasy to her husband. Curious, he questions a
prostitute and invades a costumed sex party in a mansion.
</P>
<P>
   These events prove almost shattering to the couple. And it's the
``almost'' that almost redeems the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' was marketed as a bold sex film, but its sex
is largely limited to dialogue and the brandishment of female
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the film is a tease _ and it's no less sexist
than today's men's magazines (Maxim and GQ, to name two), with
their boyish leaning toward leering.
</P>
<P>
   The film's greatest power lies in its craft. Music, production
design, lighting and cinematography are exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   The editing may falter (including continuity glitches _ watch
that moving stack of CDs), but the performances also are strong,
from the leads to the smallest bit parts.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make this alleged erotic odyssey any more
satisfying _ just admirable for its final evocation of Kubrick's
fierce devotion to detail.
</P>
<P>
   His death before the film's release led to a compromise of that
devotion, especially in terms of shot composition.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid an NC-17 rating, the studio changed the orgy scenes,
with nameless characters digitally added. In shot after shot, they
stand in the way as Cruise roams the mansion, obscuring sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   These clumsy clusters become a running joke. If you didn't know
better, you'd swear this was the worst-blocked movie ever _ or
perhaps a ripoff of the peek-a-boo scenes of the ``Austin Powers''
flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, neither is the case. Kubrick was an artist to the end.
But most of his films were also grandly entertaining, and ``Eyes
Wide Shut`` is not.
</P>
<P>
   _ DVD extras: ``Eyes Wide Shut'' on DVD offers two TV spots, the
theatrical trailer and three interviews: with Cruise, Kidman and
colleague Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   In her 18 1/2-minute talk to an unseen interviewer (who
complains about the session's brevity), Kidman seems the most
candid.
</P>
<P>
   Like her husband, she was awed by Kubrick, then fell under his
spell as a craftsman and under his wing as a father figure.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman fights back tears when she is asked about Kubrick's
death. Cruise is more successful, though he is also tormented. Both
feel the director's sudden demise at age 70 was ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   They sound as if they'd be happy to be still working on the
movie. Cruise says he ``didn't want the experience to end,'' and
Kidman equates it with ``getting lost'' in another world.
</P>

`RANDOM HEARTS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a costly, glossy film with big stars _ and familiar faces
even in bit parts _ ``Random Hearts'' is one lousy clunker.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing random about this botched job. It's bad on every
front, from the morose, meandering screenplay to the leaden
direction of Sidney Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford plays a tough cop _ call him Dirty Harrison. When
he's not being grimly stoic, he tries mightily to be mean, via an
explosive, violent temper.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow this makes him a hunky magnet for a conservative
congresswoman (Kristin Scott Thomas).
</P>
<P>
   They don't exactly cute-meet. Their respective spouses were
flying off for an affair when their plane crashed, killing both of
them.

<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky,'' she says, rising from a sofa to
greet me as I enter her suite in the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel
in Beverly Hills. As if any such introduction were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She may be newly svelte _ having recently shed some 30 pounds _
but with that helmet of black hair, alabaster skin and
orthodontically perfect smile, she's still instantly recognizable
as the reluctant star of the tawdry Oval Office scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her tete-a-tete with Barbara Walters last March and
her star turn on Kenneth Starr's witness stand, Lewinsky mostly
kept to herself in the months after the story of her affair with
Bill Clinton broke.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, she announced that she'd struck a deal
to be the new spokeswoman for the weight-loss program Jenny Craig.
Though she won't reveal the financial details of her contract
(rumor has it she's getting paid $10,000 for every pound she
loses), she will be appearing in national TV commercials for the
diet company she credits with finally helping her get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this new public role, Lewinsky agreed to talk to me
about her lifelong battle with an unhealthy body image.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In reading ``Monica's Story,'' which author (and Princess Diana
confidante) Andrew Morton wrote for her, on the flight to
California, I was struck by the extensive role Monica Lewinsky's
insecurity about her weight played in her disastrous liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she didn't dry clean the infamous blue dress, for
example, she recalled that Linda Tripp told her she looked fat in
it, so she left the dress in her closet. (Under the burden of that
insult, how many women wouldn't have done the same?)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's comment struck a deep nerve, one that has plagued
Lewinsky throughout her 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew noted in the book how when I was going through my
pictures with him, I marked everything by my weight: `Here I was 20
pounds heavier,' `Here I was 20 pounds thinner,''' she recalls.
``It was interesting to me that one of the constructs of how I view
my life is my weight. I found it disturbing _ and, of course, he
wouldn't change it, which annoyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for her, it is also how the public came to view
her. Dubbed the ``portly pepperpot'' by the New York tabloids, her
public battle to protect her privacy became an equally public
struggle with the scale. For two years, reporters have gleefully
critiqued her wardrobe and chronicled every morsel that has crossed
her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it's not even true!'' she says, laughing.
``The joke among my friends is, whatever is the most fattening
thing ordered at the table is what I ate, and I probably also had
what everyone else ate, too! I saw Calista Flockhart at a
restaurant once, and I wanted to say to her, `We're the Laurel and
Hardy of the tabloids!'''
</P>
<P>
   So why, I ask, would she invite further attention by signing on
with jenny Craig?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've found something that's helped me and might be
able to help others,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may point to the financial rewards of the deal (which
indeed will go a long way toward paying her legal bills), but
Lewinsky also has a genuine desire to connect with other women
who've struggled with their weight. On her book-signing tour, she
says, countless women came up to her saying that they identified
with her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For other people to feel comfortable sharing with me was very
touching, because it's still difficult for me to be open about
that.''
 &UR; HOW SHE'S HEALING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear that she's been in therapy _ ``It's no
secret that I'm working on myself,'' she says. She talks repeatedly
of trying to find ``balance'' and defuse the ``compulsive control''
that food has held over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've started to see is that weight for me has been a
control issue, whatever my weight has been,'' she says. ``I have
very black-and-white feelings about food _ that something's good or
something's bad, or if I eat this I'm a bad person, if I eat that
I'm a good person. I'm trying to have a more forgiving attitude and
not be as militant with myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have issues that I'm working on and I'm not there yet,
but I'm aware of a lot more.'' Those issues, she says, are ones
she's been wrestling with since as early as second grade. ``There
are things I deal with in therapy now that have nothing to do with
anything that's happening to me now or in the past few years,'' she
says, ``but are all a result of things that happened in high school
or grade school. You think, that was 10 or 15 years ago, that's
ridiculous. But those are the formative years, when you're so open
to impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in image-conscious L.A., she says, also had a
tremendous impact on her, as did her parents' eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has always been conscious of her weight,'' she says,
``and I watched her being controlled by that in different ways on
different diets. But even if you don't see it with your own mom,
you see it at your girlfriend's house with her parents. You just
can't escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents' separation _ and subsequent divorce, when she was
15 _ sparked an emotional trigger for her overeating, setting a
pattern of yo-yo dieting that would last into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my problems in the past was that I would either not get
to my goal because it was unrealistic, or I'd get there and,
because I'd struggled so hard, I'd stay there for five minutes,''
she says. ``I've probably gained and lost 20 people in my life!''
Now, she says, ``It's about keeping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest hurdle, she says, is dismantling her
``all-or-nothing'' attitude. ``I think being able to go out and
know that it's OK to have a little bit of this or a little bit of
that stops me from saying `I blew it' and having 12 drinks or a
whole cake,'' she says. ``I'm working on managing depression, too,
so I need to be able to go out with my friends. If that means that
I have a drink, then I work that into my food budget.''
 &UR; THROUGH THICK AND THIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does she think the press would have treated her differently if
she had been thin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have changed some of it,'' she says, with a
touch of regret. ``There were a lot of cruel things that people
said to me, and my weight handed them one more thing to be cruel to
me about. Especially in the beginning, when there was a lot of
uncertainty about what the relationship really was, my weight
played a negative role, because people would look at me and say,
`She's heavy _ why would anybody be interested in her?''
</P>
<P>
   She admits her search for love has been a bit, well, misguided.
(``That hasn't been undocumented!'' she laughs.) ``I fell prey to
someone I shouldn't have gotten involved with,'' she says quietly.
``But one of the positive things that came out of that was that
because I was with somebody who thought I was beautiful and sexy no
matter what size I was, I was able to discover that sexuality comes
from within. Even when I don't like to look at myself in the
mirror, my body has always felt good to me. But there's a catch-22
for me, because the person with whom I discovered my own sexuality
and sensuality was a bad emotional influence on me, and yet he gave
me this wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   As she dabs at her tears, I can feel the pain of her heartbreak.
We've all made mistakes, I tell her; we've all done foolish things
in the name of love. ``Unfortunately,'' I joke, ``my friends have
long memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure none of them have tape recorders!'' she fires
back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm stunned at her ability to defuse the emotional moment with a
joke, especially one at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously,'' she continues, ``I'm blessed to have some of the
most amazing friends in the world. I don't really consider Linda
(Tripp) a friend; I don't think she ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if not for Tripp and her tape recorder, we might never
have known the name Monica Lewinsky. Whatever Lewinsky's admitted
lapses of judgment, she never intended to gain fame from her
entanglement with the president _ certainly not this kind of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people forget I made the mistake of confiding in
someone privately,'' she says, ``but I went to pretty great lengths
legally to not have those conversations come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her desire to reveal the truth was the reason she agreed to be
interviewed by Barbara Walters. But what she had to say was instead
dwarfed by what she was wearing _ namely, the lipstick whose sales
immediately skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I designed it or owned it, that'd be great.'' She pauses,
then adds, ``Who knows, maybe I'll do my own lipstick someday!''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she's brought her business sense to the fashion
world, having launched last summer a line of handbags under the
name The Real Monica Inc., with sellout success. But, she says, ``I
really just want to find the right person and get married and have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible bachelors will now find this 26-year-old living in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the seasons and the diversity and that you just sort of
blend in,'' she explains. More than anything, it seems, she
desperately wishes that she might regain some semblance of a
normal, quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some kooky decisions and had some kooky things happen
to me, but I'm a real person,'' she says. ``What's special about me
is that people know my name, but other than that, I'm just like
everybody else. You don't have to like me _ sometimes I don't like
me _ but at least judge me on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she think the history books will treat her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I will probably be just a footnote. My name may
not even be mentioned,'' she says, perhaps more optimistic than
realistic. ``What I'm hoping is that people come to judge me not
for how the story began, but for how it ends.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she's brought her business sense to the fashion
world, having launched last summer a line of handbags under the
name The Real Monica Inc., with sellout success. But, she says, ``I
really just want to find the right person and get married and have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible bachelors will now find this 26-year-old living in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the seasons and the diversity and that you just sort of
blend in,'' she explains. More than anything, it seems, she
desperately wishes that she might regain some semblance of a
normal, quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some kooky decisions and had some kooky things happen
to me, but I'm a real person,'' she says. ``What's special about me
is that people know my name, but other than that, I'm just like
everybody else. You don't have to like me _ sometimes I don't like
me _ but at least judge me on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she think the history books will treat her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I will probably be just a footnote. My name may
not even be mentioned,'' she says, perhaps more optimistic than
realistic. ``What I'm hoping is that people come to judge me not
for how the story began, but for how it ends.'' &QL;

JACOBS SEES FUTURE IN SINDEN, O'CONNELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Jeremy Jacobs will leave the specifics to his
top two administrators, Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell, but the
Bruins owner made it clear Wednesday there must be some fundamental
changes in the way his sagging hockey franchise does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't come off a year like this and not change,'' said
Jacobs in his Delaware North Companies office in downtown Buffalo.
``You can't. If you come back with the same attitude and the same
approach, then you'll have the same results.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in four seasons, business as usual on
Causeway Street will be done without the Bruins in the playoffs.
Jacobs said he isn't sure where or how deep the changes will be,
but did suggest there will be some ``prudent'' spending aimed at
adding to the player roster and possibly adding to the
decision-making personnel in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was emphatic, however, that both Sinden and O'Connell
will continue to run the show, with O'Connell moving into the
general manager's job full-time whenever Sinden finally takes on
the club presidency as his sole responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is up to (Sinden),'' Jacobs said shortly before
departing for a trip to Florida, hours before his club faced the
Sabres at Marine Midland Arena. ``I don't know if right now is the
easiest time do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden hinted at Monday night's news conference, the farewell to
longtime team captain Ray Bourque, that he soon may relinquish the
GM job. If that decision is imminent, Jacobs said he will endorse
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' Jacobs said. ``I am confident that Mike
O'Connell has the brain power to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that some 450 miles to the east, Bruins fans are
villifying him, Jacobs acknowledged what he called ``the rhetoric''
among the disgruntled legions. He knows that Bruins Country is
unhappy, incensed most of late by Bourque's departure. He
acknowledges his club could be in for a sizeable hit at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as things look, said Jacobs, he has seen worse in his
25-year tenure as club owner. He bristled at the suggestion that
now might be the time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean get out of it?'' Jacobs said. ``Ain't gonna happen.
I'm in this sport for a long time. I think it's a terrific
franchise, I really do. We are stayers. This is not bleak. It's not
good, what's happened this year. But this is bright on the all-time
list of bleakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Much worse, said Jacobs, were the late 1980s and early '90s when
Boston politics threatened to prevent him from building his $160
million arena on Causeway Street. Worse was Bobby Orr's departure
as a free agent to Chicago in the summer of '76. If Orr's departure
registered a 10 on the scale of bleakness, he said, then today's
travails max out around a 7 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad right now, too, don't get me wrong,'' Jacobs said.
``But not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jacobs, business dipped considerably in the wake of
the 1996-97 bottoming out that resulted in the Bruins missing the
playoffs for the first time since 1966-67. He said business fell
off by as much as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's a lot in this business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If pundits are to be believed, the fallout from this season's
``freefall,'' as Jacobs terms it, could rival the apathy that came
in light of Orr's departure. At the moment, said Jacobs, he has no
hard evidence that the rhetoric among the vox populi will translate
into empty seats. Despite how it translates, he doesn't sound like
a man about to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people would love to hear me say, `Blow it up and
rebuild it.' That's not going to be the case,'' he said. ``But we
do have to make changes. We have a tremendous fan base, and they
have not gotten what they bargained for in the Boston Bruins. And
they have stuck with us. And, frankly, I've never seen Bruins fans
stick with the Bruins like they have this year. I know to some that
sounds like so much (expletive), but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to be more specific, Jacobs would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me, `Where's the beef?' '' he said. ``And I have
to say I have (Sinden and O'Connell) to make those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the points that most angers fans is the perception,
supported by financial publications, that the Bruins are a cash
cow. Why, fans ask, doesn't Jacobs plow some of the profit back
into the product? He acknowledged that the Bruins rank in the top
third of NHL clubs for profits and the bottom third for payroll.
That profit now, he said, offers the opportunity to repair some of
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not hammerlocked here by financial restrictions,'' he
said. ``We don't have the issues some teams, like Ottawa and
Pittsburgh, have encountered. We have some (financial) latitude,
and in a prudent way, these things (changes in the way the club is
managed and spends money) will take place.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Bourque, Jacobs said he was sorry to see the
club icon depart town. He said he was surprised by Bourque's
request to be traded, and he interpreted it as a measure of
Bourque's frustration with his own game and the lack of team
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bourque was a wonderful player for us for 20-21 years _ just
an unbelieveable, remarkable player,'' he said. ``He's almost 40
years old, and I think he's had his playing career. I had no idea
he wanted to leave Boston. Until he asked to leave, I thought he
would never leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he is frustrated . . . I think with himself and
with the team around him. I'm not sure how much of that is the team
around him. We wound up with some skilled players in return, and I
am happy we were able to harvest something in his departure.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bourque, who will become a free agent July 1, wants to return
to Boston, Jacobs says the opportunity will be there. ``As far as I
am concerned, he will always be welcomed as a Boston Bruin,'' he
said. ``I'd like to see him back in uniform. But at the same time,
I think that's highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if Bourque wants to return next season at his current
wage of $6 million a year? ``I think that's up to Harry,'' he said,
``and then the question is, is he a $6 million-a-year player?''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque for years has worked with the belief that a job would
await him in Boston after his playing days. His departure Monday to
the Avalanche shouldn't change that assumption, said Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still would be welcomed back,'' he said. ``We would like to
see him come back to Boston and have a future in our organization.
What capacity that would be, other than skating, I'm not sure. But
we know he is a special person.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was unfazed by suggestions that Bourque was let down by
being dealt to Colorado, considering his stated first choice was
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like him to be where he'd like to be, but we also have a
bigger responsibility to the Boston Bruins,'' Jacobs said. ``In
that situation, he's an asset to the Bruins. At his age, he's doing
well. He's made a fortune, and he should be happy. The worst thing
we could have done was to look back and feel we shorted the team.
Then next year, you'd have to deal with the fact that you're short
skilled players _ and we aren't now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs criticized the coaching staff weeks ago, expressing to
Globe columnist Will McDonough his displeasure with the club's
penalty-killing woes _ remarks that seemed to trigger the season's
unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am suspect as hell about everything,'' said Jacobs. ``You
look at someone like Pat Burns _ a very competent guy _ with
wonderful credentials and all . . . and you look at this this from
so many directions . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs then changed the course of the conversation to O'Connell.
``I think he is showing he's more reactionary (than Sinden) at this
point . . . and Harry's been the one who's more moderate, saying,
`Let's ride this a little longer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this could be construed as O'Connell being more
interested in canning the coach than Sinden, Jacobs said, ``I think
(O'Connell) wants to make more changes, but . . . I don't know if
changing Burns is the right thing, I really don't. I mean, we've
had bad coaches before.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad coaches, according to Jacobs, were Don Cherry and Steve
Kasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't fond of Kasper,'' said the owner. ``I know Harry
thinks he's a bright guy. I didn't think his players believed in
him. And Cherry did foolish things. At the end, his `I'm out of
here' thing . . . his nutty. I didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Revisting his comments weeks ago about the lapsed penalty
killing, Jacobns said he was not being directly critical of Burns'
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was critical, but it wasn't of Burns, really,'' he said.
``What I said, and I still feel, is that I don't think you go from
first to last (in penalty killing) with the same group of people.
With the exception of Tim Taylor, things were the same _ and I just
don't see how you go from first to last. Now, I don't know if
that's the coach, or what it is. But by process of elimination, I
guess you end up criticizing the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly during the interview, Jacobs said he felt this club
has underperformed. Time and again he referred to the club's young,
core talent and how he believes it should perform better. On a
positive note, he said he thought Joe Thornton's play improved
considerably, something, he conjectured, that might not have
happened if Taylor played those minutes. On a negative note, he
said Sergei Samsonov's play has tailed off considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very discouraging, isn't it?'' said Jacobs. ``But I
think there's a better player in there. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start this season, said Jacobs, he wasn't pleased
with his club's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from Day 1 this season, this team has
underperformed,'' he said. ``From the start, we looked like we we
weren't fit, like we couldn't skate _ things you just couldn't
expect after what we saw last year.''
</P>
<P>
   If the problem isn't coaching, as so many of the owners'
comments seem to suggest, what will that say about this season and
the future of the club?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we've got to dig deeper, don't we?'' he said. ``Then we
really have to start over.''

YANKEES SKIPPER IS FEELING RENEWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ An honest-to-God, Standing-Room-Only,
record-setting crowd of 7,132 jammed City Of Palms Park Wednesday.
Who was in town? Well, as my mother used to say, ``You get three
guesses, and the first two don't count.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was the Yankees. Some of 'em, anyway. There was no
Derek Jeter, no Bernie Williams, no Paul O'Neill, no Chuck
Knoblauch, and no need to duck if you were sitting behind first
base. (Hey, he's a Yankee, so there's no such thing as a cheap
shot.) It was just March 8, and it was just spring training, so it
wasn't going to be the full Yankee lineup the Red Sox will be
looking at when the teams play their first serious game of the 2000
season May 26 in New York. In spring training, the guiding
principle when it comes to ticket buying is caveat emptor, and
don't you forget it. The Yankees had played in Tampa Tuesday night,
so they almost went into a split-squad mode for this one. Even Don
Zimmer didn't come.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Joe Torre did, and that meant that the New York
organization was going to be represented with the maximum amount of
class and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The genial skipper had to make sure he had packed his sense of
humor, too, because the team he brought was 0-6, as in winless.
Rumor had it that The Boss was not amused, and never mind that last
year's world champions were 14-19 down here, or that the 125-win
juggernaut of two seasons ago was a modest 15-12 in the Grapefruit
League. George Steinbrenner is not noted for his clear perspective
in these matters.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that WBZ's John Miller cracked a little wise with the
opening query for Torre. ``If you lose today, will you have to walk
back to Tampa?'' Miller inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask George about that,'' Torre said with a
smile. ``But I brought some money so I can take a cab.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that when Roberto Kelly's ground out brought
home Rafael Bournigal (double, stolen base) from third in the third
inning, it represented the Yankees' first lead of the spring. (As
the late Mel Allen would say, ``How about that!'') And further let
the record show the manager was able to occupy his regular seat on
the bus back to Tampa after his team put a 10-4 whuppin' on the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   No Yankee follower with half a baseball brain should have been
unduly concerned about the results of a few exhibition games. But
as Torre explained when asked about the basic daily difference
between managing the Yankees and the other big league clubs he's
been in charge of (Mets, Braves, and Cardinals), the Yankees are
not your normal baseball anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're working for George,'' Torre pointed out. ``You have to
be aware that anything can break out at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that working for the George Steinbrenner
Yankees means you have, shall we say, resources. ``I am very
grateful to be working for George,'' Torre insisted. ``If I
weren't, I wouldn't have three (World Series) rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre's Yankees have had their depth weakened in the offseason,
and there is always a question about the health of pitching ace
David Cone, but they remain the favorites to win the American
League East. The difference, Torre says, is the identity of his
chief threat. He thinks he was looking at them Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at this time I didn't consider the Red Sox to be the
chief competition,'' said Torre. ``I was totally wrong. Jimy
(Williams) had that team playing all-out, every day. There is no
question that I am looking at Boston as the team we are going to
have to beat this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre then began to wax eloquent on the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry.
``It's a healthy thing for sports,'' he said. ``You ask the people
at Fenway, and they'll say it's always been there. They talk about
our rivalry with the Mets, but I don't feel it. I hate that
interleague play for that. They make more of it than it is. But
there's no question, with the Red Sox versus the Yankees. It's city
against city. You've got the connection of Babe Ruth. That's a
pretty good connection, considering that Babe Ruth saved baseball,
and he was a pretty important part of both organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forwarding a bit to recent past, as well as the present,
Torre lavished more praise on the Red Sox, saying he and his staff
had their eye on the Sox even before the famous Boston three-game
sweep in Yankee Stadium in September. ``I'm not saying they were
the most talented team,'' Torre said. ``I'm talking about how they
went about their business. The two teams that played the hardest,
all the time, were the Mets and the Red Sox. They battled for every
at-bat. They were tough outs. There was never a time where you sat
there and said, `We'll get through this inning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing in particular that Torre likes about the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Mary Ryan hint: three guesses, and the first two
don't count.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro, OK?
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes everybody else on that staff better,'' Torre said.
``The rest of them know they only have to win 10 or 12 (games). It
was very nice that we didn't have to face him in Game 1 of our
(American League Championship) series. I realize that without his
pitching in the fifth game of the other series the Red Sox wouldn't
even have been there. We were 11-1 in the postseason, but I say we
should be thought of as 11-0. The game we lost to him shouldn't
count. The old aximom is always true: Good pitching will always
stop good hitting. I was fortunate enough to manage him in the
All-Star Game. It was no contest.''
</P>
<P>
   This week is the first anniversary of his prostate cancer
diagnosis. ``You definitely have a different outlook on life,'' he
acknowledged. ``When I get stressed now, I start thinking about how
it's just a game. But then it gets to be the bottom of the seventh,
and you would definitely sell your soul to get another win.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, be happy for Joe Torre that the Yankees pulled this game
out. It's 125 miles to Tampa, and even a big league manager might
not have had a wad on him large enough to cover that cab ride.

WHY I VOTED FOR BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the most exciting Republican presidential primary in my
lifetime came to town this week, and I voted for . . . Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, let me rephrase that: I voted against Al Gore. With his
disgraceful truckling to the race-baiting Al Sharpton, Bradley
disqualified himself months ago as a worthy contender for
president; I could never have been for him, even if he hadn't been
the most left-wing candidate in the race. But it was clear by
Tuesday that Bradley was about to exit the race, so it was safe to
vote for him as a way of protesting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Gore didn't notice my protest. So why for the
first time since I began voting in presidential elections did I
boycott the GOP presidential primary? Voters by the millions
swarmed to the John McCain-George W. Bush showdown, and I couldn't
bring myself to vote for either one?
</P>
<P>
   Well _ no.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly I would prefer either man to the Democrats' champion.
I am not sure the country can withstand four more years of what
McCain dubbed ``the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.'' If it isn't universally obvious by now just how dishonest
and ruthless the vice president can be in the pursuit of power, it
will be by November.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans owe the voters more than candidates who are
merely not as bad as the incumbents. And for all the excitement and
energy of the GOP contest, neither McCain nor Bush, it seemed to me
on Tuesday, had made the case that he was the right man to
recapture the White House for his party.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, a Republican nominee ought to have a clear
philosophy of governance. It ought to be evident that there are
basic conservative principles that would be the cornerstone of his
presidency. Yet who can say, even now, what the cornerstone of a
Bush or McCain administration would be?
</P>
<P>
   ``What Does W. Stand For?'' asked The New Republic in a headline
last spring. It was a question no one seemed able to answer, least
of all the candidate. Well into the summer, Bush was flatly
refusing to take stands on issues. ``I will be glad to answer all
those questions once I get out in the course of the campaign,'' he
would say when reporters asked for his views. All the while, of
course, he was raising millions of dollars and collecting
endorsements by the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he began delivering formal speeches and issuing
position papers. But to this day, it is far from apparent that
there is a core of ideas that informs Bush's approach to
government, or that he has given much thought to why he wants to be
president. And he often sounds hopelessly out of his depth. Does he
have an opinion, he was asked late last year, on Russia's prime
minister, Vladimir Putin? ``I really don't,'' Bush answered. ``I
will if I'm the president.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush's Republican philosophy of government was murky,
meanwhile, McCain's was nonexistent. With few exceptions, the only
issues on which he carved out clear positions were the ones on
which he abandoned his party's conservative ideology of limited
government and greater freedom. On campaign finance and tobacco, he
stood for a vast increase in federal power; on taxes, he came out
against meaningful cuts in every bracket, the only path to genuine
relief.
</P>
<P>
   As Rich Lowry of National Review astutely observed, McCain
campaigned for president largely on the way he campaigned for
president. Instead of running on issues, he ran on mood and feel:
Vote for me because I'm an insurgent, because I pledge to clean up
politics, because I'll return your government to you, because I'm
ornery and unscripted, because I'm not your typical Republican.
Independents and Democrats, especially those in the press, loved
hearing a Republican talk this way. But for conservatives and
traditional Republicans, McCain was like Oakland: There was no
there there.
</P>
<P>
   What kept me away from the GOP primary, though, was more than
just the mush at the heart of the Bush and McCain campaigns. I was
also repelled by the candidates' cheap shots and nasty attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot remember a Republican primary fight that sank to the
depths of this one. Slimy e-mails accusing McCain of fathering
illegitimate children. Sleazy ``Catholic voter alerts'' implying
that Bush is a Protestant bigot. Ronald Reagan's famous 11th
Commandment has always been honored more in the breach than the
observance. But McCain and Bush went way past the foul line in
speaking ill of their fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Texas governor deserved a smack for making his stand
at Bob Jones University _ but an unhinged assault on Jerry Falwell
and Pat Robertson as ``forces of evil'' and ``agents of
intolerance'' who resemble Sharpton and the vile Louis Farrakhan?
And sure, it was fair to whack McCain from the left, since he was
wooing left-leaning voters _ but to slam him as a foe of clean air?
Or an enemy of women with breast cancer? At their worst, these two
behaved like disciples of Al Gore. And it is Gore who will benefit
from the wounds they inflicted on their party.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of scandal and deceit in the executive branch,
this campaign season was tailor-made for an inspiring Republican
message of honesty, hopefulness, decency, and liberty. What Bush
and McCain produced was something rather different. Something
rather less. It was nothing I cared to vote for.

<P>
   DIBIL, Lebanon _ A journey into Israeli-occupied southern
Lebanon, the last active front in the Arab-Israeli wars, begins on
a road so perilous that only one taxi driver will brave it.
</P>
<P>
   The potholed pavement winds into the craggy folds of the
nine-mile-wide zone occupied by Israel and its proxy militia, the
South Lebanon Army. Then it rises through exposed terrain where
Islamic guerrillas have repeatedly planted their weapon of choice:
roadside bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, especially in the south where the military and
diplomatic conflicts play out among Israel, Syria, and the
Hezbollah, people fear where they are headed at this crossroads of
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very afraid of the future here,'' said Boutros
Habib, 72, the lone taxi driver on the route he calls ``sure
death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what will happen down the road,'' Habib said.
``But right now people are fearing the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government made it clear
Sunday that with or without a peace agreement with Syria, Israel
will pull its forces out of Lebanon unilaterally in July. The
Cabinet vote was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, this looks like a victory for the Shiite
Hezbollah fighters who have long fought the Israeli occupation, and
it would seem to offer relief to an Israeli public weary of the
18-year military presence in Lebanon. But this is Lebanon, and
things are almost never what they seem.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a unilateral withdrawal has sharply increased
apprehension on all sides, creating a volatile situation that
analysts and diplomats warn could ignite into a wider conflict
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Apprehension is most acute among the 2,000 soldiers of the South
Lebanon Army. The Israeli-paid Lebanese militia and their families
are seen as collaborators by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
``Party of God.'' The South Lebanon Army soldiers fear a bloodbath
of revenge once the Israelis are gone. A week ago, Hezbollah
sharply tightened the noose on the militia when it killed five
soldiers in one ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the zone, Lebanese and Israeli analysts alike are also
fearful. They worry that a unilateral pullout by Israel will be a
dangerous gambit in the diplomatic exchanges between Israel and
Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon and effectively runs the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, warned last
week that if Israel withdraws without a peace agreement with Syria,
it is likely to be a bloody and incomplete solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chance of deterioration and broad confrontation,''
Sneh told reporters in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, Mohammad Raad, the head of Hezbollah's political
bureau, said: ``An Israeli withdrawal without an agreement with
Syria is not a serious proposal. This is not possible from our
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, a group of 500 active Shiite Muslim soldiers, took on
the vaunted Israeli military machine and dragged it into a
guerrilla war of attrition, and now the guerrillas appear to be on
the verge of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that while some in Hezbollah trumpeted victory this
week following the Israeli Cabinet's pullout vote, the cheering was
muted _ the lack of enthusiasm a sign of how much Hezollah is
beholden to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   And in the strongest comments from either Beirut or Damascus
since the Israeli Cabinet vote, the Lebanese information minister,
Anwar Khalil, said this week, ``Either it is a comprehensive, just
and lasting peace, or it will not be peace at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lebanon would give no guarantee of peace to Israel until
Syrian demands for the return of the Golan are satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say a wider crisis in the peace process is looming if
the interlocking triangle of negotiations among Israel, Syria, and
Lebanon comes undone.
</P>
<P>
   Without a peace deal, said a senior diplomat in the region, a
unilateral Israeli pullout could lead to an ``apocalyptic''
scenario in which Syria, deprived of the negotiating lever that the
occupation of south Lebanon provides, becomes desperate to find
another way to pressure Israel.
</P>
<P>
   One line of thinking holds that Syria, which is trying to secure
the return of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967, could
turn to other militants, perhaps Palestinian groups based in
refugee camps, to reopen hostilities along Israel's northern
border. Hezbollah, the diplomat said, is likely to become
preoccupied with securing a political future in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, the diplomat said, Israel could be drawn back
into a wider conflict in Lebanon more directly involving Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very real fear here,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   While diplomats struggle for a solution to what some have called
Israel's Vietnam, those living in south Lebanon must deal with the
realities of a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the road in south Lebanon, Habib, the taxi driver, peered
through a splintered windshield as he navigated a three-mile
stretch of road where 70 roadside bombs have been planted in recent
years, killing more than 60 members of the South Lebanon Army or
civilians connected to them.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs are frequently planted in simulated rocks made of
plastic, then detonated by remote control. The sides of the road
are combed and cleared daily by specially equipped tractors. But
they can't check every rock.
</P>
<P>
   Habib pointed to an overturned South Lebanon Army personnel
carrier hit by a Hezbollah bomb last June, just as the militia
pulled out of the town of Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
   That episode is cited as a model of Hezbollah restraint
following Israeli and South Lebanon Army troop withdrawals. Islamic
fighters stayed out of the largely Christian town. There have been
no reports of reprisal killings. Many of the about 200
rank-and-file militia soldiers in Jezzine turned themselves in to
Lebanese authorities to face charges of treason. Most served six
months in prison, although some have been sentenced to several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Saad was a sergeant in the South Lebanon Army for 11 years
before he turned himself in last June. He served six months and
says he feels no shame about being viewed as a collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed of trying to feed my kids,'' said Saad.
</P>
<P>
   Israel paid him $400 a month in cash for his services as a cook
in the barracks. Now he makes $200 a month serving tea in a
restaurant. The Lebanese government is doing very little to offer
economic opportunity in south Lebanon, he says. If Jezzine is a
model for the future, he adds, the future looks bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Jezzine, the road continues south into the center of the
occupied zone, which echoes daily with the thud of Israeli missiles
slamming into hillsides in the hit-and-run conflict with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the mists of an early-morning fog rises the Crusader-era
fortress known as Beaufort Castle. The 12th-century fort, atop the
most strategic plateau in southern Lebanon, was once held by
Europeans fighting to reclaim the Holy Land from Islamic conquest.
Today the crumbling remains are a central command post for the
Israeli army and the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerabilities Israel would face if it pulled out of
Lebanon without a solid peace agreement with Syria are evident as
the road turns close along the border. From there, the orange tile
roofs of the neat white-stucco neighborhoods of the northern
Israeli town of Tel Hi are plainly visible. An Israeli farmer can
be seen working the fields of a nearby kibbutz.
</P>
<P>
   The road then turns west into the little town called Dibil in
the rocky hills. It is the heart of South Lebanon Army territory
and the hometown of the militia's recently assassinated field
commander, Akel Hashem.
</P>
<P>
   The current escalation in the zone began with the killing of
Hashem, who was blown up while tending to a garden near his home.
While he was being buried, Hezbollah killed three Israeli soldiers,
then picked off three more in the following days. The deaths left
Israel mourning its fallen soldiers and watching television news
footage that looked hauntingly like Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bravado of some South Lebanon Army soldiers, there
are signs of growing panic even in a stronghold like Dibil. There
is an active black market in forged passport documents. South
Lebanon Army commanders are not expecting the sympathetic treatment
the Lebanese government allowed the rank-and-file soldiers of
Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Hashem, the slain commander, widow, Layya, was
dressed in black.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband always told us that Israel would not leave without
establishing security. I have to believe that now,'' she said,
surrounded by her two sons and Hashem's six brothers, all of them
prominent fighters in the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the brothers drove to to Hashem's grave on the edge of
town. They had to weld his crypt shut, they said, because Hezbollah
leaders have said that a collaborator like Hashem should not be
allowed to be buried in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As the taxi driver pulled away from the grave, he said: ``They
are afraid that in the end there will be no law here, just revenge
killing by one family against another. I can see that happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to really end the fighting is for both Israel and
Syria to leave us alone and let Lebanon rule Lebanon.``

GRISHAM'S ``BRETHREN'' DISAPPOINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BRETHREN 
By John Grisham 
Doubleday, 366 pp., $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Grisham's readers love him because he understands the
criminal mind _ and understands that some ``respectable'' people
like lawyers have criminal minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brethren,'' Grisham's 11th novel (not counting his
serial-in-progress), is unusual among his books because just about
everyone in it has a criminal mind. There are virtually no
sympathetic characters _ there's not a cute kid in sight, nor a
feisty woman, nor an innocent who has wandered into some
elaborately nefarious plot. Just about everybody is creepy, and the
suspense of the story lies in discovering whether the small-time
crooks are smarter than the big players.
</P>
<P>
   There are two plots that collide at an intersection no one saw
coming up. Three former judges, ``the brethren,'' are doing time in
a soft federal prison in Florida. They are providing for their
sunset years by running an extortion scheme. They have placed a
classified ad in a gay magazine, Out &AMP; About, and maneuver wealthy
closeted men into compromising correspondence with two nonexistent
troubled young men, Ricky and Percy, who are trying to get
straight. Then the brethren spring the trap _ pay up, or the
correspondence becomes public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the wheelchair-bound head of the CIA has determined
to buy a presidential election, and he has identified a pliable and
apparently spotless candidate in the House of Representatives. But
once the wheels have been set whirring, the CIA learns that its
candidate has been maintaining a private mailbox and an even more
private correspondence with ``Ricky.'' The interests of the CIA and
the brethren do not coincide, and what happens next is for Grisham
to know and his readers to find out.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of his readers are going to be disappointed. Not
because anyone reads Grisham for distinction of style. ``For an
early dinner he was whisked away to Mortimer's, the current power
place to be seen, just down Pennsylvania, where he met Elaine
Tyner, the lawyer running D-PAC. Over fruit and cottage cheese she
laid out the current financials of the newest PAC on the block.
Cash in hand of $29 million, no significant debt, money being
churned around the clock, coming in from all directions, from
everywhere in the world . . .'' _ Grisham is capable of going on
like that for pages.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the disappointment a matter of verisimilitude: It's been
a long time since plausibility was one of Grisham's strong points.
``The Brethren'' does push the envelope, though _ quite literally,
because one turning point of the story comes when someone stuffs a
card into the wrong envelope and mails it, just as a character
might have done in a creaky Gothic romance written by Mrs.
Radcliffe back in the 18th century. One would like to think that
blackmailing prominent gay men today wouldn't be quite as easy as
it would have been 50 years ago _ but then, one would like to
believe presidential elections can't be bought as blatantly as they
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   What one does expect from Grisham is a measure of excitement.
But who can get excited by characters this shallowly drawn and this
transparently wicked? They don't even seem to have fun being bad.
The moral lines are crazed, and there's not even an elementary
sense of rough justice in play. The book isn't exactly homophobic,
but it makes it seem that the victims of the extortion scheme are
getting what's coming to them, if only because they're closeted.
The mechanics of Grisham's plot are creaky and awkward; he writes
himself into corners, then tricks his way out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham has a little wit and he lets it flash out occasionally.
``A liberal is a conservative who's been arrested,'' the writer
observes. His attempts at more sustained satire are pretty feeble.
The presidential hopefuls show up for a debate. ``Tarry wore a navy
suit his wife had selected, with the standard blue shirt and the
standard red and blue tie. Lake wore a dashing light brown suit, a
white shirt with a spread collar, and a tie of red and maroon and a
half-dozen other colors. The entire ensemble had been put together
by a fashion consultant, and was designed to complement the colors
of the set. Lake's hair had received a tinting. His teeth had been
bleached. He'd spent four hours in a tanning bed.''
</P>
<P>
   But basically it's hard for the reader to feel that Grisham
really cares about this book or anyone in it. Grisham's audience
wants to see hypocrites get what's coming to them, but there are
few hypocrites in this book; everyone is openly trying to
manipulate everyone else, and Grisham has forgotten who his
audience is. Until now, he has always delivered sympathy for the
little guy who is being screwed by the system, and that is what has
won him legions of readers who feel that way about themselves,
readers who mistrust the system and its official representatives _
the millions of us who repeat lawyer jokes. It's tricky to write a
book about people we love to hate if you don't also give us someone
we really like.

&HT;     GOVERNMENT MOVES TO GUARD SNAKE HABITAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A shy black snake with yellow-orange racing
stripes known only in the valleys and foothills of Alameda and
Contra Costa counties just may stop or delay major construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to designate 406,708 acres
of Northern California as habitat for the rare Alameda whipsnake
may present roadblocks for big developments, environmentalists and
home builders said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for developers is that the remaining populations of
the fast-moving whipsnake live in places like the Hayward Hills and
Orinda, all hotly pursued for upscale housing subdivisions and golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary threat to the whipsnake is the proposed
development on private land,'' said Jeff Miller, a spokesman for
the Center for Biological Diversity in Berkeley. ``If you look at a
map of the East Bay, and you look at the large chunks of open
space, it almost completely corresponds with remaining whipsnake
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Biological Diversity and another nonprofit
organization, Christians Caring for Creation, sued the Fish and
Wildlife Service last year, winning protection for the snake's
habitat in an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for the new habitat, released Wednesday, would not
mandate preserves. However, it would make some land harder to
develop since builders typically need federal permits to change
streams or wetlands. And those permits could not be issued without
Fish and Wildlife Service approval.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is taking comments on the proposal and intends to
decide in September.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot snake that feeds on lizards, rattlesnakes, mice and
birds was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in
December 1997. The snake isn't poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that its habitat has diminished but not how many
of the reptiles are left in the world. Clearing grassland,
chaparral and oak savanna with mechanical equipment for houses,
roads, grazing and fire control is a main killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the activities that are harmful to the whipsnake are
already being regulated just because of the fact that it's on the
threatened species list,'' said Patricia Foulk, a spokeswoman for
the Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   The snake's important habitats are in Alameda, Contra Costa,
Santa Clara and San Joaquin counties.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Bjerke, a spokesman for the Home Builders Association of
Northern California, said members were reviewing the documents and
would submit comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're concerned any time additional designations
are made,'' Bjerke said. ``Our builders do everything they can to
comply with the Endangered Species Act. However, it's not easy. The
amount of additional paperwork, in many cases, stops or delays a
project. Often times, when a particular animal or plant gains
endangered status, it becomes an expensive game to figure out
whether it exists on a particular piece of property or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that it was more than a game. ``When our native
species start to disappear, we have to start worrying about what
we're doing to the air, to the land, to the water,'' he said.
``Ultimately, if we can't keep intact healthy habitat for other
species, we're probably not keeping healthy habitat for
ourselves.''

FOX-TROTTING AROUND THE TABOO OF EXIT POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's 3 p.m. on Super Tuesday, and from the bowels of
a cramped war room crammed with computers, John Ellis makes a
conference call to more than a dozen Fox News staffers. The
commodity he has is the precious currency of political junkies and
highly competitive news outlets _ exit poll results.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, a consultant, writer, and former Globe columnist (and
cousin of George W. Bush) starts the rough state-by-state rundown.
In Georgia, Al Gore leads Bill Bradley by an 8-2 margin and Bush
has a 2-1 lead over John McCain; in Vermont it's Gore and McCain by
6-4 margins; in Ohio, it's Gore by 7-3 and Bush by 6-4; in
Connecticut and Maine, the GOP primary is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   But ``if you're a Bradley fund-raiser,'' he announces with some
finality, ``you give up.''
</P>
<P>
   While foreshadowing the day's winners and losers, Ellis, who is
running Fox's exit poll operation, is not parceling out the actual
point spreads between the candidates. Perhaps that has something to
do with the fact that exit poll numbers _ and the premature leaking
of them _ has become one of the big media flaps of this campaign
season.
</P>
<P>
   It started when the online magazine Slate (www.slate.com) posted
New Hampshire primary exit polls on election day afternoon,
assailing the ``elite'' media's agreement to keep them from the
public until after the polls close as a paternalistic charade. (The
exit polls are provided by the Voter News Service, a consortium
that includes ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated
Press.)
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent primaries, the exit poll taboo has been shattered
by the National Review Web site (www.nationalreview.com) and the
Drudge Report (www.drudgereport.com). And the media debate has
raged. On the same day that Washington Post polling director
Richard Morin wrote a column criticizing the ``self-aggrandizing
'Net journalists'' who spilled the exit poll beans, the Post ran an
editorial defending Slate's decision as legitimate journalistic
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fox News chairman Roger Ailes issued a memo warning
staffers to keep exit poll results to themselves and reiterating
Fox's policy not to ``broadcast, publish or disseminate outcome
projections'' based on exit poll data before poll closings.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office Tuesday, preparing for his cable network's
crucial election night coverage, Ailes says that Fox News Channel
is ``in the game. For a new network, a brand new network, we're
highly competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, being highly competitive in the news game not
only means being prepared to call primary elections the second the
polls close, but to use a clever choreography of cues and code to
suggest the outcome even before they close.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 4 p.m., Fox News executive producer Marty Ryan
stops by Ellis's operation for a briefing. Bush is slated for an
8:40 p.m. interview with Fox News managing editor Brit Hume, and
Ellis and Ryan figure that by then, the network will be able to
call the winner in at least seven primaries. The team already knows
that Bush has won in Georgia, Ohio, Maryland, Missouri, and among
California's Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bush's Fox interview rolls around, Ellis promises,
``he'll be in a good mood.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., Ellis heads upstairs to a conference room to meet
with Fox News executives and on-air talent _ Hume, Paula Zahn,
Morton Kondracke, Fred Barnes, Tony Snow, and Michael Barone. He
stresses the states where the GOP primary is still too tough to
call: Maine, New York, and Rhode Island. As for the California
``beauty contest,'' which features a nonbinding popular vote, he
offers a solemn warning. There may be no victor until the wee hours
of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a consensus has formed. It's a big night for Bush. And
just as Hume begins his 6 p.m. Fox News Channel election special _
one hour before the early polls close _ he says Bush and Gore
``seemed poised to all but end the races in both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the news gets worse for McCain. Snow reveals some of
the telling nonhorse-race results in the exit polls. McCain's
unfavorable ratings are going up and so is the perception that he
was launching unfair attacks on Bush. Traveling with Bush,
correspondent Carl Cameron says the governor will deliver ``a
victory speech tonight.'' Fox's David Shuster, with the McCain
campaign, paints a gloomier picture.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Hume asks whether a ``victorious Bush (can) count
on the many voters who supported McCain.'' By a few minutes after 6
p.m., without calling a single winner in a single state, Hume and
company have effectively interred McCain.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:50 p.m., an ``Alert'' flashes on the screen announcing that
Fox News will call the Georgia and Vermont primaries at 7 p.m. The
rest of the day's preparation pays off as the dominoes fall. At
7:30 sharp, Fox calls Ohio for Bush followed a half-hour later by
calls for Bush in Missouri and Maryland and for McCain in
Connecticut and Massachusetts. Five minutes later, a
too-close-to-call state has finally tipped. It's Maine for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:40 p.m., Bush, now his party's presumptive nominee, begins
his interview with Hume from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, I'm really proud of what we've done
tonight,'' Bush declares. Like Ellis predicted five hours earlier,
the Texas governor is definitely in a good mood.

STILL NOT USING USENET? TRY IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes I assume too much. Now that Internet use is routine, I
occasionally suppose that all of you know the basics, such as how
to find valuable information via Usenet.
</P>
<P>
   In January, I bemoaned the fact that few Internet newcomers get
onto the Usenet system. In came a host of e-mails from people who'd
love to sign on, if they only knew how.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday, I wrote a piece for The Boston Globe's tech Web
site at www.digitalmass.com, on Microsoft Corp.'s excellent Usenet
tech support system. Sure enough, more readers were bemused. What
is this Usenet thing, and how do I sign up?
</P>
<P>
   Very well, then. Back to basics.
</P>
<P>
   The Usenet is a worldwide computer network that was founded in
1979. Originally, it had nothing to do with the Internet; it was
just a way for graduate students at the University of North
Carolina and Duke University to send messages to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Usenet is made up of hundreds of thousands of
interconnected machines called news servers. Millions of messages
are published on these servers every day, and they can be read by
anyone with access to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Messages are divided into tens of thousands of categories,
called newsgroups. People find the newsgroup topics that interest
them, and then hang around to swap comments and complaints with
like-minded folk worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Newsgroups have odd-sounding names that tell you what kinds of
messages you'll find there. The names generally begin with an
abbreviation that hints at what the group is about; ``rec'' for
recreation, ``comp'' for computer-related issues, and so on. If
you're a trucker outraged by the high price of diesel fuel, you'd
post your gripes at misc.transport.truckers. If you're sick of
Windows 98 crashing all the time, go to
microsoft.public.win98.performance.
</P>
<P>
   Internet providers run their own news servers, where subscribers
post messages. Each server ``propagates'' copies of the messages it
collects, sending them to other servers, which pass them on to
still others. In the end, copies of one message will pop up on
Usenet computers all over the planet. It's a sloppy system, but it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Signing on to Usenet can take a little effort. First, you must
ask your Internet provider for the name of its news server. Mine,
for instance, is called news.monitortan.com. Then, you plug this
information into a newsreader _ the software that allows you to
read Usenet messages.
</P>
<P>
   Newsreaders are included with the two leading Web browsers,
America Online Inc.'s Netscape Communicator and Microsoft's
Internet Explorer. Both programs can be set up in about a minute,
even by a newbie. Plug in the news server information and a few
other details, like your e-mail address, then connect to the
Internet. There will be a delay of several minutes, while your
computer downloads a list of all available newsgroups. But after
that, you'll be ready to hit the Usenet.
</P>
<P>
   There are simpler alternatives. AOL subscribers can use that
service's built-in Usenet system. It's crude compared to a decent
newsreader, but it gets the job done.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are companies that offer Usenet service directly
through the Web. I wrote about one of them, Talkway, in January.
Talkway.com has found so little interest in their Usenet services
that they're branching out into other fields. The same has happened
at the granddaddy of Web-based Usenet services, Deja.com. Visit its
home pages and you'll see hardly a sign of anything Usenet-related.
Too bad, because they're excellent gateways for the Usenet
beginner.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Web-based Usenet access is limited. For instance, some
Usenet groups feature pictures and music clips embedded into
messages. There's a lot of porn here, but some decent stuff as
well. But you need a good newsreader program to decode these
messages; the Web-based Usenet services can't handle them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a newsreader program won't notify you when someone
responds to one of your messages. The Web-based Usenet services
will fire off an e-mail to let you know. By the by, Deja.com
maintains an index of virtually all Usenet messages. So watch what
you write; it could come back to haunt you.
</P>
<P>
   Usenet isn't that difficult to use, but it still takes a bit
more effort than other Web-based discussion forums. That's one
reason it's languishing. But on the upside, Usenet's quality hasn't
been spoiled by a horde of ignorant newbies, as Internet pioneers
once feared. My favorite technology-oriented newsgroups are as good
as ever, largely because all you amateurs have stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, maybe this column wasn't such a good idea.

BROADCASTERS' HUNGER STRIKE POINTS UP LOW-PAY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ In a rented camper parked outside the area's
top-rated television station, the face of KFTV Channel 21 is
growing gaunt.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Fermin Chavez, who reads the news on two daily broadcasts
and prerecords a third, is down 13 pounds or more. He's dizzy,
weak, and weary. With his camera-friendly cheekbones even more
angular than usual, viewers of the Spanish-language station have
started calling in their concern.
</P>
<P>
   Tugging at his now-loose waistband, Chavez says he would like to
gain back the weight. But even more, he would like to earn what he
considers a decent wage. He says he won't eat until his employer,
the local affiliate of Univision, stops paying starvation wages.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, along with a handful of other unionized on-air
personalities and station engineers, has been on a hunger strike
since Feb. 18. Taking a cue from Central Valley farmworkers who
have fasted to draw attention to their own issues over the years,
the newsroom employees decided to forgo solids in protest of
salaries low enough to qualify some of their families for food
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using us, exploiting us, and we knew we needed to do
something to get everyone's attention,'' said Chavez, 37, the
highest-paid protester at $32,500 a year, but the lowest-paid
anchorman in the Fresno market. ``I don't earn a quarter of what an
anchor for an English-language station earns for one hour of air
time a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The union representing fewer than two dozen anchors, reporters,
news writers, camera operators, and master controllers, has been
trying to hammer out a contract with KFTV since July. The contract
would be the local's first with the station, where employees voted
to join the union by a narrow margin in May 1999. But negotiations
have gone next to nowhere during more than 25 bargaining sessions,
said chief negotiator Carrie Biggs-Adams, who is subsisting on
fruit and vegetable juices and water. She has lost 10 pounds so
far.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the key issue has been wages, which station
employees say are out of line with the market share enjoyed by KFTV
and the earnings power exhibited by Univision, which is the
nation's leading Spanish-language network and is run by Henry
Cisneros. The journalists who compete against them, according to
union officials, earn double or more the salaries paid by KFTV,
which dominates Fresno's Spanish-language market and often tops the
overall ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's offering percentages that look like decent
increases, but they're making next to nothing, so it's a big
percentage of nothing,'' said Biggs-Adams. ``The money being
offered is appallingly low. It's not enough to live on.''
</P>
<P>
   KFTV, for instance, has offered to raise Martin Castellano's pay
to $23,000 a year, from $21,481, she said. Castellano, a master
control operator with 10 years on the job, supports his wife and
three young daughters on that salary _ an amount low enough to
qualify them for public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it, ``The only way I'll start eating again is for them
to pay me enough to eat.'' The union is also upset over what it
considers an overreliance on freelance reporters and other workers.
</P>
<P>
   As it has throughout the hunger strike, now in its 21st day, Los
Angeles-based Univision declined to comment on the protest,
referring calls to KFTV management in Fresno. KFTV, in turn,
reissued a two-paragraph statement saying the station is committed
to good-faith negotiations and is hopeful that a fair settlement
will be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, newsroom employees are trying to pressure
management any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   They spent $385 for a table at a business luncheon where
Cisneros, a former US housing secretary, spoke Feb. 24. If he
agreed to meet with them, their plan was to eat. When he ignored
them, they sent their lunches back to the kitchen. Last weekend,
they picketed outside his Bel Air home. Cisneros was not there, so
they spoke with his neighbors instead.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, the employees take turns picketing in front of KFTV,
where their placards rest against the rented Phoenix Flyer camper
when not in use. Chavez, who has been instructed not to mention the
strike on the air, puts on a suitcoat and tie to go to work, then
puts in time on the picket line. People in the area are starting to
notice, the protesters say, honking when they drive past and
shouting encouragement at camera operators on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Even before a doctor monitoring the hunger strikers began urging
them to eat, they had won wide support among other union members in
the heavily agricultural Central Valley, where about 40 percent of
the residents are of Hispanic descent. Three of the original eight
participants have dropped out of the hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters, such as KFTV reporter Reina Cardenas,
grew up working in the surrounding grape fields, aware of the
struggles of their farmworker parents and the fasts that
now-deceased labor leader Cesar Chavez sometimes staged to draw
attention to their plight.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the current hunger strike came from Fermin Chavez,
the anchorman. But the inspiration came from KFTV management, which
sent pizzas to the pickets one day in December. Chavez says he was
so insulted by the gesture _ fast food rather than fair wages _
that he decided he would rather starve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is not to stop working, even if it's getting hard
to work,'' said Cardenas, 27, a $25,000-a-year reporter who has
dropped 8 pounds from her small frame and now worries about low
blood pressure and heart palpitations. ``What do we need to do to
get them to take us seriously? Do we have to die?''

FED HERO MAY TURN INTO GREENSPAN THE GOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan isn't winning any popularity contests on the
message boards at Raging Bull, an online financial site.
</P>
<P>
   One unhappy investor this week called him a ``scary old
codger.'' Another called him a ``wet noodle.'' Still another,
blaming the Fed chairman for this week's steep decline in the stock
market, said, ``The old fart ought to be doing audits for the
IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raging Bull crowd may not represent mainstream opinion, but
a few months from now, who knows? With his frontal assault on the
economy and the market, Greenspan the hero could yet turn into
Greenspan the goat.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman has said in no uncertain terms that the economy
is growing too fast and that it has to slow down. He has complained
on more than one occasion about the rising stock market and its
impact on consumer spending. He has even worried aloud that too
much productivity growth is contributing to an overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he warned bankers about making loans on the
expectation that the strong economy will stay strong forever.
``Lending granted on that basis could have grave consequences,''
the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   This is standard stuff. When everyone is smiling and feeling
great, we expect the chairman of the Fed to act like Oscar the
Grouch. We also expect him to raise interest rates, which is just
what Greenspan has been doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tightening monetary policy is never a fun job, because to one
degree or another everyone gets hurt,'' said Mark Zandi, chief
economist at RFA Dismal Sciences. But this time around, in addition
to the home builders, home buyers, factory owners, and factory
workers who typically feel the weight of higher interest rates,
Greenspan could face attack from a new set of critics. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Investors. Higher interest rates have always been bad for
stocks. But with so many people invested in stocks, and with so
much attention focused on stock prices, the pain is likely to be
felt more intensely than in years past. Also different today is the
Fed's attitude toward stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has said that he is not targeting stocks, but it is
clear that a market correction would help him slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way he can conduct monetary policy without
factoring in the value of stocks,'' said Fred Breimyer, chief
economist at State Street Bank and Trust Co. in Boston If the
correction gets ugly, and the average American sees the decline
show up in his quarterly 401(k) statment, the investors at Raging
Bull won't be the only ones fuming.
</P>
<P>
   --Defenders of the new economy. Greenspan himself has been one
of the great champions of the new economy. He has given technology
the lion's share of credit for the strong growth and low inflation
of the past five years. But Greenspan has decided that even a new
economy cannot run this fast _ a view that may not sit well with
others.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece he wrote last fall for the Harvard Business Review,
William Sahlman, a Harvard Business School professor, likened
Greenspan to Chicken Little. Both, he said, ``fret for no good
reason.'' Sahlman argued that the new economy was stronger than
people realized and that it would do fine ``if the government just
manages to stay out of its way.''
</P>
<P>
   New economy advocates can point out accurately that inflation
remains hard to spot. In its own survey of economic conditions
released Wednesday, the Fed found only ``limited'' evidence of
rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   --Politicians. When Greenspan was confirmed for a fourth term in
February, only four senators voted against him. All were Democrats
who come out of the William Jennings Bryan populist tradition:
Tight money is bad for the little guy.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign season heats up, however, it would not be
surprising to see more politicians jump on the anti-Greenspan
bandwagon. Democrats and Republicans could join in the attacks,
especially if the economy looks as if it is headed south.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore can be counted on to support Greenspan.
As a mainstream Republican, George W. Bush probably will avoid
criticizing Greenspan, too.
</P>
<P>
   But should Bush begin to fall behind, his position could change.
``A politician who gets desperate might have more incentive to
attack the Fed,'' Zandi said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Greenspan remains quite popular. Many Americans
would agree with President Clinton, who recently praised the Fed
chairman's ``wise and steady leadership.'' And should Greenspan
manage to pull off a soft landing for the economy and the stock
market, he might even enhance his already legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   But if the landing turns out to be a rough one, all bets are
off. Under those circumstances, most people may feel like the
Raging Bull investor who, after watching Greenspan on CNBC
Wednesday, asked: ``Will someone get Greenspan off the screen?''

INTERACTIVE SYSTEM IS THE NEXT WORD IN COMMUNICATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The television pictures were riveting: a wrecked car beside a
river far down a hillside from the highway. A Texas woman and her
baby were trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   Using her cell phone, the mother managed to call for help and
then, because she did not know exactly where she had gone off the
highway she was traveling, stayed in contact with the police until
she heard their sirens wailing high above her.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long it would have been before the wreck was found had
she not had a cell phone, one police officer replied it would have
been found by hunters, weeks later. A second question, unasked but
with an obvious answer, is what would have happened had she been so
injured she could not use her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this, and then say this word: telematics.
</P>
<P>
   Say the word, because it will be coming soon to a vehicle near
you.
</P>
<P>
   Telematics in-vehicle communications systems use satellites and
wireless networks to keep your vehicle in constant link with the
world outside your windshield.
</P>
<P>
   A telematics system in your car will notify monitoring centers
if your airbags deploy and where your car is at the time of the
wreck; you can use it to summon help in an emergency or for basic
roadside assistance; it will track your vehicle if it is stolen; if
you lock your keys in your car, you simply provide a code to the
monitoring center, and the center will unlock the car from afar;
even your doctor's name and your medical records can be kept on
file for use by emergency crews that come to your aid.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just some of the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Already offered or in the works are systems that let mechanical
problems in your car be diagnosed from the center; navigation
systems that can be downloaded, eliminating the need for discs;
systems that download MP3 music from your home computer; systems
that link you to radio stations nationwide, wherever you are, via
satellite; links to thousands of services from restaurants and
hotels to sports venues; and concierge services.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable amid the wonder of this blossoming electronic
benefit is that consumer awareness of these systems is relatively
low right now. General Motors, probably the leader in the field in
getting telematics into its vehicles, has installed about 100,000
units so far. They hope to top a million by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   A look at GM's system, called OnStar, is a vivid glimpse into a
future rapidly becoming the present. GM offers OnStar in models of
the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Saab.
</P>
<P>
   You pay $695 for the system, then $199 per year for a safety and
security package, or $399 per year for more esoteric premium
service.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the 24/7 link with an OnStar center offers you:
</P>
<P>
   With the safety and security package you get MED-NET, which
stores your medical information and can provide it to emergency
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Accident assist links you to an adviser who helps with insurance
issues and police reports.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency, the driver hits a button, a monitor plots the
vehicle's position and sends help from the closest emergency
services provider, such as police or fire and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Remote diagnostics are available if you see a warning light on
your instrument panel. You contact the center, and an operator
there signals the vehicle's computer. It transmits problem codes
and from this determines whether you need immediate roadside
assistance, if it is safe to keep driving until you can find a
garage, or if you can wait until your next regular maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   If your airbags deploy, an emergency signal is sent to the
OnStar center. An operator there will try to communicate with
occupants of the vehicle. If there is no response, or if you report
an emergency, the operator finds you via satellite and sends help.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle is stolen, you call OnStar and an operator
signals the vehicle, finds it, and tracks it. (I have read of other
systems that remotely set off the horn and make the lights flash _
certainly disconcerting to a thief who can't stop these attention
grabbers once they are activated.)
</P>
<P>
   If you get a flat or run out of gas, but don't feel safe leaving
your vehicle, OnStar will send the nearest GM service provider to
your aid.
</P>
<P>
   And if you lock your keys in the car, you call a toll-free
number, give them your code, and a cellular data call from the
operator to your vehicle unlocks the doors.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get a bit more esoteric, opt for Premium
Services. They include:
</P>
<P>
   --Information/Convenience Services in which OnStar advisers tell
you about local hotels, restaurants, and hundreds of other types of
services as you travel.
</P>
<P>
   --A navigation system that pinpoints your location and uses
voice direction to guide you on your way. It will even help you
find your way out of a traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   --And concierge service that will send flowers, book you into
hotels and restaurants, get tickets to sporting events and
entertainment venues, and help you plan a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It won't stop here, and GM certainly will not stand alone.
Already, Ford and Daimler-Chrysler are heavily into telematics.
</P>
<P>
   And once this is added to a voice-activated system that not only
makes phone calls for you, but also connects you to the Internet
for e-mail, sports scores, and stock, news, and weather reports,
the time you spend in your car will be not only safer, but also
time you can spend doing far more than waiting out the ride.

WHY IS HIS NEW SIDEWALK CRUMBLING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Just 18 months ago I installed a concrete sidewalk. Now the
tops are powdering and breaking up. I used a little salt the first
winter, but this winter I used salt substitute. What happened, and
how can I fix it so it won't happen again? Another walk that takes
a lot of salt treatment is 10 years old and in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   FARKIS TOOMAJIAN, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is amazing what salt will do. I used some concrete patio
blocks as raisers for a new step I built just last summer. These
blocks were old, but still in good shape. Or so I thought. We used
a little salt (maybe too much) in that area this winter, and two of
the blocks disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a bad batch of concrete, both in your case
and mine. That is indicated by the fact that one of your walks is
in good shape despite salt treatment. The concrete might have had
too much cement, or too much water when it was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   To fix yours, you could try this: Sweep off all the loose
concrete and apply a bonding agent to the concrete, then appy a
thin layer of hydraulic cement or ordinary mortar, or a sand-mix
concrete. The powdering concrete may cause failure with this, too,
but the bonding agent may help keep things together. If it does
fail, then replace the misbehaving walkway areas.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman is fixing his problem by putting in new blocks,
before someone takes a tumble.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I had a new roof installed last year, a ridge vent was
installed. There was no room for soffit vents, so they were not
installed. This winter, during the rather windy snowfalls, big
piles of snow appeared on the floor of the attic, right under the
ridge vent. There was enough to cause water stains on the ceilings
of the rooms below. How can I prevent that?
</P>
<P>
   MARY LASSEN, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Any vent will leak water or snow, depending on the wind and
its direction. Most ridge vents have deep baffles, deep enough to
prevent the infiltration of rain or snow. Your type (Cobra) is a
quality vent, but may be too short to prevent such infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   Short of putting in a deeper-baffled vent, there are two things
you can try. Hang a long, shallow tray under the full length of the
ridge vent. Any invading snow and water will go onto the tray and
evaporate before the next storm. An alternative is to fasten a 1 x
4 or 1 x 3 board 3 or 4 inches downroof from the vent. This will
allow air to move, but will keep out blown rain and snow.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At a recent antique home show, a man was selling a central
air conditioning system designed to be noninvasive for antique
houses. It uses small vents in the ceiling and costs $18,000, which
includes two cooling coils, the usual outdoor compressor, and
enough vents to serve a 3,000-square-foot house. Is this feasible,
or is it overpriced? Also, there is a lot of dust in my house; the
man said that his system would reduce the dust by 85 percent. Is
that so?
</P>
<P>
   NANCY YOUNG, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is certainly feasible, and the high-speed system using
small ducts is a good one, but from your description I find that
price somewhat high. I had one coil and a compressor installed last
year for $2,700 (the ducts were already in position). An extra coil
might cost $1,000, and for you that will leave $14,300 for the
ductwork. That seems excessive. Even if you double the cost of the
units to $7,400, that would leave $10,600 for ductwork, still
excessive, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I don't subscribe to the view that an antique house
should have a special air conditioning system or none at all. If
the old house is tight enough, any system will work nicely _
without resulting in excessive moisture, because an air
conditioning unit also is a dehumidifier. Whatever the system, I
don't think the dust will be reduced much at all, although it will
be moved around faster. If there is a main filter on the unit, that
might help some, but not, I think, by 85 percent.

IN THE NEW SUBURBAN, CHEVROLET TRADES BIGGEST FOR BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am rolling up Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, headed for a
week of skiing, watching from the high seat of the new Chevrolet
Suburban LT 1500 as traffic passes me.
</P>
<P>
   Two Honda Accords, one Toyota Camry, and a BMW328i, all with ski
racks atop, pass me in sequence. Seven people are rolling north in
those four cars. There are seven in my Suburban, plus ski gear and
vacation supplies. The Suburban is averaging just over 13 miles per
gallon. I don't know what the other four cars are getting for
combined gas mileage, but I am certain I hold the environmental
high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Suburban is not the biggest SUV on the block anymore.
That title goes to the Ford Excursion, built in what may have been
the final leapfrog of automakers trying to outsize each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ford got bigger last year. Chevrolet did not respond in kind.
Instead, it took what was already a very large SUV and refined it.
Shortened it slightly, cut the wheelbase slightly, gave it a
tighter turning radius _ and somehow made it feel roomier inside
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   And in a week in which the furies of the weather subjected us to
snow, ice, freezing rain, warm rain, and mud, I learned that
Chevrolet's Suburban has also given us enhanced handling and ride
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, they've taken the angular lines of the last generation
of Suburbans and made the SUV a rounder beast: rounded at the
fenders, along the roof line, at headlights and tailights. Round
like the Chevy trucks on which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it continues to feature seats as comfortable as any
you'll find: leather buckets up front, twin leather buckets in the
middle, a wide leather bench at the back. They all are firm and
supportive, yet feel as soft to sit in as fine living room
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Headroom and legroom abound, and behind it all is a massive
cargo bin, accessed by a horizontally split rear hatch. You can
open just the window or the whole thing as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, there are noticeable improvements. The controls
for four wheel drive have been moved from the dash on the right
side of the steering wheel _ where they were often blocked by the
gearshift _ to left of the wheel, where they are more accessible.
Controls for the heated seats have been placed high on the doors,
where you can see them, from down on the sides of the seats, where
you couldn't. And the interior door handles are big, full-hand-size
grips that ought to become standard in trucks and big SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Because large rigs like the Suburban ought to be hauling big
groups on trips, Chevrolet has liberally sprinkled bins, cup
holders, door slots, and pouches throughout. There are plenty of
places for plenty of stuff, from Gameboys to road maps.
</P>
<P>
   So it's comforable, it's full of people and gear, but how are
you going to move it on down the road?
</P>
<P>
   No problem when you plunk in the 5.8-liter V8 engine that seems
to have endless power and bottomless torque.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.8 in the test model had 285 horsepower; an available 6.0
boosts that to 300.
</P>
<P>
   Handling all that power with quiet, seamless transitions is a
four-speed electronic automatic transmission. It is coupled with an
Autotrac transfer case, a computer operated setup that, when in
part-time four wheel drive or low-range four wheel drive, monitors
slippage and transfers torque front to rear as needed.
</P>
<P>
   The drivetrain is settled into a new three-piece modular frame
based on the Silverado truck platform. It's rigid center and rear
for truck-like strength (you do carry big loads in an SUV) while
the front section has crash caps, which absorb the energy of
frontal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   So now you've got big, heavy, and stiff. How's it ride? Better
than any large SUV out there.
</P>
<P>
   On frost heaves, through snow, over ice, down the highway, it
was smooth and chatter free. You could feel it resisting sway on
sharp backroads corners and it moved crisply from lane to lane with
the flow of traffic. This is where big SUVs ought to be headed.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet accomplished this by doing away with rear leaf springs
and setting up a rear suspension that uses upper and lower control
arms, a track bar for lateral axle control, a rear stabilizer bar
to reduce body roll, coil springs, and self-leveling shocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2500 model, you still get leaf springs, but that's more a
rig for heavy towing, so the 1500 setup is perfect for hauling
families, gear, and lighter towing.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet has also gone to disc brakes all around and stopping
is far smoother than it was with the former disc/drum setup.
</P>
<P>
   With SUVs, of course, manufacturers rack up their big profits on
options, and the Suburban tested was a perfect example of this. We
started with a base price of just under $29,000. Then we added,
among other options, a Preferred Option Group, which included a
9-speaker sound system, cruise, front and rear air conditioning,
power bucket seats, power windows, running boards, an OnStar
communications system and rear seat audio. Then came a trailer
package, bucket seats for the second row, a locking differential
rear axle, and offroad skid plates. That got us up to more than
$42,000.
</P>
<P>
   This is why manufacturers just love to sell big SUVs. After all,
what's a rolling home-away-from-home without all the amenities?
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches
</P>
<P>
   --The push-tab sliding horizontal rails on the roof racks. Makes
installing add-on gear very easy.
</P>
<P>
   --The lights built into the bottom of the rearview mirrors. They
come on when you use the remote entry button and illuminate the
doors and running board.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --In the last generation of the Suburban, passengers had little
round lights much like those above airplane seats. They were great;
kids could read in the back without disturbing the driver at night.
They've been replaced with standard rectangles that cast a broader,
more annoying beam.

AUTO DESIGNS FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a current television ad, a Ford Focus pulls
gingerly into a slot between two cars, a parking spot so tight its
doors cannot be opened. The occupants appear trapped _ until you
see the trunk lid popped from inside and a group of 20-somethings
climb over the folded-down rear seat and out through the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   An ad you will never see would feature the same compact car
pulling into a handicapped spot, its broad driver's side door
opening and a cane pushing out for support on the pavement. The
stiff legs of an elderly driver would swing out through the
extra-wide, extra-high door, and the driver, sliding down from a
high seat, would emerge smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The new Focus is aimed at the young, but it is also emblematic
of a subtle but powerful challenge in today's auto industry: How to
sell to a young, high-tech generation but also produce cars that
will meet the physical challenges that confront aging baby boomers?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than design distinct vehicles for the separate groups and
plunk them at opposite ends of a linear design continuum, the
industry has responded in an inclusive way, striving for an
unbroken circle that boldly appeals to one group while fulfilling
the needs of another.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is necessary because of a long-held truism of auto
marketing, said Karen Stewart-Spica of the Lear Corp. in
Southfield, Mich., a leader in automotive design and engineering:
``You can sell a young man's car to an old man, but you can't sell
an old man's car to a young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, others in the industry say, as boomers age and maintain
lifestyles that are healthier and more active than those of
previous generations _ and cling to the sort of youthful attitudes
that can be symbolized by something as personal as the cars they
drive _ it can also be said that you cannot sell an old person's
car to an old person.
</P>
<P>
   So the industry has responded with what Stewart-Spica calls
``transparent enablers'' _ unobtrusive features that help people
use their vehicles. For instance, night-vision systems, in which a
camera on the grille sees into the darkness and projects images to
a space on the windshield _ like picture-in-a-picture on some TV
sets _ are making their way onto the market. They appeal to the
young as an extension of high-tech life; they are a boon to aging
boomers whose night vision is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   The new Chevrolet Suburban has vertical interior door handles
with thick L-shaped grips that you can get your entire hand around
_ great for those with hand or joint problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab station wagon offers a rollout platform in its rear
storage compartment _ appealing to picnicking tailgaters at
football games but also to elders with bad backs, for whom reaching
in to unload groceries could be painful.
</P>
<P>
   Also crossing generations are systems such as OnStar, which uses
satellites to track vehicles and alerts service centers if the
car's airbags deploy.
</P>
<P>
   And available in just a handful of cars now, but certain to
become popular, are voice-command systems that could replace
climate-control buttons, hand-operated telephones, and myriad other
switches, from lights to windshield wipers to sound system
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Safety studies have found that many accidents involving young
people happen because the drivers are distracted while fiddling
with their sound systems. For some aging drivers, the plethora of
fingertip controls can be confusing, and, for those with arthritic
hands, physically challenging. Voice controls would aid all these
groups, said Ashok Boghani, vice president of automotive practices
in North America at the Arthur D. Little research firm in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   But with all these features making their way to the market, you
still will not find any manufacturer that will advertise, ``Here's
a car for old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Older drivers may want comfort and convenience, ``but we're much
more interested in things that make us feel active, make us sense
sportiness,'' said Freeman Thomas, vice president of design and
advanced product strategy for DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you said the Buick LeSabre is for people with arthritis,
nobody would buy it,'' said Paul Ulrich, manager of General Motors'
Paragon Project, which develops vehicles for people with a wide
range of physical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich calls boomers ``a gray wave that's coming ashore.'' In
fact, the number of people in the United States between 55 and 74
will almost double in the next 30 years, from 40 million to 74
million. That alone poses a challenge to automotive designers and
manufacturers. Add to that the 77 million members of Generation Y,
those born since 1979, and the design demands are likely to tug in
opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry response has ranged from adding simple features to
cars already in production to developing full-blown concept
vehicles, incorporating a host of transparent enablers, that could
be the basis of future production cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus represents the simple touch, yet it came about in
a high-tech way.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first Ford to benefit from the use of the company's
``Third Age Suit,'' a cross between a hockey goalie's outfit and
something an astronaut might wear. The suit restricts agility, adds
bulk, and limits movement at the knees, elbows, stomach, and back.
Its gloves reduce the sense of touch. Its goggles simulate
cataracts. In short, it artificially ages young designers and shows
them the challenges confronting older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Focus, the Third Age Suit resulted in not only that wide,
high front door but also in a raised ``H-point'' (the point at
which the hips swivel) through higher seats, which give better
leverage when rising as a driver exits the car.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers have recognized the same need for easier
exits and applied it to cars other than entry-level compacts.
Ulrich of GM pointed out that Chevrolet, aware that buyers of the
hot Corvette sports car are often aging boomers, made the doors on
the latest model 1 1/2 inches wider and raised their opening height
2 inches to make rising up and out of the low-slung car easier.
</P>
<P>
   In Chevrolet's Impala, designers have put the ignition on the
dashboard, eliminating the need to twist the elbow and the wrist to
reach around the steering wheel before then twisting the wrist
again to turn the key.
</P>
<P>
   The Impala also comes with oversized knobs for climate control,
bigger inside door latches, large outside mirrors, and an inside
gauge that reports tire pressure, a definite aid for those for whom
bending down and attaching a pressure gauge would be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The key to these features, said Ulrich, is that while they help
those who need it, they are also a convenience to those who don't,
and that is part of the secret of transparent enablers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any feature you make easier to use, it gets used across the
board,'' said Thomas of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's new minivans, for instance, offer a power rear gate.
Necessary for those whose physical limitations make these heavy,
up-swinging gates difficult to use, the power is convenient for
simply unloading groceries without wrestling with an overhead door.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate crossover vehicle to be developed thus far
is the Lear Corp.'s TransG _ for transgenerational _ van. It is a
concept vehicle filled with real-world aids for aging drivers, but
whose features would appeal to young families, as well, said
Patrick Murray, Lear vice president for product analysis and
industrial design.
</P>
<P>
   Its steering wheel, dash display, and foot pedals move toward
the driver, aiding with vision and making it unnecessary for short
drivers to crunch themselves dangerously forward near the dash and
airbag. Seats swivel 45 degrees for easy entry and exit _ helpful
to aging drivers and to young families moving children and
groceries in and out of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The interior front-door handles are glistening steel poles that
run nearly the width of the door. They closely resemble grips you
might find in a shower and make it easy for those with limited
flexibility to open the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the steering wheel is open like the yoke in an
airplane, offering racy appeal to young drivers. But it also
provides a clearer view to gauges on the dash, where data such as
speed are digitally displayed in large numerals, and where computer
graphics, such as maps or other information, can be electronically
overlaid atop analog gauges, all features that older drivers might
find helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big gauges are not only good for those whose eyesight
might be fading,'' said Lear's Murray, ``but they're also good for
young drivers who might not be paying the attention to driving that
they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of the TransG cited by Murray is its seat belt
system: four-point belts that buckle at the midpoint of the torso
and eliminate the need for odd reaches back and around that
standard belts require. Again, the design is physically helpful for
the less abled, more comfortable because it eliminates the
strap-across-the-lower-neck sensation of standard belts, but
notably a feature that young drivers might notice as similar to the
harness system found in race cars.
</P>
<P>
   The TransG, Murray said, is a classic example of a generational
crossover from which manufacturers could adapt features for
production autos, the sorts of features you will increasingly find
in virtually any vehicle _ if you take the time to look for them.

AN OPEN LETTER TO A MOTHER OF YOUNG CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Carol or Sarah, Fran or Chloe,
</P>
<P>
   I can see you've had a bad day. No? A bad week, then. The baby
isn't sleeping through the night, your son chipped a bone in his
ankle, your daughter lost her glasses, and the car battery went
dead at the mall. Sounds awful. The teacher wants to talk to you
about your child's dyslexia, the two older ones fight all the time,
and the daily struggle over how much TV your kids can watch is
wearing you down to a nubbin.
</P>
<P>
   It's terrible. I know. It's unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   All you want is a night's sleep, an afternoon to yourself, 15
minutes alone in the bathroom. You'd be satisfied if the kids would
just throw their dirty clothes in the laundry basket, stop being so
fussy about what they eat, or quit nagging you to let them play
video games. You'd like just one day when everything went the way
you expected, when the baby sitter didn't let you down at the last
minute, when illness didn't fracture the plans you had so carefully
made and passionately anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   It's frustrating. I know. Motherhood is driving you crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Why did all the other parents get well-behaved, predictable,
happy-go-lucky kids while you were saddled with willful, moody,
opinionated offspring? They didn't. It only seems that way. You're
doing the best you can, and yet your daughter's friends are
tormenting her at school and your son is in a funk because the
coach plays favorites and never lets him into the game. All you'd
like is a little peace of mind and the feeling _ for just one hour
_ that things aren't always spinning out of your control.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to me. Let that fantasy go!
</P>
<P>
   This is your life, Mom, and the life of millions of parents just
like you. You can't count on anything going right ever. I can
gurantee that the minute you allow yourself to have an expectation,
it will be thwarted. Everything will conspire against the family
outing you've been looking forward to. Inanimate objects _ lost
shoes, a broken dishwasher, a missing sled _ will mock your
best-laid plans. While everything is in constant flux, holding on
to the idea of a family that operates without glitches is a move
that will leave you tense and disappointed every day of your life.
</P>
<P>
   You have to accept that what's happening is fine, as unlikely as
that may seem. Did you miss your plane and spend seven hours in the
airport in Phoenix with three children under 6? Breathe deeply.
It's perfect. Were you planning to have lunch with a friend you
haven't seen for months only to wake up to a snow day? It was meant
to be. You have to stop resisting life as it unfolds, no matter how
far afield it wanders from your desires.
</P>
<P>
   You have to learn to enjoy chaos.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend a lifetime unsuccessfully trying to change the
external world or you can alter your attitude. That's your only
choice. It may not be what you want, but it's the only chance for
happiness you have. Your response to events is the only thing that
is actually under your control.
</P>
<P>
   I can see how tired you are, but what's really wearing you out
is your own resistance to reality. Give up dreaming of some other
life. If at this very moment you could be in the Bahamas with a
nanny and a cook, your child would slip and cut his chin on the rim
of the pool, need stitches, and keep you up all night with his fear
and discomfort. There's no place to run, no paradise for mothers.
It's awful. I don't blame you for getting emotional. Go in the
shower and cry. Sit in a car in the driveway, roll up the windows,
and yell every curse you've ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   Then choose to be happy. Invent a game called ``Making Hay While
the Rain Falls.'' Use your imagination, your cunning, your sense of
invention. Don't hesitate to ask for help. Think about what you
have to do to make the worst moments an adventure. Figure out ways
to soothe yourself, amuse yourself, center yourself in any
circumstance. Don't try harder. Choose peacefulness. Be good to
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Motherhood is nature's basic training, which will stand you in
good stead in years to come. It's a cram course in patience and
wisdom, and the tests keep coming until you get it right. Then they
keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   It gets easier, but I have to warn you _ it never ends.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just the way it should be. Perfect.

BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN CRIB AND BED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving your toddler from the crib to a bed is like opening
Pandora's box: You can be in for a real surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to go from having a great sleeper to chaos
almost overnight,'' says pediatrician Richard Ferber, the nation's
preeminent children's sleep specialist. ``The child who never even
thought of getting out (of the crib) is now popping out of bed all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The best age for the move is between 3 and 4, says Ferber.
Unfortunately, few parents wait that long, and even though there
may be a practical reason to do it, if a child is too young, a move
only creates new problems on top of the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to expect a 2-year-old to have the
self-control to stay in a bed. It's not part of her developmental
equipment yet,'' says psychologist Jodi A. Mindell, author of
``Sleeping Through the Night'' (HarperPerennial). Her daughter is
33 months old ``and I don't see a big bed in her future any time
soon,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason parents move a toddler is to free the
crib for a new baby. ``That fuels the insecurity a child already
feels at having a new sibling, making her particularly needy,''
says Mindell.
</P>
<P>
   She says parents can buy up to three more months in the crib for
the toddler by finding a makeshift or alternative bed for the baby.
If that's not possible, move a toddler out of the crib at least six
weeks before the baby arrives. Whatever you do, she says, tell him,
``You're such a big boy, you need a big boy bed!'' not ``We need
the crib for the baby.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
One transition at a time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moving a child at about the same time she's toilet training is
almost always a bad idea, even though it makes sense for her to
have easier access to the bathroom at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having both transitions at once robs a child of control at a
time when independence and control are developmentally what they
are pushing for,'' says pediatrician Shari Nethersole of Children's
Hospital in Boston. ``He's bound to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice is to complete one transition before tackling the
other; logistically, it makes sense if the move to the bed comes
first.
</P>
<P>
   One way to gauge whether a toddler has the necessary control is
to try leaving him alone in a room for a few minutes during
playtime. ``Is he a kid who gets into trouble instantly,'' asks
Mindell, ``who cries because you've left or follows you out?'' If
the answer is yes, he's not ready.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Cronin wonders if she moved her daughter too soon. When
Madison was 18 months and climbed out of her crib, Cronin panicked:
``I didn't think she was safe.'' She and husband Tom took the crib
down immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In the near-year that has passed since then, Madison has slept
the night in her bed only once, the night before this interview.
Not that she was a great sleeper before that; she was often sick
and cried a lot, so Sally or Tom would bring her to their bed. But
her increased mobility has made matters much worse. That her
parents don't consistently return her to her bed doesn't help,
either, but Cronin wonders, too, if Madison was just too young.
</P>
<P>
   The day after she stayed in her bed for the first night she was
so proud of herself, she told her mom, ``I woke up and didn't come
in your room!''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin found that interesting. ``She knows that's what we
want,'' she says. ``I think she just couldn't do it before.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Exploring alternatives &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem for parents like Cronin is often that they don't
realize they have alternatives, says Nethersole. For instance, she
recommends lowering the rails, putting a hefty layer of cushions on
the floor, and teaching a toddler to climb safely. That's what our
pediatrician recommended when my son was 18 months and hurled
himself out of the crib headfirst. It was almost as if Eli just
wanted to be empowered to climb, rather than to get out of the
crib: He never dived again and never climbed down at night (during
the day was a different story), and we didn't move him to a bed for
close to a year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason to delay the move as long as possible, of course, is
safety. ``They can get into a lot of trouble wandering the house
alone at night,'' says Nethersole.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying also enables us to maintain control. Once in a bed,
even a youngster who was previously an excellent sleeper can have
difficulty settling down for the night. With the new-found freedom,
he's more aware of and enticed by activity in the rest of the
house. ``They pop in and out of bed and you can't enforce
anything,'' says Ferber, whose book, ``Solve Your Child's Sleep
Problems'' (Simon and Shuster), is the bible on the subject. Ferber
is director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His solution is a gate, either at the top of the stairs or on
the bedroom door. Many parents resist, saying it feels too
zoo-like, but Ferber says it actually feeds into a youngster's
developmental need. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   What begins as a rule _ ``It's your job to stay in bed'' _
typically escalates into threats and punishment _ ``If you don't
stay in bed, no TV tomorrow!'' _ because parents get so frustrated
at lack of compliance. The problem, as Cronin suggests, is that a
child under 3 is not capable of complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may cognitively grasp that you'll be angry, but the open
door beckons and they can't control the impulse,'' says Ferber. At
the same time, however, ``they don't enjoy the chaos when parents
are angry and yelling,'' he says. Indeed, if anything, it makes
them feel more insecure and unsafe, pushing them to act out even
more in an effort to get you to set a limit that makes them feel
safe again.
</P>
<P>
   The gate is that limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the parent's job to offer the control the child can't
provide himself,'' says Ferber. He says a gate can turn bad nights
into good ones within two nights. &QL; 
 &QL; 
When beds don't measure up &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some children, it's not the new-found access to the rest of
the house that's the problem. They simply don't like the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Faulkner was 2 when she began to outgrow her crib. Her
parents wisely waited six more months to move her, until she was
bumping into the sides while she slept. Even so, she rarely sleeps
the night in the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a comfort level with the crib that hasn't been matched
by the bed,'' says her dad, Mark.
</P>
<P>
   Nethersole says that's not unusual. ``The crib isfamiliar and
cozy. Kids feel snuggled there _ safe,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Guardrails can provide that security for some children, but they
may not provide as much protection as parents think. Cronin says
Madison moved around so much on a twin bed she was afraid she'd
roll off, even with the rails. She bought a slightly smaller junior
bed that was lower to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   One trick to ease transition is to keep the crib up after you
move the bed in so a child chooses where she wants to sleep. As
long as you have the space for both and can tolerate the back and
forth _ naps in the bed, nights in the crib, etc. _ this is a
respectful way to give a child control, says Mindell.
</P>
<P>
   For a child who is truly miserable with the bed, for whom
bedtime is a nightly struggle, and who has gone from being a good
sleeper to a bad one, Mindell would bring the crib back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is in the spin you put on it,'' she says. Not ``I
guess you're not a big girl'' or ``You can't handle this,'' but:
``Oh look! Your crib missed you, too! It came back!''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, of course, it won't come to that. When we don't rush
children and set limits for them, says Mindell, the transition to a
bed can be as smooth as, well, silk sheets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOW PARENTS CAN SMOOTH THE WAY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Place the bed in the same position in the room as the crib so a
child's perspective on the room doesn't change.
</P>
<P>
   _A child isn't too old for a crib until 4.
</P>
<P>
   _A consistent routine that includes reading makes bedtime
easier. Keep the routine the same when you move him.
</P>
<P>
   _If possible, involve a child in choosing the bed or sheets.
</P>
<P>
   _Talk about the attributes of a bed. ``This bed is special; it's
just for you. It's so big and comfortable and it can still be cozy:
Look how much your stuffed animals like it!''
</P>
<P>
   _Some children never pop in and out of bed during the night. Be
careful not to plant the idea that they can. Not: ``The rule is you
can't get in and out of bed,'' but: ``When you go to bed, call us
if you need us, just like before.''
</P>
<P>
   _Shutting a child behind a closed door for the night is not
safe.
</P>
<P>
   _Some guard rails are not safe because they leave a large space
between the bottom rung and the mattress. A child's arm, leg, or
head could get caught.
</P>
<P>
   _It can take a month for a child to get used to the bed.
</P>
<P>
   _Tell a child who doesn't like a gate, ``Let's try it without
the gate and see if you need this help or not.''
</P>
<P>
   _If a child is having sleep problems, don't assume it's because
she hates the crib, and don't make this a reason to move her. Try
instead to figure out what makes sleep an issue and work on that
directly. For instance, is there an underlying tension in the
family? Does she have difficulty with other separations? Do you use
the crib as a discipline technique so that she has negative
associations with it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ As presidential politics continue to heat up,
engaging our children in the democratic process may be just as
important as voting. For some ideas on how to do that, check out

&HT;     FALUN GONG MEMBERS TELL OF ARREST IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The moment Jein Shyue boarded the airplane
headed for California, he wanted to return to Beijing, even though
he had been jailed for three days because of his spiritual beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back right now,'' said Shyue, a 44-year-old San
Jose materials engineer and follower of Falun Gong, the mystical
movement that is banned in China. ``Seeing practitioners with your
same mind-set is like looking at yourself in a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Shyue, and Loretta Sukmei Lam, 42, of San Leandro, talked about
their experiences in detention after the Beijing police raided a
rented house Saturday night, arresting 18 followers, including
several people from Northern California and Australia. The
authorities arrested another Californian, Zhizhen ``Mary'' Qian, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests followed months of police crackdowns in China
against Falun Gong, an outlawed mystical movement that has an
estimated 60 to 70 million practitioners worldwide. The police are
trying to stem protests during the national legislature's annual
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist regime reviles the Falun Gong movement as
subversive and cult-like.
</P>
<P>
   Shyue, a Taiwanese citizen in the process of attaining U.S.
citizenship, arrived in Beijing on March 1, intent on learning
first-hand about the recent tribulations of Falun Gong followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a different world over there,'' said Shyue, who began
practicing Falun Gong in 1995 in Boston. ``It's a life-or-death
choice for them.''
</P>
<P>
   With information gleaned by e-mail, Shyue met up with the
others. They had gone to China separately with plans to protest in
Tiananmen Square and to try to address the Chinese People's
Congress on Sunday. Though they never met before, the followers
felt a deep connection by sharing their experiences, meditating and
practicing their Falun Gong exercises, Shyue said.
</P>
<P>
   The police, pounding on their door around 8 p.m. Saturday,
shattered that peace. During the raid, Lam said, she saw police
officers use a stun gun on a San Jose resident, Yili ``Vennessa''
Wang, 28, for trying to keep them from taking the group's book on
Falun Gong meditations and exercises. They ransacked the house, she
said, and ordered everyone to gather their belongings before
shipping them off to a police detention center, where they were
interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   Lam speculated that the police had tracked them down through
their cellular phones, or else had noticed the large number of
people coming to and leaving the house.
</P>
<P>
   The followers continued to meditate afterward as they waited in
the dark cement cellblock, Shyue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them showed fear,'' Shyue said. ``We didn't do
anything wrong. We have no bad intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   The police separated Shyue and Lam, as well as David Sun, an
11-year-old Fremont boy, from the others, and sent them to their
department's foreign affairs division. They joined Falun Gong
followers from Washington, D.C., and Australia who had also been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very brave and independent,'' said Shyue, praising
David, who kept up the detainees' spirits with his lively,
talkative nature. ``He loves to talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the police escorted the group to the airport in
Beijing, forcing them to leave the country. Lam left first,
boarding a plane headed for Hong Kong. Shyue waited with Sun until
his mother, Zhizhen Qian, arrived at the airport in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, relatives and friends of the mother and son still had
no word of their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Lam and other the followers vowed to continue trying to raise
awareness with human rights groups and government officials of the
persecution of Falun Gong followers in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has no human rights,'' Lam said. ``It's very, very
bad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a current television ad, a Ford Focus pulls
gingerly into a slot between two cars, a parking spot so tight its
doors cannot be opened. The occupants appear trapped _ until you
see the trunk lid popped from inside and a group of 20-somethings
climb over the folded-down rear seat and out through the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   An ad you will never see would feature the same compact car
pulling into a handicapped spot, its broad driver's side door
opening and a cane pushing out for support on the pavement. The
stiff legs of an elderly driver would swing out through the
extra-wide, extra-high door, and the driver, sliding down from a
high seat, would emerge smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The new Focus is aimed at the young, but it is also emblematic
of a subtle but powerful challenge in today's auto industry: How to
sell to a young, high-tech generation but also produce cars that
will meet the physical challenges that confront aging baby boomers?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than design distinct vehicles for the separate groups and
plunk them at opposite ends of a linear design continuum, the
industry has responded in an inclusive way, striving for an
unbroken circle that boldly appeals to one group while fulfilling
the needs of another.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is necessary because of a long-held truism of auto
marketing, said Karen Stewart-Spica of the Lear Corp. in
Southfield, Mich., a leader in automotive design and engineering:
``You can sell a young man's car to an old man, but you can't sell
an old man's car to a young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, others in the industry say, as boomers age and maintain
lifestyles that are healthier and more active than those of
previous generations _ and cling to the sort of youthful attitudes
that can be symbolized by something as personal as the cars they
drive _ it can also be said that you cannot sell an old person's
car to an old person.
</P>
<P>
   So the industry has responded with what Stewart-Spica calls
``transparent enablers'' _ unobtrusive features that help people
use their vehicles. For instance, night-vision systems, in which a
camera on the grille sees into the darkness and projects images to
a space on the windshield _ like picture-in-a-picture on some TV
sets _ are making their way onto the market. They appeal to the
young as an extension of high-tech life; they are a boon to aging
boomers whose night vision is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   The new Chevrolet Suburban has vertical interior door handles
with thick L-shaped grips that you can get your entire hand around
_ great for those with hand or joint problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab station wagon offers a rollout platform in its rear
storage compartment _ appealing to picnicking tailgaters at
football games but also to elders with bad backs, for whom reaching
in to unload groceries could be painful.
</P>
<P>
   Also crossing generations are systems such as OnStar, which uses
satellites to track vehicles and alerts service centers if the
car's airbags deploy.
</P>
<P>
   And available in just a handful of cars now, but certain to
become popular, are voice-command systems that could replace
climate-control buttons, hand-operated telephones, and myriad other
switches, from lights to windshield wipers to sound system
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Safety studies have found that many accidents involving young
people happen because the drivers are distracted while fiddling
with their sound systems. For some aging drivers, the plethora of
fingertip controls can be confusing, and, for those with arthritic
hands, physically challenging. Voice controls would aid all these
groups, said Ashok Boghani, vice president of automotive practices
in North America at the Arthur D. Little research firm in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   But with all these features making their way to the market, you
still will not find any manufacturer that will advertise, ``Here's
a car for old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Older drivers may want comfort and convenience, ``but we're much
more interested in things that make us feel active, make us sense
sportiness,'' said Freeman Thomas, vice president of design and
advanced product strategy for DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you said the Buick LeSabre is for people with arthritis,
nobody would buy it,'' said Paul Ulrich, manager of General Motors'
Paragon Project, which develops vehicles for people with a wide
range of physical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich calls boomers ``a gray wave that's coming ashore.'' In
fact, the number of people in the United States between 55 and 74
will almost double in the next 30 years, from 40 million to 74
million. That alone poses a challenge to automotive designers and
manufacturers. Add to that the 77 million members of Generation Y,
those born since 1979, and the design demands are likely to tug in
opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry response has ranged from adding simple features to
cars already in production to developing full-blown concept
vehicles, incorporating a host of transparent enablers, that could
be the basis of future production cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus represents the simple touch, yet it came about in
a high-tech way.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first Ford to benefit from the use of the company's
``Third Age Suit,'' a cross between a hockey goalie's outfit and
something an astronaut might wear. The suit restricts agility, adds
bulk, and limits movement at the knees, elbows, stomach, and back.
Its gloves reduce the sense of touch. Its goggles simulate
cataracts. In short, it artificially ages young designers and shows
them the challenges confronting older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Focus, the Third Age Suit resulted in not only that wide,
high front door but also in a raised ``H-point'' (the point at
which the hips swivel) through higher seats, which give better
leverage when rising as a driver exits the car.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers have recognized the same need for easier
exits and applied it to cars other than entry-level compacts.
Ulrich of GM pointed out that Chevrolet, aware that buyers of the
hot Corvette sports car are often aging boomers, made the doors on
the latest model 1 1/2 inches wider and raised their opening height
2 inches to make rising up and out of the low-slung car easier.
</P>
<P>
   In Chevrolet's Impala, designers have put the ignition on the
dashboard, eliminating the need to twist the elbow and the wrist to
reach around the steering wheel before then twisting the wrist
again to turn the key.
</P>
<P>
   The Impala also comes with oversized knobs for climate control,
bigger inside door latches, large outside mirrors, and an inside
gauge that reports tire pressure, a definite aid for those for whom
bending down and attaching a pressure gauge would be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The key to these features, said Ulrich, is that while they help
those who need it, they are also a convenience to those who don't,
and that is part of the secret of transparent enablers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any feature you make easier to use, it gets used across the
board,'' said Thomas of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's new minivans, for instance, offer a power rear gate.
Necessary for those whose physical limitations make these heavy,
up-swinging gates difficult to use, the power is convenient for
simply unloading groceries without wrestling with an overhead door.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate crossover vehicle to be developed thus far
is the Lear Corp.'s TransG _ for transgenerational _ van. It is a
concept vehicle filled with real-world aids for aging drivers, but
whose features would appeal to young families, as well, said
Patrick Murray, Lear vice president for product analysis and
industrial design.
</P>
<P>
   Its steering wheel, dash display, and foot pedals move toward
the driver, aiding with vision and making it unnecessary for short
drivers to crunch themselves dangerously forward near the dash and
airbag. Seats swivel 45 degrees for easy entry and exit _ helpful
to aging drivers and to young families moving children and
groceries in and out of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The interior front-door handles are glistening steel poles that
run nearly the width of the door. They closely resemble grips you
might find in a shower and make it easy for those with limited
flexibility to open the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the steering wheel is open like the yoke in an
airplane, offering racy appeal to young drivers. But it also
provides a clearer view to gauges on the dash, where data such as
speed are digitally displayed in large numerals, and where computer
graphics, such as maps or other information, can be electronically
overlaid atop analog gauges, all features that older drivers might
find helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big gauges are not only good for those whose eyesight
might be fading,'' said Lear's Murray, ``but they're also good for
young drivers who might not be paying the attention to driving that
they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of the TransG cited by Murray is its seat belt
system: four-point belts that buckle at the midpoint of the torso
and eliminate the need for odd reaches back and around that
standard belts require. Again, the design is physically helpful for
the less abled, more comfortable because it eliminates the
strap-across-the-lower-neck sensation of standard belts, but
notably a feature that young drivers might notice as similar to the
harness system found in race cars.
</P>
<P>
   The TransG, Murray said, is a classic example of a generational
crossover from which manufacturers could adapt features for
production autos, the sorts of features you will increasingly find
in virtually any vehicle _ if you take the time to look for them.

INTERACTIVE SYSTEM IS THE NEXT WORD IN COMMUNICATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The television pictures were riveting: a wrecked car beside a
river far down a hillside from the highway. A Texas woman and her
baby were trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   Using her cell phone, the mother managed to call for help and
then, because she did not know exactly where she had gone off the
highway she was traveling, stayed in contact with the police until
she heard their sirens wailing high above her.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long it would have been before the wreck was found had
she not had a cell phone, one police officer replied it would have
been found by hunters, weeks later. A second question, unasked but
with an obvious answer, is what would have happened had she been so
injured she could not use her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this, and then say this word: telematics.
</P>
<P>
   Say the word, because it will be coming soon to a vehicle near
you.
</P>
<P>
   Telematics in-vehicle communications systems use satellites and
wireless networks to keep your vehicle in constant link with the
world outside your windshield.
</P>
<P>
   A telematics system in your car will notify monitoring centers
if your airbags deploy and where your car is at the time of the
wreck; you can use it to summon help in an emergency or for basic
roadside assistance; it will track your vehicle if it is stolen; if
you lock your keys in your car, you simply provide a code to the
monitoring center, and the center will unlock the car from afar;
even your doctor's name and your medical records can be kept on
file for use by emergency crews that come to your aid.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just some of the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Already offered or in the works are systems that let mechanical
problems in your car be diagnosed from the center; navigation
systems that can be downloaded, eliminating the need for discs;
systems that download MP3 music from your home computer; systems
that link you to radio stations nationwide, wherever you are, via
satellite; links to thousands of services from restaurants and
hotels to sports venues; and concierge services.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable amid the wonder of this blossoming electronic
benefit is that consumer awareness of these systems is relatively
low right now. General Motors, probably the leader in the field in
getting telematics into its vehicles, has installed about 100,000
units so far. They hope to top a million by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   A look at GM's system, called OnStar, is a vivid glimpse into a
future rapidly becoming the present. GM offers OnStar in models of
the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Saab.
</P>
<P>
   You pay $695 for the system, then $199 per year for a safety and
security package, or $399 per year for more esoteric premium
service.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the 24/7 link with an OnStar center offers you:
</P>
<P>
   With the safety and security package you get MED-NET, which
stores your medical information and can provide it to emergency
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Accident assist links you to an adviser who helps with insurance
issues and police reports.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency, the driver hits a button, a monitor plots the
vehicle's position and sends help from the closest emergency
services provider, such as police or fire and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Remote diagnostics are available if you see a warning light on
your instrument panel. You contact the center, and an operator
there signals the vehicle's computer. It transmits problem codes
and from this determines whether you need immediate roadside
assistance, if it is safe to keep driving until you can find a
garage, or if you can wait until your next regular maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   If your airbags deploy, an emergency signal is sent to the
OnStar center. An operator there will try to communicate with
occupants of the vehicle. If there is no response, or if you report
an emergency, the operator finds you via satellite and sends help.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle is stolen, you call OnStar and an operator
signals the vehicle, finds it, and tracks it. (I have read of other
systems that remotely set off the horn and make the lights flash _
certainly disconcerting to a thief who can't stop these attention
grabbers once they are activated.)
</P>
<P>
   If you get a flat or run out of gas, but don't feel safe leaving
your vehicle, OnStar will send the nearest GM service provider to
your aid.
</P>
<P>
   And if you lock your keys in the car, you call a toll-free
number, give them your code, and a cellular data call from the
operator to your vehicle unlocks the doors.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get a bit more esoteric, opt for Premium
Services. They include:
</P>
<P>
   --Information/Convenience Services in which OnStar advisers tell
you about local hotels, restaurants, and hundreds of other types of
services as you travel.
</P>
<P>
   --A navigation system that pinpoints your location and uses
voice direction to guide you on your way. It will even help you
find your way out of a traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   --And concierge service that will send flowers, book you into
hotels and restaurants, get tickets to sporting events and
entertainment venues, and help you plan a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It won't stop here, and GM certainly will not stand alone.
Already, Ford and Daimler-Chrysler are heavily into telematics.
</P>
<P>
   And once this is added to a voice-activated system that not only
makes phone calls for you, but also connects you to the Internet
for e-mail, sports scores, and stock, news, and weather reports,
the time you spend in your car will be not only safer, but also
time you can spend doing far more than waiting out the ride.

IN THE NEW SUBURBAN, CHEVROLET TRADES BIGGEST FOR BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am rolling up Interstate 93 in New Hampshire, headed for a
week of skiing, watching from the high seat of the new Chevrolet
Suburban LT 1500 as traffic passes me.
</P>
<P>
   Two Honda Accords, one Toyota Camry, and a BMW328i, all with ski
racks atop, pass me in sequence. Seven people are rolling north in
those four cars. There are seven in my Suburban, plus ski gear and
vacation supplies. The Suburban is averaging just over 13 miles per
gallon. I don't know what the other four cars are getting for
combined gas mileage, but I am certain I hold the environmental
high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Suburban is not the biggest SUV on the block anymore.
That title goes to the Ford Excursion, built in what may have been
the final leapfrog of automakers trying to outsize each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ford got bigger last year. Chevrolet did not respond in kind.
Instead, it took what was already a very large SUV and refined it.
Shortened it slightly, cut the wheelbase slightly, gave it a
tighter turning radius _ and somehow made it feel roomier inside
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   And in a week in which the furies of the weather subjected us to
snow, ice, freezing rain, warm rain, and mud, I learned that
Chevrolet's Suburban has also given us enhanced handling and ride
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, they've taken the angular lines of the last generation
of Suburbans and made the SUV a rounder beast: rounded at the
fenders, along the roof line, at headlights and tailights. Round
like the Chevy trucks on which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it continues to feature seats as comfortable as any
you'll find: leather buckets up front, twin leather buckets in the
middle, a wide leather bench at the back. They all are firm and
supportive, yet feel as soft to sit in as fine living room
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Headroom and legroom abound, and behind it all is a massive
cargo bin, accessed by a horizontally split rear hatch. You can
open just the window or the whole thing as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, there are noticeable improvements. The controls
for four wheel drive have been moved from the dash on the right
side of the steering wheel _ where they were often blocked by the
gearshift _ to left of the wheel, where they are more accessible.
Controls for the heated seats have been placed high on the doors,
where you can see them, from down on the sides of the seats, where
you couldn't. And the interior door handles are big, full-hand-size
grips that ought to become standard in trucks and big SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Because large rigs like the Suburban ought to be hauling big
groups on trips, Chevrolet has liberally sprinkled bins, cup
holders, door slots, and pouches throughout. There are plenty of
places for plenty of stuff, from Gameboys to road maps.
</P>
<P>
   So it's comforable, it's full of people and gear, but how are
you going to move it on down the road?
</P>
<P>
   No problem when you plunk in the 5.8-liter V8 engine that seems
to have endless power and bottomless torque.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.8 in the test model had 285 horsepower; an available 6.0
boosts that to 300.
</P>
<P>
   Handling all that power with quiet, seamless transitions is a
four-speed electronic automatic transmission. It is coupled with an
Autotrac transfer case, a computer operated setup that, when in
part-time four wheel drive or low-range four wheel drive, monitors
slippage and transfers torque front to rear as needed.
</P>
<P>
   The drivetrain is settled into a new three-piece modular frame
based on the Silverado truck platform. It's rigid center and rear
for truck-like strength (you do carry big loads in an SUV) while
the front section has crash caps, which absorb the energy of
frontal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   So now you've got big, heavy, and stiff. How's it ride? Better
than any large SUV out there.
</P>
<P>
   On frost heaves, through snow, over ice, down the highway, it
was smooth and chatter free. You could feel it resisting sway on
sharp backroads corners and it moved crisply from lane to lane with
the flow of traffic. This is where big SUVs ought to be headed.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet accomplished this by doing away with rear leaf springs
and setting up a rear suspension that uses upper and lower control
arms, a track bar for lateral axle control, a rear stabilizer bar
to reduce body roll, coil springs, and self-leveling shocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2500 model, you still get leaf springs, but that's more a
rig for heavy towing, so the 1500 setup is perfect for hauling
families, gear, and lighter towing.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet has also gone to disc brakes all around and stopping
is far smoother than it was with the former disc/drum setup.
</P>
<P>
   With SUVs, of course, manufacturers rack up their big profits on
options, and the Suburban tested was a perfect example of this. We
started with a base price of just under $29,000. Then we added,
among other options, a Preferred Option Group, which included a
9-speaker sound system, cruise, front and rear air conditioning,
power bucket seats, power windows, running boards, an OnStar
communications system and rear seat audio. Then came a trailer
package, bucket seats for the second row, a locking differential
rear axle, and offroad skid plates. That got us up to more than
$42,000.
</P>
<P>
   This is why manufacturers just love to sell big SUVs. After all,
what's a rolling home-away-from-home without all the amenities?
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches
</P>
<P>
   --The push-tab sliding horizontal rails on the roof racks. Makes
installing add-on gear very easy.
</P>
<P>
   --The lights built into the bottom of the rearview mirrors. They
come on when you use the remote entry button and illuminate the
doors and running board.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --In the last generation of the Suburban, passengers had little
round lights much like those above airplane seats. They were great;
kids could read in the back without disturbing the driver at night.
They've been replaced with standard rectangles that cast a broader,
more annoying beam.

TREBLE ON CAMPUS: PIRATING MUSIC OFF WEB PROMPTS UNIVERSITIES TO
BLOCK SITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Joining scores of colleges around the nation,
the University of Texas is cracking down on students who use the
campus computer network to download songs from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such a practice often violates federal copyright laws that are
designed to protect entertainers. However, university officials'
primary interest is in ensuring that the computer network, which
serves 75,000 students, faculty and administrators, is available
for higher-priority academic uses.
</P>
<P>
   Though UT hasn't disclosed how much of its network capacity, or
bandwidth, was being usurped by those accessing music, counterparts
around the nation have estimated that 40 percent or more of their
bandwidth is monopolized by music downloads, sometimes driving up
costs &UR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Much of the commotion centers on the Web site www.napster.com,
where music can be downloaded. The Web site has been rendered
inaccessible on several university computer systems, including
UT's. While some students defended the move to make napster.com off
limits, others said it is futile to try to eliminate the activity
by targeting a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before a thousand mini-napsters are
out there on the Net,'' student Anand Kumar Inala wrote in a letter
to the Daily Texan, the student newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The university will not be able to track the new Web sites that
inevitably will appear to take napster.com's place, the sophomore
predicted. Inala signed a petition to remove the block on
napster.com.
</P>
<P>
   For all the same reasons as UT, Texas A&AMP;M University is
considering steps to discourage music downloads. So far, no World
Wide Web sites for music swapping have been blocked for Aggie
computer network users.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech, Texas Christian University, Oregon State, University
of California-Berkeley, University of North Dakota and Boston
University also have taken steps to hinder access to napster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all music shared on the Internet is copyright protected,
according to the Recording Industry Association of America. The
association is leaning on universities nationwide to curtail
unauthorized copying. The Web pages of several students who offered
pirated songs already have been knocked off A&AMP;M's network at the
insistence of the trade group, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 million computers online worldwide, the association
said it was forced to shift most of its anti-piracy resources away
from compact discs to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But within a college population that often thumbs its nose at
the corporate world _ including the music industry and its
copyright protections _ threats of legal consequences for pirating
often go unheeded, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Students called UT's recent decision to block access to
napster.com ``Draconian.'' Napster.com is one of the most popular
Web sites for accessing music files in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ceases to amaze me how people can claim censorship,
when what they're doing is breaking federal law by downloading
copyrighted material onto their computers,'' said Thomas Putnam,
director of A&AMP;M Computing and Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   Student reliance on high-speed campus computer networks to
speedily acquire new music has been surging since mid-1999, when
software for sharing songs proliferated. The MP3 format enables
music to be compressed into relatively small data files. The files
can be easily stored and transferred from computer to computer.
Though the sound quality isn't always as good as a compact disc, it
is usually at least as good as the radio.
</P>
<P>
   The downloaded music is prompting heated debate between the
entertainment industry and a handful of Web site operators who
enable widespread sharing of songs from music collections stored on
personal computers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   UT's Academic Computing and Instructional Technology Services
office said it made napster.com off limits after it registered so
much traffic that it became ``detrimental'' to the entire campus
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interest, my responsibility, is making sure that the
network infrastructure on the campus operates, and is useful and
usable by the 75,000 people that make up this community,'' said
Bill Bard, director of UT's Office of Telecommunications Services
and deputy director of the office that monitors computer usage.
</P>
<P>
   While not as problematic at A&AMP;M, music downloading is a concern.
It is heaviest in Aggie dormitories, where high-speed Internet
connections are built into rooms, Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is frequently asked about the university policy on music
downloads. His stock answer is the controlling authority is federal
law, not campus rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the FBI shows up at your door, university policy is really
irrelevant if you've got a computer full of copyrighted software or
copyrighted music,'' Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America is in contact,
seeking to raise awareness about copyright law or to alert the
school if a student is detected sharing pirated music via the
university's network, Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Using search engines, the association can easily find student
Web sites that offer pirated songs. When it does, the association
notifies the students' universities, citing the new federal Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They file (notice) with us officially and we have legal
responsibility to take down that site,'' Putnam said. ``We're
trying to teach the students that they have liabilities ... and
what they're doing is illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue raises perplexing legal questions, Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the really untested areas, in terms of legal
precedent,'' he said, ``is institutional liability for what a
student does with their own computer that happens to be located on
the campus.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two candidates in America's presidential
contest turned their guns on each other Wednesday, the first shots
in what is likely to be a scorched-earth election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the votes in the party primaries were still being counted
on Tuesday night, Al Gore for the Democrats and George W. Bush for
the Republicans both presented themselves as the only figures who
could unify the country, while vilifying each other.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore beat Bill Bradley, his opponent for the
Democratic nomination, in every state which was at stake in
Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Governor of Texas, emerged the clear victor on the
Republican side against Senator John McCain of Arizona. Though only
half the country has voted in primary contests, it is clear who
will represent each party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fight has just begun,'' said Gore, celebrating his victory
on Tuesday night. ``We need to build on our record of prosperity.
We don't need to go back to where we were before,'' he said, a
reference to the Republican era in the White House which preceded
Bill Clinton's election.
</P>
<P>
   The last Republican president was George Bush, father of the
current candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were challenged and we met the challenge,'' said Bush. ``We
are ready, and I believe our country is ready, to return exiled
honor to the White House,'' a reference to the many ethical
scandals surrounding the administration of Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both won so strongly suggests a close and
hard-fought campaign. The latest opinion poll, in the Wall Street
Journal on Tuesday, shows them neck and neck in a contest against
each other; other polls show Bush's once substantial lead cut to
single figures. But the general election in November is still
months away.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leaned heavily on the support of the party's right in his
campaigns, especially in South Carolina, a bitter and controversial
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups spent $340,000 attacking McCain on Tuesday
alone. While it helped Bush to cement the party hard core, this may
cause problems as he seeks more moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faced a less serious fight against Bill Bradley, and has
less ground to cover as he shifts to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that both candidates are in the political
center, in a time-honored tradition they will now seek to paint
each other as ideologically-crazed zealots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is way to the left. Bush is right in the center of the
Republican Party and right in the political mainstream of the
American people,'' said Haley Barbour, a Bush advisor and prominent
Republican money man.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attacked Bush for ``smear telephone calls from the
extremist right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates desperately need some of the support which went
to John McCain, who pulled in voters from Republican and Democrat
parties as well as independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those Republicans and independents out there whose heroes
are Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, to all of you I say as
well, join with us. Our campaign is now your cause,'' Gore said, a
direct appeal to McCainites.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president immediately took up the cudgels on behalf of
campaign finance reform, McCain's signature issue, calling on the
Republicans to ban ``soft money'' _ cash from interest groups and
companies that can be used to fund national campaigns. The
television ads which make American elections so prohibitively
expensive should also be forsworn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to ``make this a campaign of ideas and not
insults and conduct it in broad daylight instead of with these
secretly funded special interest attack ads that distort and
dishonor the process of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a clear assault on Bush, whose friends attacked McCain
using privately-funded ads. McCain lashed out at Bush's ``sleazy
Texas buddies,'' and Gore clearly wants voters to remember that.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also moved swiftly to heal differences with Bradley. ``I
have been moved and touched by the strength of his commitment to
healing divisions in this country,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has fought a bitter battle against McCain and will find it
harder to reach out to his opponent. ``I congratulate John,'' he
said on Tuesday night. ``We have our disagreements, but I respect
him and his commitment to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect, however, has not been the most notable quality of the
Republican battle. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ First corruption allegations, then a stunning defeat
in parliament, and now a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The ground under Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, seems to
be slipping by the day.
</P>
<P>
   The latest blow came Tuesday when a cabinet colleague, Yitzhak
Mordechai _ a former defense minister who now holds the transport
portfolio _ suspended himself from his post pending an
investigation into accusations that he sexually assaulted a
23-year-old woman civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged incident _ which has caused a storm in the Israel
media, despite the minister's denials _ would normally be chalked
up as a routine political setback, had it not coincided with a
lengthening list of signs that Barak is losing his footing, and
that this is undermining his role in the stalled Middle East peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week his parliamentary coalition fractured, allowing
his opponents to win the first reading of a critical bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barak faces a ``no-confidence'' motion after an uproar over
his education minister's plans to include the work of a nationalist
Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, on the school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   If it ever comes to a vote, the signs are that his coalition
would betray him again.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, unrest and tension among the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza have risen sharply _ with an historic
Papal visit less than two weeks away - fuelled by the endless
failure of their nationalist aspirations to make any progress.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few days, Israel has been living under a state of
heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   Its security services believe Hamas guerrillas are trying to
step up operations, and claim to have averted a devastating city
center bombing by staging a raid last week in which four suspected
guerrillas were killed.
</P>
<P>
   If true, this is a measure of the current precarious mood; Hamas
leaders tend to approve attacks only when they believe the use of
violence will receive public support from Palestinians _ along with
a willingness to endure the Israeli reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Now the temperature has risen further with a decision by an
Israeli parole board to release a Jewish settler, Yoram Skolnik,
from prison after he served only seven years of a life prison
sentence for killing a Palestinian, who was lying on the ground
with his arms tied, by shooting him in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ taken against the advice of Israel's Attorney
General's office _ has infuriated Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   It has not escaped their notice that one of those who commuted
the settler's original sentence was Israel's president, Ezer
Weizman, who is now under police investigation for accepting huge
cash gifts from a French millionaire friend.
</P>
<P>
   This is not all. Israel's foreign minister, David Levy _ already
under fire for a speech in which promised to avenge future
Hezbollah attacks on Israel with a ``child for a child'' (a threat
that, fulfilled, would amount to a war crime) _ has caused more
havoc by announcing that he would never agree to withdrawal from
the Golan Heights to the border lines of June 4, 1967 _ Syria's
foremost demand, which Barak himself seemed to have accepted.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak's standing has been eroded by an official report that
found massive campaign finance violations by his electoral
coalition, One Israel _ now subject to a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst all this, the country is agonizing over what will happen
when Barak carries out his pledge, confirmed by his cabinet on
Sunday, to withdraw forces from south Lebanon by July, if necessary
without a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Fears abound that a unilateral withdrawal will make the Middle
East even more unstable, and that an escalating spiral of violence
will begin.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Barak will be around to see it is now becoming a matter
of genuine debate. &QL;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ First corruption allegations, then a stunning defeat
in parliament, and now a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The ground under Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, seems to
be slipping by the day.
</P>
<P>
   The latest blow came Tuesday when a cabinet colleague, Yitzhak
Mordechai _ a former defense minister who now holds the transport
portfolio _ suspended himself from his post pending an
investigation into accusations that he sexually assaulted a
23-year-old woman civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged incident _ which has caused a storm in the Israel
media, despite the minister's denials _ would normally be chalked
up as a routine political setback, had it not coincided with a
lengthening list of signs that Barak is losing his footing, and
that this is undermining his role in the stalled Middle East peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week his parliamentary coalition fractured, allowing
his opponents to win the first reading of a critical bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barak faces a ``no-confidence'' motion after an uproar over
his education minister's plans to include the work of a nationalist
Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, on the school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   If it ever comes to a vote, the signs are that his coalition
would betray him again.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, unrest and tension among the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza have risen sharply _ with an historic
Papal visit less than two weeks away - fuelled by the endless
failure of their nationalist aspirations to make any progress.

   (UNDATED) _ ``For goodness sake don't quote me,'' a very senior
Clinton administration official said recently. ``Frankly though,
even if George W. wins the White House, judging by the people
around him, I think the foreign policy he conducts won't be very
different from what you see right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such of course will not be the impression conveyed as the U.S.
presidential election campaign moves towards its climax later this
year, and accusations of incompetence, bias and pusillanimity fill
the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's de facto coronation of Vice President Al Gore
and George W. Bush as the Democrat and Republican standard-bearers
in November sets up a choice which, for America's allies, could
hardly be more reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have been mocked for his mangling of the English
language and his inability to name various world leaders in the
news. It is also true that his direct foreign policy experience is
next to nil. But his pedigree is impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, Sr. too was famous for the malapropisms known as
Bushisms. But by common consent he was one of the most skilled
foreign policy presidents of recent times, and several of his close
aides are helping behind the scenes with his son's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are wise old retainers like Brent Scowcroft, National
Security Advisor between 1989 and 1993, and Condolezza Rice, a key
policymaker on the Soviet Union for George Sr. She is respected by
Democrats as well as Republicans, and tipped as a possible NSA
chief for Bush Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And when thoughts turn to potential Republican secretaries of
state, the name that trips first off almost tongue is that of Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs under Bush, the presidential
dream candidate-who-never-was in 1996, and everybody's favorite
American statesman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, his credentials could hardly be better. No vice
president has been more closely involved in foreign policy-making,
with special responsibilities in key areas like Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On many issues, notably the Balkans, his instincts are more
hawkish than those of the current president. For the first time,
too, since Teddy Roosevelt 90 years ago, the U.S. would have a
president interested in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in November, we're not very worried either
way,'' one British diplomat says, summing up the prevailing mood.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the one discernible frisson is over the man widely
tipped to be Gore's secretary of state, the redoubtable Richard
Holbrooke, current U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and
architect of the Dayton peace accords in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Holbrooke's talents _ only the mixture of
self-promotion and diplomatic thuggery with which he projects
them. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The two rebel candidates for the U.S. presidency
were set to bow to the inevitable and leave the race after
suffering crushing defeats in Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Closeted with their families and advisers at opposite ends of
the country for much of Wednesday, they were expected to make
formal announcements Thursday that their insurgencies, which had
generated so much excitement and inspired record turnouts from New
England to California, were at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, who won not a
single state, let it be known that he would throw in his lot with
Vice President Al Gore when he announced his formal withdrawal
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose duel with George W. Bush
had become particularly bitter and personal in its latter stages,
was still considering his position, despite this chummy invitation
from Bush in a breakfast television interview Wednesday: ``I would
say, John, let's team up and let's win. Let's beat Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not, as Bush then clarified, an offer of the vice
presidential slot to McCain, just a call to unity.
</P>
<P>
   His team had hoped that McCain would be able to come close
enough to Bush in a sufficient number of states to justify
continuing his challenge, but all the big prizes _ California, New
York and Ohio _ eluded him on Tuesday, leaving him with victories
only in four of the five small New England states and decisively
defeated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The effective end to the insurgencies that had breathed new life
into a flagging primary process and galvanized hundreds of
thousands of new voters was mourned by supporters of both men.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk shows and the Internet buzzed with the protests of
disconsolate voters, pledging to vote for no one in November rather
than betray their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   America's vast army of media pundits, however, was downbeat,
dismissing the end of the rebellions as only to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   No insurgent, they pointed out, has won the Republican
presidential nomination since 1964, and Barry Goldwater's win then
was possible only because the party establishment was in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, it was noted, even so popular and well
supported a figure as Edward Kennedy was unable to buck the system.
</P>
<P>
   The organizational advantage enjoyed by Gore as vice president
and Bush as the early anointee of his party hierarchy was
formidable. The youth and enthusiasm of the insurgents' campaign
staff could not compensate for the presence on the ground of Bush
and Gore campaign workers in practically every constituency for
weeks and even months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and McCain had sharp professionals masterminding
their campaign strategies; when the pace of primaries accelerated
and campaigns had to be waged simultaneously in far distant parts
of the country, however, there was nothing to having the support of
the local trade union or Republican machine.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had made a failed bid for the union machine; but both he
and McCain were treated as pariahs by their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   They could count the number of Congressional and state
government supporters only in low single digits, and while this
proved a perverse advantage to McCain in Michigan, where he
benefited from a protest vote against the state governor, the
opposite was more often true.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, perhaps, money was less of an advantage
to the front-runners than establishment clout. Bush's record 70
million dollar war chest was down to its last 10 million before
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley tapped into new sources of money via the
Internet. Bradley also attracted wealthy sponsors from Wall Street
and Silicon Valley, and if money were the only consideration they
could both plausibly continue their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns, however, made mistakes, and Bradley's in
particular suffered an eerie sequence of sheer bad luck. Bradley's
first and biggest mistake, with hindsight, was not to rebuff and
keep rebuffing the malevolent misrepresentation of his health
proposals that was put about by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once pensioners, the poor and ethnic minorities were given the
idea that Bradley's plans would make them worse off, Bradley lost
some of his key constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain learned from Bradley's early mistake, and responded to
each and every underhand attack from the Bush campaign. There were
drawbacks to that tactic, too, however, as McCain risked being seen
as excessively combative.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the ethical high road, as both insurgents tried to do,
was the key to much of their initial support. But it left them
damned if they retaliated in kind to their opponents' so-called
``negative advertising,'' and damned if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bradley was starting to get his campaign back on track,
he was forced to cancel two days of a West Coast tour because of a
heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   However he might insist that an irregular heartbeat was no
impediment to being president, it dented his image as a super-fit
former athlete and his failure to disclose it before damaged his
reputation for straight talk.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, his luck just seemed to run out: the heating on a
chartered plane failed, another developed engine trouble; and at
his final rally the lights fused.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest piece of bad luck, however, was John McCain. In the
early primaries, the two were essentially competing for many of the
same voters: independent-minded and nonaffiliated voters with an
interest in changing the political system.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's heroic life history and his talent for ``connecting''
with voters gave him an immediate advantage over Bradley. Bradley
lost New Hampshire to Gore by only 4 percent; McCain beat Bush by
19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If even a few of those votes had gone to Bradley, the whole
course of the race might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   In winning over Bradley's voters, however, McCain arguably lost
his own. His appeal to independents and Democrats came at the
expense of his appeal to mainstream Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Among McCain's devoted supporters, many are already pressing him
to leave the Republican Party and run for the presidency as an
independent. Even as he conceded defeat on Tuesday night, however,
McCain repeated his insistence that he was a loyal Republican and
would stick with his party. That is unlikely to change overnight. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The two rebel candidates for the U.S. presidency
were set to bow to the inevitable and leave the race after
suffering crushing defeats in Tuesday's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Closeted with their families and advisers at opposite ends of
the country for much of Wednesday, they were expected to make
formal announcements Thursday that their insurgencies, which had
generated so much excitement and inspired record turnouts from New
England to California, were at an end.

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So at least we now know where we stand. Following the electoral
fireworks of ``Super Tuesday'' _ ``Mega Tuesday,'' as some
commentators took to calling it _ we now know that it is George W.
Bush and Al Gore who will confront each other in the U.S.
presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who put the liberal cat among the cautious
pigeons, and John McCain, the Vietnam veteran who was unafraid to
call a spade a spade, are both out for the count.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York were among the states that gave the
all-round thumbs-down to Bradley and McCain, who both now look set
to acknowledge the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the two outsiders is a loss for American
politics. Both provided alternative voices that needed _ and need _
to be heard. We are now left with the old Establishment, scarcely
shaken or stirred.
</P>
<P>
   This exciting stage of the primaries will, however, leave at
least a trace. The waters are likely to close over the now-drowning
Bradley, whose main legacy will be a reminder that one has to be
seriously tough in order to become a presidential candidate. Nice
man though he was, he failed that basic test.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, may have done U.S. politics a lasting favor
with his successes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, he is not quite the liberal he is sometimes
purported to be. He is a classic conservative on many issues, from
abortion to gun control. But he has shown a sense of morality,
which is in itself to be admired.
</P>
<P>
   He has displayed a conviction that he lives for his beliefs,
rather than because of a craving for power.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments of recent weeks would suggest that this could be
the death of caring conservatism. Bush appears to have thrown his
lot in with the religious right. But there is little evidence that
Bush will prove some intolerant monster.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, he may well be as liberal as McCain would
have been. Nor, despite his apparent eagerness to please the
redneck right in recent weeks, will he necessarily stay painted
into that corner.
</P>
<P>
   This stage of the primaries is notable for forcing people to
define themselves in opposition to their opponents, and to target a
particular niche. Once the field has thinned out, the candidate can
afford to become more all-embracing.

<P>
   So at least we now know where we stand. Following the electoral
fireworks of ``Super Tuesday'' _ ``Mega Tuesday,'' as some
commentators took to calling it _ we now know that it is George W.
Bush and Al Gore who will confront each other in the U.S.
presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who put the liberal cat among the cautious
pigeons, and John McCain, the Vietnam veteran who was unafraid to
call a spade a spade, are both out for the count.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York were among the states that gave the
all-round thumbs-down to Bradley and McCain, who both now look set
to acknowledge the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the two outsiders is a loss for American
politics. Both provided alternative voices that needed _ and need _
to be heard. We are now left with the old Establishment, scarcely
shaken or stirred.
</P>
<P>
   This exciting stage of the primaries will, however, leave at
least a trace. The waters are likely to close over the now-drowning
Bradley, whose main legacy will be a reminder that one has to be
seriously tough in order to become a presidential candidate. Nice
man though he was, he failed that basic test.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, may have done U.S. politics a lasting favor
with his successes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, he is not quite the liberal he is sometimes
purported to be. He is a classic conservative on many issues, from
abortion to gun control. But he has shown a sense of morality,
which is in itself to be admired.
</P>
<P>
   He has displayed a conviction that he lives for his beliefs,
rather than because of a craving for power.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments of recent weeks would suggest that this could be
the death of caring conservatism. Bush appears to have thrown his
lot in with the religious right. But there is little evidence that
Bush will prove some intolerant monster.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, he may well be as liberal as McCain would
have been. Nor, despite his apparent eagerness to please the
redneck right in recent weeks, will he necessarily stay painted
into that corner.
</P>
<P>
   This stage of the primaries is notable for forcing people to
define themselves in opposition to their opponents, and to target a
particular niche. Once the field has thinned out, the candidate can
afford to become more all-embracing.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never seem to change. The most notorious moment in
the campaign waged by George Bush (senior) was when he tried to
paint his opponent, Michael Dukakis, as soft on a convicted rapist.
</P>

   In this respect (as in so many others), George W. appears to be

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Voters across America, from the small states of New
England in the east to the broad sweep of California in the west,
went to the polls Tuesday in ``Super Tuesday'' primaries that
looked set to crown Vice President Al Gore and George W. Bush as
the two contenders for the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   Their challengers, whose rebel crusades had unexpectedly
enlivened the long weeks of campaigning, and at times even
threatened a lasting upset, appeared down, but _ in the case of the
Republican, Senator John McCain _ not yet out of contention
completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose final rally in the Southern California city of San
Diego was described by one participant as ``so sad, it was almost a
wake,'' spent the day quietly in Los Angeles, before a planned
``victory'' celebration in Hollywood after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   He and his campaign team still hoped for the sort of surprise
sprung by Michigan's voters, which brought him back into the race
after his double-figure defeat in South Carolina just three days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Latest opinion polls suggested that he had a good chance of
victory in the New England states and could still overtake Bush in
New York, but that Ohio and Georgia were lost, as _ more
distressingly _ was California.
</P>
<P>
   The best that McCain could hope for there was a narrow victory
in the so-called ``popular vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was well ahead among registered Republicans, the only vote
that counted in terms of delegates to the Republican National
Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still a chance that McCain could prevail in the
overall tally.
</P>
<P>
   California, like Washington state, has a two-tier system that
allows all registered voters to vote for whomever they like, but
only the votes of registered Republicans count in the contest for
convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly close results in the other states voting Tuesday
could yet postpone McCain's departure from the presidential race,
but next week's primaries across the South are expected to seal his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   The future for Bill Bradley, Gore's sole challenger for the
Democratic Party's nomination looked even less bright.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator and former player for the New York
Knicks professional basketball team, was up early, meeting and
greeting commuters at a Manhattan subway station, from where he
went on to a local school to hobnob with voters as they emerged
from the voting hall.
</P>
<P>
   And while he, too, had a ``victory'' party planned for New York
City Tuesday night, he was said to have set aside Wednesday for
consultations with his staff _ consultations likely to leave Gore
the de facto Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence of both front-runners could be gauged by the
elaborate arrangements each had made for their victory parties last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Both were at their national headquarters in their home states:
Gore in Nashville, Tenn., and Bush _ who is Governor of Texas _ in
the state capital, Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was reported to have ``four buckets of
confetti'' ready for release in anticipation of a countrywide
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and Texas both hold their primaries next week, but the
presence of the two front-runners at their headquarters was a clear
signal to the country that as of last night they, and only they,
were duelling to succeed President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 states voted Tuesday; 15 held Democratic primaries or
caucuses, and 13 held Republican ballots (i.e., 12 held both).
</P>
<P>
   And while the only close results were expected in New York and
the popular vote in California, America's usually voluble political
pundits were cautious, having seen their forecasts confounded in
New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   As in these states, one of the biggest imponderables was the
turnout, which was expected to be the highest in primaries for
years, perhaps ever, reflecting the extent to which the energetic
insurgency of McCain had galvanized a new generation of voters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 650, OR CONTINUE TO 825) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   With voting brisk, a minor spat erupted on the sidelines about
the use of ``exit polls.''
</P>
<P>
   These polls, which estimate the final outcome on the basis of
asking voters how they have voted as they emerge from the polling
station, have increasingly enabled broadcasters and others to
pronounce the result, often with uncanny accuracy, within seconds
of the polls closing.
</P>
<P>
   Exit pollsters, however, also make running tallies and release
to subscribers, under strict embargo, periodic ``results'' through
the day. The leaking of these interim ``results'' on the Internet
prompted first complaints, and then legal action, from the polling
company.
</P>
<P>
   The company complained that it was abuse of its information (and
could influence the outcome). The Internet magazine, Slate, among
others, however, defended its decision to publish as being in the
interests of free speech and noted that the electoral world stood
to be transformed by the Internet and the clock could not be turned
back. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLAND, SWITZERLAND _ Water is the most basic of elements upon
which life depends, yet we seem to understand little about it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a developing water crisis in many parts of the world.
Increased flooding and droughts are a symptom. But do the technical
experts and the politicians understand where the solution really
lies?
</P>
<P>
   The world's increasing difficulties in managing its supplies of
fresh water cannot be tackled without a thorough understanding of
the complete water cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The problems must be seen in the context of the falls in
underground water levels in much of the world, and of catastrophic
droughts in some regions while others, such as Mozambique, suffer
catastrophic flooding.
</P>
<P>
   What prompts these thoughts is the forthcoming Global Water
Forum at The Hague from March 17 to 22.
</P>
<P>
   It will bring together thousands of experts, politicians and
representatives of nongovernmental organizations to address the
global freshwater crisis.
</P>
<P>
   My fear is that, without serious analysis of the fundamental
causes of the problem, this worthy conference will be reduced to
considering the sort of unsustainable technological solutions that
we have seen in the past.
</P>
<P>
   How long are we to go on ignoring the simple fact that the main
cause of the crisis is degradation of the natural environment, and
particularly the water cycle?
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, water-storing ponds, lakes and wetlands have
been reclaimed, depleting water sources and vastly increasing the
risk of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, deforestation and the diversion of rivers have
severely restricted the natural capacity of the landscape to retain
rainfall and refill underground water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   We affect the water cycle by discharging pollutants both
directly into aquatic ecosystems and on the land, from where they
leach into waterways.
</P>
<P>
   We have released sufficient quantities of greenhouse gases into
the atmosphere to change the climate of the entire planet,
seriously threatening wetlands and altering weather patterns so
that more floods and droughts can be expected in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of the world's 6 billion people have
no access to safe drinking water, while almost half lack adequate
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the human suffering caused, this is appalling. But
the full implications are much wider: Degradation of water
resources is the main barrier preventing the world from achieving
shared goals of good public health, security of food supplies and a
better standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to solve the water crisis is to stop assuming that
we are competing with nature and welcome natural systems as our
ally.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in India, where water tables have been falling
rapidly, we can see how restoration of ecosystems and watersheds
goes hand in hand with efficient harvesting of rainwater.
Underground water sources are refilled and can continue to meet the
basic needs of many people.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, studies show that the energy needs that will
accompany expected economic growth can be served without recourse
to large dams or nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Concentration on energy efficiency and renewable sources not
only makes economic sense but also represents perhaps our best hope
of tackling the causes of climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Conserving and restoring natural processes pays off. The U.S.
government has embarked on a program to restore the ecosystems of
the Florida Everglades to ensure water supplies for growing
populations in Miami and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity that the degradation has reached such a stage that
taxpayers are obliged to meet a bill of $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, water resources were recognized and respected
in both practical and spiritual terms. It is time to remember the
lessons of our forebears and change our behavior to protect our
sources of water and the natural processes that create them.
</P>
<P>
   They are ultimately life support systems on which we depend. &QL;

   GLAND, SWITZERLAND _ Water is the most basic of elements upon
which life depends, yet we seem to understand little about it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a developing water crisis in many parts of the world.
Increased flooding and droughts are a symptom. But do the technical
experts and the politicians understand where the solution really
lies?
</P>
<P>
   The world's increasing difficulties in managing its supplies of
fresh water cannot be tackled without a thorough understanding of
the complete water cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The problems must be seen in the context of the falls in
underground water levels in much of the world, and of catastrophic
droughts in some regions while others, such as Mozambique, suffer
catastrophic flooding.
</P>
<P>
   What prompts these thoughts is the forthcoming Global Water
Forum at The Hague from March 17 to 22.
</P>
<P>
   It will bring together thousands of experts, politicians and
representatives of nongovernmental organizations to address the
global freshwater crisis.
</P>
<P>
   My fear is that, without serious analysis of the fundamental
causes of the problem, this worthy conference will be reduced to
considering the sort of unsustainable technological solutions that
we have seen in the past.
</P>
<P>
   How long are we to go on ignoring the simple fact that the main
cause of the crisis is degradation of the natural environment, and
particularly the water cycle?
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, water-storing ponds, lakes and wetlands have
been reclaimed, depleting water sources and vastly increasing the
risk of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, deforestation and the diversion of rivers have
severely restricted the natural capacity of the landscape to retain
rainfall and refill underground water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   We affect the water cycle by discharging pollutants both
directly into aquatic ecosystems and on the land, from where they
leach into waterways.
</P>
<P>
   We have released sufficient quantities of greenhouse gases into
the atmosphere to change the climate of the entire planet,
seriously threatening wetlands and altering weather patterns so
that more floods and droughts can be expected in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of the world's 6 billion people have
no access to safe drinking water, while almost half lack adequate
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the human suffering caused, this is appalling. But
the full implications are much wider: Degradation of water
resources is the main barrier preventing the world from achieving
shared goals of good public health, security of food supplies and a
better standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to solve the water crisis is to stop assuming that
we are competing with nature and welcome natural systems as our
ally.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in India, where water tables have been falling
rapidly, we can see how restoration of ecosystems and watersheds
goes hand in hand with efficient harvesting of rainwater.
Underground water sources are refilled and can continue to meet the
basic needs of many people.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, studies show that the energy needs that will
accompany expected economic growth can be served without recourse
to large dams or nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Concentration on energy efficiency and renewable sources not
only makes economic sense but also represents perhaps our best hope
of tackling the causes of climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Conserving and restoring natural processes pays off. The U.S.
government has embarked on a program to restore the ecosystems of
the Florida Everglades to ensure water supplies for growing
populations in Miami and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity that the degradation has reached such a stage that
taxpayers are obliged to meet a bill of $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, water resources were recognized and respected
in both practical and spiritual terms. It is time to remember the
lessons of our forebears and change our behavior to protect our
sources of water and the natural processes that create them.
</P>
<P>
   They are ultimately life support systems on which we depend. &QL;

&HT;     WOUNDED EAGLE RETURNS TO SAN FRANCISCO ZOO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Bobbie flew away in 1994, little did the
people at the San Francisco Zoo realize that they would someday be
reunited with the beautiful bald eagle they had watched being born.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years later, Bobbie is back. But he will no longer be
able to fly because in January someone shot him, piercing one of
his wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saddens everyone,'' said Kathy Hobson, an aviculturist at
the San Francisco Zoo. ``It took a thoughtless person to put an end
to this bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bobbie survived the bullet wound from a .22 caliber
rifle, part of his wing was removed, and he will no longer be able
to fly or breed as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The bald eagle is a powerful bird distinguished by its white
head and tail contrasted by its dark brown body. Though once
endangered, the bald eagle population in the lower 48 states has
increased considerably in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The bird is also found in greater numbers in North America,
nesting on both coasts from Florida to Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Hatched at the San Francisco Zoo, Bobbie was a week old in April
1994 when he was placed in a nest in Catalina Island as part of a
recovery project. He was soon adopted by a pair of bald eagles.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Zoo's Avian Conservation Center, home of the
Bald Eagle Recovery Project, is the only large-scale captive
breeding program for bald eagles in the Western United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, 36 chicks have been successfully hatched from eggs
brought from nests in Catalina or breeding pairs at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie was one of them. He was released on Catalina Island at
the same time as another bald eagle chick from the program.
</P>
<P>
   When he was found wounded in January near Bakersfield, he ended
up in the care of veterinarian Thomas Banks, who found
identification bands on the eagle's right and left legs linking him
to the zoo's monitoring program. The bird was returned to the zoo
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie will be quarantined as a precaution for the next 30 days
before visitors will be able to get a glimpse of him, zoo officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo veterinarian Freeland Dunker has performed general tests on
Bobbie and said the quarantine would help him adjust to his new
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeding him a variety of things, including fish,'' zoo
spokeswoman Nancy Chan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie's permanent home at the zoo, once he's taken out of
quarantine, will be on Eagle Island, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bald eagles live a relatively long time. The longest known life
span for a bald eagle living in the wild was reported near Haines,
Alaska, as 28 years old. Bald eagles from Arizona are known to have
exceeded 12 years of age. In captivity, bald eagles may live 40 or
more years.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Public that favors gun control held hostage by NRA
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After just about every notorious new, senseless shooting spree _
most recently the death of that six-year-old girl, those five shot
by a Pennsylvania man in anti-white rage _ my wife asks how many
more must die before we get sensible gun control. The question is
only rhetorical, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be because the answer is already in: the numbers do
not matter because the powers resisting gun control simply don't
care about them. There is no elusive, magical body count out there
that will trip legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   If there were, we would have comprehensive control now, instead
of our current mishmash of laws. After all, year in and year out,
we lose more of our folks to gunfire than most other comparable
democracies combined.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton keeps pointing out, last year we lost some
4,700 children in gun deaths _ more than the child gun deaths in
the next 25 countries altogether. Even that can't unstick beholden
members of Congress from gun-lobby money and the votes promised
with it. (Or stiffen the craven against the threat implied to those
who disdain it.)
</P>
<P>
   So, although the public overwhelmingly, though inchoately,
supports gun control and has for decades, the nation remains
hostage to the National Rifle Association's permanent hysteria _
any control is a step toward federal storm troopers kicking in your
door and snatching your guns! _ and hostage to the big money and
the power politics that support the hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the current stand-off. The House and Senate passed
mild-to-meaningless controls last year, but there were signal
differences over one feature that could really matter: provisions
to close a loophole that allows sales at gun shows without
background checks. The Senate version plugs the loophole. The House
version pretends to.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference is necessary to resolve the
differences, and the president recently called in leaders of both
chambers and urged action. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the key
player, said no.
</P>
<P>
   (The NRA remains bee-busy in the state legislatures, too. It was
instrumental just days ago in killing a bill in Georgia that would
have held adults liable for negligently leaving firearms where kids
could get to them easily.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, just like my wife, recently asked, ``How many more
people have to get killed before we do something?''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, when it is expected to, dutifully tsk-tsks over gun
victims, but in truth it doesn't really give a hoot about them. If
it did, it would be trying to prevent gun crime. Instead, its
response to every new gun outrage is only to call for putting
someone in prison, though that is self-evidently not a deterrent
and is cold comfort to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of fussing in the political atmosphere about
victims' rights. The most important right is the right to be given
a fair crack at not becoming a victim in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   On average, we're sacrificing 13 kids a day to keep the NRA
happy. It's political paganism.

CRITICS' DARLING VS. `AMERICAN' INSIDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The safest bet to make in the Best Actress race at this year's
Academy Awards: Whoever wins will not have won before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of the five nominees, only one _ Meryl Streep _ has
even been nominated for Best Actress before (Julianne Moore and
Annette Bening were previously nominated for supporting roles).
</P>
<P>
   Streep received her record-tying 12th nomination _ all but two
for lead roles _ for ``Music of the Heart,'' a sentimental,
fact-based drama that met with decidely mixed critical and audience
response. Actually, it met with little audience response; according
to the Internet Movie Database, the October 1999 release hadn't
even grossed $15 million by mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   It's often said that Streep is nominated just for being in a
movie, and many of the films she was nominated for _ ``One True
Thing,'' ``Postcards From the Edge,'' ``Ironweed'' _ are uneven
enough to give this credence. That she was nominated this year is
indicative of an ongoing problem in the motion-picture industry:
not enough strong lead roles for actresses.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing that can be said for this year's roles is that
nobody was nominated for playing a hooker, but aside from Streep's
music teacher, the characters weren't exactly what you'd call nice
people. The nominated roles include a woman who practiced deception
for deception's sake (Hilary Swank, ``Boys Don't Cry''); a single
mother whose solution to all her problems is to run away (Janet
McTeer, ``Tumbleweeds''); an insufferable homemaker/real-estate
agent (Annette Bening, ``American Beauty''); and an adulterer
(Julianne Moore, ``The End of the Affair'') _ although she
experiences a life-changing crisis that helps her find God.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moore is excellent in ``The End of the Affair'' as a
British aristocrat's wife who becomes involved in a torrid affair
with a novelist (Ralph Fiennes), you can scratch her off your list
of likely winners. Columbia Pictures, which released the movie,
never seemed to know what a good thing it had _ it was one of last
year's best films _ and botched the initial marketing, opening the
movie in limited release with little fanfare. When Columbia wised
up and widened the release, it was too little, too late, and even
Moore's nomination couldn't inspire the studio to give the movie a
bigger push.
</P>
<P>
   With Moore and Streep out of the running, the competition comes
down to a three-way race among Bening, McTeer and Swank. If you
were to go by previous awards, Swank would appear to have the edge
for her performance in ``Boys Don't Cry'' as Teena Brandon, a young
Nebraska woman who posed as a man named Brandon Teena and was
eventually murdered because of the deception. Swank won Best
Dramatic Actress at the Golden Globes, and was honored by the Los
Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle
and the Dallas-Fort Worth Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Oscar voters don't think like critics, and ``Boys,'' though
much-admired, was little seen _ so far, it has grossed even less
than ``The End of the Affair'' or ``Music of the Heart.'' And
though Swank is amazing (her co-star Chloe Sevigny, a Best
Supporting Actress nominee, is even better), the movie may be too
brutally raw for voters' tastes, and that will work against Swank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds,'' on the other hand, is easy to take _ if you can
get past McTeer's character, whose flightiness is more annoying
than charming (she really makes you empathize with her
long-suffering daughter, well-played by Kimberly Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the critical praise McTeer received hinged on the
knowledge of her range: She's a British stage actress who won a
Tony Award for her performance in Henrik Ibsen's deadly serious ``A
Doll's House,'' then made her movie breakthrough playing a
comically free-spirited Southern American mom. Judging from
``Tumbleweeds''' lackluster box office, audiences didn't much care;
don't expect the academy to care much either, even though McTeer
won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves Bening, who has more on her side than her
appearance in one of last year's most-acclaimed movies. For one
thing, ``American Beauty'' was a hit (grossing more money than the
other four Best Actress movies combined) whereas Bening's
competition starred in movies that few people saw (and just because
the films were nominated doesn't mean that Oscar voters will
actually ``watch'' them). For another, DreamWorks has been smarter
than any other studio when it comes to Oscar marketing _ even
before ``Beauty'' received its seven nominations, the studio gave
it a huge, renewed Oscar-season re-release.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, is that Bening is much more of a
Hollywood insider than Swank and McTeer, and her marriage to Warren
Beatty should earn her a lot of votes just because of all the
friends they have in the community. She might not be at the March
26 ceremony because she's pregnant, and her baby is due right
around Oscar night. Academy Awards voters are a sentimental bunch,
and they're likely to give her an unusual baby-shower present.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Bening scores one of ``American Beauty's'' many
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Personal pick: Although ``Boys Don't Cry'' eventually
degenerates into tabloid sensationalism, Swank is never less than
compelling in her gender-twisting role.

A MAMMOTH UNDERTAKING IN SIBERIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, they're not exhuming Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bona fide woolly mammoth in ``Raising the Mammoth,'' a
two-hour Discovery Channel special televised worldwide on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a woolly mammoth that died 20,000 years ago was
pulled from the Siberian permafrost and helicoptered 200 miles to
an ice cave, where its flesh is getting a slow thaw and its hair a
nice blow-dry.
</P>
<P>
   The thing was huge _ one mammoth could equal the weight of 130
men, or maybe 50 guests on ``Jerry Springer'' _ and might have
drowned after slipping into a pond. It was a 47-year-old male, not
many years away from a natural death.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think of it as Jocko. But its name, now if not then,
is Jarkov, for the Siberian nomad family that found its tusks
protruding from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Jarkov isn't the only mammoth ever to be unearthed. Still, he's
an impressive specimen of a species that's been extinct for 10,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   So impressive that he might be cloned. Or possibly bred, in
absentia, with an Asian elephant to create a hybrid. An elemoth,
maybe?
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel helped to finance the mammoth expedition,
which was led by French explorer Bernard Buigues, so it could film
Sunday's special.
</P>
<P>
   It's always interesting how these programs find scientists who
specialize, passionately, in some particular creature. Here, a few
mammoth lovers have dreamed for decades about stroking the wiry
hairs of a mammoth. Their dreams are fulfilled, and they behave
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They even get, oh boy, a good whiff of Jarkov's dung and urine.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel's job is to fire the public imagination.
It doesn't help that chipping away at permafrost doesn't exactly
make for riveting TV, or that the special ends with most of Jarkov
still encased in a block of ice.
</P>
<P>
   But really: 20,000 years, extinct species, big tusks, lousy
weather, Regis Philbin. All right, no Regis, but it's hard to
suppress a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel tries to help with occasional shots of
computer-generated mammoths, loping along like elephants, and with
a sometimes overwrought script.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tempest sweeps across the tundra like a legion of arctic
ghosts,'' the narrator says at one point, and you might wish they'd
put a tusk in it. The voice on my screening tape was a woman's,
though it's to be actor Jeff Bridges' voice in the final version.
</P>
<P>
   The program is due to be televised Sunday in 146 nations and 23
languages.
</P>
<P>
   About the cloning, many experts are pessimistic because DNA,
even frozen, deteriorates with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, who knows? We might eventually have woolly mammoths for
house pets. My bet is they'd make excellent guard animals, but you
might think hard about your china cabinet.

   When Kathie Lee Gifford announced her impending departure from
``Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee,'' one reason she cited was that she
didn't want her son Cody, 10, exposed to any more public attention.
</P>
<P>
   That puzzled many observers, who tried to recall anyone but
Gifford herself exhibiting the slightest public interest in the
kid.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, along comes the movie ``Model Behavior'' on ABC's ``The
Wonderful World of Disney'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Kathie Lee Gifford and, in the cameo role of a
boy being groomed to be a photo model, a 10-year-old actor of,
shall we say, indeterminable origin. Sometimes you just shake your
head and wonder.

   Lucky you if you get the TV Land cable channel, because ``The
Honeymooners'' is returning for another round on television.
</P>
<P>
   After nightly specials at 7 and 10 p.m. each weeknight next week
_ a new documentary, a collection of sketches from Jackie Gleason's
``Cavalcade of Stars'' and two unusual ``Honeymooners''
installments _ the so-called ``classic 39'' episodes of the show
reach TV Land.
</P>
<P>
   First is a 48-hour marathon beginning at, gulp!, 3 a.m. on March
18. Then, starting March 20, the 39 filmed episodes will be shown
on TV Land's regular nightly lineup at 8 and 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's seminal television comedy. And still funny after half a
century.

</P>
<P>
   Finally, a show that's new and worth a peek is ``Cover Me,''
which debuted last weekend on the USA Network. The second episode
is Sunday at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Shaun Cassidy and purportedly based on a true story,
the series is an odd mix of drama and comedy as it traces the
adventures of an entire family that went undercover for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as ``The Wonder Years'' meets ``The Sopranos.''
Weird stuff, but nicely cast and a handsome show.
</P>
<P>
   You might almost think that there was something out of the
ordinary in Cassidy's own childhood.

FUNDING AVIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Senate has come close to meeting an obligation to air
travelers by reaching a compromise with the House to increase funds
for aviation. The move comes at a late but appropriate time, just
after the Federal Aviation Administration released its forecast of
major growth in commercial, cargo, and general aviation over the
next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise increases outlays in the fiscal 2001 federal
budget to $12.7 billion from the current $10 billion for a wide
range of airport projects and improved safety systems essential to
support existing activity as well as projected growth.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and successive administrations have tended to underfund
aviation activity, spending only about 80 percent of funds raised
by passenger fees, with the balance used to reduce budget deficits.
This failure has contributed to the most nagging problems of
commercial aviation _ frequent delays and cancellations of flights.
</P>
<P>
   But the money should be linked to commitments by the airlines to
confer the benefits of competition in areas where de facto
monopolies currently allow both predatory fare schedules and the
abandonment of air service when traffic levels are deemed too low
to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective growth of traffic is impressive, and it should
be realized if fuel prices do not soar excessively. The FAA
predicts that commercial airline fleets will expand from their
current level of 4,300 planes to 6,400 in 2011, coupled with an
additional 630 cargo planes and 24,500 general aviation aircraft.
International traffic is expected to grow even faster than domestic
travel. Air fares are expected to decline on average and in
constant dollars by about 1.3 percent a year _ excluding the impact
of fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gains that the general public would most widely
welcome would be further improvements on aircraft noise _ the
source of persistent complaints and the root of controversies like
that afflicting Logan's plan for a relatively small runway. In the
interim, it is clear that aviation will continue to grow, placing
heavy responsibility on Congress to provide adequate support
operations.

TEST OF IRANIAN JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stunning defeat of hardliners in Iran's recent parliamentary
elections raised hopes in Iran and abroad that the Islamic republic
may be capable of reforming itself democratically and instituting
the rule of law. One immediate test of reform in Iran is the
pending trial of 13 Iranian Jews who are accused of espionage by
hardliners who control the country's judiciary system.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the justice system under the Iranian theocracy has
been arbitrary, political, and unfair. Reformers were imprisoned on
trumped-up charges, as were journalists, artists, and
intellectuals. Dissident figures were murdered by agents of the
intelligence ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the 13 Iranian Jews is patently political. For
hardline clerics in the regime, the espionage charges are a
propaganda tool to be used against reformers, implying that this is
no time for the sort of laxness which the zealots attribute to
President Mohammad Khatami and his reformist backers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the accused Jews are a rabbi, a couple of Hebrew teachers,
and a boy who was 14 at the time of his arrest. Since any contact
with the designated enemies of the Islamic revolution _ Israel and
the United States _ can be defined as evidence of espionage, it is
all too easy for judicial authorities to frame innocent people. The
political message of a guilty verdict would be that the Islamic
revolution is still threatened from within and from without by
determined and powerful enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Many governments and political leaders have tried to intercede
with Tehran on behalf of the prisoners, including European
countries, Russia, and Bosnia's Muslim president, Alija
Izetbegovic. All to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Iranian Jews should become not merely a gauge
of the power balance between reformers and reactionaries inside
Iran, but also a test of Iran's readiness to overcome its
international pariah status. The 13 pawns in the Iranian power
struggle should be released immediately. If they are brought to
trial, they must have genuine legal representation, and the
proceedings should be open to outside legal observers and human
rights monitors.

LOST CAUSE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the ashes of their failed campaigns, John McCain and Bill
Bradley touted what they said were the accomplishments of their
insurgent candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was proud that his ``crusade'' to end the
stranglehold of special interests on Washington policy makers had
attracted new voters. Bradley claimed credit for putting access to
health care on this year's political agenda. His supporters,
Bradley said, should celebrate their success in forcing ``the
beginning of a new politics in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is fair to ask what they have to celebrate. Bradley
hasn't won a single contest anywhere, and McCain was drubbed badly
everywhere except New England on Tuesday. Now, at an unconscionably
early date on the calendar, the nominating process is essentially
over. Opponents could even argue, as some have, that the causes
embraced by McCain and Bradley were rejected by the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that several of these issues, especially campaign
finance reform and health care access, are important to a
significant number of voters _ most of whom now have no strong
allegiance to either Bush or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   They are also important to the nation as a whole. Many citizens
feel government is controlled not by the people but by special
interests. And the number of Americans with no health insurance _
44 million and climbing _ is a national disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs to do much more to establish credibility behind his
protestations of support for campaign finance reform, and Bush
needs to realize that the free-for-all system he espouses leaves
many people out.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gore's proposal to give more health coverage to
children is far less than is needed, while Bush's rhetoric and
record on this issue are dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have succeeded thus far by winning overwhelming
support from their party regulars. Now, facing an interminable
eight-month general election campaign, both should be seeking new
backers by speaking to major issues such as these. If they fail,
they will squander potential support and bore the country, driving
voter participation to an all-time low.

&HT;     MORE HISPANICS, ASIANS TURN OUT FOR CALIFORNIA PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANNIE NAKAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California voters are becoming more ethnically
diverse as more Hispanics and Asians exercise head to the ballot
boxes, according to surveys of voters as they left polling places
in Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that immigrants have become the new force in
electoral politics in the state,'' said David Lee, director of the
Chinese American Voter Education Committee. ``It's hard to imagine
the Democratic victories of the past few years without Latino
voters. And the Asian vote is just beginning to surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's electorate is notably more affluent than it was in
1992 and happy about it. Substantial numbers of voters said they
were doing better financially than they were eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly coincides with what we know is the general
direction of the California economy,'' said Stephen Levy, director
of the Palo Alto-based Center for the Continuing Study of the
California Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll by the Voter News Service and San Francisco
Examiner was conducted among 4,283 voters.
</P>
<P>
   It found that overall, more women than men voted and for the
first time, more Republican women than men voted in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican women now feel we have some viable candidates who
will take us on to the White House,'' said Shirley Foote, president
of the California Federation of Republican Women.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest shift has been ethnic, with Hispanics clearly
leading that change, according to Mark DiCamillo, an official of
California's Field Poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1980s, it was 80 percent whites and 20 percent
ethnic minorities,'' DiCamillo said. ``Now whites are at 72
percent. What's replacing them are generally Latinos, with some
Asians.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen percent of the voters on Tuesday identified themselves
as Hispanic; 6 percent as Asian; and 6 percent as black.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 primary, 8 percent of voters were Hispanic while in
1998, the Hispanic share of voters was 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DiCamillo credited the surge of Hispanic voters to activism
triggered by Proposition 187, a voter-approved, but court-rejected
1994 measure aimed at banning public services to illegal
immigrants. ``That was a wake-up call for Latinos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barreto said the fact that both the Republican and Democratic
presidential hopefuls courted the Hispanic vote made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing numbers of Hispanics and Asians who are voting
comes at a time when the number of black voters remains about the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known for some time that African-American political
participation has plateaued,'' Lee said. ``Every poll we've done,
including the latest one, show that increasingly, Asians and
Latinos are outnumbering African-Americans at the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Henry, professor of African-American Studies at the
University of California at Berkeley, said the fairly flat showing
of black voters at the polls Tuesday may have indicated lack of
interest in the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about four years ago when Clinton ran, he
certainly had more appeal to black voters than either Gore or
Bradley,'' Henry said, referring the Vice President Al Gore and
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the two Democrats on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley announced Thursday that he was leaving the race after
failing to win any presidential primaries.

   DENVER _ A light snow fell Thursday morning outside the training
headquarters for the Denver Broncos football team and the crowd to
meet George W. Bush, the presumptive nominee for the Republican
nomination, was enthusiastic but small.
</P>
<P>
   The cold was not the problem here. Rather it was that single
word, ``presumptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush came here in spite of the news that John McCain was
withdrawing from the nomination derby after his poor showing in the
Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   For the Texas governor, though, the primary calendar keeps
rolling and today (Friday) is the turn of voters in Colorado, Utah
and Wyoming to have their say.
</P>
<P>
   But Little Friday _ as some have dubbed it _ might now be Fizzle
Friday. Turnouts in Colorado and Utah _ Wyoming has no voting as
such but a series of party meetings _ are expected to be dismally
low as the electorate realizes that both nominations have already
been locked up, by Bush and by Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it is a Friday hardly helps. In America, voting
traditionally happens on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   This was not how it was meant to be. Indeed, this had been
heralded as the year when a region that is sometimes called the
Interior West or the Mountain West and is made up of eight enormous
states constituting almost one quarter of the landmass of the
United States, would at last make itself heard in the presidential
election process after years of being ignored by the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to give voice to the region began two years ago, with
a proposal by the governors of Utah and Colorado to have all eight
of the states _ their own plus Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico,
Arizona, Idaho and Nevada _ vote on a single day that would be
fairly far forward in the primaries schedule.
</P>
<P>
   They earmarked today (Friday), March 10. But in the end, the
plan proved too grandiose. Only the three states voting Friday
backed it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Little Friday seemed like a decent start, though. ``The
Mountain West is on the brink of a monumental breakthrough,'' Utah
Governor Michael Leavitt writes to voters on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now...the Mountain West has been essentially irrelevant
in nominating candidates for the leadership of the free world. The
West has not been heard, it has been stereotyped.''
</P>
<P>
   The stereotyping, however, may not be reversed this year if
turnouts are as low as projected.
</P>
<P>
   And once more, issues that are important to this region _ public
land management, logging policies, water conservation and
protection against nuclear spillage _ may barely make the lips of
the candidates between now and election day in November.
</P>
<P>
   And the frustration among voters here will remain. ``It's kind
of anticlimactic,'' conceded Gina Seamans, a Republican from
Arvada, a Denver suburb, who will vote for McCain today (Friday)
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better if we'd gotten together with more
Western states and made it more of a bigger deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Insult has been added to injury, meanwhile, by the commission
that selects venues for the presidential and vice presidential
debates that provide much of the drama in the final stretches of
the presidential race proper in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   There will be four of these debates, but not one will be held in
the Interior West. There has not been a debate in the region for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just insane,'' Governor Leavitt raged recently,
complaining that to the rest of the country the Interior West
remains just an afterthought. That even though some of the fastest
growing regions in the land are in Utah and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Even this week, U.S. Census figures showed that five of the 10
fastest growing counties in the country are in Colorado, all
beneath the Rocky Mountains close to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Leavitt and the other governors wrote to the
Commission on Presidential Debates, imploring that an additional
debate be arranged and awarded to a city in the West. They were
rudely turned down.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been even worse. With McCain gone, Bush could have
taken Thursday off. Instead, he visited this state, Utah and
Wyoming. For that, the Republican faithful at least, will be
extremely grateful. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ John McCain and Bill Bradley bade farewell to their
presidential ambitions Thursday, accepting with a tinge of
bitterness that they had taken on the political establishment and
lost.
</P>
<P>
   But both stood by their calls for reform and pledged to continue
their crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep fighting, keep fighting!'' McCain urged his backers at
the close of his brief valedictory speech. ``I have been defeated,
but the cause for which I ran has not,'' said Bradley at an
emotional last rally. ``It cannot be erased by one, or even 100,
defeats.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit of both challengers had become inevitable after their
losses in this week's Super Tuesday primaries. Bradley, who had
come within four points of beating Al Gore just five weeks before
in New Hampshire, won not a single state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain failed to make the national breakthrough he had hoped
for, winning only four New England states, albeit by big
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from his mountain retreat in Arizona after a day of
seclusion, McCain said that the voters had spoken, ``and I respect
their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking pale and tired, he told the hushed reporters: ``I am no
longer an active candidate for my party's nomination for
president.'' Technically, he has suspended rather than ended his
campaign, but few believe it will be revived.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that he respected the Republican victor and party
favorite, George W. Bush, and wished him well, but he declined to
endorse his candidacy and said he would take some time ``to reflect
our recent experiences and determine how we can best...bring about
the changes to the practices and institutions of our great
democracy that are the purpose of our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he appeared to scotch speculation that he would break
away from the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Wistfully, he said that he had hoped his campaign could be a
force for change in the Republican Party. Now, he said, ``I will
take our crusade back to the U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Colorado, congratulated his former rival
``for fighting the good fight'' and he said he appreciated McCain's
kind words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also agree with John McCain about the need to reform
Washington, D.C.,'' Bush said. ``In order to reform Washington,
D.C., it's important to get rid of Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   By suspending, rather than winding up, his campaign, McCain does
not surrender the convention delegates he has won in the primaries
so far to Bush. These delegates could now become bargaining
counters in what is believed to be some hard bargaining between his
own camp and that of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, it is said, has set a price for his endorsement of Bush,
which includes acceptance of some provisions of his campaign
finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
   While making no bones about ending his campaign forthwith _ and
taking a well-earned vacation _ Bradley made clear that he was also
retaining his delegates, at least for the time being and he
repeated his insistence that he would not be a candidate for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he will now support and campaign for the man
who beat him, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing reporters and campaign staff in West Orange, N.J.,
where he established his headquarters last year, Bradley said:
``The vice president and I had a stiff competition and he won. Now
it is time for unity. This country needs Democratic leadership and
I will work to ensure a Democratic White House and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   In saying that he would support Gore, however, Bradley declined
to use the word ``endorse,'' an omission seen as a deliberate
reflection of the ill-feeling left by some of Gore's campaign
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also gave the reporters allocated to the campaign two
poignant souvenirs: a tin of his favorite throat lozenges and a
silver key ring from Tiffany's, with a miniature athletic shoe
attached, a reminder of the basketball stardom that had launched
his public career. &QL;

   BERLIN _ The great fund-raiser is back. Helmut Kohl stormed into
the center of German politics Thursday, waving a large bundle of
money he hopes will buy back favor with the party he brought to the
verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Surreptitiously as in the old times, Kohl had again been
assembling a slush fund in recent weeks, but this time the donors
came with names attached.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public appearance for over a month, the
ex-chancellor revealed the names who were behind the DM6 million
war chest.
</P>
<P>
   The money was collected on behalf of the Christian Democrat
Party, to cover the debt Kohl left behind. He has admitted to
having accepted DM2.1 million in cash from unnamed donors while he
was chancellor. As a result the party is facing a fine three times
that sum.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Kohl, looking his ebullient old self, said he was
nearly there. He had to take out a mortgage of DM700,000 on the
family house in Ludwigshafen, and friends have chipped in with the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   The most generous of them was Leo Kirch, the conservative media
mogul, who is stumping up DM1 million. The other 29 donors are
academics, actors, a well-known singer and assorted celebrities,
who contributed upwards of DM5,000 each. The British publisher Lord
Weidenfeld threw DM30,000 into the hat.
</P>
<P>
   In his usual modesty, Kohl made clear that while his donors were
struck by the plight of the party, ``they wanted specifically to
support me.'' When he hands over the full DM6.3 million, his debts
will have been paid, he argues. ``I see no reason to seek
reconciliation with the party,'' Kohl declared.
</P>
<P>
   But the Christian Democrats are unlikely to be in such forgiving
mood. The party has already been fined DM41 million for
improprieties under his reign, so DM6 million will only keep the
bailiffs away for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Party colleagues are also concerned that their former boss is
once again up to his old tricks of buying influence. There are
rumors he plans to return to the Bundestag, and play a key role at
next month's party conference, where the CDU's new leader is to be
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kohl still refuses to make things easier for the
party by revealing the list of his secret donors. ``I've not named
names, and I will not name names,'' he said firmly Thursday. &QL;

 &HT;    AN EYE-OPENING WALK IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF CIVIL RIGHTS PIONEERS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was one of the worst days of my 15 years in
America.
</P>
<P>
   As I stood at an intersection in the central Illinois city of
Danville in April 1996, a white pickup truck zoomed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niggerrrrr!'' the white driver yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked, I could only stare at the white friend who was with me.
I wanted to run after the bigot who had called me a nigger and ask
him to repeat the word to my face. Then I'd beat him up for his
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, I realized for the first time that my nationality
is irrelevant to racists. They only see my brown skin, which to
bigots is my sin. And to them, I am as much a nigger or a monkey as
any African American.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Liberia, West Africa, race was hardly an issue,
though tribal conflicts existed. I didn't even know what racism was
or meant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Liberia was founded by freed slaves from the United
States, I don't recall the history of American slavery ever being
taught in school. I was also unaware of the civil rights movement
and the racism that still plagues America.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people in Third World countries, I believed America
was an utopia where everyone was rich. The thought that one was
judged there based on the color of one's skin never crossed my
mind.
</P>
<P>
   When I moved to the United States in 1984, my stepbrothers and
their cousins, who were African Americans, frequently warned me
about ``those damn white folks in this country who want to keep the
black man down.''
</P>
<P>
   At school, where blacks sat on one side of the cafeteria and
whites on the other side, I was once labeled a ``sellout'' for
sitting with a white friend on the white side of the room.
</P>
<P>
   At first I didn't understand what was going on and why the
tension existed. I didn't understand why there was a Black History
Month.
</P>
<P>
   When I began to study black history in school, I started to see
why African Americans were bitter toward whites. But none of the
history classes I took or books I read prepared me for a recent
trip to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   I was sent to cover the re-enactment of a march that led to the
passing of 1965 Voting Rights Act, which guaranteed all Americans,
regardless of race, the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Selma where the actual march took place, I
visited Birmingham. I had seen film footage from the civil rights
movement on TV, but being in the places where they took place
raised powerful feelings.
</P>
<P>
   I felt angry as I walked in a downtown area, now the Kelly
Ingram Park, where blacks staging sit-ins, even young children, had
been attacked by police dogs. The protesters were also sprayed with
fire hoses powerful enough to rip the bark from a tree 80 feet
away.
</P>
<P>
   I felt bitter when I toured the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church,
where four little girls were killed when it was bombed by white
segregationists in the fall of 1963.
</P>
<P>
   A feeling that I can't describe came over me at the Civil Rights
Institute. There, I touched the gates from the Birmingham jail,
where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter, and
viewed two water fountains labeled ``whites only'' and blacks
only.'' The white fountain was clean, but the black fountain was
rusty and filthy.
</P>
<P>
   The re-enactment of the march in Selma, on the Edmund Pettus
Bridge, brought tears to my eyes. It was on that very bridge that
young John Lewis, now a congressman from Georgia, led 600 peaceful
marchers to protest rules that prevented blacks from voting.
</P>
<P>
   However, before the marchers could make the 54-mile trek to
Montgomery, the state capital, they were attacked by Alabama state
troopers. The protesters were tear-gassed, whipped with billy clubs
and trampled by horses. Lewis suffered a skull fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Following that trip, I have a better understanding of the civil
rights movement, the struggles and the blood that was spilled.
</P>
<P>
   No, I still don't hate white people, nor do I condone racism.
But I certainly have a better understanding of why African
Americans are so angry.

`THE MILLIONAIRE MIND' REHASHES OLD MATERIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if many of us want to be millionaires, something
Thomas Stanley has bet on, to his benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, a Ph.D. who has studied the wealthy for more than 25
years, wrote ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' which has been on the
New York Times bestseller list more than 150 weeks and is No. 1 on
Business Week's paperback bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly every other business writer with a novel and popular
approach to personal finance, Stanley is exploiting his bestseller
by writing another book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Millionaire Mind'' (Andrews McMell, 406 pages, $26.95) is
already a hit, ranking No. 4 on the Times bestseller list last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But should you read 406 more pages devoted to millionaires'
habits, lifestyles and strategies _ much of the same material
covered so well in the first book?
</P>
<P>
   I would have to say, no.
</P>
<P>
   Like his first book, Stanley's second effort is based on about
1,000 responses to a questionnaire sent randomly to 5,000 U.S.
millionaires. Interviews and focus group sessions with millionaires
_ apparently some in this group really like to talk _ round out the
empirical evidence of what makes millionaires tick.
</P>
<P>
   The composite sketch looks something like this: male, 54 years
old, married 28 years, three children, average household net worth
of $9.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two percent are business owners or entrepreneurs; 16
percent are senior corporate executives; 10 percent are attorneys;
nine percent are physicians. Most made their own money rather than
inheriting it and live a comfortable but not luxurious life, with
little or no debt.
</P>
<P>
   But that just scratches the surface of Stanley's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stanley, the five factors that millionaires most
often mention as being crucial to their success are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Integrity: being honest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discipline: self-control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Social skills: getting along.
</P>
<P>
   _ A supportive spouse.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard work.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't earth-shattering enough, Stanley also provides
more minutiae about millionaires, such as their GPA (2.92) or SAT
scores (1190.) Of course, that would be relevant only if you
remember your own GPA or SAT scores, which I doubt that many people
retain past age 25, including the millionaires questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Or you might want to know what millionaires think and do to
eliminate or reduce fears and worries. Stanley has concluded that
hard work, self-confidence, preparation and a focus on key issues
are the top ways millionaires overcome their problems. THAT insight
almost blinded me.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know the most important spousal qualities that
contribute to millionaires' successful marriages? Stanley has found
that out, too. Men value honesty, manners and physical attraction
in picking their spouses; women, in addition to those qualities,
focus slightly more on earning power and wealth when picking a
mate. This is something akin to my Irish grandmother's advice that
you can marry a rich man as easily as a poor one.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you seek insight, strategy or wealth-building clues, I
highly recommend Stanley's first book. It may not give you a road
map, but it does provide an eye-opening look at how rich people get
and spend their money.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's new book rehashes the same material, only with many
more pages of statistics and analysis to belabor the points.

   ``The Shoestring Entrepreneur's Guide to The Best Home-Based
Businesses''
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Spiegel
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, $15.95
</P>
<P>
   More than 23 million Americans work out of their homes, a figure
that has grown 35 percent in three years. Entrepreneur Robert
Spiegel writes about the top 50 professional home businesses, the
top 50 nonprofessional home businesses, 50 home business franchises
and more. He includes salary levels, start-up needs and customer
descriptions with each entry.

   ``100 Ways to Win The Profit Game: Battle-Tested Business
Strategies That Add Value to Your Business Now''
</P>
<P>
   By Barry R. Schimel and Gary R. Kravitz
</P>
<P>
   Capital Books, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Management consultants Barry Schimel and Gary Kravitz have
sifted through the profit ideas they've found in their business and
picked their Top 100. These ideas, they say, will add thousands and
sometimes millions of unrealized profit to most businesses.
Bundling products and services, using trickle marketing for
qualified leads, subletting unused space and rewarding employees
for bright ideas are some of their suggestions.

   ``Never Give a Sucker An Even Break: W.C. Fields on Business''
</P>
<P>
   By Ronald Fields
</P>
<P>
   Prentice Hall Press, $22
</P>
<P>
   We've had Machiavelli, Genghis Kahn, Winnie the Pooh and even
Jesus Christ quoted about business. So why not W.C. Fields? This
book is written by Fields' grandson, who seems to be making a
business on his granddad, having written two other books and an
Emmy Award-winning video about the great comedian. If you're a W.C.
Fields fan, this is obviously for you. Otherwise, don't look for a
great deal of insight from an actor of 65 years ago.

   MOSCOW _ Fighting dolphins, once taught by the Soviet Navy to
blow up enemy ships with mines attached to their backs, have been
sold to Iran because their trainers could no longer afford to feed
them.
</P>
<P>
   The dolphins, which had been living in an oceanarium in
Sevastopol in the Crimea, were flown to Iran last month when they
failed to find a local buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a sadist I would stay in Sevastopol,'' said Boris
Zhurid, their chief trainer. ``But I cannot stand it when my
animals starve.''
</P>
<P>
   The three killing dolphins were part of a secret Soviet naval
project, originally started in 1966, under which they were taught
to sink hostile ships and attack enemy divers with harpoons fixed
to their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trained by a special military detachment,'' said
Col. Viktor Baranets, formerly an official in the Soviet Defense
Ministry. ``We called them fighting dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhurid, who accompanied his dolphins to Iran, had tried to
maintain them by teaching them circus tricks, but could not afford
the $120 a month it took to feed each dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   He told a Russian newspaper before leaving for Iran that the
dolphins _ along with seals and sea lions _ would be kept in
perfect conditions in a newly constructed oceanarium in their new
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iranian authorities have big plans to train the animals
and staff,'' said Zhurid. ``Of course Iran is not famous for its
humanity, but if my animals feel well I am ready to go to Allah or
to the devil himself.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the Iranians plan to put the dolphins
to military use.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Navy became interested in using marine animals to
carry weapons in the 1960s after learning that the U.S. Navy was
carrying out experiments with dolphins to investigate their
military potential.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1970s the Soviet Defense Ministry established
a special secret training base at Vityar Bay on the Soviet Union's
Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   With the break-up of the Soviet Union Zhurid, who was in charge
of the project along with his wife Svetlana, took the dolphins to
an oceanarium in Sevastopol on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole group left on Feb. 15 and I'm happy for them,''
Valentina Inuza, deputy director of the oceanarium, told the
Independent. ``There was no money to feed them. They were really
hungry. In Iran they will be used for both scientific research and
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last winter Zhurid searched desperately for funds to
feed his dolphins and seals. Local authorities refused to donate
any funds. For several months the trainers received no salaries.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Finally when the animals got so hungry that they
could not perform any more, we started to negotiate with anybody
who could buy the dolphinarium.'' Col. Baranets says that ``many
people wanted to buy the dolphins, but possibly the Iranians came
up with more money.'' &QL;

&HT;     AND THEY'RE OFF: BUSH, GORE BEGIN GENERAL ELECTION FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Even though voters across the nation picked
two mainstream presidential candidates with traditional messages,
enough wounds were opened during the past few weeks to make the
battle between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
as nasty and suspenseful as the unexpectedly tough primaries.
</P>
<P>
   With former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey quitting the
Democratic race Thursday, and with Arizona Sen. John McCain
suspending his campaign for the Republican nomination, voters will
have more time to compare the parties' certain nominees _ Gore for
the Democrats, Bush for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are already developing attack plans on education,
the environment, social issues, character, morality, campaign
finance abuses, the legacy of President Clinton and other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts believe Bush suffered the most during
the short-live primary season. Bradley's campaign fizzled as Gore
gained steam, but it was dog-eat-dog for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would clean up the `iron triangle'' of lobbyists,
legislation and money in Washington. McCain pushed Bush to the
right and opened up distracting problems for him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain appeared to have nearly committed a political
murder-suicide by attacking the religious conservatives as the
primary reached a critical point two weeks ago. His attacks
consolidated Bush's support from the right. That will shadow Bush
just when he needs a more moderate message for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also refused to demand that South Carolina take down the
Confederate battle flag that flies over the state Capitol.
Democratic consultants in California already believe that issue
will damage Bush here, where the non-white population is nearly 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   `McCain was speaking to a constituency in the Republican Party
that is disaffected from the religious right and much of the
congressional Republican leadership,'' said veteran Democratic
consultant Bill Carrick. `I have trouble figuring out how Bush gets
them. ... Bush had to move further to the right than Gore had to
move to the left on his issues. There was some real damage done to
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has his vulnerabilities as well. Bush, in his victory
speech Tuesday night from Austin, Texas, got a huge cheer from the
audience when he said the country would reject a White House that
had `no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a slap at a phrase Gore used to explain fund-raising
calls the vice president made from the White House, which
Republicans blasted as an infraction of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Buddhist monks. Even before the votes were
counted, Bush was snipping at Gore for holding a 1996 re-election
fund-raiser at a Southern California Buddhist temple where monks
had taken a vow of poverty. A Gore associate was recently convicted
of violating campaign laws in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign does not believe that Gore will suffer because
of President Clinton's personal problems, but they will
nevertheless try to paint Gore as Clintonesque when he claimed to
have invented the Internet and was the subject of the book and
acclaimed movie `Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   `I don't think the election will be a look back at the personal
transgressions of President Clinton,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's
national communications director. `People are sick of that. That
was an embarrassing chapter in our history, and people want to put
it behind us. But they do want a president they can trust, and so I
would point to some of candidate Gore's own statements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also thinks it has an edge over Gore on
education and among Silicon Valley executives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Bradley raised far more money than Gore among the
high-tech crowd. Bush believes his plan to increase tax deductions
for charitable contributions _ to attract the wealthy technology
crowd _ and protect Silicon Valley businesses from securities
litigation will keep high-tech executives on his side, although
Democrats have traditionally wooed the high-tech crowd.
</P>
<P>
   `We're going to talk about the fact that on tort reform, Al Gore
stands with the trial lawyers, who are anathema to Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs,'' said Republican state Sen. Jim Brulte, a Bush
adviser in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are up for a few punches against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his victory speech Tuesday, started off the general
election campaign by telling his audience that Republican
administrations in the 1980s had increased the federal deficit and
sparked a recession in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, the country since 1992 has seen crime rates drp,
abortion rates plummet and the economy take off, Gore will remind
voters.
</P>
<P>
   `We need to build on our record of prosperity,'' Gore said
Tuesday. `We don't need to go back to where we were eight years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also feel they need to rip into Bush's record in Texas
and statements he made on the campaign trail as he battled McCain.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, there are plenty of things,'' said Democratic Party
strategist Bob Mulholland, mentioning Bush's opposition to abortion
and `irresponsible tax cut proposal''
</P>
<P>
   Carrick, the Democratic consultant, said the fights between
McCain and Bush over personality and campaign tactics meant Bush
remained untested on the national stage on many important policy
issues. Voters are going to be hearing for the first time his
positions on abortion and the environment, for example.
</P>
<P>
   `The most amazing things is we still haven't defined what this
election is about,'' said Henry Brady, a political scientist at the
University of California at Berkeley. `We still can't write a
one-sentence description about the 2000 election. In 1992, it was,
`It's the economy stupid.' It's hard to get real issues on people's
plates when the economy is doing so well.''

 &HT;    CONSERVATIVES PRESS FOR ANSWERS ON IRS AUDITS
 &HT;    660&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than three years ago, federal tax auditors
began an audit of the Heritage Foundation that the research center
says has cost it $200,000 in legal fees and expenses so far and
generated a stack of documents 75 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Against Government Waste received a similar visit from
Internal Revenue Service auditors that has cost the
Washington-based private watchdog group more than $50,000 without
reaching a final conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Across the continent a few months earlier, IRS inspectors probed
the records of a third group, the non-profit Western Journalism
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to these and about a dozen other examples,
conservatives say the IRS scrutiny amounts to retaliation against
some of the Clinton administration's toughest critics. An IRS
spokesman denied that politics influences audit decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, evoking memories of President Nixon's attempts
to punish his political enemies with IRS audits, will get more
attention soon with the expected release of a report from Congress
and a ruling from a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the Joint Tax Committee of the House and
Senate was directed by congressional leaders from both parties to
review the issue ``as expeditiously as possible,'' aides say the
conclusions will be released in about about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was charged with examining whether the IRS was
pressured to audit certain non-profit groups because of their
political leanings. All the groups have tax exemptions that require
them to limit their political activity.
</P>
<P>
   The probe took so long because ``it's very labor-intensive,''
said Lindy Paull, chief of staff for the tax committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paull declined to say what the report of more than 100 pages
concludes, but she warned that it will not discuss specific tax
cases, since that is prohibited by federal privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Without those details, the report is unlikely to satisfy those
who believe they are victims of a vendetta by the Democratic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a systematic effort to intimidate these
organizations,'' said Mark R. Levin, whose Landmark Legal
Foundation sued to force the IRS to provide a list of politicians
who have sought tax audits of non-profit groups and the names of
their proposed targets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the agency has handed over hundreds of letters sent by
the White House and members of Congress from both parties. But the
agency blacked out the identities of the groups they wanted
audited.
</P>
<P>
   Levin not only wants more details, but also alleges that an IRS
official discussed shredding key documents on this topic at an
October 1997 meeting. In a further touch of Watergate deja vu, the
IRS has conceded that a tape recording was made of that session and
said that it was later erased.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has been waiting since last November for a ruling from
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Kennedy in Washington on whether he
can depose four IRS officials and examine the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Delving into the IRS operations is difficult because of strict
secrecy laws. The agency says it examines 6,000 to 10,000
tax-exempt groups a year and that less than 1 percent of the cases
result from a request from Congress or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a spokesman for the agency pointed out that the IRS is
largely operated by civil servants who are not appointed by the
president and insisted that audit decisions are based on law, not
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Hill, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who
specializes in tax-exempt organizations, said the number of
conservative groups being audited is not, by itself, evidence of
bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many of these groups would be audited for
other issues, like unrelated business income tax or excessive
compensation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she said that the tax agency is ``susceptible to
pressure'' from both parties in Congress and from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some details on the referrals to the IRS have already come to
light.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Treasury Department internal investigation, made
public late last year in response to a Freedom of Information Act
request, traces the audit of the Western Journalism Center to a
citizen complaint that the White House faxed to the IRS. The letter
complained that the WJC, based in Fair Oaks, Calif., was seeking
donations to investigate the death of White House deputy counsel
Vincent Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials concluded that the IRS had acted
appropriately and had not been under undue pressure from the White
House. The audit ended without a finding of a violation.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Farah, executive director of WJC, said in an interview
that he has been surprised at the lack of interest in the
revelation of the White House role. ``You've got this clear paper
trail,'' he said, noting that the White House had prepared a secret
331-page ``conspiracy'' analysis that blamed his center for
generating reports on Clinton scandals that later became headlines
in major news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the White House has not been alone in asking the IRS
to check out private groups. House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, asked for an investigation of the
California Buddhist temple that hosted a fund-raising event for
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers also called for a probe of the Public
Broadcasting System, which was found to be trading fund-raising
lists with political candidates, usually Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of conservative groups who say they have been audited
by the IRS is much longer. Among them are the National Rifle
Association, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and Concerned Women for
America. Individual Clinton critics such as Paula Jones, the former
Arkansas state worker who accused Clinton of sexual harassment,
have also been audited.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Heritage Foundation was being penalized for its
critiques of the administration, Phil Truluck, executive vice
president of the Heritage Foundation, said, ``I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he cited the statements of former Rep. David Skaggs,
D-Colo., who asked the IRS to review the tax exemptions of both
Heritage and Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed then and I believe now that these were serious
possible violations and the appropriate step was to ask the people
with the expertise,'' Skaggs told the Associated Press last year.
``But it would be incredible to suggest, and I won't, that there
was not a political dimension to these things. Of course there
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Shelley L. Davis, the former IRS historian turned
whistle-blower on the agency: ``The IRS in the past has been used
politically to audit both conservative and liberal organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis found a file room at the agency that she said contains
evidence that the Kennedy administration used the IRS to punish
enemies. She was later forced out of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The facts will be difficult to uncover, she held, pointing to
agency's secrecy. ``I think there is much merit in the lawsuits,''
she said. ``But I also know how adept the IRS is at bouncing these
allegations off because they have the keys to all of this
information.''

 &HT;    BILL WOULD EXPAND FREE PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS UNDER MEDICARE
 &HT;    With photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare beneficiaries would receive more
preventive screening tests without having to pay a portion of their
costs under a bipartisan bill introduced Thursday in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is sponsored by Reps. Mark Foley, R-Fla., and Sander
Levin, D-Mich., both of whom serve on the House Ways and Means
Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over Medicare. It is a
companion to legislation introduced last year by Sens. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., and James Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more money you spend up front in preventive health care,
the better the return for the taxpayer,'' Foley said. He noted that
the Medicare system, which primarily covers the acute care needs of
elderly and disabled persons, will not pay for preventive care and
counseling for diabetes, ``but will amputate your leg or put you on
dialysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1997 law offering Medicare coverage for mammograms,
colorectal and prostate screenings, Levin said relatively few
seniors take advantage of the tests. He suggested that is because
seniors have to pay a 20 percent copayment. The bill would
eliminate those copayments.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would expand the list of Medicare-covered
screenings and counseling programs to include high blood pressure
tests; glaucoma, vision and hearing screenings; cholesterol and
osteoporosis screening; nutrition counseling; tobacco cessation
counseling, and hormone replacement therapy counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Future preventive care coverage would be recommended by the
National Institute of Medicine and added to Medicare benefits
unless specifically rejected by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Graham suggested that as lawmakers look for ways to reform
Medicare and add a prescription drug benefit, a major reform should
be to shift Medicare's focus from healing to prevention.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was mentioned on TV that the deepest known spot on Earth
is a trench in an ocean. What ocean? How deep? How was it explored?
</P>
<P>
   A: The deepest known point is the Mariana (sometimes spelled
Marianas) Trench in the western Pacific, near Guam. Sources differ
on the depth, with some putting it at 35,840 feet below sea level,
others at 36,198, and still others at 37,800.
</P>
<P>
   The trench was explored in January 1960 by researchers Lt.
Donald Walsh of the U.S. Navy and Jacques Piccard, a Swiss
scientist, in the Navy's bathyscaph Trieste. The two set a world
ocean-diving record of 24,000 feet Jan. 7 of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few weeks later, they descended to the botton of the
trench in the Trieste. The descent required four hours, 48 minutes;
the ascent, 3 hours, 17 minutes. Facts on File reported that the
later dive broke their own previous record when they reached a
depth of 7.15 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The bathyscaph was a boat-shaped, 75-ton craft 50 feet long and
12 feet wide. A spherical crew chamber 6 1/2 feet in diameter was
attached underneath. At the 37,800-foot depth, the craft withstood
pressure of 16,883.2 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I would like to write members of Congress, is there a
general address to use after their name?
</P>
<P>
   A: To send regular mail, after the name, write: (for
representatives) U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC
20515; (for senators) U.S. Senate, 20510.
</P>
<P>
   To send electronic mail, visit http://congress.org/elecmail.html
and enter either your ZIP code or the person's name where
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other day, I heard Regis Philbin begin a quote:
``Monday's child is fair in face; Tuesday's child is full of
grace.'' Can you finish this for me?
</P>
<P>
   A: It goes like this: Monday's Child is fair of face, /
Tuesday's Child is full of grace, / Wednesday's Child is full of
woe, / Thursday's Child has far to go, / Friday's Child is loving
and giving, / Saturday's Child works hard for a living, / But the
Child that is born on the Sabbath Day, / Is bonny, and blithe, and
good, and gay!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, the IRS considered making airline
employees pay income tax on the free airline tickets they received.
Whatever happened with that? Now Delta Air Lines, Ford Motor Co.,
and American Airlines are said to be providing computers to their
employees. Will they be taxed as income?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two subjects, two answers, according to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Free or discounted flights offered to employees and their
spouses, dependents and parents by airlines are considered non-cash
fringe benefits, and therefore are excluded from an employee's
gross income, said IRS spokesman Mark Green. Details can be found
in IRS Publication 535, Business Expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Computers might be a different story, he added. If they're given
as a gift, they must be included as extra salary or wages unless
they meet the rule of ``De Minimis (Minimal) Fringe Benefit.'' This
benefit is any property or service an employer provides to an
employee that has so little value _ taking into account how
frequently the employer provides similar benefits to its employees
_ that accounting would be ``unreasonable or administratively
impracticable.'' Details on this general topic also can be found in
IRS Publication 535.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I collect the new state quarters, and I've noticed that those
from the Philadelphia Mint seem to be more plentiful in supply than
those from the Denver Mint. The coins from Philadelphia also seem
to be issued first. Is there a reason for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coins produced by the Philadelphia facility are distributed
mainly east of the Mississippi, those from Denver mainly west of
the Mississippi, said Jennifer Arnold of the U.S. Mint. So it's to
be expected that consumers in the East would see more P marks on
their coins than D marks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coins are produced simultaneously by both mints, Arnold added,
so your contact with them is simply a result of their geographic
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that the world has enough oil reserves to last 100
years or longer. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Estimates about petroleum resources vary considerably, so we
can't say with absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   One resource hedges by saying that if present rates of
consumption continue, petroleum may become scace sometime in the
mid 2000s. They key words here are ``may become'' and ``scarce,''
not ``will be'' and ``exhausted.'' This report goes on to say that
the world's oil reserves total about 1 trillion barrels, with some
geologists predicting that additional reserves remain to be
discovered in such places as China, offshore seabeds, and on
Canadian islands.
</P>
<P>
   Another source, meanwhile, reports that the ``most likely''
world oil endowment is 1.7 trillion barrels, of which 32 percent
already has been produced and consumed. If this estimate proves to
be reasonably accurate, current relatively stabilized world
oil-production volumes could be sustained to about 2035, at which
time a shortage of conventional oil resources would force a
production decline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another resport, published in 1996, said Saudi Arabia alone
had some 260 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, ``enough
to satisfy U.S. oil demand, at current consumption levels, for a
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that predictions are often proved wrong. In 1972,
for example, a report made by an organization called the Club of
Rome predicted exhaustion of the world's oil supplies by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item reported that Franklin D. Roosevelt, before his
inauguration as president, had been shot in Miami. I don't remember
ever hearing anything about that. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: It happened on the night of Feb. 15, 1933, just after
Roosevelt had finished speaking to a crowd at Bay Front Park in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting in his open touring car when Giuseppe Zangara, an
unemployed bricklayer, fired six shots at him from about 12 yards.
The president-elect wasn't hit, but the bullets struck five other
people, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was standing next
to the Roosevelt car.
</P>
<P>
   Cermak died March 6, and Zangara was indicted the same day.
Zangara pleaded guilty on March 9, and was sentenced to death March
10.
</P>
<P>
   Zangara, who said he had visions of killing ``a great ruler,''
told the court that he would make another attempt to kill Roosevelt
``at once'' if he were freed.
</P>
<P>
   He was electrocuted at the Florida state prison at Raiford on
March 20, 1933. News reports at the time said he was defiant toward
capitalists to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article said the January full moon is known as the
``wolf moon,'' and the one in September is the ``hunter's moon.''
Do those in other months also have names?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. These are commonly listed as the ``traditional names,''
from Native American lore, for each month's full moon: January,
wolf; February, snow; March, worm (or full sap); April, pink; May,
flower; June, strawberry; July, buck (or thunder); August, sturgeon
(or green corn); September, barley (or harvest); October, hunter's
(or harvest, again, because the full moon sometimes falls in
October); November, beaver; and December, cold.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, check this Web site _
www.7almanac.com/eye/fullmoons.html _ for more detailed, and
colorful, explanations of the names.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I read that Ted Turner bought two more ranches in
Kansas with a total of 38,239 acres. How many acres in all does he
own in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: About 1.7 million, according to Russell Miller, general
manager of Turner Ranches. His major land holdings are in New
Mexico, Montana, Nebraska and the Dakotas, in addition to some in
the southeastern United States, and total about 1 1/2 times the
size of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as January, Turner bought 90 acres of land along the
Soque River in North Georgia to use as a trout-fishing retreat for
his family.

   FILE 2 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' TV show, when a
contestant phones a friend for help with the answer, Regis Philbin
always says about the person being called, ``I know you can't see
us now.'' Why can't the person at home see the show as it's going
on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because ``Millionaire'' is taped in advance. So, obviously,
when the person at home sees the broadcast, the question already
had been asked at some earlier time. Since ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' is taped before a live audience at ABC's New York
studio, it can appear to viewers at home that the broadcast is
live.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' show recently featured a rerun of the
Osmond family reunion in December. I missed how many grandchildren
and great-grandchildren there are. Do you know? Also, two brothers
were doing sign language. Are they deaf?
</P>
<P>
   A: George and OIive have 9 children: Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne,
Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie and Jimmy. Virl has 7 children and 6
grandchildren. Tom has 9 children and 1 granddaughter. Alan has 8
children (all sons) and 2 granddaughters. Wayne has 5 children and
1 grandson. Merrill has 6 children. Jay has 3 children (all sons).
Donny has 5 children (all sons). Marie has 7 children. Jimmy has 3
children.
</P>
<P>
   So the total is 2 parents, 9 children, 53 grandchildren and 10
great-grandchildren, said Jennifer Wallace of Osmond.com.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest Osmond sons, Virl and Tom, are hearing impaired.
They were the first deaf missionaries sent out by the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving the deaf population in
Canada. They aren't part of the Omond Brothers singing group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you print the exact wording of the Second Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, and the generally held interpretation as to
who may possess firearms?
</P>
<P>
   A: Capitalization and placement of commas is subject to
variation, but this is the text (as found in World Book
Encyclopedia, World Almanac and other common resources): A
well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed.
</P>
<P>
   This amendment _ one of 10 known collectively as the Bill of
Rights, which was ratified on Dec. 15, 1791 _ has been interpreted
in two ways. Some people believe it gives ordinary citizens the
right to possess firearms; others believe it only gives each state
the right to maintain its own militia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What health benefits do members of Congress have, and how
much do they pay for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're entitled to participate in the health benefits
program available to all federal employees, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. A number of insurance options are
negotiated with insurance companies by the federal government at a
discount, with no special subsidies involved for members of
Congress. The amount paid varies according to the options.
</P>
<P>
   Outside that program, there are some ``important benefits''
members of Congress get that aren't available to other federal
employees, Sepp said. First, they can avail themselves of the
Attending Physician's Office, which Sepp described as a
``reasonably comprehensive care clinic in the Capitol.'' That
service was free to members until 1992, when they began paying a
nominal fee of $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And second, they're entitled to receive medical care of an acute
nature, such as surgery, at the Walter Reed Army Hospital and the
Bethesda Naval Hospital. This is ``privileged care,'' Sepp said,
meaning the members are admitted on a priority basis and get
upgraded rooms and greater privacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book ``Washington: City of Scandals,'' members
of Congress are charged the minimum flat daily rate for stays at
either hospital, even if they require intensive care treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What states have the Powerball lottery?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon,
Rhode Island, Wisconsin and West Virginia, plus the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is the ``kudzu line,'' the farthest north that kudzu
can live over the winter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kudzu might be seen in places are far north as Long Island,
but it doesn't thrive there season after season. It's basically
found in the South. Horticulturist Wayne McLaurin of the University
of Georgia says the clinging vine won't thrive year after year much
farther north Kentucky, Virginia and Maryland because it needs a
long growing season. In colder areas there's not enough time for
nutrients to be put back into the kudzu tubers for future growth,
McLaurin said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Pope John Paul would make an apology for Catholic
treatment in the past regarding persecution, and anti-Semitism in
particular. I haven't seen anything more about it since. Can you
give me an update?
</P>
<P>
   A: The apology will be in the form of a document, titled ``The
Church and the Faults of the Past: Memory in the Service of
Reconciliation,'' which is expected to be read March 12 by the pope
at a ceremony in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, produced by a 28-member Vatican theological
commission, is viewed as an attempt to apologize for 2,000 years of
violence, persecution and ``blunders,'' such as the Inquisition,
the Crusades, and the Roman Catholic Church's treatment of Jewish
people.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the paper is seen as a centerpiece of the
Vatican's holy year, or jubilee, celebrations, which occur every 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian newspaper La Repubblica has suggested that Pope John
Paul II will go so far as to apologize for the church's failure to
resist the Nazis, but without implicating Pope Pius XII, who has
been accused of ignoring the Holocaust during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives in the Curia, the Vatican's bureaucracy,
meanwhile, have argued that an apology would erode the foundations
of church authority. But they were rebuffed and told that the
jubilee could be celebrated only with ``purification of the
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a Kalashnikov? It was mentioned, without explanation,
in a newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   A: The term refers to a family of automatic assault rifles and
light machine guns, most notably the AK-47. The AK-47 was designed
in 1947 by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   It fires a rifle-type cartridge at up to 600 rounds per minute
and is one of the most widely distributed automatic rifles in
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Golfer Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland won $1 million at
the Match Play Championship in California. Does he have to pay
taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, since he is not a U.S.
citizen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Without knowing all the details, because exceptions and
extenuating circumstances are always possible, the IRS declined to
address Clarke's case specifically.
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, income earned in the United States by a
resident or non-resident alien is subject to taxation in the same
manner as for a U.S. citizen, said IRS spokesman Mark Green.
Information on the general topic can be found in IRS publication
519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, Green added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I got my first driver's license and registered to vote as a
new 18-year-old bride in 1960. But I read recently that the voting
age wasn't lowered to 18 until 1972. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: You must have lived in Georgia, Kentucky or Alaska. Those
three states permitted 18-year-olds to vote before the 26th
Amendment was ratified in 1971. Three other states (Minnesota,
Montana and Massachusetts) permitted voting at 19, and three more
(Maine, Nebraska and Hawaii) allowed 20-year-olds to vote.
</P>
<P>
   On June 20, 1971, Ohio became the 38th state to ratify the 26th
Amendment, which lowered the minimum voting age to 18 for all
state, national and federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The new amendment was certified officially in a White House
ceremony conducted by President Nixon on July 5, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the origin of the expression ``the whole nine yards''?
My wife believes it refers to a machine gunner's ammo belt, but I
insist it refers to sail.
</P>
<P>
   A: When Q&AMP;A printed an explanation several years ago, it created
a deluge of theories from readers. Among them: It came from ancient
burial practices in Egypt in which bodies of poor people were
wrapped only in short pieces of silk, but bodies of wealthy people
were fully wrapped, thus taking ``the whole nine yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Another version: The term came from fighter pilots in World War
II whose machine guns used ammo belts in nine-yard lengths, so if
they shot all their rounds of ammunition in a fight, they used
``the whole nine yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, a Scotsman's kilt needs a lot of material, hence, ``the
whole nine yards.''
</P>
<P>
   And still another: It refers to the nine yardarms on a clipper
ship, and when all the sails were being used, it was . . . well,
you know.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these is correct, if you accept the Facts on File
Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins as a resource. It traces
the expression to construction workers, who use the expression when
referring to the maximum capacity of a cement-mixer truck: nine
cubic yards of cement.

   FILE 1 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was mentioned on TV that the deepest known spot on Earth
is a trench in an ocean. What ocean? How deep? How was it explored?
</P>
<P>
   A: The deepest known point is the Mariana (sometimes spelled
Marianas) Trench in the western Pacific, near Guam. Sources differ
on the depth, with some putting it at 35,840 feet below sea level,
others at 36,198, and still others at 37,800.
</P>
<P>
   The trench was explored in January 1960 by researchers Lt.
Donald Walsh of the U.S. Navy and Jacques Piccard, a Swiss
scientist, in the Navy's bathyscaph Trieste. The two set a world
ocean-diving record of 24,000 feet Jan. 7 of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few weeks later, they descended to the botton of the
trench in the Trieste. The descent required four hours, 48 minutes;
the ascent, 3 hours, 17 minutes. Facts on File reported that the
later dive broke their own previous record when they reached a
depth of 7.15 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The bathyscaph was a boat-shaped, 75-ton craft 50 feet long and
12 feet wide. A spherical crew chamber 6 1/2 feet in diameter was
attached underneath. At the 37,800-foot depth, the craft withstood
pressure of 16,883.2 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I would like to write members of Congress, is there a
general address to use after their name?
</P>
<P>
   A: To send regular mail, after the name, write: (for
representatives) U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC
20515; (for senators) U.S. Senate, 20510.
</P>
<P>
   To send electronic mail, visit http://congress.org/elecmail.html
and enter either your ZIP code or the person's name where
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other day, I heard Regis Philbin begin a quote:
``Monday's child is fair in face; Tuesday's child is full of
grace.'' Can you finish this for me?
</P>
<P>
   A: It goes like this: Monday's Child is fair of face, /
Tuesday's Child is full of grace, / Wednesday's Child is full of
woe, / Thursday's Child has far to go, / Friday's Child is loving
and giving, / Saturday's Child works hard for a living, / But the
Child that is born on the Sabbath Day, / Is bonny, and blithe, and
good, and gay!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, the IRS considered making airline
employees pay income tax on the free airline tickets they received.
Whatever happened with that? Now Delta Air Lines, Ford Motor Co.,
and American Airlines are said to be providing computers to their
employees. Will they be taxed as income?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two subjects, two answers, according to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Free or discounted flights offered to employees and their
spouses, dependents and parents by airlines are considered non-cash
fringe benefits, and therefore are excluded from an employee's
gross income, said IRS spokesman Mark Green. Details can be found
in IRS Publication 535, Business Expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Computers might be a different story, he added. If they're given
as a gift, they must be included as extra salary or wages unless
they meet the rule of ``De Minimis (Minimal) Fringe Benefit.'' This
benefit is any property or service an employer provides to an
employee that has so little value _ taking into account how
frequently the employer provides similar benefits to its employees
_ that accounting would be ``unreasonable or administratively
impracticable.'' Details on this general topic also can be found in
IRS Publication 535.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I collect the new state quarters, and I've noticed that those
from the Philadelphia Mint seem to be more plentiful in supply than
those from the Denver Mint. The coins from Philadelphia also seem
to be issued first. Is there a reason for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coins produced by the Philadelphia facility are distributed
mainly east of the Mississippi, those from Denver mainly west of
the Mississippi, said Jennifer Arnold of the U.S. Mint. So it's to
be expected that consumers in the East would see more P marks on
their coins than D marks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coins are produced simultaneously by both mints, Arnold added,
so your contact with them is simply a result of their geographic
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that the world has enough oil reserves to last 100
years or longer. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Estimates about petroleum resources vary considerably, so we
can't say with absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   One resource hedges by saying that if present rates of
consumption continue, petroleum may become scace sometime in the
mid 2000s. They key words here are ``may become'' and ``scarce,''
not ``will be'' and ``exhausted.'' This report goes on to say that
the world's oil reserves total about 1 trillion barrels, with some
geologists predicting that additional reserves remain to be
discovered in such places as China, offshore seabeds, and on
Canadian islands.
</P>
<P>
   Another source, meanwhile, reports that the ``most likely''
world oil endowment is 1.7 trillion barrels, of which 32 percent
already has been produced and consumed. If this estimate proves to
be reasonably accurate, current relatively stabilized world
oil-production volumes could be sustained to about 2035, at which
time a shortage of conventional oil resources would force a
production decline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another resport, published in 1996, said Saudi Arabia alone
had some 260 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, ``enough
to satisfy U.S. oil demand, at current consumption levels, for a
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that predictions are often proved wrong. In 1972,
for example, a report made by an organization called the Club of
Rome predicted exhaustion of the world's oil supplies by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent item reported that Franklin D. Roosevelt, before his
inauguration as president, had been shot in Miami. I don't remember
ever hearing anything about that. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: It happened on the night of Feb. 15, 1933, just after
Roosevelt had finished speaking to a crowd at Bay Front Park in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting in his open touring car when Giuseppe Zangara, an
unemployed bricklayer, fired six shots at him from about 12 yards.
The president-elect wasn't hit, but the bullets struck five other
people, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was standing next
to the Roosevelt car.
</P>
<P>
   Cermak died March 6, and Zangara was indicted the same day.
Zangara pleaded guilty on March 9, and was sentenced to death March
10.
</P>
<P>
   Zangara, who said he had visions of killing ``a great ruler,''
told the court that he would make another attempt to kill Roosevelt
``at once'' if he were freed.
</P>
<P>
   He was electrocuted at the Florida state prison at Raiford on
March 20, 1933. News reports at the time said he was defiant toward
capitalists to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article said the January full moon is known as the
``wolf moon,'' and the one in September is the ``hunter's moon.''
Do those in other months also have names?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. These are commonly listed as the ``traditional names,''
from Native American lore, for each month's full moon: January,
wolf; February, snow; March, worm (or full sap); April, pink; May,
flower; June, strawberry; July, buck (or thunder); August, sturgeon
(or green corn); September, barley (or harvest); October, hunter's
(or harvest, again, because the full moon sometimes falls in
October); November, beaver; and December, cold.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, check this Web site _
www.7almanac.com/eye/fullmoons.html _ for more detailed, and
colorful, explanations of the names.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I read that Ted Turner bought two more ranches in
Kansas with a total of 38,239 acres. How many acres in all does he
own in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: About 1.7 million, according to Russell Miller, general
manager of Turner Ranches. His major land holdings are in New
Mexico, Montana, Nebraska and the Dakotas, in addition to some in
the southeastern United States, and total about 1 1/2 times the
size of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as January, Turner bought 90 acres of land along the
Soque River in North Georgia to use as a trout-fishing retreat for
his family.

<P>
   Q: On the ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' TV show, when a
contestant phones a friend for help with the answer, Regis Philbin
always says about the person being called, ``I know you can't see
us now.'' Why can't the person at home see the show as it's going
on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because ``Millionaire'' is taped in advance. So, obviously,
when the person at home sees the broadcast, the question already
had been asked at some earlier time. Since ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' is taped before a live audience at ABC's New York
studio, it can appear to viewers at home that the broadcast is
live.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' show recently featured a rerun of the
Osmond family reunion in December. I missed how many grandchildren
and great-grandchildren there are. Do you know? Also, two brothers
were doing sign language. Are they deaf?
</P>
<P>
   A: George and OIive have 9 children: Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne,
Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie and Jimmy. Virl has 7 children and 6
grandchildren. Tom has 9 children and 1 granddaughter. Alan has 8
children (all sons) and 2 granddaughters. Wayne has 5 children and
1 grandson. Merrill has 6 children. Jay has 3 children (all sons).
Donny has 5 children (all sons). Marie has 7 children. Jimmy has 3
children.
</P>
<P>
   So the total is 2 parents, 9 children, 53 grandchildren and 10
great-grandchildren, said Jennifer Wallace of Osmond.com.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest Osmond sons, Virl and Tom, are hearing impaired.
They were the first deaf missionaries sent out by the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving the deaf population in
Canada. They aren't part of the Omond Brothers singing group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you print the exact wording of the Second Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, and the generally held interpretation as to
who may possess firearms?
</P>
<P>
   A: Capitalization and placement of commas is subject to
variation, but this is the text (as found in World Book
Encyclopedia, World Almanac and other common resources): A
well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed.
</P>
<P>
   This amendment _ one of 10 known collectively as the Bill of
Rights, which was ratified on Dec. 15, 1791 _ has been interpreted
in two ways. Some people believe it gives ordinary citizens the
right to possess firearms; others believe it only gives each state
the right to maintain its own militia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What health benefits do members of Congress have, and how
much do they pay for this?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're entitled to participate in the health benefits
program available to all federal employees, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. A number of insurance options are
negotiated with insurance companies by the federal government at a
discount, with no special subsidies involved for members of
Congress. The amount paid varies according to the options.
</P>
<P>
   Outside that program, there are some ``important benefits''
members of Congress get that aren't available to other federal
employees, Sepp said. First, they can avail themselves of the
Attending Physician's Office, which Sepp described as a
``reasonably comprehensive care clinic in the Capitol.'' That
service was free to members until 1992, when they began paying a
nominal fee of $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And second, they're entitled to receive medical care of an acute
nature, such as surgery, at the Walter Reed Army Hospital and the
Bethesda Naval Hospital. This is ``privileged care,'' Sepp said,
meaning the members are admitted on a priority basis and get
upgraded rooms and greater privacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book ``Washington: City of Scandals,'' members
of Congress are charged the minimum flat daily rate for stays at
either hospital, even if they require intensive care treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What states have the Powerball lottery?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon,
Rhode Island, Wisconsin and West Virginia, plus the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is the ``kudzu line,'' the farthest north that kudzu
can live over the winter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kudzu might be seen in places are far north as Long Island,
but it doesn't thrive there season after season. It's basically
found in the South. Horticulturist Wayne McLaurin of the University
of Georgia says the clinging vine won't thrive year after year much

 &HT;    SCIENTISTS MAY SOON FORECAST INVISIBLE 'SPACE WEATHER'
 &HT;    For release Sunday, March 12.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Space weathermen believe they are on the verge of
being able to forecast storms in the Earth's magnetic field, where
mysterious turbulence increasingly plagues a technology-dependent
world.
</P>
<P>
   Miles above the familiar dark clouds that have wrecked ships and
caused river valleys to flood throughout history, storms in the
planet's magnetosphere can disrupt activities that most of us now
take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   When these storms blow in, television reception is scrambled.
Pocket pagers go deaf. Cards won't swipe properly at ATM machines
or gasoline pumps. Even electric power grids can fail, subjecting
tens of thousands of of homes and businesses to black-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for decades that the storms are stirred by
solar flares, super-hot areas caused by enormous explosions on the
face of the sun, but they have not known how to predict when the
flares would occur.
</P>
<P>
   That is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Arizona and Colorado announced last week (March
11) in Science magazine that they had successfully ``looked'' all
the way through the sun and were able to detect flares on its far
side.
</P>
<P>
   That ability was based on earthquake-like disturbances created
by developing solar storms on the far side of the sun. The
disturbances sent seismic waves all the way _ about 8 million miles
_ through the sun so they could be detected on the near side.
</P>
<P>
   Since it takes the sun 27 days to make one rotation on its axis,
the discovery should give researchers up to two weeks' notice,
rather than a few hours, before the super-hot blotches make their
way around to face the earth.
</P>
<P>
   And if all goes as planned, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration will launch IMAGE, the world's first ``space
weather'' satellite, this week. Scheduled for launch Saturday
(March 18) from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, IMAGE is
to monitor the turbulent weather systems in the near-space region
occupied by the Earth's magnetosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Green, director of space science and data at NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., predicts that the satellite
will be so successful that before long similar spacecraft will be
deployed to monitor conditions in the magnetosphere the way weather
satellites keep track of conditions in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the point where we need to know how to understand
space weather,'' he said. ``It is going to be fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no shortage of examples to support that view.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, solar storms sent a flood of charged particles racing
toward the Earth at over a million miles per hour. The storm these
particles generated in the magnetosphere knocked out electric
transformers belonging to Hydro-Quebec, the Montreal-based power
company, and left 6 million people in eastern Canada and the
northeastern United States without electricity for nine hours.
</P>
<P>
   The storms disrupted short-wave radio transmissions, crippled
Coast
</P>
<P>
   Guard navigation systems and spooked automatic garage doors into
opening and closing on their own. Over 80 percent of North
America's pocket pagers went deaf as a post because of another
solar storm two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Risk Insurance Management Society warned its members last
fall that ``storms in space _ originating on the sun, 93 million
miles away _ can have the same financial impact as a hurricane or
an earthquake, resulting in losses of tens of billions of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The flares and another phenomenon known as solar wind happen
because of the sun's own magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what happens there and in the Earth's
magnetosphere, it is useful to recall the common grade school
experiment in which the teacher sprinkles a pinch of iron filings
onto a sheet of paper, then passes a magnet beneath the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The filings immediately arrange themselves in a series of
curving and more or less concentric lines between the two ends of
the magnet, guided by the lines of force that emanate from the
magnet.
</P>
<P>
   As it spins, the core of the sun generates a similar field of
force. However, since the equatorial region of the core spins at a
different speed than the polar regions, the magnet ``lines'' are
not orderly like those of a classroom magnet. Instead, they bend
and overlap and tangle. Where they intersect, they generate
enormous energy, which heats the sun's atmosphere to temperatures
millions of degrees hotter than its surface.
</P>
<P>
   At those temperatures, atoms are ripped apart and plasma
composed of disassociated electrons and protons are sent flooding
through the solar system. This flood of electrically charged
particles is known as the solar wind. The flares cause ``gusts'' in
the solar wind.
</P>
<P>
   Green explained in an interview that on the sun's surface, the
tangle of solar magnetism becomes increasingly wound up, so that
once about every 11 years the sun goes into a ``solar maximum''
phase in which the number and intensity of flares increases. It is
now entering such a phase.
</P>
<P>
   When the solar wind reaches the Earth, it is deflected by this
planet's own magnetic field, which is generated by the rotation of
molten iron and nickel in the planet's core. It surrounds the Earth
like a protective cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   While it is much more orderly than the tangle of solar magnetic
lines, the Earth's magnetic field is also distorted _ by the solar
wind, which flattens the part of the field facing the sun and drags
out the part on the Earth's night side, somewhat like the tail of a
comet.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetosphere refers to charged particles trapped inside the
Earth's magnetic field. They are much like the teacher's iron
filings, but at densities of fewer than a dozen electrons per cubic
inch.
</P>
<P>
   The particles are electrically charged, and even at those
densities, they affect radio waves passing through them. When the
solar wind gusts strike the magnetosphere, turbulence occurs among
the particles, causing magnetosphere ``storms'' that disturb radio
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   A gasoline pump depends on such transmissions to and from
communications satellites when it makes sure your credit card is
not maxed out before allowing you to fill your tank. If performance
of the satellites is disrupted by the storms, the swipe-and-pump
authorization can break down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the particles that make up the solar wind are deflected
away from the Earth's surface, they can send enormous jolts of
electricity flooding through the magnetosphere, and from there down
into the atmosphere and to the Earth's surface. Such a jolt is what
knocked out Hydro-Quebec's transformers 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAGE satellite, Green explained, will view the patterns
formed by the charged particles trapped in it and sketch the
magnetic field from those patterns.
</P>
<P>
   It will loop through an elliptical polar orbit that takes it
28,000 miles above the North Pole and then swings it down for a
pass 600 miles over the South Pole. Powered by solar cells, it will
use a variety of technologies to map the particles.
</P>
<P>
   One, a Doppler radar not too different from speed detectors used
by police, will measure movements of the particles within the
magnetic field. Four thin antennae will each extend hundreds of
yards from the slowly turning satellite. From end-to-end, the
antennae will be longer than the height of New York's Empire State
Building, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Other, newly created technologies that will sense and image
previously invisible molecular processes. About a month after it is
launched, IMAGE is to start sketching the first picture of the
magnetosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Although around 30 satellites and other space craft have
collected samples of the magnetosphere, scientists have only a
crude understanding of its makeup, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine yourself as a scientist in this field for 30 years,
and all you've been able to do as you go into space is launch your
little probe and look at the temperature here and the temperature
there, particles here and there _ just various pieces of this
enormous cloud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 30 years, the best you can do is draw cartoons of it.
Now, imagine, all of a sudden, I will be able to show you an
honest-to-goodness picture of what it looks like. It's what we've
been working 30 or 40 years to do. That's where we are right now,
with this spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the pinnacle of your career.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  What do Duke Ellington, Alan Greenspan, and Aristotle have in
common?
</P>
<P>
   Genius, yes. (We'll grant Al some leeway here.) Beyond that,
each is a featured player in a popular course being offered on a
local campus this semester.
</P>
<P>
   One course is 30 years old and imaginatively combines community
service with classroom study. Another is a year old and like its
subject, the stock market, could scarcely be trendier. A third is
brand new and stylishly untrendy: a course on early American jazz,
taught by a Mozart scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The courses, chosen not entirely at random, sample the variety
and popularity of what's being taught at area colleges at any given
time.
</P>
<P>
   Literature and Arts B-80: The Swing Era Examines American jazz
from the early 1930s to bebop. Considers sociological issues and
the relationship of swing-era jazz to classical music and popular
song, to place swing's achievements into a broader historical and
musical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I call a mean tune!'' Robert Levin shouts out over
the closing bars of ``Hocus Pocus,'' a 1934 Fletcher Henderson cut,
featuring the incomparable Coleman Hawkins on tenor sax. Levin then
fires up a CD dub of a Louis Armstrong recording he inherited from
his father, a jazz buff.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, the perpetual-motion Harvard prof cannot seem
to stand _ or sit _ still. Bouncing over to the piano, Levin bangs
outs a Bach prelude followed by some Jelly Roll Morton licks.
Strutting around the Sanders Theatre stage in front of 560
students, he dips his shoulders and wags his fingers in classic
hepcat style to a peppery clarinet solo by Buster Bailey. Close
your eyes and you can almost smell the Cotton Club circa 1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're figuring out what makes this music tick as well as
connecting to it emotionally,'' Levin tells his audience, a mixed
bag of Harvard students and AARP types who are auditing.
</P>
<P>
   For Levin, a classically trained keyboardist who studied with
Nadia Boulanger, ``The Swing Era'' represents a chance not only to
branch out into more of a pop-music idiom but to expose a younger
generation, in a serious and scholarly way, to the recordings he
grooved on as a kid in Queens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple reason I'm doing this is that I'm crazy about the
music,'' says Levin, whose piano-thumping lecture style has been
packing them in all semester. ``But that's not reason enough. The
fact is, this is the first truly mass popular music in US history.
I want students to get a real insight into the aesthetics of swing,
the way they'd view a painting in a fine arts course or read a poem
in a literature class.''
</P>
<P>
   The course benefited from an early buzz around campus, in part
because Levin also teaches a popular course on chamber music and is
famous for his energy and showmanship. For most of the students in
L&AMP;A B-80, Bix Beiderbecke and Benny Goodman belong as much to
ancient musical history as Beethoven and Liszt do. But as they're
learning, American music didn't start with Jimi Hendrix and Miles
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Trierweiler, a freshman from Denver, was initially drawn
to Levin's course because it fills a core requirement. ``I listen
to mostly KISS-108 stuff,'' says Trierweiler, ``but not a lot of
jazz. This looked like fun, though. Levin is pretty quirky, too. He
dances around a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Bolton, a junior from Alabama, grew up near New
Orleans listening to '60s and '70s rock. Now, she digs
jazz-influenced groups like Phish. ``I wanted to understand the
background more,'' says Bolton, who concedes that Levin's use of
terminology is ``tough to follow at times.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart and soul of Levin's lectures are close audio analyses
of classic swing tracks. Lectures on Goodman and Ellington
incorporated repeated playings of ``King Porter Stomp'' and ``Mood
Indigo,'' performed by different bands with different arrangements.
Like any good jazzman, though, Levin is an inveterate improviser. A
discourse on Ellington's recording of ``Take the A Train,'' for
instance, segued into a brief history of the Manhattan subway
system.
</P>
<P>
   Says Levin, ``My secret goal is to build students' listening
libraries, the way others bought `Rubber Soul' or `Born in the
USA.' Because once you've got these recordings, you'll listen to
them. I'm on a cultural crusade here.''
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Bruce PL 088-089: Person and Social Responsibility
(PULSE) Course requirements include 10 to 12 hours per week of
community service. In light of classic philosophical and
theological texts, students address the relationship of self and
society, the nature of community, the mystery of suffering, and the
practical difficulties of developing a just society.
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, there is almost no chance Kristin
Kusmierz would have crossed paths with Michael Brady during her
college years. Or wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Kusmierz is a BC junior from North Kingstown, R.I. Brady is a
44-year-old, HIV-positive substance abuser from Scituate who never
went to college and who is ``pretty much on my last chance right
now,'' Brady says.
</P>
<P>
   BC's PULSE course is nothing if not a great equalizer, though.
And so one day last week, Kusmierz and Brady took a stroll together
around Shattuck Hospital in Jamaica Plain, where Brady is a patient
in the Living and Recovering Community program (LARC) and Kusmierz
works as a student volunteer through the Victory Programs agency.
The two found more in common than either might have dreamed of four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not like a conversation between a college student and a
dope fiend,'' Brady recalled afterward. ``We talked about the
virus, about substance abuse and her maybe going into human
services after she graduates.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to hear what a student has to say to someone who's
been on the street for 30 years.'' Kusmierz nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``To actually see people living with the virus teaches you more
than any book can,'' she said, seated in a cramped hospital
conference room with two fellow PULSE students and half a dozen
LARC patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In class, we focus on how to live your life, how to develop a
system of meaning that builds a community. It's much easier to
internalize something when you read it and see it.'' Kusmierz is
one of 300 BC students enrolled in the program this year,
continuing a tradition established in 1970. In weekly section
meetings, students discuss writings by Aristotle, Rousseau, and
Locke along with contemporary authors like Charles Taylor and
Jonathan Kozol. They also keep detailed journals, diaries that
often provoke soul-searching examinations of what personal and
social responsibility truly mean.
</P>
<P>
   The course has seldom been more popular. About 150 students were
turned away this year for space reasons, despite the heavy reading
load and community-service requirement. Program director Donald
McMenamin says word of mouth is his best recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids hear from other students who say it's the most
important course they've taken at BC,'' says McMenamin. ``They
start out thinking they're going to change the world, and they
leave realizing how much they've been changed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In class, McMenamin and his colleagues push students to relate
what they're reading to issues they've encountered in the field.
Thus a recent discussion of Taylor's ``The Ethics of Authenticity''
prompted McMenamin to ponder the relationship between the
individual and society, asking students if there were anything like
a shared definition of the American Dream. ``Does your concept of
the dream correspond to that of the people in the placement
agencies where you work?'' he inquired. ``If the good life is going
to be achieved,'' he argued, ``all the voices must be at the table.
If we exclude some of those voices, we risk impoverishing our
notion of what is authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusmierz noted that as people focus more on individual freedoms
and less on how their actions affect others, the dividing line
between haves and have-nots sharpens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as large segments of society can't realize their
definitions of the good life,'' she said, ``programs like LARC will
exist.'' The voices heard around a hospital conference table last
week were authentic, all right, painfully so. Amid the sobering
talk of viral loads and T-cell counts, though, there was also
laughter. And that constituted a learning experience in itself.
</P>
<P>
   John Miller, a LARC patient from Dorchester, glanced at Richie
Moriarity, a sophomore from Maryland, and said that if he could
give these BC kids one gift, it would be ``an awareness of drug
addiction. Because there's always a line to cross, and I crossed
it. Once you cross it, you can't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Moriarity smiled back. ``Being at BC gives you a warped sense of
reality,'' he said softly. ``Everyone there is fortunate. Everyone
has plenty of money. It knocks me off my feet every day I come over
here. It's like _ `` Moriarity glanced around the table _ ``hel-lo,
Richie. Welcome to the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   EXP 88S: Understanding the Stock Market Students will begin to
develop an understanding of and an appreciation for the
fundamentals of stock market investing, doing so within the realm
of larger social, demographic, political, and economic
contexts.``Who knows what a margin is?'' asks Timothy Stratford in
a basement classroom of Braker Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one?'' Twenty-nine students sit on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' says Stratford, writing ``THE MAGIC OF MARGIN'' on a
blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the whole premise of what I'm about to tell you is that
you should never do it, but it's crucial to know about.'' A hand
goes up. ``Yes?'' ``Alan Greenspan said today he was unconcerned
about margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratford laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he say why?'' he asks, tapping the board. ``OK, here's my
concern,'' continues Stratford. ``It's buying stock with money you
don't have. It's the biggest disaster you can do. Mutual funds do
it because they can get in and out of stocks quickly. You can't.
Any questions?'' Thus began week six of an unusual course offered
by Tufts University's Experimental College. Call it Greenspan 101.
From calculating interest rates to shorting tech stocks, the course
aims to demystify the Dow while equipping students with the basics
of portfolio building. Chaucer? Organic Chem? Forget about it. The
cheer you hear is tuition-strapped parents yelling, ``Finally, a
course with a return on investment!'' Stratford, an ex-bartender
who logged 17 years as a broker, was likewise cheered when 200
students showed up for the course last spring, six times the number
he could accommodate.``The ones who don't get in beg me for a
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   says Stratford, now teaching the course for the third time. ``If
I were a broker and 180 prospective clients showed up, I'd be
thrilled. But I'm not trying to sell them anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, most of whom admit they don't know NASDAQ from
NASCAR, must write brief application essays. ``Like learning to fix
my car and cook a turkey,'' wrote one, ``learning about the stock
market is one of those goals that I've had for a while but haven't
gotten around to addressing.'' Gushed another, ``I only know that
those mysterious numbers that flash by right before the commercials
on the national news excite me more than any other possibility in
my life.'' Ah, youth.
</P>
<P>
   Two students have brought parents to class. Drew Carlton, a
senior from Shaker Heights, Ohio, took the course last fall. An
experienced day trader, Carlton knew as much about Internet trading
as Stratford did, maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Carlton, ``I liked it because it's a lot more
relevant than most college classes. This is something everyone
should know about.'' Jennie Robin, a senior psychology major from
Long Island, knew nothing about investing before this semester.
``I'm about to graduate, and I thought I'd better take one course
in something relevant,'' says Robin. Her midterm assessment? ``It's
given me a basis for reading the business page every day,'' she
says. ``Some things are still unclear, though, like inflation and
interest rates or _ `` join the club, Jennie `` _ what actually
moves the stock market up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stratford preaches anything, it's the value of patience and
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Strategies like dollar cost averaging _ investing small amounts
consistently to capitalize on market fluctuations _ are emphasized
over picking the next hot dot-com stock or go-go mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Says Stratford, ``Some of these kids want to make money, some
have parents who think this is good stuff to know, and some want to
walk into job interviews and not sound like idiots.'' He smiles.
``I'm here to help them all.''

&HT;     SCIONS OF POLITICAL DYNASTIES BATTLE FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 12)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON 
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If ruthless old King George III were still around,
he probably would chortle over the irony of George W. Bush and Al
Gore, sons of prominent political dynasties, battling for the
presidency of a republic that long ago rejected leadership by royal
succession.
</P>
<P>
   The English king might also smile at the fact that when Gore
journeys to Los Angeles in August to be anointed officially as the
Democratic Party's presidential nominee, he will share the
spotlight with America's most exalted political dynasty, the
Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   It is inevitable that the convention in Los Angeles will be
steeped in nostalgia because it was there that John F. Kennedy was
nominated 40 years ago. For a few fleeting hours in August,
sentimental Democrats may seek to transform the City of Angels into
a reincarnation of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy connection is important to Gore. In various public
opinion polls, Americans list Kennedy among the outstanding
presidents in American history. The rating is probably more a
tribute to the Kennedy elegance, eloquence and premature death than
to his performance in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it could help Gore in his race with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also is the city where Robert F. Kennedy was fatally
wounded 32 years ago after winning the 1968 Democratic presidential
primary. In addition, California is a state in which Edward M.
Kennedy defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 Democratic primary, but
to no avail. Carter was renominated and then defeated by Republican
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore might ponder a valuable lesson from the Kennedy campaign.
Against the advice of angry liberals, John Kennedy selected his
chief opponent for the presidential nomination, Senate Majority
Leader Lyndon Johnson of Texas, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberals threatened to bolt the party. Robert Kennedy
didn't like Johnson and strongly opposed the choice. But John
Kennedy stuck by his decision despite the fact that his
relationship with Johnson was nothing like Gore's warm relationship
with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Johnson, a
master legislative tactician, took over the presidency and passed
into law every major item that had been on the liberals' agenda
since Harry Truman's presidency and, in some cases, since Franklin
Roosevelt's.
</P>
<P>
   That agenda included monumental civil rights legislation,
Medicare, Medicaid, federal aid to education, a war on poverty and
protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, after that record of achievement, Johnson led
America into the quagmire of Vietnam, and tragedy stalked our land.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960, however,
provides a second lesson for Gore: A candidate's chief political
opponent can be a helpful running mate and vice president if he
knows his way around Washington and has ideas about ways to improve
the lot of the American people. That fact of political life could
lead Gore to seek former Sen. Bill Bradley as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many other possible vice presidential nominees:
California Gov. Gray Davis, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California and even Sen. Bob Kerrey, who
actively supported Bradley in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Political dynasties are not new to America. In the earliest days
of the republic, voters elected John Adams as president and later
chose his son, John Quincy Adams for the same office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been occupied by two Harrisons _ William
Henry and his grandson Benjamin. Neither left much of a mark on the
presidency or the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the presidential giants of the 20th century were distant
cousins Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Both had sons who
aspired to political glory, but never quite made it.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1960 has either political party chosen Los Angeles as
the site of its national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Although Los Angeles is 3,000 miles across the country from
Kennedy family base in Boston, it has become something of a second
home for the peripatetic Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy frequently visited the city where he mingled with
the flamboyant Hollywood ``Rat Pack'' headed by Frank Sinatra. It
presumably was there that he first met Marilyn Monroe, who became
an important hidden factor in his life.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kennedy's sisters, Pat, lived in a Santa Monica
beachfront home with her husband, actor Peter Lawford, who was an
intimate fixture in the Rat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Kennedy and Tennessee Senator Albert Gore Sr. both
sought the Democratic vice presidential nomination on a ticket
headed by Adlai Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Having been nominated for president a second time, Stevenson
decided that the way to breathe excitement into the Chicago
convention was to let the delegates pick his running mate. So, he
opened the race up to all who wished to take part.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees included Kennedy, Gore Sr., Sen. Hubert Humphrey of
Minnesota, New York Mayor Robert Wagner, and Gore's fellow senator
from Tennessee, Estes Kefauver.
</P>
<P>
   By the end if the first ballot, it was apparent that support for
Gore Sr., Humphrey and Wagner was fading. That meant a second
ballot showdown between Kennedy and Kefauver.
</P>
<P>
   The result was riveting as votes switched from one candidate to
another and the Kennedy and Kefauver tallies grew. Finally, Senator
Gore shifted Tennessee's vote to Kefauver and Oklahoma changed its
votes from Gore to Kefauver. Enough states followed Gore's lead to
put Kefauver over the top.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy won millions of friends and admirers by striding to
the stage to make a gracious speech urging that Kefauver's
nomination for vice president be made unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   If Speaker Sam Rayburn, the convention chairman, had not
recognized Gore and the Oklahoma delegation, Kennedy said later,
``I might have won that race with Senator Kefauver _ and my
political career would now be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Like European royalty, American dynasties are linked to one
another.

THE MEDIA WERE MORE ENAMOURED WITH MCCAIN THAN THE VOTERS WERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazing. Even after George W. Bush crushed John McCain from
coast to coast Tuesday, some of the deep-thinkers on television
were saying that McCain would have had a better chance of defeating
Al Gore in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain didn't even finish ahead of Bush in California's
come-one, come-all open primary that put all the candidates on the
same ballot. Bush was a strong second to Gore in that race, which
was impressive when you consider that the vice president has spent
more time courting Californians than Warren Beatty spent courting
starlets back in his bachelor days.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be competitive in the state that launched Ronald
Reagan's political career. It's even possible _ and remember, you
read it here first _ that Bush could snatch California's 54
electoral votes in November.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the Golden State this week barely gave McCain a second
look.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ``electability'' is just one of several myths conjured
up by reporters and pundits who became infatuated with the Arizona
senator on the basis of ... on the basis of what, exactly? His
biography and his willingness to shoot off his mouth all day long?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, voters are not so readily swept off their feet by
media-concocted ``phenomenons'' who owe their existence to little
more than worshipful press coverage and fluke wins in nontypical
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   From ``sea to shining sea,'' to borrow a phrase from Bush's
victory speech, Republicans preferred Bush as their standard-bearer
in the race against Gore _ and no amount of wishful thinking by
McCain and his boosters in the media could derail the Texas
governor's nationwide bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain ``surge'' was fiction.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign served a useful purpose, though. It forced
Bush to stop jogging and start running. It forced Bush to ask
himself if running for president was something that he really
wanted to do _ and if winning was really important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were challenged _ and we met the challenge,'' Bush said
Tuesday night. ``We were tested _ and we were equal to the test.
... Republicans and conservatives from all across America have said
they want me to lead the Republican Party to victory come November,
and I am ready and I am eager to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In fending off McCain, Bush showcased his resolve and his
resourcefulness. He also acquired valuable experience in dealing
with an opponent who is boosted and bolstered by the sympathetic
bias of the media _ the very same situation he will encounter as he
takes on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is naive enough to imagine that Bush will get a fair
shake from the media should consider what happened during the
primary season.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush criticized McCain, the front-runner was savaged by the
media for ``going negative.'' When Gore attacked challenger Bill
Bradley _ oftentimes with accusations that were patently false or
at best grossly misleading _ the media criticized ``Bradley'' for
his lily-livered response to Gore's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Bush might have been caught off guard when he suddenly found
himself fighting off an opponent ``and'' a hostile media in the
Republican primaries. But he won't be surprised by the two-front
battle that awaits him in the next phase of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I predict that Bush will be equal to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already in November attack mode, tediously and
dishonestly misrepresenting Bush's tax-cut plan as a ``risky tax
scheme'' and offering up an outrageously disingenuous proposal to
forgo TV advertising throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Given his druthers, Bush would much rather talk about ideas and
issues than splash around in the mud with Gore. But Bush won't let
Gore push him around; he won't make the mistake that Bradley made
by turning the other cheek to Gore's unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are saying that the country needs to psych itself up
for a mean-spirited, negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   OK. But here's a question for the pundits: Will your definitions
of ``mean-spirited'' and ``negative'' be the same for both
candidates?

RIDE EASY, KNOWING YOUR CAR'S STREET-LEGAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What makes a car ``street-legal''?
</P>
<P>
   _ W.D., Del Mar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It means that the car complies with all federal, state and
local mandates,'' said Greg Rager, editor of High Performance Mopar
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Car regulations involve tires, lighting, emissions, ``ride
height'' and many other things that a car enthusiast can modify.
These laws vary from state to state and sometimes even county to
county, Rager said. ``What's legal in Florida is not necessarily
legal in California.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, you should familiarize yourself with local
ordinances and state laws before buying a car that's described as
street-legal. ``Caveat emptor,'' Rager said. ``If you're buying a
modified car in any state, you really ought to make it your
business to know what the laws of that state are.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Cindy Crawford?
</P>
<P>
   _ T., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Crawford in care of the William Morris Agency, 151
El Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, who turned 34 on Feb. 20, married nightclub owner
Rande Gerber in 1998, and they have a 7-month-old son, Presley
Walker Gerber.
</P>
<P>
   On her official Web site, www.cindy.com, Crawford posts monthly
updates on her activities and answers reader e-mail. ``We're in
Hawaii sneaking in a few days vacation,'' she wrote this month.
``Rande and I went golfing and even sporting-clay shooting, but
mostly just hanging out with Presley in the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many years ago, I had a small policy with the Conger Life
Insurance Co. in Florida. Is the company still in business?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.B., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The Conger Life Insurance Co., also known as Florida Life
Insurance, was placed into liquidation by Florida insurance
regulators in 1997. Conger policies were purchased by Life and
Health of America, so you should still be covered by the policy.
</P>
<P>
   To inquire about your insurance, send the policy number to Life
and Health of America, 6363 Taft St., Suite 202, Hollywood, FL
33024, or call (954) 920-7090.

SHOULD WE AID MOZAMBIQUE? SUCH A QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A month ago, a studio audience probably could not have helped a
quiz show contestant win any part of a million dollars if the
following question had been asked:
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the capital of the African country that President
Clinton recently described as having the world's fastest growing
economy? Is it (a) Lagos; (b) Kinshasa; (c) Maputo; or (d)
Johannesburg?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not altogether certain that much help from that lifeline
would be forthcoming even today. That question was popped the other
day to a well-read, much-informed, policy-wonk journalist, and his
final answer was Lagos, the largest city in Nigeria, although he
wondered if it might not be Johannesburg, the industrial capital of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer, of course, is Maputo, the capital of
Mozambique. Presumably a goodly number of the audience for a ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' broadcast might have gotten wind of the
economic progress that has been happening in Mozambique because of
the tragedy of almost biblical proportions that has engulfed that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of drenching rain and a cyclone have transformed
Mozambique into a waterlogged nightmare of death, danger,
dehydration, devastation, hunger and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, more than 400 bodies had been recovered. As the
waters recede, that dreadful count is expected to exceed 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's farmland is inundated. Roads and bridges
have been washed away by the surging waters of the worst floods to
descend upon southern Africa in half a century. Between 800,000 and
900,000 people are said to have been victimized to some degree by
the enormous natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Although the devastation is not confined to Mozambique, that
country has been hit hardest. And the tragic irony of it is that it
struck just when Mozambique was doing so well, when it was being
hailed far and wide as a great African success story.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mozambique gained its independence from Portugal in
1975, it was embroiled in civil war until the early 1990s _ a
fierce struggle between the Marxist-oriented Frelimo government and
the Renamo insurgents backed by the apartheid government of South
Africa. Although the Frelimo government allowed a multiparty
electoral system in 1990, the war didn't end until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the multiparty system was put in place. And in
1994, Frelimo outpolled Renamo in free elections. Last year,
Frelimo repeated that feat.
</P>
<P>
   Democratization and a switch to a free-market economy opened the
way for forging strong economic links to South Africa and made
Mozambique more attractive for foreign investment generally.
</P>
<P>
   During each of the past three years, Mozambique has posted an
economic growth rate of 10 percent. Such has been the pace of
economic improvement in Mozambique that last year it opened a stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The country's prospects brightened even more when Mozambique's
primary governmental creditors agreed to reschedule most of its
international debt. A sizable percentage of its most burdensome
debt _ i.e., export credit debt on which interest is charged at
market rates _ was forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Now the floods have come and the skies have darkened for
Mozambique. The country's infrastructure is in shambles. Hundreds
of millions of dollars will be needed to put it back together
again.
</P>
<P>
   International aid is now flooding in, although some have
criticized the tardiness of its arrival from the United States and
some other developed nations. It will be some time before things
there can be restored to a semblance of normality.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that immediate assistance, the developed nations
should feel an obligation to make the necessary investment in
Mozambique to put it back on the progressive track on which it had
embarked before Mother Nature unleashed her fury upon the region.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States in particular, Mozambique's catastrophe
offers an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of its professed
commitment to paying more attention to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has made a good start by dispatching
U.S. military personnel to help with the rescue and rebuilding
efforts and in joining with Britain in agreeing to forgive more of
Mozambique's debt, now estimated at about $88 million.
</P>
<P>
   This country must also do its utmost to persuade other foreign
powers, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to take
similar action. Mozambique cannot possibly get back on its feet
while trying to service that debt obligation.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't need the intellectual wattage of a ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' contestant to figure out that it's in our national
interests to support free enterprise and democracy in Africa.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nintendo boasts that its video game controller
will ``take a licking and keep on ticking,'' but the hands of the
children using it have been left blistered and bleeding, according
to the New York attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In a case surrounding ``Mario Party,'' Nintendo of America Inc.
agreed to ship protective gloves to any of the estimated 1.15
million households in the United States that bought the game,
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said in announcing an out-of-court
settlement with the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   With the company offering up to four pairs of the gloves to each
buyer and the gloves retailing for about $20, the settlement could
cost Nintendo upwards of $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer announced the settlement on Wednesday, calling it ``good
news for parents throughout the nation. Nintendo has agreed to take
responsibility for the effect of its games on young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Pritchard, a spokeswoman for Spitzer, said the company
had received about 100 complaints on injuries from the game, and an
undetermined number of people had called the attorney general's
office as well.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is partly in the hand-held controller _ which
Nintendo's Web site describes as ``ergonomically designed'' _ and
partly in the Mario Party game itself. To play Mario Party, which
is targeted at children ages 7 to 13, users must navigate through
certain ``mini-games,'' allowing them to collect coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for Mario to work off some of that pasta,'' one
demonstration page on the Web site reads. ``A big Boo threatens you
from behind, so unless you can generate enough light by turning
those pedals ultrafast, Boo will get you and your coins, too!''
</P>
<P>
   But to move quickly, some children press their palm onto the
controller's joystick, which has grooves etched into a circular
tip. The friction and pressure on the grooves have caused burns,
cuts, punctures, blistering and tearing of the skin, according to
the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo did not return a call for comment, but on its Web site
it is now posting a warning, ``To avoid irritation to your skin
and/or damage to the Control Stick, do not rotate it with the palm
of your hand. Rotate the Control Stick with your thumb or by
holding it between your thumb and forefinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the mini-games within Mario Party appear to encourage
the use of the palm. Spitzer singled out six: Paddle Battle, Tog O'
War, Pedal Power, Cast Aways, Deep Sea Divers, and Mecha Fly Guy.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain the gloves, people will have to submit an outline of
their hand on paper, along with some kind of proof of ownership,
which can include a receipt, credit card statement, serial number,
or even a photo of the user with the game, Pritchard said. The
company has a consumer hot line, 800-521-0900.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering the gloves, the company paid the state
$75,000 to cover the cost of the investigation.

<P>
   Do you know which of these foods has the fewest calories?
</P>
<P>
   Low-fat bran muffin
</P>
<P>
   Two-egg-white omelet, made with low-fat ricotta cheese, spinach,
1 piece whole-wheat toast with 1 teaspoon margarine spread
</P>
<P>
   Tuna salad (with oil-packed tuna) on whole wheat toast with bowl
of fresh fruit and non-fat yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Chicken and pasta salad with fat-free dressing
</P>
<P>
   Apple pie
</P>
<P>
   Non-dairy cheesecake
</P>
<P>
   Broiled salmon with lemon-butter sauce
</P>
<P>
   Broiled lean round steak, with garlic sauteed in olive
</P>
<P>
   oil
</P>
<P>
   Fast food choices:
</P>
<P>
   Quarter Pounder
</P>
<P>
   Filet-O-Fish
</P>
<P>
   From the vending machine:
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter crackers
</P>
<P>
   Lite potato chips
</P>
<P>
   Small chocolate shake
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry sundae
</P>
<P>
   Did you guess which foods in our Calorie Challenge? Here are the
answers:
</P>
<P>
   A low-fat bran muffin from Dunkin' Donuts has 240 calories, 4
grams of protein, 57 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram fat.
</P>
<P>
   A two-egg-white omelet, made with low-fat ricotta cheese,
spinach, one piece of whole-wheat toast with 1 teaspoon margarine
spread has 162 calories, 33 grams protein, 10 grams carbohydrates,
6.3 grams fat.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: More is less: Eat the omelet, and all its trappings.
Not only will you be satisfied longer, but you're taking in half
the calories for much more food.
</P>
<P>
   Splurge if you want, and add a whole egg; you can still afford
the calories and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   A tuna salad made with oil-packed tuna on whole wheat toast with
a bowl of fresh fruit and non-fat yogurt has 699 calories and 19
grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken and pasta salad with fat-free dressing has
</P>
<P>
   395 calories and 9.7 grams fat.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: We like to think of tuna as a diet food, and pasta as
anti-diet. But it's not the case when the tuna is oil-packed and
combined with mayonnaise. In this case, calories from fat outweigh
the nutrients in the fruit and yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Broiled salmon with lemon-butter sauce has 375 calories and 37.8
grams fat (9.3 saturated).
</P>
<P>
   Broiled lean round steak with garlic sauteed in olive oil has
379 calories, 38 grams fat (4.7 saturated).
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Salmon's another food we think of as healthful, but it
compares greatly to lean steak in fat as well as calories. Salmon
is neither fat-free, nor saturated fat-free. The butter pushes the
saturated fat of the salmon meal over the top. Moral: Enjoying a
lean steak can't hurt once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Apple pie has 210 calories, 29 grams carbohydrates, 9 grams fat.
</P>
<P>
   Non-dairy cheesecake has 160 calories, 16 grams carbohydrates,
10 grams fat.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Bet you thought apple pie was a safe bet next to
cheesecake. But cheesecake made with tofu, which has won numerous
taste awards, wins out. Even though it has 1 gram more fat, it has
far less sugar and calories than the apple pie. The cheesecake
offers vegetable protein as well.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter crackers have 138 calories, 3 grams protein, 6.6
grams fat, 16 grams carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Lite potato chips have 133.5 calories, 2 grams protein, 5.8
grams fat, 18.9 grams carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Looks like the peanut butter crackers would lose out,
but they have more protein and less sugar. That gives them more
punch for the numbers and more staying power as well. You won't
have to eat ``just one more'' to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   A Quarter Pounder has 430 calories, 21 grams fat, 23 grams
protein, 27 grams carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   A Filet-O-Fish has 470 calories, 26 grams fat, 15 grams protein,
45 grams carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Both of these are very high calorie foods, and both
contain huge amounts of fat, but the fish falls short in protein,
and has more sugar (carbohydrates). Beef wins.
</P>
<P>
   A small chocolate shake has 360 calories, 9 grams fat, 60 grams
carbohydrates, 11 grams protein.
</P>
<P>
   A strawberry sundae has 290 calories, 7 grams fat, 50 grams
carbohydrates, 7 grams protein.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Both these items are high in sugar, of course, but the
calories can't be ignored in the shake, even though it has more
protein. One note: Combine these numbers with the numbers in the
Quarter Pounder, and you can see how one trip to the fast-food
window can kill a diet in a hurry.

   Defuse caloric bombs by measuring portions
</P>
<P>
   In her new book Portion Savvy (Pocket Books, $24), nutritionist
Carrie Latt Wiatt shows how portions add up to calorie overload.
</P>
<P>
   A simple meal of cereal, milk and juice can become a caloric
bomb if the portions are assumed and not measured. For her recipes
to work, you must measure the serving portions. Here are recipes
from her book and others.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Concept cars take spotlight at auto show
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some concept cars at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
International Auto Show that stand a pretty good chance of making
it to the showroom not much different than the way they look today:
Ford's Thunderbird retro roadster and the Mercury Mountaineer
sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   There are others that are platforms for technology or design
ideas, like the Chrysler Chronos and the Oldsmobile Profile.
</P>
<P>
   But some former concepts have become reality and either are in
dealer showrooms or will be soon. Among them are the Chrysler PT
Cruiser, a retro minivan that is attracting attention and creating
waiting lists around the country; the edgy Pontiac Aztek
sport-utility; and the new little brother in the Ford SUV family,
the Escape.
</P>
<P>
   Besides concepts, the car show, sponsored by the Metro Atlanta
Automobile Dealers Association, features more than 500 new 2000 and
2001 model-year vehicles from more than 30 automakers. Here are
some highlights of the show, which continues through Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler
</P>
<P>
   One of this year's show stoppers is the Chrysler PT Cruiser, a
small, retro-looking minivan based on the Dodge Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Dodge division of Chrysler group re-enters NASCAR
racing next year with its Intrepid. An early version of the red
racing machine that could be piloted by Georgia's Bill Elliott is
on display. For more conventional drivers, the company is showing
its redesigned Dodge and Chrysler minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its stable of sport-utility vehicles, Jeep is featuring
the Commander concept vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The German side of the family is showing the CL500 sedan and the
Alabama-built M-Class sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford
</P>
<P>
   From the mammoth Excursion and the hybrid Sport Trac to the
smaller Escape and the Mountaineer concept vehicle, light trucks
take the spotlight for the Ford and Mercury divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The newest entries include the 2000 Sport Trac, which already is
arriving in showrooms. The hybrid sport-utility/pickup truck
combines the seating from the Explorer SUV and adds a small pickup
bed behind it.
</P>
<P>
   While the Excursion, the largest SUV on the planet, has been on
sale for months, Ford also is showing the new addition at the small
end of the line, the Escape. It's smaller than the Ranger-based
Explorer but larger than its competition, the Honda CR-V and Toyota
RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury Mountaineer sport-utility concept is nearing its
final form before production. It will replace the current Explorer
clone.
</P>
<P>
   Besides SUVs being marketed under the Ford Outfitters theme,
Ford also is showing its 2001 F-Series SuperCrew full-size,
four-door pickup truck. The vehicle joins a number of similar-size
and smaller competitors in going beyond the usual extended cab. The
full-size rear doors open to a full-size back seat where full-size
adults can sit comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight also is on two cars, the Ford Thunderbird concept
and the Lincoln LS luxury sport sedan, which won Motor Trend's Car
of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   The new T-Bird joins the retro craze, going back to its 1950s
roots as a two-seater with a removable hardtop sporting porthole
windows and just a hint of turquoise in the Thunderbird logo. The
car is expected to go on sale in fall 2001 as either a 2001 or 2002
model.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display are the redesigned 2000 Ford Taurus and Mercury
Sable, both built at Hapeville and loaded with new safety features,
and the company's new small car, the Focus.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors
</P>
<P>
   GM divisions are wheeling out three concepts, two of which are
nearly ready to go on sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Pontiac Aztek is a sport-utility based on the company's
minivan platform, but it sure doesn't look like the Montanas and
Ventures rolling out of Doraville. Its sharp angles and aggressive
appearance are designed to appeal to younger buyers with active
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   To help them do that, it has an array of standard and optional
features, including a pull-out cargo tray. The tailgate is designed
for _ well _ tailgating, with sculpted seats and rear-facing
radio/CD speakers for the party.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztek will be in showrooms this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For grown-ups, the vehicle gets a different treatment from Buick
as the Rendezvous. The more traditional-looking SUV incorporates a
number of refinements for comfort, style and safety that Buick
hopes will help it hold on to buyers who have been moving from the
division's sedans. The Rendezvous is Buick's first truck and should
go on sale next year.
</P>
<P>
   The third concept, the Oldsmobile Profile, holds gee-whiz
technology such as voice-activated controls, Internet access and a
sliding rear door for a sedan. Olds also is showing the 2001 Aurora
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all from the General.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet displays two of its new, redesigned cars, the Monte
Carlo and Impala. Joining the Corvettes on the floor is a pace car
for the Le Mans-style race at Sebring, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn division shows off its new, larger line, the LS, and
GMC is displaying its renamed Suburban, now known as the Yukon XL.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac shows its technological muscle in the DeVille. It
features Night Vision technology, which uses infrared signals
transmitted from the center of the grille to ``see'' in the dark.
The car also has back-up warning signals that beep when the car
gets too close to an obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   There's even some fun and games in the Buick display. A trailer
houses golf displays featuring Buick spokesman Tiger Woods and
automaker-sponsored tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Honda
</P>
<P>
   It's not a concept car, but it's a concept _ the 70 miles per
gallon gasoline-electric engine Honda Insight hybrid. The bright
green car would have attracted plenty of visitors anyhow, but with
gasoline prices at record levels and likely to go higher, interest
should be especially keen in two-seat coupe that can laugh as its
drives past a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a sportier turn of mind, Honda also is showing
its S2000 roadster. Look closely at dashboard just to the left of
the steering wheel. That red starter button is one of the car's
cooler features.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese automaker is going both big and little. In the
former category, it's showing the new Sequoia sport-utility
vehicle, which is even bigger than its current Land Cruiser. The
2001-model vehicle is comparable in size to the Ford Expedition.
Also on display is Toyota's full-size pickup, the Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   On the small side is the 2000 MR2 Spyder roadster, a snub-nosed
little sportster that will be on sale soon. In between, Toyota is
showing its hot compact, the Echo, which is being marketed to
children of baby boomers who sometimes are known as echo boomers.
</P>
<P>
   And not to be outdone in the mileage department, Toyota also is
displaying its high-mileage hybrid Prius with a gasoline-electric
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean carmaker is bounding into the crossover vehicle
market with its own, the CrossTour, a coupe with a liftgate and the
back-seat utility of an SUV. It's also keeping touch with reality
by showing its new sport-utility, the 2001 Santa Fe.

 &HT;    Dieter's dilemma: Calories really do count
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For dieters today, it's hooray for protein and hold the
carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, it was up with carbs and down with fat.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since calories were mentioned in any of
the diets.
</P>
<P>
   But they do count _ some more than others, according to
nutrition experts.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging from one diet craze to the other, following one
nutrition controversy after another, we've lost the focus on the
role calories play in nutrition, says Ellen Haas, former
undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed for years to reduce fat in the diet and after many
years, the manufacturers started listening. As a result, they gave
us thousands of products lower in fats, but still high in sugars
and calories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's missing is balance _ in our foods, and in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange dichotomy that more people than ever say they're
dieting and watching their weight, yet the numbers for overweight
Americans are notably high.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
reported that the number of obese Americans _ those at least 30
percent over ideal body
</P>
<P>
   weight _ rose from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The number of obese Floridians increased almost 72 percent, from
10.1
</P>
<P>
   percent in 1991 to 17.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study, Tufts University researchers found that 63
percent of
</P>
<P>
   men and 55 percent of women over the age of 25 are obese or
overweight, the highest rate ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for weight gain is simple: We're taking in more
calories than we use; we're eating more and moving less.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem simple to eat less and exercise more. For most of
us, it's one of the most difficult things to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to weight control, Americans will try
anything,'' said Jackie Berning, professor at the University of
Colorado and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.
``But they don't want calories to count. What they want is to be
able to eat the foods they like, not count calories, and still lose
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   They also don't want to think about portion control. ``We
supersize everything, and wonder why we gain 10 pounds. It's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheah Rarback, a Miami dietitian who is also a spokeswoman for
the ADA, said Americans as a society are bombarded with food _ from
television commercials to fast-food outlets to convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we have to seek out opportunities for physical exercise.
We're not walking, we're driving to the gym. We've become more and
more sedentary, yet we're being served bigger portions that our
bodies don't need. Our caloric intake is out of balance. And our
lifestyle equation is out of balance,'' Rarback said.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh, unprocessed foods are in short supply at restaurants. The
more processed the food, the higher in calories it's likely to be,
and more empty of nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruits and vegetables are nutrient-dense, not calorie-dense,''
she said. ``They're also low in fat. They're high in flavor and you
get a lot of bang for your buck, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   That's before processing.
</P>
<P>
   A cup of broccoli has 46 calories; a cup of frozen broccoli from
Pillsbury is 120 calories. An almost imperceptible sauce on the
broccoli creates the added calories.
</P>
<P>
   Simple homemade mashed potatoes with margarine, whole milk and
salt have 111 calories per half cup. But those same potatoes made
from French's mashed potato mix jump to 140 calories, and they gain
31 mg. of sodium _ it's all in the processing. And who's going to
stop at just a half-cup?
</P>
<P>
   A whole fresh tomato (about 1 1/2 cups of fruit) has only 24
calories. But once it's pureed and canned, one cup contains 102
calories, 39 mg. more sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans talk about nutrition but don't practice it,
Berning said. Instead, dieters are lured by diets that eliminate
one food group or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's mind-boggling. They throw out the carbohydrates
on these protein diets, for instance, and by cutting out one food
group, they're automatically eliminating calories,'' she said. ``Of
course they're going to lose weight _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bodies need protein, we can't live without it, so sure,
protein is great, but not at the expense of other nutrients,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, calories become an issue again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're overeating protein, you're going to gain weight. The
same with carbohydrates, fat, whatever food: If you're taking in
more than you burn, you're going to gain the weight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rarback agrees. She cautions that not everyone has the same
caloric intake level, so saying a 2,000 calorie diet is good for an
average gets a lot of people in trouble. ``You have to know
yourself and what you need. You have to decide how active you are,
and age and weight have a lot to do with it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing teens and athletic young adults require extra calories.
The more active you are, the more calories you need. ``If an adult
woman can maintain her weight at 1,200 calories, she's not active
enough,'' Rarback said. ``I'd tell her to add some activity. On the
other hand, 2,000 calories may be too many for an average small
woman who is active. ``
</P>
<P>
   The main thing, however, is to make the calories that you take
in count, she said. ``If you're eating nutrient-dense foods, you'll
have calories left over for those splurges.''
</P>
<P>
   And there should be indulgences built in to any diet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think eating should be pleasurable,'' Rarback said. ``Life's
to be enjoyed.''

BEING JULIA: JULIA ROBERTS ON FAME, FORTUNE AND `ERIN BROCKOVICH' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment column.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Julia Roberts
in a scene from ``Erin Brockovich.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I'm not a bitch,'' Julia Roberts says. ``That's probably the
biggest misconception there is of me.''
 &HT;    Roberts knows that the label is frequently attached to her, but
she insists that it's unjustified.
 &HT;    ``I think I get it because I'm tall and really very smart and
have lots of ideas and am willing to share them,'' she says. ``When
you're energetic about things and opinionated, it often intimidates
people who aren't very smart themselves.''
 &HT;    If that sounds like Roberts has an axe to grind, dismiss the
idea. Actually, the 32-year-old actress seems calmer and more
comfortable with her own stardom than ever before.
 &HT;    ``I find the press less aggressive than before,'' she admits.
``I don't respond to stupidity and disrespectfulness. I notice
reporters seem to have increased intelligence and respect these
days.''
 &HT;    Her willingness to tell it the way she sees it may be left over
from her latest film, the based-on-fact ``Erin Brockovich,'' which
will open on March 17. It casts her as the title character, a
twice-divorced, working-class mother of three who finds a job in a
law office and stumbles onto a scandal involving polluted water and
a billion-dollar coverup.
 &HT;    Those who are used to the gorgeous, elegantly costumed and
charmingly adorable Roberts of her last three movies _ the hit
romantic comedies ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' (1998), ``Notting
Hill'' (l999) and ``Runaway Bride'' (l999) _ are in for a shock.
Roberts' Erin Brockovich is loud and vulgar, and doesn't suffer
fools gladly. She swears like a truck driver, and her wardrobe runs
to skintight tops and thigh-high skirts.
 &HT;    Which took a little help from the costume department, because
the real Brockovich _ who has a walk-on role as a waitress named
Julia _ fills out those tops considerably more than Roberts.
 &HT;    ``It's a great part in a really great story,'' the actress says,
laughing, ``and it allows me to reveal more cleavage than God ever
thought to give me. It was all Barbie theater _ all fabulous.''
 &HT;    The role is quite a departure from her two 1999 films: ``Notting
Hill'' cast her as a glamorous movie star _ hardly a stretch _
opposite Hugh Grant's nerdy bookseller, while ``Runaway Bride''
reunited her with Richard Gere, her co-star in ``Pretty Woman''
(l990), for the saga of a woman who just can't quite say ``I do.''
 &HT;    It must have been tempting to keep on in that lighthearted vein
_ after all, it was the success of those films that enabled Roberts
to become the highest-paid actress in Hollywood history, pocketing
$20 million for ``Erin Brockovich.''
 &HT;    ``I look at my salary as the bonus winning round in a TV quiz
show,'' she says. ``It doesn't change what I'm doing or how I
approach my work, and it doesn't make me a better actor or work any
harder. It's just a reward.''
 &HT;    It does, however, mark a peak in her up-and-down career since
``Pretty Woman,'' which this year will be released in a
10th-anniversary edition.
 &HT;    ``It's terrifying, isn't it?'' she says. ``It makes me feel old
_ but, then again, think about how much older that makes everyone
else.''
 &HT;    Roberts thinks the woman she is today bears little resemblance
to the youngster who first made Hollywood sit up and take notice.
 &HT;    ``I'm not the same girl,'' she says. ``That was a little while
ago _ I weighed 20 pounds more, and I knew about 50 things less.''
 &HT;    One of the things she knows now is that, even before this year's
Oscars are awarded, there's already Hollywood buzz that ``Erin
Brockovich'' could bring Roberts her third Oscar nomination next
year, her first since consecutive nods for ``Steel Magnolias''
(1989) and ``Pretty Woman.''
 &HT;    For her own part, Roberts declines to speculate on her chances.
 &HT;    ``I think all my movies are great,'' she says, shrugging. ``It's
just the press who choose to dump on me or not. But I'm not saying
that all the best elements of filmmaking didn't come together in
`Erin Brockovich.'''
 &HT;    And, yes, if she gets the opportunity, she'd vote for herself.
 &HT;    ``Yeaaah, honey,'' she says, laughing. ``You'd vote for
yourself. See your name on the ballot, and it's a real easy
check.''
 &HT;    As for the future, Roberts' name has been rumored to be attached
to any number of films. Most recently she's been said to be about
to star opposite Brad Pitt in David Fincher's ``The Mexican.''
 &HT;    The actress snorts in dismissal.
 &HT;    ``According to the Hollywood trade papers, I'm in every movie
they're making these days,'' she says. ``The truth is, I don't have
a next film. I've had eight months of break.
 &HT;    ``I'm taking some time off and enjoying it,'' she says. ``I like
hanging around the house with my mom and family, going to bed early
and waking up when I want to wake up and cooking and doing all that
kind of stuff.
 &HT;    ``When something good comes along, I'll take it,'' Roberts
concludes. ``If that's two years from now, that's how long my break
will be. If it's tomorrow, then there you go.''

JEDI MAESTRO: `STAR WARS' COMPOSER JOHN WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of composer
John Williams with George Lucas during the making of ``Star Wars:
The Phantom Menace.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    John Williams knows the score.
 &HT;    Creating music for sci-fi megamovies is never an easy task, the
Oscar-winning composer says. Harder still, in the case of ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' was living up to the expectations
created by his earlier trio of ``Star Wars'' scores.
 &HT;    ``I'm always daunted by these movies,'' Williams says on the eve
of the April 4 video release of ``The Phantom Menace.'' ``The music
has a lot of competition from sound effects, and the music has to
carry the sound of the film all the time.
 &HT;    ``The `Star Wars' movies don't have pages and pages of actors
doing dialogue,'' he explains, ``and the dialogue that's there is
very fragmented, so the orchestra has to sweep the film along.
 &HT;    ``There's also always a nagging doubt that you may not be able
to produce something as effective as the last time out,'' he adds.
``And when you're facing the prospect of writing two hours of music
in a couple of months _ that's hundreds of thousands of notes _
it's a challenge.
 &HT;    ``I was aided to a degree at the outset of `The Phantom Menace'
by the fact that we could use 10 percent of the earlier music, the
signature music, on the outer ends of the film,'' the composer
says. ``But 90 percent of the music is new. The energy of the film,
the battles, the pacing, the balancing of themes and keys and
tempos and variations of orchestration in order to maintain one's
interest in a score that long ... that's a technical challenge.''
 &HT;    Williams began by screening a rough assembly of ``The Phantom
Menace'' and discussing ``the musical kinetic'' with
writer/director George Lucas.
 &HT;    Then he strolled into a ``dimly lit'' room, yellow notepad in
hand, and hand-composed the score.
 &HT;    The music completed, Williams reunited with the London Symphony
Orchestra, with which he had teamed years earlier on the previous
``Star Wars'' adventures, to conduct and record the music.
 &HT;    As always, each major character has his or her own musical
motif, as do major worlds, certain battles and several varieties of
creature.
 &HT;    ``My task was to make the music of `The Phantom Menace' feel
that it belonged to the other three films, but was new to this
piece,'' Williams says by telephone from his Los Angeles home.
 &HT;    ``One of the nice elements was that Anakin (Jake Lloyd) _ who,
as we know, is to metamorphose into Darth Vader _ needed a theme,''
he says. ``If you listen to Anakin's theme, people say, `Ah, it
must be Darth Vader.' I decomposed Darth Vader's `Imperial March,'
and tried very subtly to introduce a slight hint of what he's to
become in the context of a very sweet, innocent and lyrical piece
suitable for Anakin.''
 &HT;    Williams admits to being ``very pleased'' with the ``Phantom
Menace'' score, and particularly likes the 65 minutes of material
culled together on the soundtrack.
 &HT;    He won't, however, win an Oscar for it. Instead, he received the
38th nomination of his career for the evocative Irish strains heard
in ``Angela's Ashes.''
 &HT;    Always busy, Williams is currently living at an even more
frenetic pace, devoting the spring and summer to a spate of
projects that include introducing a new piece, ``Tree Song,'' at
the Tanglewood Music Festival, scoring Mel Gibson's upcoming
Revolutionary War drama ``The Patriot'' and conducting several
Boston Pops concerts in Massachusetts.
 &HT;    At some point, probably in late 2001, he's expecting a call from
George Lucas. The composer _ whose other genre credits include
``The Time Tunnel'' and ``Lost in Space'' for television, as well
as ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' and ``E.T.: The
Extraterrestrial'' _ will then sharpen his pencils, dim the lights
and prepare to journey once again to a place far, far away.
 &HT;    Lucas is almost certain to call, because Williams' music is as
integral to the ``Star Wars'' mythos as the Force, Han Solo, R2-D2,
Tatooine or glowing lightsabers.
 &HT;    ``My sense of inseparability is probably a little less than
other people's,'' Williams says modestly. ``But if I look at it
objectively, they are inseparable.
 &HT;    ``It's one of those things that has always characterized
sequels,'' he adds. ``The strong musical signatures carry over.
It's very much a part of the genre as well.
 &HT;    ``I'm very gratified by the longevity of the `Star Wars' music
and the aural imagination that it engenders in people, that they
think of these characters when they hear the music.
 &HT;    ``I'm glad the next two prequels are going to happen,'' Williams
says. ``I'm very interested in seeing what George does and what
kind of opportunity the movies will give me to continue to add to
the body of what's become a weighty tome that so many people seem
to enjoy.''

 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 12)   &HT;     (Eds: ADDS the words ``despite Bradley's professed lack of
interest in the idea'' at the end of the 12th graf.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON 
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If ruthless old King George III were still around,
he probably would chortle over the irony of George W. Bush and Al
Gore, sons of prominent political dynasties, battling for the
presidency of a republic that long ago rejected leadership by royal
succession.
</P>
<P>
   The English king might also smile at the fact that when Gore
journeys to Los Angeles in August to be anointed officially as the
Democratic Party's presidential nominee, he will share the
spotlight with America's most exalted political dynasty, the
Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   It is inevitable that the convention in Los Angeles will be
steeped in nostalgia because it was there that John F. Kennedy was
nominated 40 years ago. For a few fleeting hours in August,
sentimental Democrats may seek to transform the City of Angels into
a reincarnation of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy connection is important to Gore. In various public
opinion polls, Americans list Kennedy among the outstanding
presidents in American history. The rating is probably more a
tribute to the Kennedy elegance, eloquence and premature death than
to his performance in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it could help Gore in his race with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also is the city where Robert F. Kennedy was fatally
wounded 32 years ago after winning the 1968 Democratic presidential
primary. In addition, California is a state in which Edward M.
Kennedy defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 Democratic primary, but
to no avail. Carter was renominated and then defeated by Republican
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore might ponder a valuable lesson from the Kennedy campaign.
Against the advice of angry liberals, John Kennedy selected his
chief opponent for the presidential nomination, Senate Majority
Leader Lyndon Johnson of Texas, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberals threatened to bolt the party. Robert Kennedy
didn't like Johnson and strongly opposed the choice. But John
Kennedy stuck by his decision despite the fact that his
relationship with Johnson was nothing like Gore's warm relationship
with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Johnson, a
master legislative tactician, took over the presidency and passed
into law every major item that had been on the liberals' agenda
since Harry Truman's presidency and, in some cases, since Franklin
Roosevelt's.
</P>
<P>
   That agenda included monumental civil rights legislation,
Medicare, Medicaid, federal aid to education, a war on poverty and
protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, after that record of achievement, Johnson led
America into the quagmire of Vietnam, and tragedy stalked our land.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960, however,
provides a second lesson for Gore: A candidate's chief political
opponent can be a helpful running mate and vice president if he
knows his way around Washington and has ideas about ways to improve
the lot of the American people. That fact of political life could
lead Gore to seek former Sen. Bill Bradley as his running mate
despite Bradley's professed lack of interest in the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many other possible vice presidential nominees:
California Gov. Gray Davis, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California and even Sen. Bob Kerrey, who
actively supported Bradley in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Political dynasties are not new to America. In the earliest days
of the republic, voters elected John Adams as president and later
chose his son, John Quincy Adams for the same office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been occupied by two Harrisons _ William
Henry and his grandson Benjamin. Neither left much of a mark on the
presidency or the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the presidential giants of the 20th century were distant
cousins Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Both had sons who
aspired to political glory, but never quite made it.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1960 has either political party chosen Los Angeles as
the site of its national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Although Los Angeles is 3,000 miles across the country from
Kennedy family base in Boston, it has become something of a second
home for the peripatetic Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy frequently visited the city where he mingled with
the flamboyant Hollywood ``Rat Pack'' headed by Frank Sinatra. It
presumably was there that he first met Marilyn Monroe, who became
an important hidden factor in his life.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kennedy's sisters, Pat, lived in a Santa Monica
beachfront home with her husband, actor Peter Lawford, who was an
intimate fixture in the Rat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Kennedy and Tennessee Senator Albert Gore Sr. both
sought the Democratic vice presidential nomination on a ticket
headed by Adlai Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Having been nominated for president a second time, Stevenson
decided that the way to breathe excitement into the Chicago
convention was to let the delegates pick his running mate. So, he
opened the race up to all who wished to take part.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees included Kennedy, Gore Sr., Sen. Hubert Humphrey of
Minnesota, New York Mayor Robert Wagner, and Gore's fellow senator
from Tennessee, Estes Kefauver.
</P>
<P>
   By the end if the first ballot, it was apparent that support for
Gore Sr., Humphrey and Wagner was fading. That meant a second
ballot showdown between Kennedy and Kefauver.
</P>
<P>
   The result was riveting as votes switched from one candidate to
another and the Kennedy and Kefauver tallies grew. Finally, Senator
Gore shifted Tennessee's vote to Kefauver and Oklahoma changed its
votes from Gore to Kefauver. Enough states followed Gore's lead to
put Kefauver over the top.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy won millions of friends and admirers by striding to
the stage to make a gracious speech urging that Kefauver's
nomination for vice president be made unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   If Speaker Sam Rayburn, the convention chairman, had not
recognized Gore and the Oklahoma delegation, Kennedy said later,
``I might have won that race with Senator Kefauver _ and my
political career would now be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Like European royalty, American dynasties are linked to one
another.

   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ Lawyers for the Miami relatives of Elian
Gonzalez told a judge Thursday that the 6-year-old boy has the
right to seek political asylum in the United States and the family
has the legal standing to try to block the U.S. government from
returning the shipwreck survivor to Cuba. In a hearing that could
go a long way toward resolving a bitter custody battle waged across
the Florida Straits, lawyers for the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) told U.S. District Judge Michael Moore
that only Elian's father in Cuba could speak for the boy. (Summary

   MCCAIN (Sedona, Ariz.) _ Sen. John McCain, the Republican whose
insurgency became the surprise of the primary season, ended his
maverick candidacy on Thursday with the hope that he would
eventually prevail in ``making our party as big as the country we
serve.'' Two days after being soundly defeated in coast-to-coast
primaries, McCain had gracious words for Gov. George W. Bush but
stopped noticeably short of endorsing him, saying only, ``I
congratulate Governor Bush and wish him and his family well. He may
very well become the next president of the United States.'' He also
ended speculation that he might make a third-party run by repeating
once again, ``I love my party, it is my home.'' By Alison Mitchell.

   BRADLEY (West Orange, N.J.) _ After an often bitter 14-month,

primary, former Sen. Bill Bradley ended his quest for the

behind Vice President Al Gore. But while Bradley pledged to work
for Gore's victory in the general election, he refused to use the
word ``endorse'' to describe his support for Mr. Gore and declined
to release his delegates to the vice president _ presumably to give
him more influence at the Democratic National Convention this
summer. By James Dao.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't get us wrong _ we usually like Brian De Palma. Although he
has delivered some schlock through the years _ remember, he
directed ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' _ the snazzy filmmaker has
given us such winners as ``Carrie,'' ``Dressed to Kill,'' ``Blow
Out,'' ``The Untouchables'' and the underrated ``Casualties of
War.'' Even his latest, ``Mission to Mars,'' is entertaining enough
to look past its many flaws.
</P>
<P>
   But when we saw the ``Mission'' trailer _ which seemed to appear
before every movie during the past few months _ we couldn't help
but think, ``There goes De Palma again, ripping off another
director.'' Only this time, it's Stanley Kubrick instead of Alfred
Hitchcock. De Palma, it seems to us, has a penchant for borrowing
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Which gave us an idea for a chart, which follows. But let's play
nice, and say that De Palma is just paying homage to famous
filmmakers.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   8 Oscar nominations: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), actress
(Annette Bening), director, original screenplay, cinematography,
film editing, original score. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays
a man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing,
daringly hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's
a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed
Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: original score. A finely made adaptation of
Frank McCourt's popular memoir of growing up in poverty and death
in Ireland. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite parts
re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the memory of McCourt's
lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might wonder what the fuss
is all about. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Leonardo DiCaprio
</P>
<P>
   and Virginie Ledoyen.
</P>
<P>
   A secondhand plot. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a restless young man
who travels with other aimless, privileged young people to a hidden
paradise _ then screws it up. It's hard to get attached to
characters who care about only one thing: their next moment of
pleasure. The cinematography makes the most of exotic locations.
But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the film's
gorgeous emptiness. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: director, supporting actress (Catherine
Keener), original screenplay. It's a loopy original. John Cusack
plays a quirky file clerk who discovers a door that leads into the
noggin of actor John Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the
nature of identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the
illusion of free will, it's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And often hysterically funny. (SM)1 hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Hilary Swank), supporting actress
(Chloe Sevigny). This intense true story of Teena Brandon, a
21-year-old woman who believed she was a man. After cutting her
hair and reversing her name, she hung out with some hard-drinking
rednecks in rural Nebraska, which didn't work out. The movie is a
bit low-budget, but it's still a remarkable film. (ERG) 1 hour, 54
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: picture, director, adapted screenplay,
supporting actor (Michael Caine), art direction, original score,
film editing. John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half,
Dr. Larch (Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in
his Maine orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's
protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the
world. (ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Danny DeVito,
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler, Neve Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   As we get to know Mona (Bette Midler) through flashbacks, we
quickly understand why nobody is disturbed by her demise. It turns
out that the Yugo in which she took a header into the Hudson River
had its brakes sabotaged. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito)
begins investigating her murder and finds that everyone in town had
something against Mona. (Hap Ernstein, Palm Beach (Fla.) Post) 1
hour, 30 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Julianne Moore), cinematography.
Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM)1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: supporting actress (Angelina Jolie). Two
fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna Kaysen's
memoir about the two years in the '60s she spent at a mental
hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Winona Ryder steadies the
movie, but Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath.
(ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: picture, supporting actor (Michael Clarke
Duncan), adapted screenplay, sound. A manipulative but meticulously
crafted, absorbing and beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen
King's prison novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose
latest prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical
powers of healing. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' PG (profanity and mild sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Keaton,
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   Breezily written by the Ephron sisters and briskly directed by
Diane Keaton, the movie's ads want you to believe it's a
side-splitting sibling comedy about three sisters (Keaton, Meg
Ryan, Lisa Kudrow) trying to connect. However, it's really an aging
parent-confused adult child story in which Ryan tries to be all
things to her dying dad (Walter Matthau). (ERG) 1 hour, 32 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Denzel Washington). Washington
delivers his best performance in years as pugilist Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender wrongly imprisoned
for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though ably directed, the
film contains some fabrications to tell this otherwise compelling
true story. (Bob Longino)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino
</P>
<P>
   and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: Picture, actor (Russell Crowe), director,
adapted screenplay, cinematography, film editing, sound. Crowe, the
hot-tempered cop in ``L.A. Confidential,'' gives an astonishing
performance. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, a real-life cigarette
industry consultant who blew the lid off the tobacco industry. Al
Pacino plays the ``60 Minutes'' producer dogging the story. (ERG) 1
hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Tom Cruise), original
screenplay, song. A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families,
love and forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with
small miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
movie is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of thing you live
through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. (SM) 2
hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gary Sinise,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's Red Planet opus is too much like other films
(``Contact,'' ``The Abyss'' and, especially, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey''), but it's still a decent popcorn movie packed with
thrills and sharp special effects. Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie
Nielsen and Jerry O'Connell are part of an astronaut team trying to
rescue others lost on Mars. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a remembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Best Thing'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Madonna
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue, the melodramatic situations, the performances all
scream ``Phony!'' Madonna and Rupert Everett play best pals (she's
straight, he's gay), who end up raising a child together. Some bad
movies, of course, are perversely enjoyable. This isn't one of
them. (Robert W. Butler, Kansas City (Mo.) Star) 1 hour, 40
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yakking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ninth Gate'' R ( violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp
</P>
<P>
   and Lena Olin.
</P>
<P>
   A major disappointment from Roman Polanski, it stars Johnny Depp
in a tale of old books, the devil and the gateway to satanic
powers. Imagine one of those seasonal Halloween horror houses, but
designed by librarians. And what do you get at the end of the trek?
The spectacle of a bunch of rich twits in black robes, play-acting
a satanic mass. (SM) 2 hours, 13 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Blue'' R (animated sequences of violence
</P>
<P>
   and nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   An animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Satoshi Kon.
</P>
<P>
   This anime feature isn't the usual sci-fi stuff but an
intriguing, twisty mystery that has more to do with the work of
live-action mind-game masters, like Alfred Hitchcock, Claude
Chabrol or Spain's Alejandro Amenabar (``Open Your Eyes''). (SM)
$3, $5 after 6 p.m. 404-651-2463. 1 hour, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Rear Window'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Stewart,
</P>
<P>
   Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's 1954 classic is restored and re-released. Jimmy
Stewart and Grace Kelly star in a New York peep show of suspected
murder. Let's enjoy the movie for what it is: a sexy (if sometimes
sexist) chamber drama that gradually, expertly ups the suspense to
excruciating levels, all without breaking a sweat. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' R (sex, violence, nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad. ... Ben
Affleck plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order
to bed babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess
with her psycho brother (Gary Sinise), who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous. (ERG) 1
hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent wrap-up of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween get-up. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM)1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis,
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment
</P>
<P>
   and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   6 Oscar nominations: picture, director, supporting actor (Haley
Joel Osment), supporting actress (Toni Collette), original
screenplay, film editing. A surprising, spine-tingling gem.
Eight-year-old Cole (Osment) can see restless phantoms with their
skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film that speculates on
what the relationship between the restless dead and a liaison to
the living world might be. (SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse, N.Y., schoolkids trying to
extend one out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV
weatherman suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott
appears as the ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert
Denerstein, Denver Rocky Mountain News) 1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' PG-13 (profanity,
</P>
<P>
   disturbing images, sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,Youki Kudoh and Max von Sydow.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty but chilly. Based on the best seller, Ethan Hawke plays a
newspaperman looking into slaying charges against a
Japanese-American. The case rekindles memories of internment during
World War II and Hawke's youthful romance with the suspect's wife.
Beautifully photographed to mask its thin plot, ``Cedars''
generates little passion and, frankly, is flatline drama. (SM) 2
hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' R (profanity, sexuality and alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actor (Sean Penn), supporting actress
(Samantha Morton). This jazzy little doodle of a mockumentary is
middling Woody Allen and, as such, mildly likable once you get past
the insistent whiff of self-justification. Penn is superb as a
legendary (and fictional) jazz guitarist in the 1930s who's an
angel with a guitar in his hands and a louse the rest of the time.
(ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon,
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law and
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   5 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Jude Law), adapted
screenplay, art direction, original score, costumes. A handsome but
flawed adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty thriller.
Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to Italy to bring
back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his lifestyle and
committing murder. (SM) 2 hours, 18 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG)1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: song. More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than
families have seen in years. Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen) and old and new characters are locked in a delightful story
of toy rustling and what it means to love a child. It sports an
inspired, hilarious script and stunning visuals. (Bob Longino)1
hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The War Zone'' Unrated (specific sexual abuse,
</P>
<P>
   nudity, violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ray Winstone
</P>
<P>
   and Tilda Swinton.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by actor Tim Roth, a seemingly normal family, living on
the desolate coast of Devon, England, is beset by secrets and lies
that lead to total breakdown. The teen son (Freddie Cunliffe)
suspects his father (Ray Winstone) is having sex with his older
sister (Lara Belmont). A brutal, challenging film that asks you to
take a risky journey. (ERG) 1 hour, 38 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``What Planet Are You From?'' R (sexual situations, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Garry Shandling
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``I Married a Stand-Up From Outer Space.'' A strangely
desperate and unfunny comedy about a galactically equipped alien
and his mission to breed with Earth women. Poor Annette Bening
plays one of the women; Garry Shandling, who also co-wrote and
produced this mess, is the R-rated extra-terrestrial. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service) 1 hour, 40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollak. (SM) 1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas,
</P>
<P>
   Tobey Maguire
</P>
<P>
   and Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas plays scruffy, scattered English lit professor
Grady Tripp in director Curtis Hanson's (``L.A. Confidential'')
well-written version of Michael Chabon's novel. Part satire and
part coming-of-age tale of a man in his 50s, the film is full of
episodes and digressions that are as interesting as the final
destination. It's also a feast for actors, who make the most of
tiny, telling moments. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes. B

 &HT;    SENATE PANEL APPROVES BILL TO DOUBLE NUMBER OF HIGH-TECH VISAS
 &HT;    340&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill that would allow more high-skilled
foreigners to work in the United States was approved Thursday by
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that U.S. high-tech companies are
struggling to fill cubicles with capable and educated workers,''
said Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act would
increase the number of H-1B temporary visas, which allow highly
skilled workers to work in the United States three years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase the limit on the number of visas to
195,000 this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and in the next two
fiscal years. It would exempt from the limit those who come to the
United States to work at universities and those who have recently
received advanced degrees at a U.S. college.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the visa limit is 115,000 this year, 107,500
next year, and 65,000 in fiscal 2002. Hatch's bill would more than
double the three-year total to 585,000 visas, compared to 287,500
under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the increase is only a temporary solution to the
shortage of high-tech workers, and that more training and education
for American workers in areas of math, science, and technology were
needed. The bill would earmark $150 million for scholarships and
grants to train and educate more American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also retains a $500 fee for each visa, paid by the
companies that employ foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
Connie Mack, R-Fla., Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. The bill passed the
committee on a vote of 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bill was voted on, the panel rejected a substitute
offered by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that would raise the limit
by a smaller amount and increase the visa fees paid by businesses.
A bill similar to Kennedy's is pending in the House.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's proposal would increase the number of visas this year
to 145,000, an additional 30,000 visas, and would exempt all
foreign workers with educations above a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's proposal would also establish a tiered fee system that
would collect $30 million per year. Companies with fewer than 150
employees would pay $1,000 per visa, companies with between 151 to
500 employees would pay $2,000 per visa, and those with more than
500 employees would pay $3,000 per visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech companies are experiencing record profits, and they
can well afford to pay a higher application fee,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested allocating money for training initiatives,
scholarships for low-income students, and improving the H-1B visa
applications process and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any credible legislative proposal to increase the number of
high-tech workers available to American businesses must begin with
the expansion of state-of-the-art high-tech career training
opportunities for large numbers of American workers,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee rejected Kennedy's proposal, 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said that Kennedy's proposed increase in visas was
inadequate to address the shortage of high-tech labor. He added
that an increase in fees paid by companies was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to Hatch and Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee,
a group of labor, immigration and civil rights organizations urged
Congress to consider more than just temporary immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very troubled that the only immigration legislation
given adequate attention this year so far is related to
highly-skilled temporary workers,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees International Union, the Service Employees International
Union, the United Neddletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees,
the National Council of La Raza, and the National Immigration
Forum.

 &HT;    IT'S DEAD!
 &HT;    IT'S RED!!
 &HT;    IT'S MARS!!!
 &HT;    By Michael Alicea
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give it up, Hollywood: Mars is dead.
</P>
<P>
   No canals. No mysterious face. No life of any kind. Nope, not
even one stinking bacterium. Nothing but red, dead, rusty dust.
</P>
<P>
   But when did the facts ever get in a movie's way? Mission to
Mars, which opens today, features not just Martian life but
super-intelligent Martian life that supposedly started life on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is set in 2020. Humanity has launched its first manned
mission to the Red Planet. But yikes! When they get there, three of
four crew members are wiped out by a huge whirlwind worm. In come
the rescuers, who waste no time getting themselves in big trouble.
Good thing, for while saving themselves they uncork the secret of
life and then, of course, live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Fun, but what a crock. If there was ever any life on Mars, there
was no happy end to it. Mars _ named for the Roman god of war _ is
a dead, cold, inhospitable world whose air is poison and whose
climate would kill us in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, our Martian fascination has persisted for years.
We don't get excited about ``Jovians'' or ``Saturnians,'' but Mars
has always kept us wondering and waiting for a visitor or two.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Mars was thought to be the most likely of all the
planets to harbor life. Its modern appeal began with a
mistranslation of the Italian astronomer Giovanni Sciaparelli's
1877 observations of what he termed ``canali'' on Mars. What he
meant as ``channels,'' a natural occurrence, was taken as
``canals,'' man-made structures. Soon after, Martians became tragic
figures in our imaginations, scraping at the bone-dry dirt, which
is red because it's full of iron oxide (rust), and digging canals
in an attempt to save their race by drawing water from the frozen
poles.
</P>
<P>
   By 1897, H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds had Martians looking
toward Earth to solve their own global concerns over the dying
Martian environment. In 1910, Percival Lowell penned Abode of Life,
a serious look into the possibility of advanced life-forms on the
Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Martians have been pictured as the enemy (Invaders
From Mars, Mars Attacks!), the misguided, (The Martian Chronicles),
the silly (Marvin the Martian, Spaced Invaders) _ and now, with
Mission to Mars, benevolent progenitors.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the movies, more serious arguments over the existence
of Martians have recently taken place. They began with the Viking
spacecraft images of a region named the Cydonia Mensae. These
pictures showed the now-infamous ``Face'' _ a mount that looks like
a human face when the light hits it just right _ and pyramid-like
mountains that look like remnants of a ``city.'' This area is the
centerpiece of Mission to Mars _ the last vestige of a race who
escaped a planetary catastrophe _ and the ``Face'' is their
monument to whichever creature from Earth had evolved enough to
travel ``home'' and prove his intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that these structures alone prove Mars either was
once inhabited and we are the descendants of that race, or was once
inhabited but all the Martians died, leaving behind their ruined
cities and monuments.
</P>
<P>
   But to scientists, this is simply nonsense. The city? A few
hills of ruddy dirt blown into rare shapes by the forces of Mars'
unrelenting winds. The Face? Shadows and rocks. Nothing more. Mars,
they say, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   But when did science ever sell movie tickets?

 &HT;    CONGRESS LIKELY TO GIVE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY MORE FOREIGN WORKERS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a labor drought this summer, technology
executives are asking Congress for relief this spring.
</P>
<P>
   They claim their businesses can grow only if sprinkled with
talent drawn from deep pools of labor found in India, China and
elsewhere. Congress must increase the ceiling on visas for
foreigners with high-tech skills to keep U.S. companies from
shriveling, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the effort believe today's worker shortages
will actually strengthen the economy in the long run. They argue
that if companies can't get a quick fix from overseas, they will
retrain older U.S. workers and work more closely with schools to
produce better students.
</P>
<P>
   With elections coming up, most members of Congress are eager to
please wealthy technology executives. And no lawmaker wants to be
accused of slowing the engine that has been driving the U.S.
economy's longest expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these lawmakers fear a backlash from workers
concerned about competition from low-wage foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there is a national labor shortage of such
dimensions that we need more visas,'' said Vin O'Neill, a lobbyist
for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a
professional association based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The visas, known as H-1B visas, allow highly skilled workers
such as engineers and computer programmers to come into the United
States for three years. Usually, a visa can be renewed once for an
additional three-year stay. Often, temporary workers use the visas
as a step toward gaining permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   This debate over foreign workers may sound familiar. Just two
years ago, spurred on primarily by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
Congress raised the annual limit on high-tech visas from 65,000 to
115,000 for both fiscal 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But under current law, the limit will fall to 107,500 when
fiscal 2001 begins Oct. 1, and the following year, the cap will
return to 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies, which have been hiring frantically in the
past year, will hit this year's limit even before spring is over.
Unless the law is changed, they will have to cool their heels until
new visas become available Oct. 1 and will face even a greater
squeeze under next year's smaller visa cap. Some executives even
suggest U.S. businesses will have to move operations overseas to
find workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Computing Technology Industry Association, a trade group,
says nearly 269,000 high-tech jobs are going unfilled already,
costing U.S. businesses $4.5 billion in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   To help companies, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., introduced a bill last month to increase H-1B
visas to 195,000 for this year, and to stay at that level through
fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Their legislation, sent to the Senate floor Thursday by a 15-3
vote of the Judiciary Committee, also would exempt from the cap
foreigners who work for U.S. colleges and universities or research
institutions, as well as foreigners who received a master's degree
or doctorate from a U.S. college within six months of their
employment.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would retain a provision of the 1998 bill requiring a
$500-per-visa fee to go toward scholarships and worker training
programs in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said labor shortages are so severe that he believes
lawmakers will move his bill quickly. ``I don't think we're going
to have tremendous opposition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Congress favor a different approach. Rep. Lamar
Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, has
submitted a bill that would boost the H-1B visa cap from 115,000 to
160,000, but just for this year. In 2001, the ceiling would fall to
107,500, and then to 65,000 the following year. ``Our bill seeks to
solve an immediate problem,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith bill also would boost the visa fee to $1,000 per
foreigner, with the revenues going to college scholarships for
students in high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports raising the visa ceiling.
``We are ready to support a reasonable increase in the number of
H-1B visas as long as it reflects a balanced approach that protects
and prepares the U.S. work force,'' White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has rounded up some key co-sponsors: Rep. Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., who co-chairs the Congressional Internet Caucus; Rep. Tom
Campbell, R-Calif., whose district includes Silicon Valley, and
Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte's support is especially important because he is widely
regarded as the high-tech world's best friend in Washington. If
Goodlatte says this is the best deal industry is going to get from
Congress and the White House, tech lobbyists may well take his word
for it. Tech companies would then renew their fight for more visas
when a new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   How well next year's lobbying effort goes may depend heavily on
a study being conducted by the National Science Foundation, which
was directed by Congress in 1998 to verify high-tech job needs. The
foundation is expected to complete its work by October.
</P>
<P>
   The study may at last add facts to a debate that has been argued
with largely anecdotal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of visas point to news stories about some foreign
workers who say they were lured to this country with promises of
good pay, only to earn a paltry $500 a month. But reliable research
has not determined exactly how often pay abuses occur.
</P>
<P>
   Visa opponents also say many older workers want high-tech jobs,
but young executives at high-tech companies won't offer them
training. Are there really enough older tech workers to supply
fast-growing companies with the labor they need? That question has
never been answered conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, visa opponents insist the job market is changing enough
to relieve labor shortages without more foreign help. O'Neill, of
the electrical engineers group, admits hiring has been difficult
for some companies in the past year, but attributes much of the
employment surge to the effort to repair Y2K computer bugs. Now
that those problems have been fixed, computer-related job openings
are declining and ``salaries are leveling off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Hatch-sponsored legislation, Dan Stein, a
lobbyist for the anti-immigration movement, says: ``There isn't a
single study that shows that kind of bill is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Tech employers vigorously disagree. They note that the Bureau of
Labor Statistics' employment projections through 2008 show the No.
1 industry for job growth will be computer and data processing
services, which will need 3.47 million workers in 2008, compared to
1.6 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000 and 2001, the Labor Department says the five
fastest-growing occupations are computer engineers; computer
support specialists, systems analysts, database administrators and
desktop publishing specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Department of Education reports that college
degrees granted in engineering are declining, while computer
science degrees are down sharply from the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Thom Stohler, a spokesman for the American Electronics
Association, a Washington-based trade group representing high-tech
companies, says U.S. colleges can't possibly produce enough
engineers to fill the labor market in coming years because very few
students are taking the math courses needed to get those degrees.
``The pipeline from K through 12 is not looking good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But given that the National Science Foundation's study on the
job market won't be completed for months, Smith and Goodlatte say
the most appropriate thing for Congress to do now is boost the visa
cap only for this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that the expansion is of a temporary
nature, so that our long-term goal is to make sure these
opportunities exist for American citizens,'' Goodlatte said.

 &HT;    Stare death in the eye _ and live to tell about it
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dreaded Acanthophis antarcticus _ better, and more aptly,
known as the death adder _ is stirring things up at the Tennessee
Aquarium in downtown Chattanooga these days.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Australian native, whose deadly fangs inject
highly toxic venom into its hapless prey, is safely locked behind
glass, along with some equally fearsome friends.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened ``Venom: Striking Beauties,'' which will remain
in the aquarium's 1,500-square-foot changing exhibits gallery
through Jan. 2, 2002, brings visitors eyeball-to-eyeball with some
of the world's loveliest and most lethal animals.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the black widow was trouble, get a load of cow
killer wasps, black mamba, bullet ant, the Goliath bird-eating
tarantula and the stinging catfish.
</P>
<P>
   These exotic creatures are among the nearly 50 species of
venomous spiders, insects, fish, scorpions, snakes and poisonous
dart frogs now residing in settings that mirror those in the wild.
Among the 22 habitats are a dense South American rain forest where
the yellow eyelash viper and terciopelo reside, an African rain
forest featuring several species of mambas and vipers, and a
Southwestern desert with rattlesnakes, Gila monsters and scorpions.
Oh, my.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its shock value, ``Venom'' aims to help visitors develop
an appreciation for these often misunderstood animals by offering a
glimpse into their secret worlds.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, venom is simply part of the feeding strategy _ a
way to immobilize the unfortunate victim destined to become supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these creatures use venom as means to capture prey,
not as a weapon,'' says Jackson Andrews, director of operations and
husbandry at the aquarium. ``Instead of relying on venom as a
defense, many of these animals have developed strategies that help
them remain hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Austere design elements _ harsh angles, metal, vaulted chambers,
industrial locks _ give the exhibit a futuristic look.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive touch screens and graphic panels show cultural
connections to venom, describe its medical benefits and explain the
difference between venom and poison.

 &HT;    `Ninth Gate' opens to a devil of a dud
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching ``The Ninth Gate'' is like being force-marched through
dank rooms piled high with musty books, led by drab tour guides who
mutter the same pedantic points over and over. Imagine one of those
seasonal Halloween horror houses, but designed by librarians. And
what do you get at the end of the trek? The spectacle of a bunch of
rich twits in black robes, play-acting a satanic mass.
</P>
<P>
   Like the silly orgy in Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
this late-act set piece in ``Gate'' confirms the sad decline of a
once-terrific director.
</P>
<P>
   Here it's Roman Polanski, the sly hand behind ``Chinatown'' and,
more relevantly, ``Rosemary's Baby.'' An expert fusion of the
psychological and supernatural, that 1968 classic made us question
whether the pregnant heroine was really carrying Lucifer's baby or
having a mental meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how weird things got, it kept a foot in the real
world. By contrast, ``Gate'' quickly shuts out reality, starting
with a New York setting that doesn't resemble New York. (Like
Kubrick, Polanski shot in Europe.) And you never question the
psychological state of this movie's characters: They're all nut
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a sullen expert on rare books.
``You're a book detective,'' says wealthy widow Liana Telfer (Lena
Olin), one of many who're fascinated by the 17th-century volume,
``The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows.'' She's trying to
recover her late husband's copy, acquired by reptilian publisher
Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), whose personal library is devoted to
one subject: the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Legend holds that the book's credited author worked with a ghost
writer: Satan himself. On Balkan's dime, Corso flies to Europe to
inspect the two other known copies of ``Gates,'' hoping to
determine which is the original. The key is nine tarotlike
engravings, which Corso finds have slight variations in each book.
Supposedly, whoever unlocks the mystery of the images can summon
Ol' Scratch himself and gain earth-shattering powers.
</P>
<P>
   OK, fine. But Corso's journey proves long and tedious, played
out in dark-paneled European offices and country homes, and
sputtering to an ambiguous (unsatisfying) end. ``Gate'' takes place
in a world without malls, computers or teenagers. Maybe this was
meant to make it ``timeless.'' Instead, it unfolds in a vacuum. You
feel that Polanski himself is bored with the story and can't be
bothered to liven it up. Even Corso's run-ins with a thug are
lazily staged.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easier to cut it some slack if a recent movie hadn't
shrewdly blended reality and the paranormal. Who knows whether
writer-director M. Night Shyamalan is a fan of ``Rosemary's Baby,''
but his Oscar-nominated ``The Sixth Sense'' creates the same
tension and understated spookiness of that film. It finds menace in
the commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, there's nothing commonplace here. Like the
undead revelers in Polanski's ``Fearless Vampire Killers,'' the
actors have an overitalicized look, like figures in medieval
pageants. In one miscalculated scene, actor Jose Lopez Rodero plays
twin booksellers. The use of split screens is clumsily apparent,
the actor's dialogue is dubbed, and the characters look like
dueling Gepettos.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the many ill-advised choices that keep bumping
you out of the movie's intended spooky spell. The only real sense
of dread is on the soundtrack, via composer Wojciech Kilar's
Walpurgisnacht waltz.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the screenplay, adapted from Arturo
Perez-Reverte's novel ``El Club Dumas,'' credits three writers.
English is a second language for two; the third is a classical
literary scholar. Maybe that accounts for the leaden dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest misstep is Polanski's decision to cast his wife,
Emmanuelle Seigner, as The Girl. She's an enigmatic creature who
shadows Corso, a guardian angel (or perhaps demon) _ one of those
symbolic figures that can work in books but rarely translate to the
screen. Trying to seem mysterious, the blank-faced Seigner mainly
seems to be fighting a hangover. Once she starts to kick butt like
a ninja and (so help me) defy gravity, the film has slipped
irreversibly into camp.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mystery here is how the actors maintained straight
faces while mouthing the script's empty mumbo-jumbo. Depp sticks to
a basic mode, simmering as a bookish, loner mercenary; the gifted
Olin and Langella are stuck playing cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   They probably put their faith in Polanski, trusting him to
transform the lame script into a creepily elegant mood piece.
Instead, it's the sort of thing that might have turned up as a
1970s TV movie, starring Anthony Franciosa and Karen Black. ``The
Ninth Gate'' won't spook you, but it'll give you a few
unintentional laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ninth Gate''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp and Lena Olin. Directed by Roman Polanski.
Rated R for violence and sexuality. 2 hours, 13 minutes.
</P>

   The verdict: Not worth unlocking. A major disappointment from
Roman Polanski.

 &HT;    Restored `Window' clearly a thrill
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too many trees have given their lives to provide pages for
essays about the cinema-as-voyeurism subtext and Freudian imagery
in ``Rear Window.'' Go to the library if you want that stuff. Here,
let's forget academic analysis and enjoy the restored, 1954
rerelease for what it is, bottom line: a sexy (if sometimes sexist)
chamber drama that gradually, expertly ups the suspense to
excruciating levels, all without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a finessed variant on ``Rope,'' Alfred
Hitchcock's 1948 experiment that also tried to build tension while
confined to one interior set. Only this time _ without the single,
long takes that kept ``Rope'' mired in staginess _ Hitch got it
right.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't know, James Stewart plays news photographer
L.G. ``Jeff'' Jeffries, stuck in a wheelchair with a broken leg.
When he's not getting massages from home nurse Thelma Ritter
(obviously in pre-HMO days), or fending off the charms of society
girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), he whiles away his hours casually
spying on his neighbors through their windows overlooking his New
York courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   These folks are comic relief at first: the aging Miss
Lonelyhearts, the frustrated composer, the insatiable newlyweds and
the lithe, blond dancer who bends over and shows off her tush so
often that you figure she's wise to Jeff's peeping ways. Then
there's stocky salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who draws
Jeff's main focus when his nagging wife suddenly disappears. Has
she gone away, or been done away with?
</P>
<P>
   As Jeff grows convinced that he has (almost) seen a murder, the
movie builds suspense so gradually that it can surprise you with
its cumulative force. In particular, the sequence when Jeff watches
helplessly as Lisa, across the courtyard, finds herself in peril is
one of Hitchcock's more grueling scenes _ not because of what
happens, but what could. As usual, what we fear is much worse than
what we see.
</P>
<P>
   Thrills aren't the only thing ``Rear Window'' provides. It's
Hitchcock's second valentine to Kelly (they worked together three
times). Who can forget the amazing entrance he gives her, shooting
Lisa as an ambiguous force of both light (her dazzling blondness
and skin) and dark (the shadows she casts on commitment-shy Stewart
as she looms close for that way-sexy slo-mo kiss).
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also keeps the movie from becoming too claustrophobic: Her
inexhaustible, breathttaking wardrobe provides the equivalent of
ever-changing scenery.
</P>
<P>
   I know some people who call ``Rear Window'' their favorite
Hitchcock flick. It's not mine; it's too tidy, lacking the
unsettling, unsparing wide-screen landscapes of his later movies
(especially ``North by Northwest'' and ``Vertigo'') or the jolts
of, say, ``The Birds'' and especially ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Like one of Jeff's neighbors, the composer, Hitchcock is playing
a deceptively simple tune here, showing how much he can get away
with within a tight rhyme scheme. In fact, the movie is scored like
music. Pay attention to the way it alternates scenes thick with
dialogue with long, tense patches of silence.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the cacophony of street sounds and radio ditties
that constitute the movie's soundtrack gives way to the composer's
completed tune. In its final moments, ``Rear Window'' offers a view
of the world that I doubt Hitchcock believed for a second. It gives
us the reassurance (or perhaps illusion) that even in this backyard
microcosm tainted by loneliness, mistrust and murder, strangers and
the random events of their lives can come together, at least for a
moment, in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rear Window''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter. Rated
PG.1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A classic. See it.

 &HT;    Journey of discovery leads to the heart
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By Valerie Boyd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service In his latest book of essays, James
<TEXT>
Alan McPherson's voice is not so much a voice of exile as it is the
voice of a masterful writer who has found his way home.
<P>
   For McPherson, home is Iowa City, Iowa, where he teaches at the
Iowa Writer's Workshop. Home has also been Grant Hall at Atlanta's
Morris Brown College, where, as a student, he learned priceless
lessons about pride and power. And it has also been, among other
places, Disneyland, where for years he took his daughter on
periodic pilgrimages to teach her to believe in magic. Ultimately,
though, the short story writer (who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1978
for his collection ``Elbow Room'') and memoirist (``Crabcakes'')
has found that home is a state of mind, a place of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Disneyland,'' one of the most affecting of the dozen essays
in ``A Region Not Home,'' McPherson tells how, after a bitter
divorce, he found an unlikely ally in hiking the emotional terrain
of long-distance fatherhood: his imagination. In what was surely
one of the most unusual uses of money awarded from a MacArthur
Foundation ``genius'' grant, McPherson and his daughter, Rachel,
began to fly _ literally. ``I began, then, in my imagination, to
view the country as one big house. My bedroom was in Iowa City.
Rachel's bedroom was in Charlottesville. Friends had guest rooms,
for Rachel and for me, in Richmond, in Washington, D.C., in
Stamford and in New Haven, in New York, in Boston, in Cambridge, in
Chicago, in Oakland, and in Los Angeles. All Rachel and I had to
do, with the MacArthur money, and with my own earnings after that
largesse had run out, was to move from room to room in this huge
house, bonding as we went with each other and with our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   On one of these treks, 10-year-old Rachel is grounded in
Chicago's O'Hare Airport by a massive snowstorm. You can almost
hear McPherson's voice shaking, as if it just happened yesterday,
when he writes: ``She had no money and was being obliged to sleep
in a chair or else on the floor of the airport with the other
children of divorce, tagged like Christmas gifts, who were serving
out their obligations to distant parents. ... During that hard
December night, I sat at my table and made telephone calls, like
thousands of other anonymous parents, to every possible source of
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel sleeps in the guest room of a family friend in Chicago.
But her father does not go to bed that night. Instead, he waits for
dawn: ``When the flight from O'Hare arrived and when Rachel came
down the jetway,'' he recalls, ``I thought my heart would break.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of intimate geography McPherson continually
traverses in ``A Region Not Home,'' whether he's writing about his
beloved daughter; about his mentor, the late Ralph Ellison; or
about a fascinating stranger _ a beggar in Palo Alto, Calif., for
instance, whose cardboard sign reads simply: ``I am a Christian
man.''
</P>
<P>
   McPherson's essays are at once eloquent and earthy, astute and
imaginative, philosophical and practical. And in each one, he
weaves together divergent strains of thought that eventually add up
to that one magic moment when it all becomes clear _ for the reader
and for McPherson himself, it seems. This, perhaps, is the signal
achievement of this remarkable collection: The author manages to
make you feel as if you're going with him on a journey of
discovery. Yet McPherson is thoroughly in control, writing with an
unrelenting intelligence that fully engages the intellect, even
while making the heart pound.

 &HT;    The complexities of good and evil, faith and flesh
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serious novelists like to say that fiction is a moral concern,
and perhaps it is. But right and wrong exist on one plane, and good
and evil on another. It is easier to take measure of the forgivable
than of the ineradicable. Evil, if you believe it exists, is
somehow beyond human reach and yet it is all around us, resistant
to all purgatives.
</P>
<P>
   For Graham Greene, it was in the nature of things that there be
no grace without evil, the renewal of the one reinforcing the
presence of the other. Try as we might, we can never rid ourselves
of ourselves. Those who have seen the artistically exquisite movie
version of Greene's novel ``The End of the Affair'' understand this
better than they could have before _ understand, in particular, how
deeply he penetrated the psychology of desire and obligation,
betrayal and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 40-odd books that Greene wrote _ not only novels but
also travel narratives, essays and criticism, autobiography and
children's stories _ ``The End of the Affair'' and ``The Power and
the Glory'' stand in an odd relation to each other. Edmund Wilson
was not the only critic who counted ``The End of the Affair''
(along with, if I'm not mistaken, ``A Burnt-Out Case'') Greene's
finest work, but reacquaintance with it today makes clear how
different its theme is from that of ``The Power and the Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   At its most superficial level, as moviegoers know, ``The End of
the Affair'' involves an adulterous love affair, although Greene's
narrator, novelist Maurice Bendrix, tells us early on, ``... this
is a record of hate more than of love.'' It is a novel whose
complexities are the familiar ones: desire and betrayal, jealousy
and distrust. What is less familiar, perhaps, is the way in which
those emotions are shown to reveal not merely the necessary
circumstances of the story but the lineaments of human character.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond theological conundrums
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy for American readers to think of Greene as an
``English'' novelist, whatever that might imply. The truth is that,
apart from certain mannerisms of style, he was never as English as
Americans imagined. ``The End of the Affair'' is set in postwar
London, but what is more universal than love betrayed? And ``The
Power and the Glory'' is distinctly un-English _ in the Roman
Catholicism that broods over it, in the slightly exotic setting
(Mexico), in the dialectic of good and evil on which the novel is
built. The story is set in the sun-bleached southern provinces of
Tabasco and Chiapas, and the landscape itself becomes the
metaphorical canvas on which hunter and hunted play out their roles
in a drama that has its protagonist but no real heroes. The one
character who ought to have been, Padre Jose, goes to his death
praying that his own sins be forgiven along with those of his
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was never above playing God with his characters. But in
``The Power and the Glory'' you have the sense of something deeper
than theological conundrums. Greene's whisky priest travels about
on his mule saying Mass and giving the sacraments in a country of
simple believers and a militantly atheistic government. The
government is prohibitionist as well, so Greene's fallible priest
has neither wine for himself nor wine that can be turned into the
blood of Christ for the faithful. (In one powerful scene, he comes
upon a bottle only to see it guzzled before his eyes by a
contemptuous government official.)
</P>
<P>
   Greene's padre takes the gospel to pueblos and tropical villages
where the rot and torpor are enough to drain a soul of all faith,
hope and charity. The air in a Greene novel always hangs heavy with
foreboding, an air in which only a Graham Greene character could
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   A failure of mind and heart
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere was never more than that _ the air and not
the ground on which the novel was planted. Greene's real subject
was human failure, and in a Greene novel neither faith nor flesh
has an easy time of it. It is no different in ``The End of the
Affair.'' When a priest urges on Bendrix the palliative of
confession, Bendrix tells him contemptuously, ``I've got nothing to
repent except failure. Go back to your own people, father, back to
your bloody little box and your beads.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure, in ``The End of the Affair,'' was one of the mind
and heart, not one that penance and prayer could undo. Neil Jordan,
the director of the movie version, understood this. John Ford, who
directed the 1947 movie version of ``The Power and the Glory''
(titled ``The Fugitive''), got things backward, giving the police
lieutenant in pursuit of Greene's padre an integrity that might
have been his salvation and the padre an indomitable goodness he
never possessed. The whole point of that novel is that good and
evil exist in us all, and that we come to grace only from guilt.
The padre, waiting in his cell for his executioner, says his rosary
consoled him only in the knowledge that another priest would come
for the faithful. And if they were lucky, he would be a better one.
In prayer, he knew he had failed both himself and those whose faith
was entrusted to him. The wrong he understood, but it was evil he
could not change.

   HOMEDEPOT-LATAM _ Home Depot could make an announcement in the
next week about its international growth plans, according to a new
analyst's report. The news could be that it is acquiring at least 3
Sam's Club stores from Wal-Mart for about $50 million in Buenos
Aires, Argentina. Analysts view that as positive because Home Depot
needs to leverage down the up-front costs incurred to enter Latin
America. Analysts estimate that Home Depot lost about $10-$11
million in the region in 1999 primarily due to startup costs. Also,
there has been speculation that HD is looking at European and
German acquisitions. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 8.

   PAPER _ As the paper industry's movers and shakers gather this

the recent round of consolidation should increase profitability in

   OT-ABUSE _ The nation's factories and offices are running

workplace is changing thus creating a grey area: who should get
paid overtime? And who's exempt? A look at this issue. (Joyner,

LAST CALL FOR SHOWS LIKE `FREAKS AND GEEKS,' `FELICITY' AND `SPORTS
NIGHT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My guess is that Paul Feig wrote the pilot for ``Freaks and
Geeks'' both out of frustration and personal salvation, knowing
full well that any network programmer taking a chance on it had to
be either brilliant or batty.
</P>
<P>
   At age 37 and having had roles on promising-but-unnoticed
sitcoms like ``The Jackie Thomas Show,'' Feig had become
disillusioned by the medium's limitations. Apparently, it was
impossible to blend honesty, poignancy and humor on TV,
particularly when portraying adolescents, who were always presented
as precocious kids quick to upstage their slow-on-the-take parents.
</P>
<P>
   As written, and as executed by a fine cast of young actors,
``Freaks and Geeks'' gloriously rebels against the traditional TV
blueprint. It not only sets up shop in 1980, but it has the nerve
to zero in on the adolescent confusion of teen-agers drowning at
the bottom of the popularity gene pool without so much as a helping
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Apatow, who, with Feig, co-created the series and serves as
executive producer, mentioned recently that NBC initially found
``Freaks'' clever and often downright hilarious, but over a number
of episodes, somewhat depressing. The network has become leery
about how long audiences would watch losers always being losers.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, its last airing registered at No. 77 on the prime-time
chart, just a few slots ahead of UPN's ``The Parkers,'' which means
it could be in serious trouble once networks start handing out pink
slips in mid-May to make room for the fall's new entries.
</P>
<P>
   With a little over two months left in the TV season, it's that
time of year when networks start fingering weak performers for
execution, and ``Freaks'' is clearly on NBC's radar. The dramedy
returns to the schedule Monday still well-liked by critics, but it
is on the proverbial ``bubble'' _ that is, so fragile that its
survival depends on the performance of this upcoming string of
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks'' is not alone, of course. ABC could give the boot to
the still underachieving ``Sports Night,'' CBS is rethinking the
future of ``Early Edition'' and ``Martial Law,'' Fox may have had
enough of ``Time of Your Life'' and ``Family Guy,'' and on NBC,
``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Suddenly Susan'' may have worn out
their welcomes. (''Stark Raving Mad'' might also be in trouble
considering that the Top 10 sitcom manages to lose 21 percent of
its ``Frasier'' lead-in.)
</P>
<P>
   The loss of ``Freaks'' would be painful. It's as adventurous and
risky as they come, as funny and touching, and, if I can debate TV
Guide here _ it's the Best Show You're Not Watching. (Sorry,
``Sports Night.'')
</P>
<P>
   Based on the premise that teen-age life can be hell, the show
has routinely found ways to both celebrate and ridicule the
protagonists, beginning with the Weir family, which includes
Lindsay (Linda Cardellini), a book-smart girl who camouflages her
good looks by wearing oversized army jackets and hanging out with
the less academically oriented ``freaks'' who smoke pot on the
school patio.
</P>
<P>
   Her younger brother, Sam (John Francis Daley), is even more of a
basket case. He's scrawny and whiny and insecure, and his fear of
showering after gym class (remember those days?) only egged on his
tormentors, who found a way of forcing him to streak through the
halls naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks'' is filled with an assortment of other
down-on-their-luck characters who defy the usual TV caricatures,
namely the pouty pretty people who inhabit shows on similar
subjects, like the WB's interesting but far less effective
``Popular.'' (Which will probably be renewed.)
</P>
<P>
   To the producers, both stand-up comedians with pain at the heart
of their laughter, the main focus of ``Freaks'' isn't about getting
the girl or winning the big game, but surviving obstacles with a
sense of humor intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about sending people home happy,'' is how Apatow
explains it.
</P>
<P>
   Armchair Internet critics and the influential viewers who make
up Viewers for Quality Television (it ranked No. 14 on VQT's latest
quality survey, ahead of ``Friends,'' ``The Simpsons'' and ``Ally
McBeal'') have found much to like with the series' edgy
sensibility. But I don't see the kind of
cancel-it-and-we'll-kill-you backing afforded ``Sports Night'' last
season when ABC even hinted at axing the half-hour series.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if ``Sports Night'' has that same die-for-you backing
this season, I haven't seen it. That's because ``Sports Night,''
though still a better half-hour than most, has been wildly uneven
this season, due in part to its erratic writing (what a boob
they've made of Felicity Huffman's once-strong Dana) and
squandering golden opportunities, like William Macy's recurring
character, who appeared like a flash of greatness and, then,
nothing. (Is writer/producer Aaron Sorkin spending too much time
with his new beau, ``The West Wing?'')
</P>
<P>
   Joining ``Freaks'' and ``Sports Night'' on the bubble is
Jennifer Love Hewitt's drama ``Time of Your Life'' and ``Get
Real,'' which have been mired in the bottom tenth of shows since
their first batch of episodes. Maybe Hewitt's fans have given up on
her as a lead character, or perhaps they've simply found nothing to
like about a series where character development was an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   My theory is that ``Time of Your Life'' suffered tremendously
the day Fox asked creators Amy Lippman and Christopher Keyser to
shift the show's creative focus to better fit the quirkiness of
``Ally McBeal,'' which it precedes. There's nothing like packaging
to kill creativity. Suddenly, Hewitt became an annoying neurotic,
except without Calista Flockhart's strong cast support and David E.
Kelley's quaint writing.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Get Real,'' the family series where everyone spews pop
culture references while talking to the camera, it wouldn't have
returned if so many Fox shows hadn't failed to attract audiences.
With ``Party of Five'' ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and, maybe, ``The
X-Files,'' signing off this season, Fox will have to fill holes
left by shows with solid brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``Felicity'' and the WB. Fighting a
season-long ratings slump, the network is undergoing a major
schedule shakeup; the college drama moves to Wednesdays, into the
post-''Dawson's Creek'' slot, beginning April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting ``Felicity'' to Sunday proved a bigger disaster than
Keri Russell's haircut. This season the show is ranked 130th and
seen in an average of 2.4 million homes, down nearly a million from
last season when it aired on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the alien romantic thriller ``Roswell'' is headed for
Monday nights. But be warned: The WB plans to revamp this charming
little series by playing up the sci-fi angle and slowing down what
I liked best about the series: the complications of alien
socialization among us.
</P>
<P>
   But the WB figures it's got to do something. ``Roswell''
currently ranks 125th for the season, with an average viewership of
3.8 million. (The WB midseason reinforcements include the new drama
``D.C.,'' about young people working in the nation's capital, and
``Movie Stars,'' the resurrected comedy about a family headed by
actors.)
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, the WB is in negotiations to air the foamation
comedy ``The PJs,'' the Eddie Murphy-backed series about the
tenants of a black housing project that Fox left off the fall
schedule and now seems willing to relinquish altogether. (It makes
perfect sense, now that the WB has a half-hour hole to fill on its
Segregated Friday night slate of black-cast comedies. Would it kill
them to actually ``develop'' a project with people of color?)
</P>
<P>
   For ``Freaks,'' let's hope it's not three strikes and out. This
is the third ``launch'' of the series, jokes Apatow. ``Freaks'' was
off the air for three weeks after its second episode. It was then
on for three weeks and off for four. It was MIA during all of
February sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning Monday, ``Freaks'' will have an uninterrupted
eight-episode run. The episodes ``are hilarious and sweet and
brutal all at the same time,'' Apatow promises. There's even an
upside. ``We know that if we're canceled, these episodes will air
on Nickelodeon for the rest of our lives,'' Apatow says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we might as well make them special.''

 &HT;    News and notes from around NASCAR
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAKING HEADLINES
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING BACK: NASCAR too quick to call Vegas race: NASCAR did
the East Coast media and race winner a favor by calling the
CarsDirect.com 400 after 148 of 267 scheduled laps because of rainy
weather. The decision was made 3:15 p.m. local time at a track that
has lights for night racing. The premature ending disappointed many
track fans, who had spent a pile of casino chips for tickets.
Granted, the forecast wasn't encouraging, but weather changes
quickly in the desert. NASCAR hung around for 12 hours to get in
last March's Atlanta race under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Chevy drivers means happy fans: NASCAR knows it is always
in trouble when the Chevys aren't running among the leaders, which
led to this week's rule change for the Monte Carlos. The sport
flourished in the 1990s because of seven words: ``Jeff Gordon's
domination and Dale Earnhardt's reputation.'' Both drive Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD: Rainbow Warriors may finally see pot of gold: The
Atlanta race could not come at a better time for Jeff Gordon, who
has suffered a tough start to the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has enjoyed good luck at Atlanta, winning the Cracker
Barrel 500 in 1999. Another series of bad breaks by Gordon at
Atlanta Motor Speedway could cause panic for the No. 24 team.
</P>
<P>
   How 'bout a sunny afternoon? NASCAR's luck with weather
continues to take a free-fall. Daytona was windy and cool,
Rockingham dealt with threatening clouds and Las Vegas fans dealt
with a rain-shortened event. Weather for Sunday's race depends on
the timing of a front, forecast to move through the area Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   LEADERS OF THE PACK
</P>
<P>
   Rating some of the best Winston Cup crew chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   1. Todd Parrott: Robert Yates made a brilliant move teaming
Parrott with Dale Jarrett. The two have won two Daytona 500s and a
Winston Cup title. Parrott has followed in the footsteps of his
father, Buddy, as a proven crew chief who can direct race teams to
victories. Parrott was instrumental in building the original
``Rainbow Warriors'' pit crew. He's an obvious pick for the top
spot.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jimmy Makar: He doesn't grab headlines and operates with a
low-key demeanor like his driver, Bobby Labonte. Makar has been
with the Joe Gibbs team from the beginning, giving the 18 car a
legitimate chance to win this year's Winston Cup championship. He
is the best at understanding the driver's needs and making
adjustments. After starting at the back of the pack in Atlanta last
November, Makar made adjustments and Labonte eventually won the
race.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jimmy Fennig: Much of Mark Martin's success can be attributed
to Fennig. The two communicate well when they set up the No. 6
Taurus. The radio communication between them on race day shows that
they are on the same page while deciding how to keep the team in
front.
</P>
<P>
   4. Greg Zippadelli: Many are pointing to the Zippadelli-Tony
Stewart tandem as the next Ray Evernham-Jeff Gordon duo. That is
lofty company, but the Pontiac team enjoyed the best rookie season
of any driver in NASCAR history. A year ago, NASCAR car fans were
wondering who Zippadelli was. Now they know.
</P>
<P>
   5. Tommy Baldwin, Jr.: When rumors began to swirl about the
departure of Ray Evernham from Hendrick Motorsports, Baldwin's name
kept surfacing as the man to lead Jeff Gordon into the new century.
He was offered the job but declined, saying that he was seeing
progress with Bill Davis Racing and Ward Burton and wanted to be
part of their success. Burton had made it to third in the points
standings before struggling last week at Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Some strong performances from those who are making a move toward
the front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Johnny Benson: He bought his way out of his contract with the
No. 26 Roush team and it looks like he made a wise decision. His
No. 10 Pontiac led late in the Daytona 500 only to be worked over
by five Fords at the end. He backed up a good SpeedWeek with a
solid sixth place finish at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dale Earnhardt, Jr.: Most thought he would be good, but
Earnhardt Jr. ran up front most of the day at Las Vegas. He led 43
laps and was a legitimate threat to win.
</P>
<P>
   FREE FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   Some weak performances from those who appear headed to the back
of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hendrick Motorsports: The leader of the bow-tie brigade has
fallen on hard times early in 2000. Jeff Gordon has gone eight
consecutive races without a top-five finish. Terry Labonte is
waiting for the emergence of the 1996 magic between he and recently
reunited crew chief Gary DeHart. Jerry Nadeau's season has been
dismal. The road-racing ace is praying for Sears Point and Watkins
Glen to get here soon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gary Nelson: Nelson, NASCAR's series director, continues to
defend the belief in some corners that NASCAR racing has become
boring. While discussing the subject on Tuesday's ``NASCAR Live''
radio show, Nelson read endless statistics supporting the claim
that that the 2000 season is one of NASCAR's most competitive ever.
The fans aren't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   MARTIN Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who drives the No. 6 Ford Taurus in Winston Cup and
the No. 60 car in the Busch Series, is coming on strong after back
surgery during the off season. He has said that this year will be
his last in the Busch series, where he is the all-time leader with
41 victories. Here Martin talks with Cox News Service reporter Rick
Minter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After three weekends of driving in two divisions, how is your
back?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's real good. The pain is gone. It is still going to be
sort of a rebuilding process for probably the next year. It feels
great right now, and I'm able to do everything I could do and more,
than before I had the back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering all your success in the Busch Grand National
Series, why are you giving it up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm getting old, getting tired. They ask too much of you
nowadays. There are too many interviews, too much media, too many
fans, too many races, too many sponsor appearances. I can't do
everything. It used to be I could just drive one car and then drive
the other. Now, I have to do all these other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have been instrumental in getting Matt Kenseth a ride in
a Roush Racing Ford. What impressed you about Matt?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew where he came from and where he was racing. I knew he
was winning races in a lot of different cars, driving for a lot of
different people. That meant he knew how to make cars go, and he
wasn't relying on the teams. They didn't have enough depth to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the next Matt Kenseth?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I had the wherewithal, I'd have Casey Atwood under
contract. I forced Matt on Roush Racing, and if I was in charge I'd
have Casey, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people have said the Daytona 500 was a boring race. Do
you think it was, and what do you think of the new shock rules for
Talladega and Daytona?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just because nobody flipped doesn't mean it was boring. I
think the new shock rule is great. The reason I had a chance in
that race is because handling mattered. Handling has to matter for
it to be racing. I've been racing for 25 years, and handling has
always mattered everywhere, except Daytona and Talladega since we
started running restrictor plates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the pressures that led to your retirement from the Busch
series making you think about how long you want to stay in Winston
Cup?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not worried about it. I'm going to be competitive for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   QUEST FOR VICTORY:
</P>
<P>
   Drivers with more than 100 NASCAR Winston Cup starts still
trying for that elusive first victory.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Bill Elliott remains full of drive in year 25
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Feb. 29, 1976, Bill Elliott, his family and a few friends
from Dawsonville, Ga., showed up at Rockingham, N.C., with a
second-hand Ford Torino and a desire to become Winston Cup racers.
</P>
<P>
   Few people would have imagined that the skinny kid with the
bushy red hair and the syrupy Southern drawl one day would rule
Winston Cup racing. Or that he would still be a top competitor in
his 25th season.
</P>
<P>
   Even Elliott concedes that his success _ 40 victories, 49 poles,
the 1988 championship, a speed record and more than $21 million in
career earnings _ seemed unlikely on that first trip to ``the
Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a clue what we were doing,'' Elliott said. ``I
enjoyed working on the cars probably more than driving. Driving
became part of what I was doing, but I thoroughly enjoyed working
on the car. That was the biggest challenge _ working on the car and
making it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Elliott's latest challenges: Handling the flood of
speculation in recent weeks that he'll be switching to Dodge from
Ford next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll all come out in the wash on Friday,'' Elliott said
Wednesday when asked to comment on the rumors of the move to a new
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Everham, who left Jeff Gordon's garage last year to strike
out on his own with Dodge, plans a news conference Friday morning
to announce one of the two drivers for his Dodges next year.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is that Elliott will be the driver named to the
Evernham team.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Elliott's 25th season has been marked by early success.
He finished third at the Daytona 500 and chalked up a fourth-place
finish at the CarsDirect.com 400 at Las Vegas. Elliott ranks sixth
in the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's career began to blossom in 1977 after Roger Penske
decided to sell his Ford race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy bought all that stuff off Roger,'' Elliott said. ``That
was the turning point of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Equipped to compete, Elliott began to crack the top 10 on a
regular basis, and fellow driver Benny Parsons, now a TV analyst,
took an interest in his career. Together, they persuaded Michigan
businessman Harry Melling to back Elliott's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the experience, and when Harry started putting money
into it, we were able to put it all together,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   He finished second seven times in Melling's car before he got
his first victory, in the season-ending race of 1983 at Riverside,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Allison clinched the series title in that race. ``Bill had
worked so hard and done such a good job driving that him getting
his first win added an extra piece of pleasure to my winning the
championship that day,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Bill Elliot ruled Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Daytona 500 and 10 other races, including the Winston
500 at Talladega and Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway. In winning
three of the circuits four biggest races, he became the circuit's
first Winston Million winner.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 9 Ford stayed on a roll, winning the 1987 Daytona 500
and the 1988 championship and setting a qualifying mark of 212.809
mph at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   Success brought with it some difficult moments for Elliott, who
was content with being rather anonymous while growing up in the
remote Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can give me a shovel and I can dig a ditch and be just as
happy as I can be,'' he said. ``I tell people that when I retire,
I'm going to get me a pulpwooder's truck and a old chain saw and
hit the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   As the media pressure intensified, Elliott had to spend more
time in front of the microphone. He still avoids those moments as
much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not a high-profile kind of guy,'' Elliott said.
``It's not that I don't want to talk. I'm just uncomfortable doing
it, so I just shy away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he does speak, fans respond. For 14 of the past 16
years, he has been voted the circuit's most-popular driver. Elliott
said he plans to give those fans more to cheer about than they've
had the last few years. His last victory in a points event came in
the 1994 Southern 500 at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in racing _ and in his race teams _ have hampered his
career in recent years, he said. But Elliott now believes he has
the right combination to win races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a great career, if it ends tomorrow,'' Elliott said.
``But I still love driving a race car and I plan to do it for
several _ make that numerous _ more years.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain said Thursday that he was
``suspending'' his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination. But he stopped short of endorsing his rival, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, and vowed to continue his fight for party
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we began this campaign that we faced a difficult
challenge,'' McCain said at an outdoor news conference where the
desert wind whipped through the air. ``Last Tuesday, that challenge
became considerably more difficult as a majority of Republican
voters made clear their preference for president is Governor
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's noon announcement came two days after his staggering
losses in the major primaries on Super Tuesday. McCain took most of
the New England states at stake, but he lost the important
battlegrounds of California and New York to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain simply congratulated Bush Thursday, saying ``he deserves
the best wishes of every American.'' But he did not say that he
planned to release his delegates _ 224, to date _ and he even
stopped short of offering the outright declaration that Bush would
definitely become the next president: ``He may very well become the
next president of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Colorado rally following McCain's announcement, Bush
acknowledged the strong run that his rival had given him. ``I know
the competition has made me a better candidate,'' Bush said as his
supporters cheered. ``I know the competition will help us win the
White House come November.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush quickly turned his attention to the issues of military
spending and tax cuts, firing shot after shot at Vice President Al
Gore, the expected Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Gore's major rival, announced an hour before
McCain's news conference that he had halted his campaign for the
Democratic Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McCain nor Bradley signaled a willingness to make a
presidential bid on an independent ticket, as some supporters of
each of the underdogs hoped they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my party,'' McCain said. ``It is my home. Ours is the
party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan. That's good company for any
American to keep, and it is a distinct privilege to serve the same
cause that those great Americans dedicated their lives to.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, McCain had said that his party loyalty
was manifested in his quest to reform its workings. It was this
very image of an establishment outsider that propelled the senator
to unexpected popularity. He used Thursday's news conference to
emphasize his reform message, vowing that he would ``never walk
away from a fight'' and drawing wild whoops and thunderous applause
from his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped that our campaign would be a force for change in the
Republican Party,'' he said, ``and I indeed feel we've set a course
that will ultimately prevail in making our party as big as the
country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, McCain lashed out at Bush for appealing
to the most conservative factions of the Republican Party. Bush
drew much of his primary votes from the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   By not releasing his delegates, McCain is trying to ensure that
he will have a prominent voice at this summer's Republican
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Anticipating McCain's concession, a few of Bush's supporters in
the Senate reached out to the senator's allies on Wednesday in the
hope of healing any rift between the two Republicans and uniting
the party.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of McCain said that Kenneth Duberstein, a former
White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan, and Sen.
Charles Hagel of Nebraska were relaying word to Bush's allies that
the governor had to take the initial step to heal the breach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that Governor Bush is going to need Senator
McCain, not just for John McCain, but for who and what John McCain
represents,'' Hagel said. ``He represents reform as much as any one
dynamic of who McCain is. John McCain is going to want to have a
voice in helping shape a reform agenda in the Republican Party as
we go into the election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them will have to have a conversation about this
and about campaign finance's priority on a Bush agenda. What I'm
saying is that a reform agenda will have to be there for McCain to
get enthusiastically engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel emphasized that while he and McCain had talked several
times a day for the past several days, they had not discussed
whether McCain's support for Bush would be conditioned on his
stance toward an overhaul of the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush triumphed over McCain on Tuesday from coast to coast
except in New England, he will go into the general election in a
less commanding position than Gore because he had to turn to the
Republican Party's most conservative elements to defeat his rival.
That has carried a political cost.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's victory in the critical general election state of
California, for example, exit polls showed that Bush's victory
depended on Republicans. He ran far behind both Gore and McCain
among such critical swing groups as independents and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   A joint front with McCain could help him repair some of the
damage and draw to his side the legions of new voters that McCain
drew into the primaries. But several aides or advisers to Bush said
that the Texas governor was not offering specific changes in his
position on overhauling campaign finance regulations simply to
placate McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the conservative allies that used direct mail and
telephone banks to help Bush defeat McCain did so in large part
because they oppose McCain's campaign finance proposals, which they
believe would cut their own abilities to influence elections and
the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, Bush balked when Gore pledged to swear off
unlimited donations to political parties so long as Bush did.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN, Bush noted Gore's widely criticized
actions in raising money for the Democratic Party in 1996 and said
that Gore should enter into a debate over such campaign funds with
President Clinton, a reference to recent news reports that Clinton
has been busily raising such cash for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such partisan finger-pointing did not deter McCain from
passionately railing on the overall issue of campaign reform
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your help, my fellow Americans,'' he said, ``we will keep
trying to force open doors where there are walls to your full
participation in the great enterprises of our democracy, be they
walls of cynicism or intolerance or walls raised by self-interested
elite who would exclude your voice from the highest councils of our
government.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably cooler air will surge across the Northeastern states
Friday in the wake of a cold front, bringing the unseasonable
warmth of the past several days to an abrupt end. Readings in many
locations across the East will be as much as 30 degrees colder than
they were during the afternoon Thursday. To the south, showers will
develop in the Carolinas along the trailing end of the same front.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Mississippi Valley, an area of low pressure will
strengthen as the day progresses, leading to patches of rain. With
breezes out of the Gulf of Mexico increasing, some locations in the
northern Gulf Coast states will receive as much as two inches of
rain with locally heavier amounts possible. Some localized flooding
will occur, especially in poor drainage locations. Meanwhile,
showers will also extend into the south-central Plains on the
northern edge of this system.
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers are likely on the high plains of western Kansas and
eastern Colorado Friday as winds veer and rise up the sloping
terrain. Low clouds will also be found in this region as
temperatures struggle to rise out of the 30s. Scattered snow
showers are also likely farther to the north in the mountains of
Colorado and southern Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   An area of high pressure will move across southern Nevada
Friday, bringing abundant sunshine to much of southern California
and the deserts of the Southwest. Meanwhile, rain will spread
toward the Pacific Northwest coast as a cold front moves ashore.
Snow will develop in the Cascades later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dust In The Wind
</P>
<P>
   The sky often clears following the passage of a cold front, but,
for several hours on Wednesday, the sky turned a pale brown in
parts of Iowa in the wake of a front. The darkened skies were the
result of suspended dust several thousand feet above the ground.
The dust particles originated in the southern plains, where, on
Tuesday, strong winds from the west picked up dirt over the
region's parched soil. Not infrequently, dust from the Sahara
desert in Africa travels several thousand miles across the
Atlantic, dimming the cerulean skies over the Caribbean islands.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: McCain, Bradley bow out

<P>
   CHALLENGERS SHEATHE THEIR SWORDS
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley and John McCain formally announced today they're no
longer presidential candidates. Bradley's comments, in West Orange,
N.J., retained traces of his campaign fight, but he said he'll
support Al Gore. McCain, in Sedona, Ariz., stopped short of a
complete surrender, saying he'll reflect on what he can do to best
serve the country. He wished George Bush well, but did not endorse
him.
</P>
<P>
   FULL BORE ON GORE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, in Colorado today, thanked his vanquished GOP
rival and immediately turned his fire on Al Gore, accusing him of
inconsistencies in his approach to campaign finance reform. Bush
criticized Gore for talking about eliminating unregulated ``soft
money'' in election campaigns while at the same time planning to
headline party efforts to raise millions in soft money for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK WEB SITE UPDATES
</P>
<P>
   As they ended their campaigns, Bill Bradley and John McCain were
quick to send the news out over cyberspace. Bradley's Web page gave
the news straight, telling visitors in big, bold letters that he
had withdrawn from the presidential race. And Bradley quickly
e-mailed supporters to thank them for their hard work. McCain's Web
page was a little more subtle. The letters were smaller, but the
message was the same. And gone was the pop-up window asking
visitors to donate money.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. BUSH GRACIOUS TO ALL
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush congratulated her husband's opponents _ on both sides
of the isle. ``Of course I want to say congratulations (to the
McCains) on a hard-fought campaign,'' she told ABC. ``I think
</P>
<P>
   Senator McCain brought a lot of ideas to the table that will
continue to be discussed. And I think that's important.'' Laura
Bush also congratulated the Gores. ``I think they ran a great race.
Looks like they won everything ... and I think that's terrific for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TEMPLE OF DOOM?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is hoping to ride the nation's prosperity to the White
House, but he faces eight months of questions about impoverished
Buddhist monks and nuns who contributed more than $100,000 to his
1996 campaign. And laying out what is likely to become a campaign
theme, George W. Bush said America is ready to end the Clinton-Gore
administration. ``Americans want someone who will restore honor and
dignity to the White House,'' he told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   OR, MAYBE, ALAN GREENSPAN SHOULD BE RUNNING?
</P>
<P>
   By 46 percent to 44 percent, Americans say George W. Bush is
``more likely to continue the nation's economic expansion'' than Al
Gore, according to a new USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll. The poll had a
3 percentage point margin of error, which means the candidates are
in a statistical tie on that question.
</P>
<P>
   KISS AND MAKE UP, THEN TIE THE KNOT?
</P>
<P>
   Some of John McCain's closest advisers have begun pushing him as
George W. Bush's running mate, a political alliance that would
require delicate fence-mending in the aftermath of their bitter
primary fight. McCain has said he would not consider the vice
presidency, but Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford, two South
Carolina Republicans who counseled McCain through his primary
contests, said they would urge McCain to consider taking the No. 2
spot.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE GROUND ON THE BATTLEGROUND
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore, party nominations assured, are
reaching out to John McCain's independent-minded primary voters,
each determined to capture the middle ground. In California, where
candidates were ranked by all voters on a single ballot, McCain
finished third overall to Gore and Bush, but was the top
vote-getter among independents. Gore is moving quickly to stake out
the high ground on campaign finance reform, saying he would make it
a campaign priority. That's a major McCain position, and a subject
on which Gore himself is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   AND THE BATTLE GROUND MEANS MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Once the most cash-flush presidential candidate in history,
George W. Bush is embarking on a campaign to replenish his coffers
with another $10 million after taking in just $2.8 million in
February _ less than one-third of the $10 million John McCain
raised during the month. Bush now has raised more than $73 million,
a record. And Al Gore, who unlike Bush is subject to federal
spending limits, plans to raise an additional $4 million to
supplement some $7 million in unspent taxpayer funds for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T FORGET KEYES _ HE'S STILL IN IT
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes has been quiet about it, but some aides say they
expect him to remain in the GOP presidential race. But his schedule
will be pared back dramatically. He's spending today at home in
Maryland before going to Utah and Oklahoma for the rest of the
week. That trip is followed by eight days off, and then,
presumably, a light, sporadic schedule for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEN, THERE'S ALWAYS ROSS PEROT
</P>
<P>
   Now that the dust has settled in the major party fights, Reform
Party activists are stepping up their calls to persuade Ross Perot
to make a third try for the White House. The Dallas Morning News
reports that while discussion about recruiting John McCain is
``mostly talk, a push to recruit Perot for a third run will
intensify.'' Supporters are said to be sending postcards to Larry
King, urging him to invite Perot on his show, where he launched his
1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   FCC LOOKING AT THOSE WILY ADS
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is investigating
Republicans for Clean Air, a group backed by Texas entrepreneurs
that began running ads last week touting George W. Bush's
environmental record and slamming John McCain's. It initially was
unclear who was behind the group or who paid for the ads until Sam
Wyly, a Dallas software magnate and longtime Bush supporter,
stepped forward last Friday to take the credit. McCain's campaign
complained to the FCC _ and the Federal Election Commission as well
_ arguing that the ads should have indicated they actually were
funded by Wyly and his brother, Charles. At least one commissioner,
Gloria Tristani, suggested she might agree.
</P>
<P>
   NOT A SEXUAL ISSUE, JUST MARCHING FOR PEACE
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton was confronted at a meeting of a homosexual
Democratic group in Greenwich Village by two hecklers who demanded
to know why she plans to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade,
which excludes gay marchers. She asked the pair, a man and a woman,
to please allow her to finish her remarks first. The hecklers
allowed her to proceed. So why will she march in the parade? She
said because of her interest in supporting the Irish peace process,
a cause she and President Clinton have been involved in for the
last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE AND ON TRACK
</P>
<P>
   More than 17,000 Democrats in Arizona cast ballots through the
Internet in the first two days of a primary billed as the first
binding online election. By the end of Tuesday, more than 13,000
Democrats had voted online, officials said, but the rate fell
Wednesday, after news that Bill Bradley would drop out of the race.
Arizona Democrats with Internet access can cast ballots through
Friday, at any time of day, and those without access can vote at
polling places Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   NICE AND RELAXED IN THE ISLANDS
</P>
<P>
   The final results of Tuesday's Hawaii Democratic caucuses won't
be ready until early next week. Some districts on islands beyond
Oahu are having trouble compiling their numbers and sending them to
party headquarters in Honolulu, a party official said. The numbers
should arrive by Friday and be compiled by Monday. According to
preliminary figures compiled at midnight Wednesday, Al Gore won
nearly all of Hawaii's 14 delegates to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   EMBATTLED D.A. IN ANOTHER RUNOFF
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, under fire for his
handling of the city's unfolding police corruption scandal, has
been forced into a November runoff election against one of his top
deputies. With about half of the vote counted, Garcetti led two
challengers with 39 percent, far short of the majority needed to
win a third term outright. Steve Cooley, a veteran deputy D.A. who
heads Garcetti's welfare fraud unit, had 37 percent. Garcetti was
forced into a runoff four years ago, too, after failing to win a
conviction against O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   RESHAPING A STATE
</P>
<P>
   A Republican candidate for governor of West Virginia wants to
help shape his state, but Joseph Oliverio wants to do it by lopping
off the Eastern Panhandle. He thinks a sale to Virginia or Maryland
could bring the state $20 billion for much-needed infrastructure
projects _ and do those three counties a favor at the same time.
``We just abuse these three counties. ... We take their tax money
and then show up every four years saying, `Vote for me!' They
deserve better.''

`MR. SPACEMAN': HANG AROUND WITH EARTHLINGS AT YOUR OWN RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hero of Robert Olen Butler's new novel is nicer than Garry
Shandling's womanizer from outer space, calmer than Robin Williams'
Mork, and more conflicted than Steven Spielberg's E.T. As aliens
go, he's a pretty regular guy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plot of ``Mr. Spaceman,'' it sounds as if it came
straight from the pages of The National Enquirer: An alien, charged
by his superiors with learning the ways of earthlings, marries a
woman from a small town in Alabama, abducts a busload of tourists
and debriefs them aboard his spaceship in an effort to prepare
himself for a millennial appearance on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   It is a testament to Butler's gifts as a writer that he has
fashioned from such cartoonish materials a novel of surprising
poignance. Although the story is marred by silly, forced
comparisons between the spaceman and the Messiah, it gains in
resonance as it moves along, to emerge as one of Butler's most
convincing performances yet: a work as amusingly quirky as his 1996
collection ``Tabloid Dreams'' and as affecting, in its quixotic
fashion, as his award-winning 1992 book ``A Good Scent From a
Strange Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Spaceman'' begins pretty much where a story in ``Tabloid
Dreams'' titled ``Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover'' left off. Desi,
a ``wiggly hairless shy courteous smart-as-a-whip'' alien, has
returned to Earth to fetch his humanoid beloved, a hairdresser
named Edna Bradshaw, and the two have blissfully set up
housekeeping aboard his spaceship. He loves her for being a
blabbermouth, for blurting out her every whim and thought. She
loves him for his sweetness, his earnest desire to understand the
human species and his fumbling, Ricky Ricardo way with American
words.
</P>
<P>
   Desi and Edna are playing host to 12 humans who were on their
way to a casino when Desi beamed their tour bus up to his ship.
Having watched plenty of television over the years, Desi does his
best to fashion a greeting that will welcome his guests and put
them at ease. ``Hi,'' he says. ``My name is Desi. I am a friendly
guy. There is a Kind of Hush All Over the World Tonight. I Would
Like to Teach the World to Sing. I Would Like to Buy the World a
Coke.'' Despite his best efforts to charm his visitors, Desi is
secretly troubled. For decades he has been observing and
interviewing earthlings, trying to make sense of their species'
peculiar ways, but he knows now that the research phase of his work
is ending. It is already Dec. 30, 2000, and in a matter of hours he
must descend to Earth and make himself known _ he is under orders
from his superiors to inform earthlings that they are not alone in
the cosmos _ no matter what the personal consequences of such an
announcement might be.
</P>
<P>
   Edna, understandably, fears for his safety, and Desi, despite
his species' serene rationality, finds himself becoming
increasingly anxious, too. In fact in recent days he has found
himself developing strangely human traits: for the first time in
his life, he has begun having dreams _ nightmares, really _ when he
goes to sleep, and he has begun to suffer, as all humans do, from
inchoate feelings of yearning and loss.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, whose earlier books have often demonstrated a taste for
portentous philosophizing, tends to harp, annoyingly, on the
abstract qualities that make human beings human, and he also tends
to dwell, annoyingly, on the qualities that make Desi seem
Christlike. He suggests that the 12 tour bus visitors will become
Desi's disciples and describes the home-cooked meal Edna serves the
guests as Desi's ``last supper.''
</P>
<P>
   When these matters are allowed to recede into the background,
and Butler simply focuses on the sad-funny exchanges between his
characters, the results are more persuasive. Desi undergoes a kind
of mind meld with each of his visitors, which gives them all a
chance to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   There's Judith Marie Nash, daughter of a born-again minister,
who believes _ or wants to believe _ that Desi is ``Jesus come
again.'' There's Hudson Smith, a black lawyer who mocks his
father's belief in the American dream, even as he realizes that his
own success stems from his father's faith. There's a Vietnamese
refugee named Lucky who loves to gamble, figuring that if you lose
as big a thing as your country, ``the great cosmic odds'' are that
you're due to win something equally large. There's Arthur
Stackhouse, a World War II veteran, who remains haunted by the
atomic test he once witnessed in the Nevada desert.
</P>
<P>
   In telling these people's stories Butler draws upon the same
gifts of empathy and insight, the same ability to limn an entire
life in a couple of pages, that he used to give his portraits of
Vietnamese immigrants in ``A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain''
such tenderness and power.
</P>
<P>
   As for Desi, Butler has managed to make him odd enough to seem
genuinely ... uh, alien while at the same time endowing him with
the melancholy sense of dislocation that afflicts so many of his
earlier heroes. In relating Desi's encounters with a human world
that's both in thrall to a tabloid culture of quick money and in
search of some kind of spiritual redemption, he has written a
pseudo-sci-fi novel that is at once funny and humane, entertaining
and touching.

`MIDNIGHT': AFTER PERSONAL DARKNESS A MILLENNIAL DAWN IN RIO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ``Midnight'' takes place in Rio de Janeiro in the recent past _
about 10 weeks ago, to be precise. Its story begins on the morning
of Dec. 30, 1999, and concludes two days later, in the bright dawn
of a new millennium, with the world looking pretty much the same as
it did before, which, given that the final scene takes place on one
of Rio's spectacular white sand beaches, is not too shabby.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers, Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas, capture some
of Rio's less lovely realities as well. In tracing the crossing
paths of characters drawn from Brazil's middle class and from its
criminal underworld, their camera captures the homelessness,
poverty and corruption that plague Brazilian society.
</P>
<P>
   But like ``Central Station,'' Salles' previous film,
``Midnight'' finds occasions for hope in the midst of general
unhappiness. Its mood, at once mournful and exuberant, owes
something to the spirit of samba, Rio's great contribution to world
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midnight'' is a modest, somewhat sentimental film whose appeal
may lie as much in its evocative location as in the story it tells.
Its best sequence is a long, slow chase through the winding
alleyways of a favela, one of the crowded shantytowns that cling to
the hillsides above the bay.
</P>
<P>
   There are also spectacular rooftop shots that are like gritty
postcards of the blue ocean and metastasizing slums spread out
under the beneficent arms of a giant white statue of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Central Station,'' ``Midnight'` is about an unlikely
encounter between two incongruous characters _ in this case a
relatively affluent woman who makes her living helping others and a
representative of the urban demimonde. Maria (Fernanda Torres), a
speech tutor for the deaf, lives in a comfortable high-rise
apartment with her lover, Pedro (Carlos Vereza), a saturnine
intellectual who, on the last day of the century, abruptly abandons
her.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown into despair, she decides to hurl herself from the roof
of her building, which is where she meets Joao (Luiz Carlos
Vasconcelos), a convict who has been clandestinely released from
prison to kill his old friend Chico (Mateus Nachtergaele), a petty
hoodlum and police snitch.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vasconcelos and Torres are as unstintingly lugubrious as
they are beautiful to look at, and the film's pulse is supplied by
Nachtergaele, whose jittery, streetwise energy recalls a young
James Cagney. He is assisted by some deft hand-held-camera work and
beautiful color cinematography as well as by the natural vibrancy
of Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic meeting of Joao and Maria _ she's virtually naked,
he's just out of prison and fireworks are going off all around
them, so you kind of know what's coming _ feels more like the
playing out of a narrative conceit than a plausible event in the
lives of two people.
</P>
<P>
   It's as trumped-up and artificial as the idea that a
happenstance of the calendar is a major event in history. In
attempting to debunk the notion that the passing of the millennium
is an event of apocalyptic significance, ``Midnight'' gives the
notion more credence than it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   But when it forgoes this kind of grandiosity in favor of close
attention to its characters and setting, ``Midnight'' is an
interesting, occasionally touching film. &QL;

`RENDEZ-VOUS WITH FRENCH CINEMA': A TASTING MENU OF GALLIC CINEMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This replaces NUIT-FILM-REVIEW)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No actress in the world is able to project more
emotion through a mask of immobility than Catherine Deneuve, the
enduring French star who gives one of her deepest screen
performances in Philippe Garrel's film ``Le Vent de la Nuit''
(``Night Wind'').
</P>
<P>
   This beautiful but sad-hearted movie, a high point of the Film
Society of Lincoln Center's annual ``Rendez-Vous With French
Cinema'' series, is a meditation on the relentless passage of time
and the suicidal impulses of two diehard romantics who refuse to
accept life's inevitable changes.
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve is Helene, a wealthy married woman from old money who is
desperately in love with Paul (Xavier Beauvois), a feckless young
sculptor of no particular charm. As Paul's commitment to Helene
wavers, she becomes increasingly agitated and possessive.
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve registers Helene's panic and frustration in minute but
telling changes of expression and vocal tone: a mouth that almost
imperceptibly tightens, eyes that brim with squeezed-back tears and
a voice that involuntarily clenches. Even when Helene finally
cracks and commits a desperate act, she maintains her formidable
reserve. Yet somehow Deneuve subtly registers every emotion
seething behind Helene's impenetrable surface.
</P>
<P>
   An irony at the heart of the movie is that Deneuve's towering
stature in French cinema is owed in part to her ageless beauty.
Time has not passed her by, the way it has passed her character by.
Helene eventually meets her doomed male counterpart, Serge (Daniel
Duval), a gaunt, taciturn architect and onetime political
revolutionary who is Paul's artistic mentor.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul and Serge drive from Positano to Paris to Berlin, we
glimpse an immaculate, economically robust Europe. Yet Serge, like
Helene, is unable to accept the present and remains obsessed with
self-destruction for reasons that are never totally specified.
</P>
<P>
   One of the remarkable things about the movie is the way it
withholds evaluation. Instead of casting a psychoanalytically
knowing gaze on these unhappy middle-aged people, it prefers to
paint them as romantic heroes. Yes, they may be fools, but they are
also the ravaged survivors of a nobler, more authentic era.
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve's neurotic, despairing Helene is only one of many
powerful female performances in this season's ``Rendez-Vous,''
which opens Friday at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center
and runs through March 19.
</P>
<P>
   If this year's series were to be summed up in one phrase, it
might be the Year of the Woman. Although women have always been
held in much higher regard by the French cinema than by Hollywood,
a majority of the strongest entries in the 16-film series are by
and about women.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects range from children to teen-agers to the
middle-aged. ``Le Vent de la Nuit,'' incidentally, is not the only
movie to feature Deneuve, who also stars in Gabriel Aghion's much
more conventional screwball comedy, ``Belle Maman''(``Beautiful
Mother'').
</P>
<P>
   Another high point of the series is Daniele Thompson's
warm-hearted ensemble film, ``La Buche,'' (``Yule Log'') which was
a big hit in France. Making her directorial debut, Thompson, a
screenwriter who collaborated with Patrice Chereau on his films
``Queen Margot'' and ``Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train,'' has
created a rich, tasty plum pudding of a movie about the members of
an extended Parisian family uneasily gathering together at
Christmas after the death of their mother's second husband.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this Gallic answer to ``Home for the Holidays''
are three sisters: Louba (Sabine Azema), a nightclub singer of
Russian folk songs whose long affair with a married man has reached
a critical turning point; Sonia (Emmanuelle Beart), a beautiful,
affluent superwoman whose picture-perfect marriage is on the rocks;
and Milla (Charlotte Gainsbourg), their sullen, rebellious younger
sister.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond capturing the mixture of melancholy, anxiety and
exhilaration that the holiday season brings to most of us, this
tour de force of ensemble acting offers incisive but compassionate
portraits of more than half a dozen complex characters whose lives
are all in rapid flux.
</P>
<P>
   A riskier, more volatile group portrait, Noemie Lvovsky's film
``La Vie Ne Me Fait Pas Peur'' (``I'm Not Afraid of Life''),
examines the frenetic childhood and adolescence of a clique of four
girls growing up in the 1970s and early '80s. The movie dives
headlong into the spirit of childhood, capturing as few movies have
done the raw, untamed energy of girls passing through the tomboy
stage of pre-pubescence into a turbulent, boy-crazy adolescence of
fly-by-night fads and crazy, momentary obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   The movie plunges us into the rough-and-tumble physical and
emotional chaos of youth with all its embarrassingly uncontrollable
emotions amped up high. While the movie doesn't sort out its
characters' histories as carefully as it might, it takes huge
risks, including staging its characters' fantasies in
candy-colored, costumed musical sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Solveig Anspach's ``Haut les Coeurs!'' (``Chin Up!'') and Pascal
Thomas' ``Dilettante,'' by contrast, are carefully drawn,
compelling portraits of individual women. ``Haut les Coeurs!'' is a
finely acted, clinically detailed portrait of Emma, a pregnant
30-year-old musician (beautifully played by Karin Viard) who is
found to have breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Advised by one doctor to abort her four-month-old fetus lest it
be deformed by chemotherapy, she resists and arranges with another,
more caring doctor to bear the child prematurely (by Caesarean
section) at the same time she undergoes a mastectomy. The movie is
acutely attuned to the doctor-patient relationship and the
wrenching medical choices a cancer patient must make.
</P>
<P>
   Viard's compelling performance takes us on an emotional roller
coaster whose moods run from a wild and scary defiance to abject
terror and self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In ``La Dilettante,'' Catherine Frot gives a masterly,
sympathetic portrait of a perplexing character, a 40-something
woman with two grown children who impulsively returns to Paris from
Switzerland, where she has been living, to start a new life. Her
character, Pierrette, is a sophisticated charmer who has never
taken life all that seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Even when she lands in prison after helping an unscrupulous
antiques dealer buy a valuable heirloom at bargain prices, she
maintains a blithe detachment. While some might describe Pierrette
as having psychopathic tendencies, others would laud her as a free
spirit. The movie withholds any judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Puce'' and ``Les Vacances'' (``Holidays''), two short films
by Emmanuelle Bercot playing together, both feature remarkable
performances by Isild Le Besco, a young actress who captures the
impish brashness of early adolescent sexuality with an astonishing
naturalness.
</P>
<P>
   In ``La Puce,'' by far the more substantial of the two, she is a
virginal but curious 14-year-old girl who allows herself to be
seduced by a man more than twice her age. Every slippery nuance of
a power game that ends in what would be called statutory rape in
the United States rings nastily true.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every film in the series is so directly concerned
with female experience. ``Ma Petite Entreprise'' (``My Little
Business''), which opens the 10-day festival Friday, is a
skillfully plotted caper about a law-abiding woodworker forced to
concoct an elaborate insurance scam after his workshop is destroyed
by fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Enfants du Marais'' (``The Children of the Marshland'') is
similarly lighthearted. A nostalgic valentine to life in rural
France between the two world wars, it is peopled with lovable
eccentrics.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Klapisch's millennial science-fiction comedy
``Peut-Etre'' (``Perhaps'') stars a wizened but still charming
Jean-Paul Belmondo as a futuristic patriarch who encounters his
father as a young man during a New Year's Eve time warp and begs
him to impregnate his girlfriend so that he can be born. The
imaginatively designed right-to-life fable portrays Paris in the
not-too-distant future as half-buried in desert sand.
</P>
<P>
   In Benoit Jacquot's ``Pas de Scandale'' (``Keep It Quiet''),
Fabrice Luchini plays a corrupt corporate buccaneer recently
discharged from prison whose mysterious conversion from crook to
childlike truth-teller upsets his family and associates upon his
return. The movie, which features Isabelle Huppert as his grimly
proper wife, takes a heavy-handed swipe at upper-middle-class
social hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peau d'Homme, Coeur de Bete'' (``Skin of Man, Heart of
Beast''), the feature film debut of Helene Angel, portrays another
return. A man who left home 15 years ago under mysterious
circumstances comes back to the fold and disturbs the family's
psychological chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like misty-eyed love stories, there's Francois
Dupeyron's ``C'est Quoi la Vie?'' (``What's Life?''), a kind of
back-to-nature answer to Claude Lelouche's make-out classic, ``A
Man and a Woman.'' In this variation, a handsome young farmer (Eric
Caravaca) and a reclusive opera singer (Isabelle Renauld) find
happiness in a small farm in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Createur'' (``The Creator''), an outrageous satire of the
self-centered artist, stars Albert Dupontel, an actor, writer and
director who at times suggests a Gallic Peter Sellers, as a
playwright whose monumental writer's block can be breached only by
acts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Claude Berri's ``Debandade,'' France's first
Viagra comedy. In casting himself as a dilapidated over-60 art
dealer who discovers the joys of the sexual wonder drug, Berri
certainly displays courage in portraying late-middle-aged sexual
activity. That doesn't make the spectacle of Berri pawing and
kissing a woman less than half his age especially appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   If this year's ``Rendez-Vous'' series isn't quite as strong or
as sensational as last year's (which introduced Catherine
Breillat's ``Romance,'' with its hard-core erotic sequences), it
still displays a level-headed humanity that one doesn't find in
American films, with their mixture of gadgetry and market-tested
emotional string-pulling. One of the keys to that humanity is the
assumption that women's lives are as important as men's. That sense
of sexual balance makes all the difference. &QL;

&HT;     THE EXIT STRATEGY  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In any war, political or military, a good general
has an exit strategy to save face in case his grand vision of
victory doesn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill Bradley, that was easy; with no primary victories, he
had no choice but to pull out of the Democratic presidential
contest. He made brave noises about continuing to talk up issues
that are important to him but he has lost his public megaphone and
will have trouble being heard from now on.
</P>
<P>
   For Sen. John McCain, there are more options. He suspended his
campaign, but he is in a strong position to remain a force for
reform in the Republican Party. He did not detail his full exit
strategy, which is bound to be complicated _ balancing partisan
loyalty with a continuing crusade to change the GOP and the
campaign process. He said he would not take the third-party route.
</P>
<P>
   Both men insisted they would never, ever accept the vice
presidential nomination, recoiling from the notion in horror. To
hear them tell it, being second banana to Vice President Al Gore or
Gov. George W. Bush has about as much appeal as a pit full of
alligators.
</P>
<P>
   They could in the end change their minds, as other losers have
done once their own presidential hopes are thoroughly dashed.
Lyndon Johnson, for instance, swore he would never take the second
spot right up to the moment John F. Kennedy asked him to do so. In
any case, there is no sign that Gore and Bush plan to tap their
defeated rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley brings no additional political strength to a Gore
ticket, and McCain doesn't fit Bush's oft-repeated ideal of a
running mate as ``someone who likes me.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain's speech was conciliatory in tone, he was
noticeably unenthusiastic about the future Republican nominee. He
wished Bush well but did not endorse him or even suggest that he
meant to support his candidacy in more than a superficial way.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's potential for stirring up trouble gives him
considerable political leverage to demand things of Bush in the
name of party unity. The question is how much he wants, and what
Bush is prepared to give. If I were Bush, I'd give a lot, short of
selling my soul.
</P>
<P>
   Defeated candidates with a following who are not brought
promptly back into the fold can greatly undermine the winner's
future _ and help their own political standing. After losing the
GOP primaries to President Ford in 1976, Ronald Reagan pretty much
sat on his hands during the campaign and contributed to Ford's
defeat by Jimmy Carter. Then Reagan picked up the mantle four years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cannot win the White House unless he can attract a large
chunk of the moderate and independent voters who preferred McCain.
Nearly 20 percent of McCain voters polled during Tuesday's election
said that if the senator were not the nominee, they would support
Gore over Bush and only 10 percent said they would jump to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At this early stage, McCain is apparently thinking only in terms
of somehow pursing his campaign reform agenda in the Senate and at
this summer's GOP convention. His power as Senate Commerce
Committee chairman will be helpful there.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush and the Republican establishment oppose the central
legislative changes he wants to make, it is difficult to see how
they can successfully co-opt McCain. But the GOP will have to try.
He may have lost the election but he now belongs in the pantheon of
800- pound political gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee for the Study of the American Electorate (CSAE), a
nonpartisan research organization, reports that McCain was solely
responsible for a surge in GOP turnout on Super Tuesday. He
galvanized both supporters outside his party who crossed over to
help him and opponents within who wanted to stop him. Many of his
voters were independents more liberal on social issues than
traditional Republicans. Roughly one third of the electorate is
firmly Democratic, one third Republican and the rest independent _
the urgent target of both general election candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, CSAE director, notes that Republican Party turnout
was the highest since Sen. Barry Goldwater ran in 1964,
inaugurating the party's lurch to the right. It rose 4.3 percentage
points to a level of 13.6 percent of the eligible electorate.
Democratic turnout, by contrast, was low, at 10.1 percent. ``McCain
stole any semblance of interest and contest from the Democratic
race,'' Gans said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gans doesn't predict what might happen in the general
election without McCain. Sustaining voter excitement is now up to
the two philosophically opposed candidates, the issues they develop
and the tightness of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Will Gore and Bush sharpen their differences or move
simultaneously to the mushy middle? Gore is stuck with the Clinton
administration (Bush constantly refers to the Clinton-Gore years),
but if Gore can keep the focus on the economy rather than the
scandals, he may transcend that guilt by association. Bush is stuck
with Pat Robertson, who has his shoes on backward marching
resolutely into the past, but Bush's own record is milder and more
acceptable to the mainstream, and he may overcome that association
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The mushy middle may be boring, but it is safe. It doesn't scare
folks. Tilting too far one way or the other can create a backlash,
as McCain discovered.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy was a surprise blockbuster. What will he do
for an encore? You can bet there will be one.

 &HT;    Latin America, Europe may be part of Home Depot's expansion
plans
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot is on the verge of announcing more details
about its international expansion, an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   The news may include one of several possibilities in Latin
America or Europe, said Wayne Hood of Prudential Securities. The
Atlanta-based home improvement retailer has been talking with
Wal-Mart Stores about acquiring Sam's Club sites in Argentina for
its previously announced expansion in Buenos Aires, Hood said. Home
Depot reportedly is looking to buy at least three Sam's Clubs for
about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Home Depot nor Wal-Mart would comment on a possible
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would help Home Depot meet its goal to open four
or five stores this year in Argentina. The retailer has four stores
in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible announcement could confirm speculation that
Home Depot is lining up an entry into Europe, Hood said. British
newspapers have been reporting recently that Home Depot is eyeing
acquisitions in the United Kingdom, but Hood is looking elsewhere
on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be surprised if the company were to announce its
intention to move into Germany,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Home Depot's European interests picked up last
March when the retailer hired Ikea President Anders Moberg to lead
its international business. Moberg significantly expanded the
Swedish furniture chain throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
   Hood rates Home Depot's shares a ``hold.'' The retailer's stock
rose more than 5 percent Thursday, closing at $55.31 1/4, up $2.93
3/4.

`THE NINTH GATE': TO HELL IN A HANDBASKET, TAKING A TRUSTY BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those with an interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' look no further. Roman Polanski's ``Ninth
Gate,'' with its wizened decadence _ Darius Khondji's velveteen
cinematography looks as if it came out of Rembrandt's Fotomat _ and
its tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Langella, wearing a hairpiece that is most assuredly from
the Stygian depths of Hell, is Boris Balkan, a wealthy and
therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired antiquities who hires
Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a weedy rogue book dealer, to locate a
volume called ``The Nine Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   You can tell that Corso is a rebel kind of book dealer: he
smokes as he pores over vintage tomes, and he doesn't wear gloves
to keep his skin oils from the delicate pages. Balkan hires Corso
to find the volume that will unlock the Nine Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The book is so pernicious that it drives an elderly man to hang
himself from a noose that doesn't look capable of supporting a pair
of socks.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with debonair slashes of white across the sides of his
head, Corso begins a search that will take him over several
continents and at least 90 minutes because there are three versions
of the book in question. He must ascertain which ``Gates'' is
authentic and stay a step ahead of Liana (Lena Olin), who cuts a
striking figure in black; she was born to be a widow.
</P>
<P>
   It was her husband who killed himself, driven mad by some
intoxicating combination of her fatale figure and having such a
horrific tome in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by his aerodynamic hair detailing, Corso goes from one
``Gates'' owner to another to check out their copies. He's pursued
by a sylph (Emmanuelle Seigner) with the vacant stare and bored
pout of a 14-year-old idly channel-surfing in hopes of finding
MTV's Carson Daly. She races across Europe after Corso.
</P>
<P>
   Is she on Corso's side? Will Balkan get Satan's powers in his
clutches through mastery of ``The Nine Gates''? And what about
Satan? Since the rich in these Devil-quest spectaculars are always
searching for the Devil but often come to a bad end, does this mean
he's a socialist? Or perhaps, since money attracts money, that he's
a supply-sider?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions to be answered sooner or later in an issue
of Cahiers du Cinema. Or The Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   In adapting the European slight-fright best seller ``El Club
Dumas,'' Polanski is out to cross ``Rosemary's Baby'' with his
saucy spoof ``The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is
about as scary as a sock-puppy re-enactment of ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' and not nearly as funny.
</P>
<P>
   There's no leading man less interested in staying close to type
than Depp. His Dean Corso is a craven hustler who makes the
detached, cowardly Ichabod Crane he portrayed in ``Sleepy Hollow''
seem as forceful as Buffy the Vampire Slayer; he shows no interest
in vesting learned characters with courage. Polanski's reflexes are
gone, so all he can do is watch the camera pass gracefully from set
to set.
</P>

&HT;     LAWMAKERS STRESS NEED TO IDENTIFY, TREAT POTENTIALLY VIOLENT
YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tackling the issue of youth violence in the wake of
several fatal school shootings across the country, a bipartisan
group of lawmakers issued a report Thursday calling for more
programs aimed at identifying troubled children early and
addressing their mental health needs.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 lawmakers, who included representatives as ideologically
diverse as conservative Bob Barr, R-Ga., and liberal Sheila
Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, agreed that state and local jurisdictions
need to focus attention on boosting the ability of individual
schools to intervene in the lives of troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, the panel co-chair, said the panel
members steered clear of discussing gun control, a divisive issue
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting weekly since last fall, the lawmakers made three
broad conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress should ensure that early intervention programs are
adequately funded in schools and communities across the country.
One example is where a uniformed police officer is placed full time
in a school to counsel students and defuse potentially violent
situations.
</P>
<P>
   &Cx1f; _ Congress should ensure that schools have the resources to
identify ``at-risk'' children and to provide them with health
programs and mental health counseling, especially if they are being
abused at home. Numerous studies have shown a link between abuse
and criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   _ The juvenile justice system should not apply a one-size-fits
all approach to children who break the law. Instead, the focus
should be on rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The report also stressed the need for parents to provide a
``strong moral foundation'' and positive role models.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference, Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., who
co-chaired the panel, said ``early intervention efforts that
require the close participation of parents and communities are
essential to reducing youth violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost added that ``we must deal with this from a very early
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent schoolyard shootings have heightened concerns about
violence amount children and adolescents. On Feb. 29, a 6-year-old
Michigan boy shot and killed a 6-year-old girl in front of a
teacher and classmates. Last April, two teen-agers killed 12 fellow
students, a teacher and then took their own lives at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo. In 1998, two boys, 11-years-old and
13-years-old, opened fire at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark.,
killing a teacher and four girls.

 &HT;    JUDGE HEARS ARGUMENTS IN ELIAN CASE, FATHER HIRES ATTORNEY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   MIAMI _ The fate of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez
inched toward a resolution Thursday, as a federal judge took
arguments in a long-awaited hearing on whether the boy should go
home to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Michael Moore issued no decision and
gave no indication when he might do so.
</P>
<P>
   The judge instead listened to three hours of intense and often
arcane legal argument, then dismissed the teams of attorneys
without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Miami's Federal Courthouse, a small group of protesters
_ mostly Cuba exiles _ waved Cuban flags and chanted for Elian to
be allowed to stay in the United States. The boy did not attend the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court date was the latest chapter in Elian's saga, which
began three months ago when he was found floating in an inner tube
off Fort Lauderdale after his mother and 10 other people perished
on an ill-fated attempt to flee Cuba by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has lived with relatives in Miami since then, but his
case has become an international tug-of-war, prompting angry
rhetoric and dueling protests between Miami's Cuban exiles and
Cuban President Fidel Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
   In January, federal immigration officials ruled that Elian
should go back to Cuba to live with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, saying that both U.S. and international law support the
notion that parents are best equipped to speak for their children
in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision triggered angry protests in Miami, and federal
officials backed away from forcibly taking Elian back to Cuba.
Instead, they invited the Miami relatives to file a federal lawsuit
to resolve the case.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's hearing, government lawyers argued that the
lawsuit should be tossed out, saying that federal immigration
decisions are not subject to review in the courts. They also said
Elian was too young to speak for himself, and that federal
officials properly identified the boy's father as the one who
should make decisions on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition of the rights and responsibilities of parents
is a fundamental part of our law and constitution,'' said the
government's lead attorney, Deputy Solicitor-General Edwin
Kneedler. ``The question is, 'Who best speaks for the child?'''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Miami relatives said federal statutes also
grant any alien present in the United States the right to apply for
asylum regardless of their age, and that Elian was wrongly denied
that right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute clearly states that any alien physically present
in the U.S. has the right to apply for asylum,'' argued Barbara
Lopoa, one of the attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives. ``Nowhere
in the statute does it say that this right is limited solely to
adult aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's attorneys have filed an asylum application for the
boy, and argued that federal officials wrongly refused to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Moore questioned Kneedler closely on the point, asking
whether the government had or had not officially accepted the
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' Moore said. ``The problem is
that the record doesn't support your argument. If an application
was accepted, then you have to hold a hearing and have due
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore also seemed troubled that the federal law governing such
cases doesn't spell out how old an alien must be in order to file
an asylum application on his own, or which federal officials have
the authority to decide who should speak for a child in such a
case.
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler admitted the statute is silent on those matters, but
again emphasized that U.S. and international law support the
child-parent bond.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys also argued that the federal court has no
authority in the case, and that the Miami relatives have no legal
standing to file court actions on Elian's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Moore could toss out the case for those reasons, or grant the
family's request and order an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In either event, the losing party could appeal, and the legal
battle could stretch on for weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Thursday, Juan Miguel Gonzalez
disclosed that he has hired a high-powered Washington attorney,
Gregory Craig, who represented President Clinton in his impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In an about-face from previous statements, Gonzalez said he is
prepared to come to the U.S. to take his son home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But when that day might come seemed no clearer after Thursday's
court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   One legal expert predicted the case could drag on for months,
especially if Judge Moore orders an asylum hearing for Elian. The
longer the boy stays with his Miami family, the less likely a court
would be to uproot him, said Ira Kurzban, a noted South Florida
immigration attorney who attended the hearing as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delaying tactic,'' he said ``That's been the family's
strategy from the start.''

`DETERRENCE': PREPOSTEROUS, BUT A TINGLE OR TWO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The threat of nuclear war may have receded in the last two
decades, but it certainly hasn't disappeared. That's why a movie
like ``Deterrence,'' Rod Lurie's clunky political thriller about
nuclear brinksmanship in the near future, probably serves some
useful purpose, despite its ham-fisted preachiness and mediocre
acting.
</P>
<P>
   A shrill warning to the complacent, the movie extrapolates from
the present to eight years in the future with barely enough
credibility to make you shudder at the possibility of a nuclear
confrontation between the United States and Iraq. Almost despite
itself, it does produce a mild tingle or two.
</P>
<P>
   In Lurie's ominous vision of global politics in 2008, a large
Iraqi army marches into Kuwait unexpectedly while the United States
is preoccupied with potentially explosive tensions in Asia. The
sudden, large invasion is initiated while the incumbent president,
Walter Emerson (Kevin Pollak), is campaigning for his party's
nomination in Colorado. When a surprise blizzard traps him and
important members of his staff at a diner in the tiny town of
Aztec, they are forced to deal with the crisis equipped with only
four telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deterrence'' has the look, attitude and touch-all-bases
casting philosophy of a budget-conscious television movie from the
1970s. With its blunt admonitory tone and single-set location
(reminiscent of ``Twelve Angry Men''), it often has the feel of a
high school civics lesson packaged as melodrama. Its editorial
pretensions are underscored by an opening black-and-white montage
of actual presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt through Bill
Clinton lambasting war.
</P>
<P>
   The diner's employees and patrons are a predictable variety-pack
assortment of types. They include its black cook (Bajda Djola) and
French-Canadian waitress (Clotilde Courau), an invective-spewing,
equal-opportunity bigot (Sean Astin) and a white middle-class
couple (Michael Mantell and Kathryn Morris) who happen to be
playing chess when the president's party pops in. Each wooden
character has his own designated speech pinning down a different
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The only character to depart from formula is the president, who
as played by Pollak is one of the least statesmanlike U.S. chief
executives to appear in a Hollywood film. Even though the character
wasn't elected president (he ascended from the vice presidency
after the death of his predecessor), Pollak's president, when
discussing world affairs, exhibits all the charm and stature of a
shifty-eyed accountant outlining tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Without appearing to think twice, he issues a preposterous
ultimatum to the Iraqis: If they don't immediately halt their
invasion and disarm their biological weapons, the United States
will launch a nuclear attack on Baghdad. He gives the residents
exactly one hour and 20 minutes to vacate the city. The
inappropriately sarcastic tone that creeps into his voice
occasionally suggests Dennis Miller delivering one of his
misanthropic rants.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie shows some nerve in depicting the president as a
hawkish cold fish, Pollak's Emerson is so devoid of appealing human
qualities that the notion of anyone having chosen this pompous
nebbish for a running mate is inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   The president's chief advisers aren't much more credible. Sheryl
Lee Ralph as his national security adviser, Gayle Redford, exhibits
a cool, glossy huffiness more appropriate to a pop diva than a
government official. Timothy Hutton, as his chief of staff, is
saddled with the movie's most bombastic speech, about how the
Garden of Eden was originally in Iraq and how dropping a nuclear
bomb in the area would be the equivalent of destroying the cradle
of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Having ``Deterrence'' unfold on a single set only adds to the
film's artificiality. Had the characters been given any depth or
complexity, the diner might have turned into a microcosm of the
larger world. But the little dramas that erupt among these
cardboard mouthpieces cooped up together are strictly the stuff of
amateur theater.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's strongest element is its reasonably sophisticated
projection of global politics based on present-day realities. But
even here, ``Deterrence'' falls apart when it pulls a final trick
out of its sleeve. Although it would be unfair to give that trick
away, suffice it to say it is not a whammy of a surprise.

`MISSION TO MARS': SMALL STEP FOR MAN, BUT A BIG WHOOP FOR
MARTIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As in ``Apollo 13,'' Gary Sinise gets to watch all his pals go
off into space without him. In ``Mission to Mars,'' he's Jim, a
morose astronaut pining for his dead wife, and his depression makes
him an unlikely candidate for the Mars mission. ``He's good,''
explains Cmdr. Woody Blake (Tim Robbins), ``but not for this.''
</P>
<P>
   All the characters _ the cast includes Don Cheadle, Connie
Nielsen and an uncredited Armin Mueller-Stahl _ are nice-guyish and
cooperative, so much so that they're nondescript. The director,
Brian De Palma, catches them in noble profile so often that you
wonder when the commemorative coins are going to be issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' takes off with a splash of wit, with the
ominous rumbles of a rocket launched toward the heavens. That
rocket explodes into a spray of confetti as the camera pulls back
to show a backyard barbecue and the happy NASA crew discussing the
coming Mars flight.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma loves to dance with the medium to show that any move,
from a quick twirl to an athletic arabesque, can be immediately
achieved. But what's not at his disposal this time is his ability
to mix tones. ``Mission to Mars'' is a plea for understanding, a
call for brotherhood. It's as much of a New Age paperweight as
``Contact,'' Robert Zemeckis' film about finding an otherworldly
intelligence, but De Palma is emotionally lost in the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' could be called De Palma's ``Abyss.'' And in
turn, that James Cameron opus was a brine-soaked attempt to work
through the themes of Stanley Kubrick's ``2001: A Space Odyssey''
with a benevolent perspective as an alien intelligence extended a
tendril of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma soars off into space toward the same end, with a group
of writers including Graham Yost of ``Speed'' and writers with
producers' credits like Ted Tally (``Silence of the Lambs'') and
David Goyer (``Blade''), although much of the picture feels as if
it came from the director. It can't take too many people to come up
with lines like ``Those stresses have never been tested in space!''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since such a grandiloquent souffle of
majesty and silliness refused to rise on the big screen: probably
not since ``The Abyss,'' in which Cameron's deepest desire was to
have audiences discover he was not just a genre filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma's gift is an ability to bend the generally rigid
constraints of genre to suit his needs by inflating the emotional
content of thrillers and film noir so that you choke on your
laughter or are simultaneously touched and frightened.
</P>
<P>
   He has been accused of being inexpressive, but his problem here
is that he is too enraptured by his subject. There's a
follow-your-bliss dreaminess here that wouldn't be out of place at
a Deepak Chopra seminar or on a Mannheim Steamroller album.
</P>
<P>
   The visual design is spectacular, and the scenes on the Martian
surface look so real that the picture could have been made on
location. A holographic sequence detailing the evolutionary link
between Earth and Mars is staggeringly well staged. Even in those
instances, the movie is undermined by De Palma's uncharacteristic
wet-eyed awe.
</P>
<P>
   He introduces a standard-issue alien with an elongated frame and
then goes that cliche one better. A single tear rolls down its _
well, I guess you'd call it its cheek _ and there it stands, as if
it were a Martian Iron Eyes Cody.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be an original moment in the entire movie,
and the score is so repetitive that it could have been downloaded
directly from -EnnioMorricone.com. All this addled sincerity comes
from trying to create wonderment for adults, growing out of Jim's
rediscovery of his humanity after he is later recruited for a
rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   Sinise's thoughtful patience in this situation makes him appear
to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie, which
narratively seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each
minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can
hear you snore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Mission to Mars' is rated PG (parental guidance suggested). It
includes grown-up astronaut language and potentially upsetting
violence. &QL;

THE LUXE SPLENDOR OF ROME IN THE 1700S

<P>
   New York City considers itself the art capital of the world, but
it will probably never be the equal of Rome in the 18th century.
Rome was a mecca for cultivated citizens from all over the world.
``Rome in the 18th century was like New York today,'' said Peter
Marino, a New York architect. ``You had to go and be seen there. It
was the center of energy, where everything was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Rishel, the senior curator for European paintings at
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, agreed. ``Rome was the pre-eminent
international school of art in 18th-century Europe,'' he said,
``the place where new ideas were most often hatched, nurtured,
developed and launched into international circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   For painters and architects especially, all roads led to Rome.
The French painters Jacques Louis David and Ingres went to paint
and see masterpieces. The English architects William Kent, Robert
Adam and John Soane measured ancient ruins. The Americans Benjamin
West and John Singleton Copley copied pictures by the masters.
</P>
<P>
   This influence is explored in ``The Splendor of 18th-Century
Rome,'' an ambitious exhibition that opens at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art on Thursday and runs through May 28. Some 400 works,
mostly paintings but also prints, drawings, sculpture, textiles,
furniture and objets d'art represent Rome's wealth in art during
that century.
</P>
<P>
   Rishel said the show, which has been in the works since 1991,
came from a realization that ``for the average museum visitor,
18th-century Rome remains terra incognita, and the work of even its
finest painters, sculptors and architects is unfamiliar.''
</P>
<P>
   The show reminds visitors that before Rome became the capital of
a united Italy in 1871, it was an independent Papal State. The
popes were generous patrons of all the arts. There are ravishing
examples of ecclesiastical pieces and vestments embroidered in gold
and silver. ``These are the luxe of the luxe,'' Rishel said. ``They
are as luxe as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition opens with a dazzling, two-foot-tall silver,
silver gilt and lapis lazuli inkstand showing the monument in the
middle of the piazza of the Quirinal Palace in Rome. The miniature
is a tour de force, complete with the Quirinal's famous Egyptian
obelisk and the two ancient sculptural groups on either side of it,
which depict Castor and Pollux and their horses. On the model the
horses are lids for the inkwells. The water in the Quirinal
fountain is represented by the blue lapis lazuli.
</P>
<P>
   The model was made in 1792 as a presentation piece for Pope Pius
VI, who could see the monument from the window of his summer
palace, by a Roman silversmith, Vincenzo Coaci (1756-94). Coaci was
the student of Luigi Valadier (1726-85), a Roman silversmith who
was the subject of an exhibition at the Louvre in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This artist was not only a gold and silversmith, but also a
designer and maker of both bronze and stone objects,'' Alvar
Gonzalez-Palacios writes of Valadier in the show's catalog.
Gonzalez-Palacios is the editor of a journal of decorative arts in
Rome and has just written a best-selling autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valadier was one of the first to perfect small-scale
reproductions in bronze of classical masterpieces,'' he writes,
``which in his hands became precious objects, embellished by
decoration and settings made of ancient colored marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition has three Valadier carta glorias, which are
religious crib sheets. These have elaborate gilt bronze frames with
stands. Inside the frame, where you might expect a picture,
Valadier has chiseled the Latin words of the Mass in silver _ just
in case a priest lost his place during Mass. They are dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   Valadier antiques are in great demand, and there are a few on
the market now. Aveline, a top Paris dealer, has two pairs of
signed Valadier candelabra that were made as centerpieces for the
tables of the nobility. Each has four gilt bronze arms coming out
of an alabaster vase that is supported by three caryatids. The
caryatids stand on a base decorated with multicolored marbles.
Jean-Marie Rossi, the proprietor, said they were very rare and
``have a very rare price.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariane Dandois, another Paris dealer, has a ``term'' attributed
to Valadier. As Dandois explained, ``According to Roman mythology,
a term was the god who marked and protected the boundaries of a
person's fields. He is always represented as a bust on a
pedestal.'' Her term, from about 1775, may have been made for the
gallery of the Palazzo Borghese in Rome, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning piece of furniture in the exhibition is
probably the console table designed by Vincenzo Pacetti. Its top is
one solid piece of black and white marble that looks like black
paint splattered over white snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romans were stone snobs,'' said Dean Walker, the senior
curator of decorative arts and sculpture at the museum. ``They got
green stone from Egypt and black and white from Aquitaine in
France.''
</P>
<P>
   An 18th-century stone sample book, also in the exhibition,
identifies the Pacetti marble as bianco and nero antico. It rests
on four caryatids, beautifully modeled male and female figures that
morph at the waist into normal table legs inset with the same
marble.
</P>
<P>
   Italian antiques at this elevated level seem to be coming back
into fashion, though they are very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big revival of interest in Italian furniture,'' said
Marino, the architect. ``I have two clients who don't want French
or Georgian antiques, only Italian, perhaps because they go well
with modern slick interiors. But this furniture needs volume; you
have to show it in big spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers also think it's in vogue. Lou Marotta, an antiques
dealer on East 60th Street in Manhattan, said, ``There is a demand
for top-of-the-line Italian pieces, but not as strong as in the
1980s.'' He has a pair of 18th-century gilded Roman consoles, with
veneered marble tops and cabriole legs ending in horse hooves,
priced at $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman things are more edited,'' Marotta said. ``They are
incredibly powerful but they are not over the top, as Venetian
pieces often are. The days of an entire Roman room are over. A good
Italian antique has to be juxtaposed against something contemporary
to bring it down and make it more humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Regal, another dealer on East 60th Street, said, ``Italian
furniture is not as fussy as French furniture, and it has more
movement than English furniture.'' He is selling a real souvenir of
the Grand Tour, a set of three buttermilk yellow marble miniature
Roman temples, for $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dandois best summed up the appeal. ``Roman things have more
fantasy and imagination than French pieces of the same period,''
she said. ``They have guts.''

`CONDO PAINTING': LETTING AN ARTIST EXPLAIN, WHETHER IT HELPS OR
NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Condo Painting'' is not, as the title might seem to suggest,
an instructional film for apartment owners, but rather a 87-minute
documentary on the life, work and thought of George Condo, a
garrulous painter with a mischievous sense of humor and an
eccentric, quasi-mystical view of art and the world it inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   To call the film a documentary may be a bit misleading. Directed
by the Chicago filmmaker John McNaughton (whose earlier work
includes the cult classic pseudo-documentary ``Henry: Portrait of a
Serial Killer'' and the feverish sex thriller ``Wild Things'') in
close collaboration with its subject, ``Condo Painting'' tries not
only to record the artist's aesthetic theories but also to apply
them.
</P>
<P>
   What results is a free-form excursion, studded with abstract
music-video effects (and accompanied by a soundtrack featuring
music by people like DJ Spooky, Tom Waits and the Residents),
through the sensibility of a man who is sometimes enlightening,
sometimes amusing and sometimes annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Like many artists, Condo has built an elaborate intellectual
apparatus to explain what he does, and like most artists, what he
does is more interesting than his explanations. One of his central
conceits, borrowed from Aldous Huxley's mescaline bible ``Heaven
and Hell,'' involves contact with what Huxley calls the antipodes,
the distant regions of human consciousness that constitute a kind
of collective dream world.
</P>
<P>
   In Condo's words, these regions are inhabited by interpodal or
antipodal beings who look, in his portraits of them, like the
zombie kin of Yosemite Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Condo, a draftsman of considerable skill and a painter committed
to classical standards of discipline and decorum, declares
affinities to both the world of modern American pop culture and the
traditions of the old masters.
</P>
<P>
   One of his side projects is a handmade book called ``Granny's
Guide to Art History'' _ Granny as in Granny Clampitt of ``The
Beverly Hillbillies,'' whose head, along with those of other Nick
at Nite icons like Gomer Pyle and Barney Fife, Condo superimposes
on reproductions from Leonardo, Hals and Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest debt seems to be not to any other visual artists,
but to the literary heroes of the Beat Generation. Allen Ginsberg
and William S. Burroughs appear in the movie, which also follows
Condo on a pilgrimage to Lowell, Mass., the hometown of Jack
Kerouac.
</P>
<P>
   Condo, a native of nearby Chelmsford, was born in 1957 and so
could not have known the Beats in their heyday. And while there is
something wishful and secondhand about his devotion to them, there
is also something earnest and touching. The most affecting part of
the movie, its last half-hour or so, observes Condo at work on a
painting he conceives as a tribute to Burroughs and Ginsberg, each
of whom died midway through the making of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Condo seems to be one of those peculiar souls who regard
Ginsberg, Burroughs and Kerouac not just as colorful characters or
interesting writers but also as major thinkers. Your tolerance for
``Condo Painting,'' which began as a 15-minute promotional film for
the PaceWildenstein Gallery before swelling to feature length, is
likely to depend on how much Beat idolatry you can stand.
</P>
<P>
   You may wish that Condo would expand further on the space-time
continuum, the status of conscious reality, the geography of the
antipodes and other vital matters. On the other hand, you may wish
that he would just shut up and paint and that McNaughton's restless
camera would just sit still and watch him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik's pink pants aside, pro golfers are swinging
with style.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of polyester plaid pants and loud colors, it's a
quieter, more refined fashion statement on the course. The current
trend also reflects the '40s-inspired fluid silk trousers and
oversize sport shirts.
</P>
<P>
   While golf stars such as Tiger Woods, Kirk Triplett and Gary
McCord are known for specific looks _ Woods' lucky color (red),
Triplett's Italian designs and McCord's tropical shirts _ it's
often the clothing manufacturers they endorse who are the real
image makers.
</P>
<P>
   Take Woods. His youthful good looks, poise and consistent wins
got him a multimillion-dollar endorsement contract (plus a royalty
arrangement on product sales) with Nike. But when it comes to
wardrobe selection, Woods doesn't get to call the shots, says Nike
golf apparel director David Hagler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger doesn't get to pick and choose what he's going to wear.
His entire wardrobe is scripted in advance for every single day he
participates in a tournament where he's getting major coverage. We
design a specific outfit for the weather conditions, so one day he
might wear a rayon blend golf shirt, another day a shirt made of a
moisture-management fabric called Dri-Fit. But we also know that
red is Tiger's power or lucky color, so it's important for his
Sunday wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans may have noticed that Woods' fashion stance has changed
since he signed with Nike in 1997. Originally he wore bright red
shirts on Sundays, and reflected a younger, sportier image.
</P>
<P>
   As Woods has matured, his _ and Nike's _ tastes have changed, so
this spring Nike, is dressing him more upscale, says Hagler. And
the shade of red is more sophisticated, closer to claret than
crimson.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion freedom Woods does have is limited to his belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Nike doesn't make belts, he wears his own, brown or
black, depending on the outfit. However, we are considering a Tiger
Woods belt collection,'' Hagler adds.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller companies such as Tony Bahama have a different
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company has its own view, but we're different than, say,
Nike, and we approach people whose personalities reflect our image,
which is casually chic with an island attitude,'' says company
spokesman Tony Margolis. ``And we hope it will be our good fortune
that along the way, they get TV exposure that results in publicity
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Bahama doesn't even have a golf division, but describes
itself as a sportswear company that is ``golf friendly,'' so there
are no million-dollar deals yet, he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much each player is paid, because the
amount depends on the player's needs and motivation. They strike
deals that aren't just about money, but each of the players we
dress _ McCord, Peter Jacobsen and Russ Cochran _ does get a
complete wardrobe and they're free to mix and match shirts and
pants to create their own ensembles.''
</P>
<P>
   The wardrobe Margolis is talking about is a soft, draping
collection of clothes that includes solid color trousers and
shirts, as well as the company's trademark tropical prints with
palm trees and hibiscus flowers. To ensure the player is
appropriately dressed for the weather, there are cotton, linen and
silk for warm climates; sweaters, vests and shirts that are
chill-and-wind resistant; and also water-proof shirts for sudden
showers.
</P>
<P>
   The only requirement, he adds, is that they wear his brand of
clothes to every tournament they compete in. And they must
participate in at least 20 to 25 tournaments a year.
</P>
<P>
   Within those free wardrobes, each player tries to find a lucky
look. For Woods, it's red on Sundays. Sometimes it's a red shirt or
vest, but other times he has to settle for a narrow stripe of red
in the weave of his golf shirt because Nike didn't have red on its
seasonal color palette.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, who also wears Nike, says he prefers black and navy,
and favors the company's white or two-tone Nike golf shoes. But
he's not a clothes horse and claims to be easy to please.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if he could change the dress code, he'd trade his
pleated pants for Bermuda shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a lot more comfortable in shorts, but I realize some of
the guys out there have ugly legs,'' he joked as he stepped into
the locker room at the Riviera golf course in Pacific Palisades for
last month's 2000 Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples, who's signed with Ashworth, is even less picky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I've got clothes on, I'm happy. And besides, they
(Ashworth) let me give a little input, so I request shirts with a
loose fit and pants with a lot of cotton or wool gabardine.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Ernie Els, a fashion plate in black silk trousers
with a silver-tipped black leather belt. Els says he works closely
with Adidas, which he endorses, and its next collection available
in April will reflect his input.
</P>
<P>
   Like Els, Matt Gogel thinks professional golfers have a duty to
look as presentable as possible, but he doesn't give Fairway and
Greene any input. ``They send me 25 to 30 shirts a month and I
select whatever I want. But I do have a preference to stripes over
solids,'' says the Mission Hills player.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett, winner of this year's Nissan Open, endorses the
Italian line called Carnoustie which keeps him looking dapper in
navy and black ensembles. But he, too, stays out of the drawing
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have zero influence, and that's the way I want it _ as long
as they don't make me wear knickers. Or white shoes and belt, which
are unlucky,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes are a big deal these days. It used to be everybody wore
white. Then Tiger became known for black shoes, which could be why
Jerry Kelly laughs and says black shoes are bad luck. He and many
other players prefer black-and-white saddle shoes on the course.
</P>
<P>
   In regard to his wardrobe, which is provided by Ashworth, Kelly
says, ``I pretend to like everything, but I'm Irish so I like
green.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Duffy Waldorf makes his style statement with Hawaiian
print shirts, while Rory Sabbatini stands out in geometric prints.

 &HT;    JUDGE HEARS ARGUMENTS IN ELIAN CASE, FATHER HIRES ATTORNEY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   MIAMI _ The fate of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez
inched toward a resolution Thursday, as a federal judge took
arguments in a long-awaited hearing on whether the boy should go
home to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Michael Moore issued no decision and
gave no indication when he might do so.
</P>
<P>
   The judge instead listened to three hours of intense and often
arcane legal argument, then dismissed the teams of attorneys
without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Miami's Federal Courthouse, a small group of protesters
_ mostly Cuba exiles _ waved Cuban flags and chanted for Elian to
be allowed to stay in the United States. The boy did not attend the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court date was the latest chapter in Elian's saga, which
began three months ago when he was found floating in an inner tube
off Fort Lauderdale after his mother and 10 other people perished
on an ill-fated attempt to flee Cuba by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has lived with relatives in Miami since then, but his
case has become an international tug-of-war, prompting angry
rhetoric and dueling protests between Miami's Cuban exiles and
Cuban President Fidel Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
   In January, federal immigration officials ruled that Elian
should go back to Cuba to live with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, saying that both U.S. and international law support the
notion that parents are best equipped to speak for their children
in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision triggered angry protests in Miami, and federal
officials backed away from forcibly taking Elian back to Cuba.
Instead, they invited the Miami relatives to file a federal lawsuit
to resolve the case.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's hearing, government lawyers argued that the
lawsuit should be tossed out, saying that federal immigration
decisions are not subject to review in the courts. They also said
Elian was too young to speak for himself, and that federal
officials properly identified the boy's father as the one who
should make decisions on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition of the rights and responsibilities of parents
is a fundamental part of our law and constitution,'' said the
government's lead attorney, Deputy Solicitor-General Edwin
Kneedler. ``The question is, 'Who best speaks for the child?'''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Miami relatives said federal statutes also
grant any alien present in the United States the right to apply for
asylum regardless of their age, and that Elian was wrongly denied
that right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute clearly states that any alien physically present
in the U.S. has the right to apply for asylum,'' argued Barbara
Lopoa, one of the attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives. ``Nowhere
in the statute does it say that this right is limited solely to
adult aliens.''

 &HT;    Coke CEO to tie executive compensation to diversity goals
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Doug Daft is putting his money where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's new chairman and chief executive told employees
Thursday that he will be linking his success and compensation _ as
well as his managers' _ to meeting soon-to-be set diversity goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets measured gets done, and for that reason there will
be a series of (diversity) goals, objectives and targets
established over the next few months,'' Daft said in an e-mail memo
to all employees. ``Everyone in the organization will be held
accountable for meeting them. My own success and compensation will
be tied to these diversity goals, and the same will be true
throughout the management ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft is making diversity a ``top priority'' and said he is
creating a new position of vice president and director of diversity
strategies, who will report directly to him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's e-mail to employees was Daft's second on diversity
this week. On Tuesday, he told employees the company was ``working
toward an expedient and equitable resolution'' of the racial
discrimination suit filed against Coca-Cola, which seeks
class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came after last week's meeting and rally by
African-American employees and their supporters, who said they
would pressure the company to treat black employees fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff's attorney Cyrus Mehri praised Daft's move to link
executive compensation to diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major victory for plaintiffs in the class who have
been seeking these kinds of reforms for nearly a year,'' Mehri
said. ``This is the first step towards moving Coca-Cola from a
laggard to a leader on diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the practice of linking executive compensation to
diversity goals has been growing among big companies, executive
compensation experts said, most firms _ big and small _ still do
not do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are paying more attention to diversity and other
nonfinancial measures in determining executive compensation,'' said
Sanford Godwin, an executive compensation expert for the William M.
Mercer human resources consulting firm. ``But still a significant
majority of companies do not directly link executive pay to
measures such as diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 survey, the Society for Human Resource Management
found that 58 percent of the participants from Fortune 500
companies did not link compensation and performance to diversity
goals. At smaller firms, 79 percent did not tie such goals to
compensation and performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one the of the points of contention in promoting
diversity for a long time,'' said Tim Mulvaney, president of
Mulvaney Group, a New York-based diversity and leadership
consulting firm. ``If you want to know what people are spending
their energies on, you can look at two things _ what they get paid
for and what their boss is asking them about.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft told employees the company ``must have an organizational
structure that supports our diversity goals.'' In the near future,
he said, he will be appointing the new diversity director, who will
work with top company executives ``to build new initiatives to move
the company to the head of the class in leading and managing
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri, the plaintiffs' attorney, expects Daft to announce other
diversity initiatives in the coming weeks as both sides prepare to
begin settlement talks on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will examine each reform closely and seek to make necessary
improvements so that the reforms have staying power,'' Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight current and former employees,
alleges that the company has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
The plaintiffs are seeking to represent a class of about 2,000
black salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied all allegations and opposed plaintiffs'
attempt to make it a class-action case.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is it too much to expect the National Design Museum
to show a little design now and then? Finally Cooper-Hewitt has
taken the plunge. With the first edition of its National Design
Triennial the museum brings us real, living design. Not the history
of design; not the sociology, anthropology, psychology, theory,
politics or economics of design. Not Good Design, Green Design or
Universal Design. Just Design, the whole field of American Design
and nothing but Design.
</P>
<P>
   The first in a series of survey exhibitions to be held every
three years, it offers a bracing dunk in the present. Encompassing
graphics, fashion, industrial products, architecture, interiors,
furniture, toys, stage and movie sets, and computer animation, the
show is not a Best of the Best contest. Projects by 83 designers
and firms, all produced in the last three years, are not grouped by
disciplines. Viewers may pick their own winners and losers. We
expect survey shows to be irritating, and this one does not
disappoint. Too often the ideas lose focus. There are vexing
omissions and far-fetched connections. Still, this show makes
design look like the most protean, fertile field this side of the
Tigris and Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
   It has been organized by Donald Albrecht and Ellen Lupton, two
curators on Cooper-Hewitt's staff, along with Steven Skov Holt, a
seasoned Silicon Valley denizen. Their synergy is infectious. They
have taken what might be called the Josephine Baker approach to the
bountiful subject. In concert performances Baker would toss
peaches, apples, papayas and other fruits into the audience. At
Cooper-Hewitt the curators pelt us with ideas. Color, light, form,
image, movement, materials and technologies land in seemingly
random arrangements of contemporary American style.
</P>
<P>
   The Triennial is organized around eight themes, from Fluid to
Unbelievable, with stops at Physical, Minimal, Reclaimed, Local,
Branded and Narrative along the way. The logic behind these motifs
is more intuitive than analytic. This is not to say that the
curators lack discrimination. Their approach reflects the mercurial
state of design today.
</P>
<P>
   Fluid, the introductory theme, states the show's overarching
message: dead or alive, natural or cultural, all things must morph.
The section also documents a particular current circulating through
architecture and design today. Greg Lynn's ``Hydrogen House,''
created in 1996 for the Austrian Mineral Oil Co., exemplifies the
movement toward ``blob'' architecture created with animation
software. Frank O. Gehry's unbuilt project for 1 Times Square
deploys folding fabric as an innovative building skin. The impact
of both projects is rooted in the shifting, mutable nature of
contemporary visual culture.
</P>
<P>
   A second-floor gallery devoted to Branded design embraces
without condescension Martha Stewart's antiseptically earthy
gardening products. Seed packets and a remarkable poison-free bug
killer are used to symbolize the power exercised by labels, logos
and slogans in the world of mass consumption. But why include
Stewart and not Ralph Lauren? Why ask why? We love Martha and we
don't like Ralph. Go figure. Just do it. Whoosh.
</P>
<P>
   The eight themes are themselves brands, meta-labels for objects
whose existence hangs on their reception in the consumer
marketplace. Although handbags by Kate Spade and a dress by
Geoffrey Beene are displayed in a Minimal gallery, Spade and Beene
are also outstanding brand names. So are Apple and, at this point,
even Frank O. Gehry. Less established designers, like Stefan
Sagmeister, shown in a photograph with his name carved into his
naked torso, are labels in the making. Doesn't everyone want to be
a trademark? Isn't that what's driving the explosion of all those
FillInYourName.coms?
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors will be impressed by the commercial aspect of this
show. Some of the objects can actually be purchased at the
Cooper-Hewitt gift shop. Others are available at fine stores
everywhere, or online. Many of the objects have graced the covers
and articles of that excellent trade magazine ID. An architect
whose work is represented in the show told me that his first
response on seeing it was to look around for a shopping cart. In
short, it offers a field day for those who can't wait for another
chance to whine about the breakdown of the cordon sanitaire between
museum and marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of museum design departments, however, such a
boundary never existed. Since the 1930s the explicit purpose of
design departments like that at the Museum of Modern Art was to
encourage a rapprochement between art and industry. This had been
the Bauhaus ideal. The Modern extended the ideal from production to
consumption. The museum didn't design products. Instead it rewarded
manufacturers for producing objects that Philip Johnson and
subsequent curators found aesthetically pleasing. They Branded
stuff with the Good Design label.
</P>
<P>
   In the Good Design period, Branded and Minimal shared a similar,
machine-based aesthetic. Today the two are complementary opposites.
The Brand catapults more stuff into the world. Minimal design
creates the illusion that stuff can be kept at bay. Michael
Gambelli, who designed the Triennial, is an excellent illusionist.
Using a Minimal palette of gray homisote panels, clear plexiglass
containers, white fabric and empty space, he has kept the show from
turning into Times Square. Gambelli has also achieved the
remarkable feat of keeping the ornate interiors of Andrew
Carnegie's mansion from undermining the entire idea of design.
</P>
<P>
   Reclaimed, another Triennial theme, is the offspring of Branded
and Minimal. Since stuff never really goes away, it might as well
be made use of. Reclaimed is design's trash compactor. It shows
what to do when Branded objects lose their value or aura. Don't
throw away those webbed plastic straps that came wrapped around
that shipment of clingy Diane von Furstenberg traveling pants
suits. Make your own version of Constantin and Lorene Leon Boym's
version of Breuer's Wassily chair! Breuer's aesthetic was based on
industrial production. The Boym sensibility derives from the
landfill end of the consumer system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Images and ideas can be reclaimed along with physical castoffs.
Peter Girardi, a retired graffiti writer based in Manhattan,
collects old typefaces, printer's marks, candy wrappers and other
signifiers cut loose from their signifieds. Then he posts them on a
Web site: www.funnygarbage.com, a semiotic town dump. In contrast
to the crisp, clean look of most computer graphics, Girardi and his
associate, Chris Capuozzo, want Web pages to look like old
newspapers blowing around the alley. Funny Garbage is working on
``Pink Donkey and the Fly,'' a cartoon show on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Bargmann's ``Testing the Waters'' is the most ambitious
project in the Reclaimed section, and one of the best in the
Triennial. A 45-acre park now under construction in Vintondale,
Pa., it is reclaiming land polluted by the drainage from a former
coal mine. To produce the design Bargmann, a landscape architect,
recruited a historian, a hydrogeologist and a visual artist. They
have produced what the curators call ``a giant ecological washing
machine'' that invites visitors to witness basins, spillways and
other stages in the water-cleansing process.
</P>
<P>
   The themes slither through one another like a series of spinoffs
and mergers. ``Testing the Waters'' would fit just as well or
better in the section called Local, dedicated to our archaic
attachment to place. The Local highlight is a remarkable house
designed by Marwan Al-Sayed for a couple in Phoenix. Formerly
employed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien
(who are handsomely represented in the Physical part of the show),
Al-Sayed uses thick masonry walls, metal trusses, tent fabric and
the desert surroundings in a design that recalls Frank Lloyd
Wright's Taliesin West.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture in general is sketchily handled. The selections are
choice but misleadingly labeled. Given the earnestness with which
Steven Holl pursues architecture's metaphysical dimension, it is
painfully obtuse to classify his MIT dormitory under Physical. Nor
is Neil Denari's work all that Fluid. Scary is more like it. With a
vocabulary derived from space age technology, his designs tend
toward the hard-edged. Beautifully conceived, Denari's projects are
beginning to look like Cold War antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gluckman and Robert Wilson's project for the Pittsburgh
Cultural Trust is filed under Minimal but is also a good example of
Reclaimed, or even Branded. The design drapes backlighted,
translucent theatrical scrims over the side walls of old industrial
buildings that are being recycled into Pittsburgh's new arts
district. A form of subliminal advertising, devoid of words or
images, the design is a refreshing antidote to the cloying,
scenographic buildings of Michael Graves and Charles Moore.
</P>
<P>
   If Walter Pater were alive today, he might well conclude that
all art aspires to the condition of movie titles. Examples of the
genre, created by the Hollywood company Imaginary Forces, are found
in the Physical galleries, and it is true that these haunting,
hilarious and brilliant montages provoke a visceral response.
Created for ``Seven,'' ``Mimic'' and ``Dead Man on Campus,'' these
short films should come with a warning attached: please don't
reveal the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The show's final two segments are utterly misnamed. Most of the
work displayed under the Narrative rubric is actually
illustrational. Projects by David Rockwell, Julie Taymor, Gary
Lloyd and David Gallo are fine examples of scenographic art, but
there is nothing narrative about them. Narration, in architecture
and design, refers to a spatial or visual sequence that duplicates
the formal structure of storytelling. That structure, analyzed by
Russian linguists in the early 20th century, proceeds from an
initial state of equilibrium through a series of unbalancing
episodes to a final, heightened state of equipoise. (Think of
rising, by stages, to the top of the Eiffel Tower.)
</P>
<P>
   Lebbeus Woods' project is the only one in the section that
follows a true narrative structure. Titled ``Civilization,'' it is
part of an exhibition that is to open in Berlin in May.
Intentionally or not, the design recreates in architectural form
the world according to Richard Rorty, author of the influential
1989 book ``Contingency, Irony and Solidarity.'' Rorty, our most
enlightened contemporary philosopher, has reflected on ways of
adapting to rapid cultural change. Woods, whose previous work
includes visionary studies of war-torn Sarajevo, has created a
dystopic environment of sharp, fragmented shapes that will serve as
an installation for a show on fantasies of 21st-century life.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable, the show's final section, would be more accurately
titled Next. Given the objects already seen, it is all too easy to
believe that the projects gathered here, or variants of them, will
soon be on the market. David Small's ``Talmud Project'' is a work
of genius. A prototype for an interactive book, produced at the MIT
Media Lab, the project may be the Triennial's most powerful piece
of architecture. Combining passages from the Torah and the Talmud,
in English and French translations, the software enables viewers to
manipulate blocks of text into the walls, streets and windows in an
imaginary city of words.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that is truly Unbelievable at Cooper-Hewitt
(apart from Martha Stewart's poison-free bug killer) is the entire
exhibition. In recent years New Yorkers have come to depend on
Moss, the SoHo store, for close-up inspections of new design. This
routine reversed the standard protocol in Good Design days, when a
museum display of well-designed objects preceded by some years the
establishment of retail outlets where consumers could buy them. It
is refreshing to see commercial and curatorial intelligence brought
into closer alignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Triennial was conceived a few years ago by Dianne H.
Pilgrim, who stepped down as the director of Cooper-Hewitt in
January. What a great parting gift.
</P>
<P>
   The National Design Triennial remains at the Cooper-Hewitt
Museum, 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, through Aug.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a short time after two men were stabbed to
death in a brawl and Ray Lewis was composing himself in his room at
a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and his companions saw an early morning TV broadcast
saying that two men were dead near a Buckhead nightclub. The
initial report was that it was a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were relieved _ it wasn't them,'' said Atlanta attorney
Akil Secret, recounting what his client, Jessica Robertson, has
told prosecutors. But then the broadcast mentioned a stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robertson, who was in the room, Lewis turned to one
of the co-defendants and asked, ``You didn't stab anyone, did
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a Lewis acquaintance who last week was given immunity
from prosecution, on Saturday turned over to investigators nine
garment bags, a carry-on bag, a plaque and a sweatshirt belonging
to Lewis. Two of the garment bags contained fur coats, including
the dark-colored mink and dark gray suit Lewis wore that night.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are expected to test the clothing for any blood
stains.
</P>
<P>
   Secret said he did not see any blood on the clothing during a
cursory look before turning the garments over to authorities. But
he said he would not be surprised if the blood tests were positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence is going to be that the coat fell off
onto the floor'' of the limousine Lewis and his party were riding
in, Secret said. ``If there was as much blood in the limo (as
authorities have said) then it would be odd if there was no blood
on the coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's blood on the coat, I don't think that implicates
anybody; that is a fact that could have many interpretations,''
Secret added. ``You have people scurrying into the vehicle after a
melee. There's bound to be contact, person to person, person to
car, clothes to clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and two friends, Joseph Sweeting, and Reginald Oakley,
have been charged with the murder of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard
Lollar, 24, both of Decatur, Ga. The men died after they and others
were involved in a brawl with members of Lewis' party on a Buckhead
street near the Cobalt lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and about 10 others fled the Buckhead scene in a
37-foot-long Lincoln Navigator that was hit by five shots as it
sped away, authorities had said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure pandemonium'' inside the limo, Secret said,
describing the scene. ``They were screaming at (driver) Duane
Fassett to `Drive! Drive!' It seemed like he froze.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis met Robertson, a Houston woman in her 20s, the Wednesday
before the Super Bowl and accompanied him to parties thrown by
Magic Johnson and Atlanta music producer Jermaine Dupri, Secret
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since she has come forward, authorities now have the names of
several more passengers in the limousine. Robertson has told
prosecutors that Lewis and his companions were encountered by the
victims and overhead statements that led them to believe they were
about to be robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Secret said Robertson was not hiding the clothes from
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not take that to hide them,'' he said. ``She thought
there was nothing sinister involved. There was nothing like that
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret said Lewis's original plan was to have his limo driver
bring his cache of clothes back to his Maryland home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never intended to take them to Hawaii'' where Lewis was to
play the following week in the Pro Bowl, Secret said. ``He was
going to travel light to Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   But the limo was incapacitated because of the gunshots and Lewis
called Robertson on her cell phone as she was driving away from the
hotel. ``She got a call, it was Ray asking her if she didn't mind
taking his clothes until he got back,'' said Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Secret said that Robertson placed the clothes in a storage
locker here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a very good reason why she chose, on her own, to put
those clothes in the storage bin,'' Secret said, declining to
elaborate. ``Ray Lewis had nothing to do with her decision to do
that. Nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the next few days, Robertson became aware that
Atlanta Police considered the clothes Lewis wore that night to be
evidence. ``The D.A.'s office began to infect the atmosphere that
the clothes were hidden because of some sinister purpose,'' Secret
said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned, Robertson went back and took a look at the clothes,
the lawyer said. ``She noticed no blood stains at all.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard would not comment on Robertson's
statements or anything regarding the case, citing the court-imposed
gag order.

   ATLANTA _ It was a short time after two men were stabbed to
death in a brawl and Ray Lewis was composing himself in his room at
a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and his companions saw an early morning TV broadcast
saying that two men were dead near a Buckhead nightclub. The
initial report was that it was a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were relieved _ it wasn't them,'' said Atlanta attorney
Akil Secret, recounting what his client, Jessica Robertson, has
told prosecutors. But then the broadcast mentioned a stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robertson, who was in the room, Lewis turned to one
of the co-defendants and asked, ``You didn't stab anyone, did
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, a Lewis acquaintance who last week was given immunity
from prosecution, on Saturday turned over to investigators nine
garment bags, a carry-on bag, a plaque and a sweatshirt belonging
to Lewis. Two of the garment bags contained fur coats, including
the dark-colored mink and dark gray suit Lewis wore that night.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are expected to test the clothing for any blood
stains.
</P>
<P>
   Secret said he did not see any blood on the clothing during a
cursory look before turning the garments over to authorities. But
he said he would not be surprised if the blood tests were positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence is going to be that the coat fell off
onto the floor'' of the limousine Lewis and his party were riding
in, Secret said. ``If there was as much blood in the limo (as
authorities have said) then it would be odd if there was no blood
on the coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's blood on the coat, I don't think that implicates
anybody; that is a fact that could have many interpretations,''
Secret added. ``You have people scurrying into the vehicle after a
melee. There's bound to be contact, person to person, person to
car, clothes to clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and two friends, Joseph Sweeting, and Reginald Oakley,
have been charged with the murder of Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard
Lollar, 24, both of Decatur, Ga. The men died after they and others
were involved in a brawl with members of Lewis' party on a Buckhead
street near the Cobalt lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and about 10 others fled the Buckhead scene in a
37-foot-long Lincoln Navigator that was hit by five shots as it
sped away, authorities had said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pure pandemonium'' inside the limo, Secret said,
describing the scene. ``They were screaming at (driver) Duane
Fassett to `Drive! Drive!' It seemed like he froze.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis met Robertson, a Houston woman in her 20s, the Wednesday
before the Super Bowl and accompanied him to parties thrown by
Magic Johnson and Atlanta music producer Jermaine Dupri, Secret
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since she has come forward, authorities now have the names of
several more passengers in the limousine. Robertson has told
prosecutors that Lewis and his companions were encountered by the
victims and overhead statements that led them to believe they were
about to be robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Secret said Robertson was not hiding the clothes from
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not take that to hide them,'' he said. ``She thought
there was nothing sinister involved. There was nothing like that
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret said Lewis's original plan was to have his limo driver
bring his cache of clothes back to his Maryland home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never intended to take them to Hawaii'' where Lewis was to
play the following week in the Pro Bowl, Secret said. ``He was
going to travel light to Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   But the limo was incapacitated because of the gunshots and Lewis
called Robertson on her cell phone as she was driving away from the
hotel. ``She got a call, it was Ray asking her if she didn't mind
taking his clothes until he got back,'' said Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Secret said that Robertson placed the clothes in a storage
locker here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a very good reason why she chose, on her own, to put
those clothes in the storage bin,'' Secret said, declining to
elaborate. ``Ray Lewis had nothing to do with her decision to do
that. Nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the next few days, Robertson became aware that
Atlanta Police considered the clothes Lewis wore that night to be
evidence. ``The D.A.'s office began to infect the atmosphere that
the clothes were hidden because of some sinister purpose,'' Secret
said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned, Robertson went back and took a look at the clothes,
the lawyer said. ``She noticed no blood stains at all.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard would not comment on Robertson's
statements or anything regarding the case, citing the court-imposed
gag order.

`ORPHANS': MOM'S DEAD, BUT HER BROOD ISN'T A WHOLE LOT BETTER OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Orphans'' was shown as part of last year's New Directors/New
Films series. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on April 2. The film opens
Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The milk of human kindness hasn't merely soured in Peter
Mullan's transcendently nasty but very funny comedy, ``Orphans.''
It has so poisoned the air of Glasgow that its clammy atmosphere
seems charged with petty malice.
</P>
<P>
   The story of three brothers and a sister, each of whom goes
grotesquely haywire after the death of their beloved mother, the
film gleefully rubs our noses in comic misanthropy that makes
American movies like ``The Ref'' and ``Very Bad Things'' seem
almost like rays of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   The directorial debut of Mullan, who won acclaim for his
portrayal of a recovering alcoholic in Ken Loach's film ``My Name
Is Joe,'' ``Orphans'' takes especially wicked delight in
contrasting the survivors' mawkish displays of grief over the death
of their dear old mum with their mean, spiteful attitudes toward
everyone outside the family.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins innocently enough as the four Flynn siblings _
Thomas (Gary Lewis), Michael (Douglas Henshall), Sheila (Rosemarie
Stevenson) and John (Stephen McCole) _ mourn at the coffin of their
recently deceased mother, who in flashback is shown comforting her
wee ones during a scary thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner have they kissed her goodbye and deposited keepsakes
beside her body than they repair to a local pub where Thomas
lurches onto the stage to sing his mother's favorite song, ``The
Air That I Breathe.'' To the vast amusement of the onlookers,
Thomas collapses midsong into a blubbering heap.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Michael promptly gets into a brawl with Duncan
(Malcolm Shields), one of the jeering patrons, and finds himself
stabbed in the abdomen. Bleeding profusely, he rushes outside the
bar, where he runs into John and tells him what happened. John goes
ballistic, vowing to kill Duncan. He recruits his embittered cousin
Tanga (who delivers Chinese food) as an ally, and the pair spend
the rest of the movie cruising around Glasgow in Tanga's truck with
a sawed-off shotgun looking for Duncan and along the way nearly
raping and killing two of Tanga's takeout customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Michael decides not to seek treatment for his wound.
Instead he plans to go to work early the next morning and pretend
he was injured in an industrial accident and sue for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The Flynns' sister is no day at the beach either. Impatient to
leave the church where Thomas insists on remaining overnight with
their mother's coffin, Sheila, who is mentally and physically
disabled and confined to a wheelchair, leaves the premises and has
a series of misadventures after her vehicle gets stuck in a rut.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila is the kind of person who is so wound up with rage that
she often doesn't deign to reply when other people address her. In
Stevenson's portrayal, she emerges a grumpy little beast dispensing
hostility and malice at every turn. As if the atmosphere weren't
already tempestuous enough, a violent storm erupts, causing power
failures around the city.
</P>
<P>
   As the Flynn siblings survive one mishap after another, the
movie settles into being an uproarious knockabout farce larded with
the kind of gross-out jokes you would expect to find in a Farrelly
Brothers comedy. But instead of having a prankish adolescent joie
de vivre, these bits have a meaner Swiftian edge.
</P>
<P>
   The awful things people say and do to one another don't emanate
from an impulse to make mischief so much as from a deep-seated
anger and frustration. When the characters lash out, they hope to
inflict permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   Like most satires whose point is to remind us that beneath our
civilized surfaces we're no better than beasts, ``Orphans'' doesn't
really know where to carry its misanthropy. After ridiculing the
Flynn siblings' sentimentality, the movie ends up feeling sorry for
them as they finally gather, much the worse for wear, for their
mother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The only way a movie like this can finally shoot the moon is
have the world come to an end in one final self-destructive spasm.
But that was already done in ``Dr. Strangelove.'' At the end of
``Orphans,'' life creeps on. &QL;

`MODEL BEHAVIOR': TIRED PLOT, LOTS OF GUEST-STARS  
 `CAITLIN'S WAY': NEW SERIES ABOUT AN UNHAPPY TEEN-AGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of reviews. Time and station are

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alex Burrows has a terrible life. She's 16, shy, insecure and
dateless. At a party, when she tries to talk to the boy she has a
crush on, she just humiliates herself. And home is no better. Her
little brother is a tattletale, and her father forces her to put on
a chef's hat and coat and work on weekends for his catering
company. Honestly, she might as well be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in her bedroom, flipping through a magazine, she sees
pictures of Janine Adams, a teen-age supermodel, and wonders why
she can't have a glamorous life like Janine's. Fashion shoots!
Trips to Paris! Partying with the stars! Well, she's going to get
her chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Model Behavior,'' Sunday night's ``Wonderful World of Disney''
movie, is the story of how Alex and Janine _ who happen to look
exactly alike when Alex takes off her glasses and lets her
tied-back hair loose _ decide to trade places for a week. It's a
grass-is-greener ``Prince and the Pauper'' plot, played as teen-age
tragicomedy, with guest stars of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   For young viewers there's Justin Timberlake, a member of the pop
group 'N Sync, as another famous model. For the grownups there's
Kathie Lee Gifford, already practicing for life after Regis Philbin
(she announced recently that she was leaving their morning talk
show this year), as Janine's pushy stage mother. Gifford's
9-year-old son, Cody, has a small role in the film, too, as
Janine's ambitious little brother, off to Aruba for his first
modeling job. Vendela, the model, also has a cameo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Model Behavior'' has its small charms (it's great fun when
Janine talks back to Alex's teacher) and is sure to be watched by
its young target audience, but it's riddled with unimaginative,
trite elements that smell suspiciously of an ``oh, heck, it's good
enough for kids, they won't know any better'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   When Janine and Alex (both played by Maggie Lawson) meet,
bumping into each other at a book-signing party for Janine's new
memoir, naturally Alex is carrying a tray full of canapes. And
although the tray hits Janine directly in the face, her hair,
makeup and valuable facial features emerge miraculously undamaged.
There should at least have been traces of a cheese ball sticking to
her nose. When Alex, pretending to be Janine, takes her nervous
personal assistant, Monique, skating, the scene naturally ends with
Monique falling down.
</P>
<P>
   The film even does the old person-mistaking-lookalike-for-mirror
act (which was done much better by Lucille Ball and Harpo Marx and,
in a recent variation, by David Duchovny in an episode of ``The
X-Files''). Mark Rosman, the director, calls this version ``a very
fun scene.'' But the premise doesn't even make sense in this
instance, since one of the two people has to be intentionally
mimicking the other's movements and expressions. Not the case here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Model Behavior'' ignores that, just as it has neither Alex nor
Janine make any real effort to pretend to know her lookalike's
friends and family. Once in a while, luckily, that works, as when
Janine takes one look at Alex's little brother, Josh, and says,
``Are we related?'' Josh takes the comment as sarcasm and replies,
``Only genetically.''
</P>
<P>
   The film does make Janine's desire to trade places with Alex
believable, too. She's absolutely ready to give up 5 a.m. workouts
and business parties with people 20 years her senior, and she's
dying to order out for pizza and Chinese food, even if it means she
gains a pound or two.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Clark, who plays Josh, is a standout. So is Karen Hines,
who plays the eager-to-please Monique. Gifford's work is uneven,
but she doesn't have much depth of character to work with. As
Janine's mother, she has lines like ``When I was a model, we did
everything our handlers told us to,'' and ``Have you been pigging
out on peanut butter cups again?''
</P>
<P>
   The truth comes out at the Greenfield High Fall Ball, with
appropriate statements by characters who have learned lessons from
the experience. Gifford's character, for instance, is going to
respect Janine's need to be just a regular teen-ager now and then.
And everyone finds true love or at least a dancing partner, even
Cody.

   Go West, Young Woman
</P>
<P>
   Yet another unhappy teen-age girl, Caitlin (Lindsay Felton), is
the heroine of Nickelodeon's new series ``Caitlin's Way.'' She's a
tough New York orphan who has run through six foster families in
two years. In Saturday night's hourlong preview episode, she learns
that her dead mother does have a living relative after all, a
cousin, and lucky Caitlin is going to live with her and her family.
In Montana. Oh no, says the worldly, obviously sensitive Caitlin,
``those people are weird out in the sticks.'' The show, which seems
false and awkward in the city, seems more at home out West.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin, whose defense mechanism is taking photographs of
anything that disturbs her, soon learns that out in ``the sticks''
there are killer wolves and rustlers. And that this new family
(``the cop, the vet and the geek _ I guess things could be worse'')
may stick with her. In the show's first regular half-hour on
Sunday, the vet-cousin (Cynthia Belliveau) decides it's time to
tame Bandit, who is beautiful as a wild horse but has to learn the
rules with his new family. Nice metaphor.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ All the negative news about Sotheby's and Christie's
since the federal antitrust investigation heated up last month has
left the art world wondering what these auction house giants will
have to sell at their important spring sales in New York in May. So
Christie's was eager to send out the word that one of the stars of
its sale of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works on May 8 _
and the cover art for the sale catalog _ will be what it calls the
most important Caillebotte ever to come on the auction market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Balcony, Boulevard Haussmann,'' painted in 1880,
depicts the back of a man who experts think was the the artist's
lawyer, Albert Courtier, looking out at the boulevard from the
balcony of Caillebotte's Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of Impressionist painters, much of the work has to
do with light and shadow. A sun-dappled cityscape is angled in the
distance, while the intricately painted ironwork in the foreground
separates inside from out. The work centers on the figure of the
man, who is shaded by a red-and-white awning.
</P>
<P>
   Caillebotte had moved into his sixth-floor apartment just a year
before he painted ``Man on the Balcony'' and was fascinated with
the architectural views of Paris, especially the new buildings he
could see from his vantage. ``The perspective and the composition
are particularly modern,'' said Franck Giraud, who heads Christie's
19th- and 20th-century art department. ``The way the view is set at
a diagonal looking west over Paris was quite radical for its
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Caillebotte gave the painting to Courtier. After the lawyer's
death in the early years of the century his estate sold it to a
Jean Metthey, a Paris dealer, then put it up at auction in Paris in
1946. It was bought by George Courturat, another Parisian
collector, and has been in the Courturat family ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleague in Geneva Thomas Seydoux knew the owners and had
been talking with them about selling the painting for years,'' said
Giraud, who added that their decision to sell this spring had to do
with both the strength of the market and a desire to begin some
estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, expected to sell for $6 million to $8 million, has
been exhibited in several major shows, most recently ``Gustave
Caillebotte: Urban Impressionist,'' which opened at the Grand
Palais in Paris in 1994 and then traveled to the Art Institute of
Chicago and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ART NOW? NOT NOW
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has abandoned its plans to hold a second evening sale
of contemporary art in May. After the November sales it announced
it was initiating ``Contemporary Art Now,'' an auction devoted to
art from the last 20 years, purposely to keep up with with
Christie's, whose contemporary-art auctions cover 1970 to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``When talking to clients, I could feel the resistance to having
a third evening contemporary-art sale,'' said Tobias Meyer,
director of contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide. ``We had the
material and could have pulled it off. But at this moment I'd
prefer to have one really energetic sale.'' Meyer said, however,
that he still wanted ``to keep the door open'' such an auction in
the future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IN A TOKYO TOWER
</P>
<P>
   Minoru Mori, president and chief executive of the Mori Building
Co., the largest developer in Japan, is planning a museum devoted
to 20th- and 21st-century art, architecture and design. The Mori
Art Center will be a Kunsthalle, a museum without its own
collection. It will be part of a $2.5 billion complex, the largest
private urban redevelopment in Japan, with residential towers,
movie complexes, restaurants and shops. It is to open in early 2003
in the Roppongi district of central Tokyo, on the 51st to 54th
floors of an office building with an observation deck providing
panoramic views of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese public still loves Impressionist rather than
contemporary art,'' Mori said. ``I wanted to help make the public
more aware of newer art.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori, a member of the Museum of Modern Art's International
Council, has asked the Modern to serve as the museum's cultural
partner and artistic adviser. ``We have an arrangement to give the
museum guidance, to help them build a first-class institution,''
said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern. ``We will also
periodically make available to them exhibitions.'' The new museum
will pay the same fees the Modern charges as for any traveling
exhibition, Lowery said, and is paying it a consulting fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Mori Art Center has also established a collaborative
arrangement with the Royal Academy of Art in London.
</P>
<P>
   A WHITNEY AWARD
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that the Tate Gallery in London, the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum and the Cooper-Hewitt in New York, and the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art all have their own awards programs;
now the Whitney Museum of Art is getting into the act. It plans to
give a $100,000 prize every two years to an emerging artist living
and working in the United States. The winner will be chosen from
the artists included in the Whitney's Biennial exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Named the Bucksbaum Award, it has been established by the
Bucksbaum Family Foundation of Des Moines, Iowa, run by Melva
Bucksbaum, a Whitney trustee since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some months now we had been thinking of launching an
artist-in-residence program as a way of championing emerging
artists,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Each winner will spend two years participating in the museum's
graduate and independent study programs as well as public events,
like lectures and symposiums. At some point during the residency
the artist's work will be on view as part of the museum's
continuing contemporary-art series.
</P>
<P>
   The first winner is to be chosen in April by a jury of five arts
professionals. &QL;

A SOUND COLLECTION: TEXAN'S MACHINES REVEAL THE REVOLUTION OF
ELECTRONICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: N.J., N.Y.) 
(Eds.: Photos available on NYT database) 
 
By MARTY RACINE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYTOWN, Texas _ Bob Botto shows off a remarkable piece of
technology in his dining room. It's encased in rich wood grain, and
the ``top works,'' or hardware, are exquisitely crafted.
</P>
<P>
   This item is so revolutionary it reproduces sound without
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   It is an 1892 Edison Class M business phonograph.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to attribute the Information Age to computer technology.
But, as Botto's Houston-area home reveals, the electronic continuum
dates to the 1800s, when inventors, many of them immigrants,
advanced the means of communication and defined the American
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Botto, an analytical chemist for Exxon, and his wife, Kathy, who
runs the couple's antique radio and record player shop, own more
than quaint, fanciful machines. These are artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Edison invented the Class M phonograph in 1888 as a
recording and playback device for office dictations; phonographs
for home entertainment weren't produced until a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The machine was battery-powered, with sound imprinted on a wax
cylinder that fit onto a spindle, or mandrel. It's a classic, Botto
says. ``One of these comes along in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought it from a Dallas collector who called one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is one you really want, it's missing
(parts),'' the collector told him. ``But, oh, let's see, I'm paying
$1,200 for it, I'll let you have it for $2,400.''
</P>
<P>
   Botto went up immediately and claimed it. Moments later another
collector called, offering $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   He rebuilt the motor and top works, and found an original
bichromate battery _ ``so rare, it's the only one I've ever seen''
_ for $700. A wood expert restored the housing.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase included a box of cylinders that rank among the
first commercial recordings. Produced by the Chicago Talking
Machine Co., one was a march conducted by John Phillip Souza,
recorded in 1892.
</P>
<P>
   Botto regards the cylinder with awe: ``It's very, very
precious.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`HERE IT IS, AN EDISON PHONOGRAPH' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Botto, 50, grew up in Buffalo, N.Y., as a curious sort. He was
fascinated with electricity and magnetism, loved museums, and
collected rocks and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   While in college, he met Kathy, a high school junior, on a bus
transporting their respective church youth groups to Syracuse. Bob
happened to have one of his inventions, ``light solution.'' Add
water and it emits light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carried it around in a little bottle. You never know when
you might need it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a chemist. He lived in the basement. He didn't think
about women. But he mustered the courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like to see my light solution?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kathy enrolled at the State University of New
York-Buffalo in history, Bob was at Cornell in Ithaca working on
his Ph.D. in geochemistry. But the long-distance relationship
blossomed. They married during their respective final years in
school, and in 1975 Bob was hired at Exxon's chemical plant in
Baytown, a city of 68,000 people about 15 miles east of downtown
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bob had no apparent interest in vintage communications
equipment. But in 1983 he was driving home from a chemical
conference in Waco when he stopped to rest in Hiedenhiemer. There
was a junk shop across the street.
</P>
<P>
   As he perused old telephones and such, the white-haired
shopkeeper spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here, I've got just what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   From beneath the counter he produced a wooden box filled with
rusted parts and spiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is, an Edison phonograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Botto saw only rusty parts and spiders. But he was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   The man wanted $25; Botto had $19.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, you take it and send me a check.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A STORE IS BORN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was an 1899 Edison. Botto began assembling it. The
trial-and-error process, he figured, was not dissimilar to that of
inventing.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later he had it playing. Botto was enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I'd play this machine for everybody who
walked in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he wanted more. He hunted specimens that today are
``virtually nonexistent,'' or ``so historic you would never see
one.''
</P>
<P>
   To Kathy they were contraptions cluttering the house. But she
grew fond of antique radios. She began collecting and restoring,
and joined the Houston Vintage Radio Club.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1985, Bob and Kathy recognized the inevitable: All
our stuff will keep increasing, then we'll need to get rid of some
because we'll find better stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: a store. Kathy runs Vintage Sounds in northwest
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider her a technological historian,'' Bob says.

 &QL; 
A LITTLE HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Edison, born in 1849, is The Man. Fascinated with science
and nature, he devised things that helped people, Botto says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had knowledge of what people wanted. And he had a powerful
ability to get people working on something and make it improved.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest invention was neither the phonograph nor the light
bulb. It was the research laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were scientific laboratories in universities, but none
produced inventions except by accident. Edison was the first to put
together an industrial research laboratory and say we're going to
invent, manufacture and market things all out of this laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   Edison invented the tinfoil phonograph in 1878. By the 1890s his
Standard, more portable than the Class M, was a home fixture.
Spring-powered for uniformity of speed, it was equipped with
octopuslike listening tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Others copied the Edison model. Columbia boasted of its 1895
graphophone, ``It talks, laughs, plays and sings. Strictly
high-class entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   The graphophone and Edison's phonograph reproduced sound waves
incised vertically onto the cylinder. Simultaneously, German
immigrant Emile Berliner in Philadelphia invented the gramophone,
with sound incised laterally onto a disc, or ``plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand-cranked gramophone didn't compete with the Edison until
1896 when Eldridge R. Johnson of nearby Camden, N.J., produced
Berliner's first spring-powered unit. The phonograph became popular
when Johnson in 1900 produced a plate from a wax master (rather
than a crude zinc disc). And when the Victor Talking Machine Co.
developed superior electric-process plates, Edison's cylinder
phonograph was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   By whatever format, talking machines disseminated popular
culture at the dawn of mass marketing. A recording comedian known
as Uncle Josh cut an episode in 1910 titled ``Uncle Josh Buys an
Automobile.'' It begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've done it, yes sir, Nancy nagged at me until I bought
an automobile. Nancy said the Willets had one and the Weavers had
one and here we were riding around in a buckboard behind a
bone-rattling horse that was blind on the offside. I hadn't been
a-hankerin' for that gasoline wagon, but in order to keep peace in
the family I sold four head of cattle, some hogs, 10 ton of hay and
put a mortgage on the farm and bought an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all Pumpkin Center turned out to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1917 Victor released a radical new music called the Jass One
Step by the Dixieland Jass Band. Botto owns this, the very first
jazz recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody heard anything but ballads, marches, sacred music and
classical,'' Botto says. ``Columbia first recorded the song, then
passed on releasing it. So (the band) went to Victor, which had a
little more snap. They said, hey, maybe some people might like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL; 
A PAIR OF MUSEUMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Bottos' two daughters left home, their upstairs
bedrooms morphed into museums, one for Kathy's radios, the other
for Bob's newest passion, communications.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Wireless Room. Illuminated by an 1890s Edison
bulb, it features oddities like the magneto electric machine.
Invented in 1854, it produced a magnetic current for therapeutic
purposes. But by harnessing the relationship between magnetism and
electricity, it presaged the concept of radio.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the first telegraph, or sounder, invented by Samuel Morse
in 1860 and manufactured by Charles L. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1875 Williams leased his Boston workshop to a fellow named
Alexander Graham Bell, who with Williams' technician, Thomas
Watson, invented the telephone. It became practical when Edison
invented the carbon button transmitter in 1877.
</P>
<P>
   The country would soon be strung with telephone and telegraph
lines. Cities would choke on them. What if, some mused, we could
communicate without wires?
</P>
<P>
   In 1890, Edouard Branley formed a circuit, or coherence, between
two electrodes hooked to a battery and relay. He called his device
the coherer.
</P>
<P>
   Botto's 1897 coherer looks like a primitive bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the very, very first device to receive radio
transmission. Believe me, there's not many of these around.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian-born Guglielmo Marconi applied the coherer to
communications. He was more visionary than inventor, Botto says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put the idea in front of people so they could understand
what you can do with (an invention). Before him, it was just a
laboratory curiosity.``
</P>
<P>
   Marconi developed ship-to-shore communication, and in 1901 he
transmitted Morse code across the Atlantic. After the sinking of
the Titanic, all ships at sea were required to have a wireless
operator aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The first wireless voice transmission was in 1906, but voice
wasn't feasible until Lee DeForest, the ``father of modern radio,''
invented an electron tube that amplified signals.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural radio broadcast was in 1920 over Pittsburgh
station KDKA. A year later Westinghouse produced a crystal receiver
that required no headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Now technology followed you anywhere.

KOHL SAYS HE HAS RAISED FUNDS TO COVER FINES ON CDU 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Helmut Kohl, the former German chancellor, emerged from
weeks of seclusion Thursday to announce that generous friends and a
mortgage on his house had enabled him to raise enough money to
cover the financial damage suffered by the Christian Democratic
party as a result of his ``mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing alternately jocular and irascible, Kohl broke his
silence at a news conference where he brandished a list of 30
friends and admirers _ including actresses, film producers and
businessmen _ who he said had contributed to the raising of $2.95
million.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who unified Germany a decade ago, has admitted accepting
just over $1 million in secret _ and thus illegal _ payments
between 1993 and 1998. His actions have exposed the party to fines
of $3.15 million and set off a crisis of the dominant political
force in postwar Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the $3.15 million, Kohl said, ``I will soon be in a
position to transfer the entire sum to the treasurer of the
Christian Democratic Union.'' He added, ``I made a mistake and I
want to try to repair the financial damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not financial damage that has principally hurt the
Christian Democrats. Rather, it has been the prolonged sight of the
once venerated Kohl defying the law by refusing to name the people
who secretly gave him money while he was in power.
</P>
<P>
   To see Europe's preeminent statesman of the last decade reduced
Thursday to revealing the amount of money raised by the mortgaging
of his house _ $250,000 _ was to appreciate the extraordinary
downward turn in Kohl's life over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   On the central issue of legality and trust, where Kohl has
maintained that his ``word of honor'' prevents him from revealing
the identities of donors to whom he guaranteed anonymity, there was
no sign of any shift Thursday. ``I have no intention of changing my
position,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Christian Democrats will certainly be relieved to
receive the promised financial assistance, they would be much
happier with a list of the donors between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Democratic Union welcomes every contribution
that will help us in our difficult financial situation,'' said
Wolfgang Schauble, Kohl's successor as party leader who himself
announced his resignation in February. ``But loss of trust requires
explanations that cannot be replaced with money alone.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although apparently schooled by his aides to appear humble and
contrite Thursday, Kohl, 69, bristled visibly when a journalist
asked if he was trying to buy an ``indulgence'' _ a remission for
past sins _ through his fund-raising drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with indulgences, nothing whatever,''
Kohl shot back. ``That is an absurd suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats, in opposition now after 16 years in
government under Kohl that ended in 1998, have forced the former
chancellor to resign as honorary chairman and canceled a lavish
70th-birthday celebration that had been planned for April. But they
have been unable to persuade him to talk openly.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kohl did produce one list Thursday _ that of the donors who he
said have helped him raise money in recent weeks. The single
largest contribution, he said, was made by Leo Kirch, a close
friend and the head of the Kirch media group, who gave $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other contributions were made by the British publisher, Lord
Weidenfeld, the president of Nestle, Helmut Maucher; the German
newspaper publisher, Erich Schumann; and the actress Uschi Glass.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said the contributions, which cannot be claimed as tax
write-offs, were being collected in account number 1216175 of a
Commerzbank branch in Essen. He appealed to citizens of Germany and
the European Union to give freely.
</P>
<P>
   Among the donors were Kohl himself and his wife, Hannelore,
weighing in with $350,000, raised partly through the mortgaging of
their house in Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim and partly from the former
chancellor's savings.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said he intended to restore his financial situation by
writing his memoirs and publishing them next year. It seemed
unlikely, however, that this promised book would shed any further
light on the identity of the donors because the former chancellor
appears to be convinced that he is morally bound to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks that everything he did was for the good of Germany
and so he does not have to bother with small details like the
law,'' said Christian von Westinghausen, a Berlin lawyer. ``This
was the performance of a king, a monarch late in his life who has
lost touch with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Christian Democrats have been fined $21 million for
the acceptance of various illegal contributions during Kohl's
chancellorship. Imposing the fine in February, Wolfgang Thierse,
the Social Democratic speaker of Parliament, said pointedly,
``There are no provisions in the law for words of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats, who enjoyed a string of successes in
state and local elections last year as the government of Social
Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder floundered, have seen their
support plunge in recent months. The party lost in the state of
Schleswig-Holstein in February, but performed well enough to
suggest that it would not disintegrate as Italy's Christian
Democrats did in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has every chance now to come out of its current
malaise,'' Kohl said, without spelling out his reasons for this
opinion. It is currently leaderless and will choose a replacement
for Schauble later in March.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hahne, a commentator on German television, suggested that
Kohl was mistaken. ``He portrayed this as a coup, a demonstration
of the wide support he has from people in the country,'' Hahne
said. ``But the fact is this drama may well prove unending for the
Christian Democrats as long as the names have not been revealed.''

 &HT;    Increasing number of employees face more work but no overtime
pay
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David Worley is seeing firsthand the pangs of a
hard-charging economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 2 1/2 years, the Atlanta attorney said he has filed
two dozen lawsuits _ twice his usual number _ from workers who say
they're not being adequately paid for working overtime. His list of
clients includes accountants, construction workers, parking lot
attendants, television industry technicians, office clerks,
security guards and health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   Working overtime has become the norm in the booming economy as
more companies pile more work on existing employees because they
can't find new ones to hire. Many workers aren't taking the extra
workload lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their employers are forcing them to work longer and longer
hours but failing to pay them the required overtime,'' said Worley,
whose own workload has increased as he works on behalf of
overworked workers.
</P>
<P>
   His latest case involves five CVS pharmacists in Georgia, four
of whom are in metro Atlanta, and whether they are exempt from
overtime provisions. The pharmacists allege they routinely worked
60 to 70 hours a week but weren't getting overtime. CVS disputes
the claim but declined to discuss the case in detail. Says CVS
spokesman Todd Andrews: ``We have examined the plaintiffs' case and
believe it has no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes likely will become more common as the economic
good times, tight labor market and low unemployment stretch on _
and continue to stretch workers thin.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the overtime issue arose as Congress is considering
a bill to raise the minimum wage. The provisions, tucked inside the
voluminous bill, ask that certain inside sales employees and
computer professionals be exempt from overtime requirements. Who is
entitled to overtime and who isn't is at the heart of legislation
dating from the 1930s. Today, roughly six in 10 American workers
are entitled to overtime under the law.
</P>
<P>
   It continues to be a source of frustration for workers and their
employers. A check of recent overtime violations shows the numbers
are on the rise. In fiscal year 1999, which ran from October 1998
through September 1999, the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and
Hour division determined that some 100,000 U.S. workers were owed
about $62.3 million in overtime pay. So far in fiscal year 2000 _
just over five months _ about 75,000 workers are due $46.4 million
in overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violation rates seem to be climbing,'' says John McKeon,
Atlanta-based deputy regional administrator for the U.S. Department
of Labor's Wage and Hour division. ``The tight labor market makes
it harder for companies to attract workers and as a consequence
they may work their existing employees more hours and don't pay the
proper overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Wage and Hour Administrator Michael Kerr recently testified
before Congress that production and nonsupervisory workers were
logging more overtime than a decade ago: The average weekly
overtime hours in 1999 were 4.6 hours, compared with 3.8 hours in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Personnel Decision International found that
more than half the 600 full-time workers surveyed said their work
week has increased in the last five years, with the average work
week totalling close to 50 hours. Of those who were working more
hours, 44 percent said they were putting in more than 50 hours.
They attributed the increased time on the job to increased demands
from their company.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the overtime dispute is a set of federal laws
fashioned under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which
among other things ushered in the 40-hour work week and promised to
make life easier for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Labor Standards Act, established in 1938, governs
record-keeping, wage and hour, child labor and overtime. It
essentially says exempt workers _ those who aren't managers or
professionals performing certain highly skilled tasks _ should be
paid overtime (usually time and a half) for working beyond 40 hours
a week. The law has been amended and grown more complicated over
time.
</P>
<P>
   The debate illustrates how much the nature of work has changed
since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated updates, observers say, the law has become
outdated because of technological and sociological changes. Also,
new categories of jobs such as computer programmers and help-desk
workers have created gray areas in the law, making it hard for
employers to figure out who is entitled to overtime and who isn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of computer jobs, some workers are exempt under
provisions written into the federal law in 1996, yet whether
overtime pay applies to scores of others is unclear, says Tim
Bartl, assistant general counsel for LPA, a trade group
representing senior human resource executives of major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the gray area. It's a different type of work and
different type of compensation,'' such as stock options, that
exists now, Bartl added. ``It's a new dynamic and creative work
environment. The government needs to figure out a way to make it
easier for employers to determine who gets overtime and who
doesn't. Right now as the law stands, it's very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta attorney Ann Hale-Smith agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the economy we have now, there are so many more different
kinds of jobs than there used to be,'' said the attorney with the
Atlanta law firm of Irvin, Stanford &AMP; Kessler, which represents
management in labor and employment law disputes. ``You have jobs in
high tech that didn't exist five years ago. We've gone to more of a
service economy vs. manufacturing, and they don't fit into the neat
categories that jobs fit into 30 or 15 years ago when you could
clearly say somebody was blue, white or pink collar. That's not
true anymore, and the law is struggling to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Worley doesn't buy Hale-Smith's argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an excuse a lot of employers use to violate the law,''
he said. ``They say the workplace is changing and the laws were
passed in 1938. Fact is, the law was passed so that people would
not be overworked, and the way that's enforced is that the law
requires you be paid time and a half. That's not something
employers and workers can negotiate around.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more prevalent is the growing use of independent
contractors, part-time and temporary help workers, most of whom
aren't getting overtime pay or traditional benefits, legal experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Some) companies are hiring contractors and working them far
more than 40 hours, but not paying them overtime either,'' Worley
noted. While the debate over overtime rages on, the booming economy
has provided overworked workers with another option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If excessive amounts of overtime are required, employees will
vote with their feet by leaving,'' says Les Hough, executive
director of the Usery Center for The Workplace at Georgia State
University. ``That only exacerbates the problem. Turnover has
become a chief irritant in retaining employees.''

 &HT;    HOUSE PANEL RESTORES MONEY FOR PRINCEVILLE STUDY
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Appropriations Committee reinstated
funding Thursday for a $1.5 million federal study on raising the
dike that protects the historic town of Princeville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The money had been dropped earlier this week from a Republican
plan to provide more than $347 million in flood aid for victims of
last year's Hurricane Floyd. The action angered many people,
including Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., who called the omission
``unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Thursday that dropping the $1.5 million was ``a
mix-up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't intend to take this one out,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill
Young, R-Fla., chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The money
was mistakenly grouped with another project that was rejected, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their story and they're sticking to it,'' said Clayton,
whose district includes Princeville. But she added that the
explanation ``could be true,'' and she was grateful to the GOP
leadership for their help in putting together a good emergency aid
package.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study and the
overall flood aid is part of an $8.8 billion supplemental spending
bill for the current fiscal year. The bill includes nearly $5
billion for peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and $1.7 billion for
drug intervention in Colombia. The Appropriations Committee was
expected to vote on it late Thursday after several hours of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., an outspoken critic of foreign aid,
said he would vote in favor of the measure, despite his
reservations about the money included for foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to vote for any legislation that will help the
people of eastern North Carolina,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton attended part of the committee hearing with Delia
Perkins, the mayor of Princeville, who was in Washington lobbying
for aid. Rep. David Price, D-N.C., introduced both Clayton and
Perkins in the hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great coincidence,'' said Clayton, that Perkins was
in the capital. ``She was our ace in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeville, the oldest town in the country incorporated by
freed slaves, gained widespread attention last year in the
aftermath of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Edgecombe County town was submerged in 23 feet of water for
10 days after heavy rains sent the Tar River over the dike. Almost
all of the town's 650 homes, 30 businesses and three churches were
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased,'' Perkins said about the emergency aid.
``It's very good _ not only for Princeville but for the surrounding
communities.''

RUSSIAN JOURNALIST AND OIL EXECUTIVE DIE IN PLANE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A top Russian investigative journalist and a leading
petroleum executive were among nine people killed early Thursday
when a chartered jet crashed on takeoff from Moscow's main domestic
airport, Sheremetyevo One.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Artyom Borovik, and the head of the oil-trading
company Alliance Group, Ziya Bazhayev, had taken off for Kiev when
the three-engine Yak-40 passenger jet apparently tipped sideways
and slammed into the runway. Two other oil-company employees and
five crew members also died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   There was immediate speculation that the two men had been slain
in one of the violent feuds that periodically rock the top echelons
of Russian industry and politics. Moscow transportation
investigators opened a criminal inquiry into whether the flight
violated air-safety rules, and one official told the Interfax news
service that a terrorist act had not been ruled out as a cause of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Federal Security Service, the domestic
successor to the Soviet KGB, said Thursday night that Bashayev, who
is of Chechen descent, had received threats because he had refused
to supply weapons to rebels in the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way to document that accusation. Nor was there
any evidence of foul play. Witnesses said that one wing of the jet
struck the runway during takeoff, causing the aircraft to cartwheel
and break up just after it left the ground. The plane's flight-data
recorder was recovered and will be analyzed for evidence of the
cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Borovik, reported to be 38 or 39, was something of a legend in
Russian journalism. The son of a famous Soviet-era foreign
correspondent, he himself became famous for his highly critical
dispatches on the war in Afghanistan. His articles, published just
as Mikhail Gorbachev had begun loosening controls over freedom of
expression, caused a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, he built a small media conglomerate called
Sovershenno Sekretno Holding _ the words mean ``top secret'' _
which produced newspapers and television programs with an
investigative bent. His television program bearing that name was
bounced off Russia's state-controlled RTR network last June after
delving into political corruption. It had an eight-year run.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives said then that the program was smearing major
political figures to maintain its huge popularity. But Borovik
contended that the move signaled the Kremlin's intention to subdue
the press before the winter's parliamentary elections and the 2000
presidential campaign _ a prediction which has largely come true.
</P>
<P>
   Bazhayev's Alliance Group was well known in petroleum-industry
circles. But unlike some Russian tycoons who have won both wealth
and notoriety in the oil business, his was not a household name.
Industry analysts said the Bazhayev company was an oil broker,
buying and reselling petroleum shipments, and an adviser to other
oil companies undergoing restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Bazhayev, who would have been 40 in July, served in the
mid-1990s as the president of Yunko, a government-controlled
enterprise created to manage Chechnya's petroleum business. He
later became head of a huge but financially troubled oil producer,
Sidanko. The company has since gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian business press, Bazhayev's company was
struggling this month with Sidanko executives over the disposition
of a Sidanko subsidiary deeply in debt to Alliance Group.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the two men were flying to Kiev. An
Alliance Group executive was quoted on Moscow television as saying
that Borovik and Bashayev were old friends and were discussing a
joint business venture. Other reports, none of them confirmed,
stated that Borovik was planning to expand distribution of his
publications in Ukraine, or that he was investigating Russian
involvement in the Ukrainian aluminum industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two men's private Yak-40 jet, which was 24 years old, was
due to be retired in July 2001, but the plane's owners said it was
in excellent mechanical condition. The pilot was said to have
logged more than 7,000 hours in the air.

 &HT;    Straight Talk Express didn't keep up with Bush campaign
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, ARIZ. _ John McCain had never lost an election before
the South Carolina primary and his unfamiliarity with giving a
concession speech showed on election night last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than congratulate George W. Bush and let it go at that,
McCain gave an angry speech that attacked Bush as, in effect, an
empty suit.
</P>
<P>
   His jaw tight and his speech clipped, McCain looked nothing like
the happy warrior who caravaned through New Hampshire on the way to
a stunning victory.
</P>
<P>
   McCain the man had been on the receiving end of so much negative
advertising and campaigning, including allegations that he fathered
children out of wedlock and approved of abortion, that he might
have been excused for a little anger.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain the politician should have known that the campaign
was going to get rough after Bush lost New Hampshire and found
himself under siege by supporters who were wondering what was going
on.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took it personally and he let it show, and the moment may
have marked a turning point in his campaign. ``The reaction of the
McCain camp to the South Carolina loss started the downward spiral
because it got them fundamentally away from the message that had
elevated them and provided the excitement to that point,'' said
Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who is not affiliated with either
campaign. ``It's almost as though their anger at the Bush campaign
tactics clouded their political judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reform, McCain's main line of attack was to criticize
Bush for negative campaigning. After Pat Robertson weighed in in
Michigan with anti-McCain telephone calls, the Arizona Republican
unleashed a memorable speech that branded Robertson and the Rev.
Jerry Falwell ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   He did himself no favors when the next day he used the word evil
to describe the two men, even if he was joking, as he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The speech played well in some circles, but among Republicans,
particularly conservative Republicans, McCain's comments were a
call to battle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ran poorly among Republicans in most primaries, but his
comments appeared to galvanize social conservative voters behind
Bush's campaign. ``We may not like Bush, but we have to stop
McCain,'' said Steve Frank, a leader of California conservatives,
describing the tenor of a flood of e-mail messages in the days
before Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a true-blue Republican with a 17-year voting record
that left little doubt about his conservatism, but he was finding
it very difficult to come by Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   Independents and Democrats, attracted by his story and his call
for reform, showed no reluctance to vote for him. And their
support, which McCain contends is crucial if Republicans are to win
the White House, may be his campaign's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and independents do not a Republican nominee make.
</P>
<P>
   A telltale sign of McCain's problems in this regard came in the
form of a placard at Ohio State University last month that read,
``Republicans for McCain.'' It was a revealing and damaging
statement that a Republican would have to advertise there are other
Republicans behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said McCain's speech, delivered in Robertson's hometown
of Virginia Beach, solidified McCain's place in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech is one more piece of the giant mosaic that McCain
has constructed that says, 'I am the Democratic, independent, media
candidate for the Republican nomination,'' Sabato said. ``The
problem is that in the end, to get the nomination, you have to be a
Republican candidate for the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of McCain's exit from the race and
some costly errors that have hurt in recent weeks, it is easy to
underestimate what McCain accomplished in his 14-month campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, they've done a remarkable job given the
resources at their disposal,'' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain always knew that it would take the political equivalent
of a perfect game to win the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed to have too much of everything _ money,
endorsements, organization and a huge lead in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to knock Bush off stride by winning four early
primaries _ New Hampshire, South Carolina, Arizona and Michigan _
then hope that Bush would look like a weak candidate once his aura
of invincibility had been stripped away.
</P>
<P>
   What McCain had to do was introduce himself to voters by means
of his personal history, then provide a platform of reform,
principally of campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear early on that crowds warmed to his optimism and
enthusiasm, all the more remarkable in view of his long struggle as
a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on the presidential scene at a moment when Americans
were looking for someone to believe in, someone not tainted by the
sex and campaign finance scandals that engulfed Washington for the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was, in the words of Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), ``the
antidote to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the reaction to McCain as he went to one town hall
meeting after another in New Hampshire. It helped propel his win in
New Hampshire and sent him to South Carolina with polls showing he
had erased Bush's once sizable lead there and in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment in South Carolina when anything looked
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Having just fled the cold of New Hampshire for sunny South
Carolina, McCain spoke at a breakfast at an antebellum, waterfront
mansion in Beaufort.
</P>
<P>
   Shaded by an enormous water oak heavy with Spanish moss, McCain
stood on the front steps. But many in the overflow crowd urged him
up one step and then another because they could not see.
</P>
<P>
   A delighted McCain complied and hit on a metaphor for his
campaign. ``One step at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he stumbled a few times and watched Bush roll inexorably
toward the nomination. Tuesday's round of voting was the clincher,
as McCain lost nine of 13 contests in what amounted to a nationwide
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by reporters, McCain looked back on his campaign in the
days before Tuesday's primaries. He acknowledged many mistakes,
blaming himself for the many ``idiotic things I've said.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to dwell on any one error. McCain and his aides knew
all along that attacking Falwell and Roberston carried enormous
risks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the campaign, they all insisted it had been the
right thing to do a statement of principle, even if it backfired as
a political tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to say that and you had to say it before the
(Virginia) primary because if we had said it after the primary then
you're not...legitimately giving your criticism and your vision for
the party,'' McCain said the day before the California primary.
</P>
<P>
   This comment was made aboard the Straight Talk Express, the
campaign bus that became a rolling news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the campaign, however, McCain got in trouble on
at least two occasions for remarks he made on the bus. One was the
``evil'' comment, which became front-page news in the New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, McCain and reporters engaged in a tense
back-and-forth over whether he had misled them about his
participation in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion was of no lasting importance, but it showed an
evolution of sorts in a campaign that started off carefree in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that McCain lost either his perspective or
sense of humor. He never blamed a reporter for a piece of bad news,
and he insisted right to the end that the experience of running for
president was the most rewarding of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not enjoy it? Good God, how many people in the world have
this opportunity?'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   And there were events, even in the last days, when he appeared
uplifted by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people waited in the dark for McCain at the Vietnam
memorial in Rochester, N.Y., on a cold, windy night. The candidate
described his initial dislike of the Vietnam memorial in
Washington, D.C.. But he said his view was forever changed when he
saw two grizzled veterans at the wall, touching the names of dead
comrades and crying openly.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished, the campaign fired off streamers that, aided
by the wind, looked like fireworks in the night sky.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So much for De La Hoya versus Coley at the Garden. So
much, come to think of it, for that sprawling prize fight known as
Super Tuesday. The season's most exciting slugfest by far is taking
place at the Circle in the Square Theater, and this one is evenly
matched.
</P>
<P>
   With two of America's finest young actors, Philip Seymour
Hoffman and John C. Reilly, squaring off in the superb new revival
of Sam Shepard's ``True West,'' a clean victory is impossible to
call. Which is entirely appropriate to Shepard's 1980 story of two
brothers locked in an increasingly brutal and increasingly funny
struggle for identity. Hey, it's family. Nobody wins.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of competitions, let's get one crucial thing out of the
way. You've probably heard by now that Reilly and Hoffman are
alternating in the lead roles in ``True West'': those of Austin,
the ingratiating, orderly Hollywood screenwriter, and Lee, his
menacing vagabond of a brother. Rest assured that no matter which
performance of the production you attend, there's no way you're
going to lose.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people I know who went to different single previews of
this ``True West,'' which officially opened Thursday night under
the pitch-perfect direction of Matthew Warchus, have said they
couldn't imagine it being cast any other way. If you've followed
Hoffman's and Reilly's work on film, you probably have your own
ideas of who was meant for which part. Forget it. Whichever way
you've sliced it, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   To see both versions of the current ``True West'' _ and if you
have the time and the money, you must _ is to enrich deeply your
experience of just what good actors can do with the limited
instruments known as the human body and voice.
</P>
<P>
   You'll wind up thinking gratefully about the respective,
resonant flourishes Hoffman and Reilly bring to such activities as
the smashing of a typewriter with a golf club and the buttering of
a mountain of toast. Oh, and let's not forget just how these actors
utter the same, heavily weighted word toward the evening's end:
``Mom!'' But this cross-casting is no gimmick, no self-indulgent
showcase for technique at the expense of the play itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, this production makes a persuasive case for
``True West'' as a great American play, arguably Shepard's finest.
The contrast of the two versions, which are similarly staged but
quite different in tone, also shows the incredible variety that can
be harvested from a work this fertile without betraying its
essential nature.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``True West,'' which follows Austin and Lee through a
period of uneasy cohabitation in their absent mother's California
house, is specifically anchored in time and place, it also has a
primal, even eternal quality. And as funny as it is, it is equally
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   True, Shepard uses his family portrait to practice some gleeful
marksmanship with such familiar targets as Hollywood deal-making
and the dime store illusions bred by the movies. But he also looks
deeper to suggest the tenacious hold of the idea of the frontier on
the American imagination and its attendant fantasies of escape.
</P>
<P>
   He discredits that particular myth (the true West of the title,
his characters observe sorrowfully, is long gone), just as he does
that alternative American Eden, the sunny, safe and nurturing
suburbia. The mighty American family, however, endures in Shepard's
world as a baleful pole star, just as it did in the tragedies of
Aeschylus and Sophocles. Even though its members may try to lose
themselves in the blankness of places like the Mojave Desert,
they're not about to wriggle free of the stranglehold they have on
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Family, as Lee cheerfully points out, is the frame in which a
majority of homicides take place. Though it is classically the
institution that fosters and bolsters the sense of individual self
against the world, for Shepard's characters, it is what gnaws away
at the edges of individual identity.
</P>
<P>
   The young man who returns to the decaying homestead in ``Buried
Child'' famously see his own face, in the rearview mirror of a car,
dissolving into the faces of his ancestors. ``True West''
(previously best known for the fondly recalled Steppenwolf
production of 1982 with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich) presents
two brothers, ostensibly as opposite as yin and yang, who before
the evening's end effectively become each other, although what that
``other'' happens to be is by no means certain.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing at all high-handed or obscure in the way this
production brings out the existential echoes in classic sibling
rivalry. While ``True West'' has its cavernous depths, for sure, it
also has a surface that is as accessible and entertaining as
anything this playwright ever wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Warchus, Hoffman and Reilly, accordingly, keep their audience in
a state of aching laughter as Austin and Lee variously make nice,
play rough, compete for the attentions of a smarmy movie producer
(Robert LuPone) and turn downright homicidal. But the comedy never
for an instant feels contrived; it seems to emanate as deeply from
the characters' viscera as the froglike belches of the
beer-swilling Lee. (Well, that's Lee as played by Hoffman.)
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and Hoffman are frequently classified as actors of the
same stripe. This is understandable. They are both in their early
30s and have both appeared impressively in three films by Paul
Thomas Anderson, including the current ``Magnolia.'' (They each
have Austin-type roles in that one.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet to see these two at loggerheads in ``True West'' is to
realize how different they are from each other, at least in their
essential presences. Put superficially, Reilly's performances tend
to develop in a straight line, a steady stream with implicit
undercurrents; Hoffman's style suggests more of a squiggle, an
undulating pattern of eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say one is too simple and the other too fancy.
They are both equally able to surprise you. It's just that Reilly
does so by stealth; Hoffman, by full-frontal attack. Their
switching parts alters the basic chemistry of the play.
</P>
<P>
   When Hoffman plays Austin, the respectable family man and
well-paid screenwriter, and Reilly plays Lee, the renegade loner
and burglar, the effect is of diametrical opposites. Reilly gives
Lee a hillbilly accent and a dangerous, purposeful slowness.
Hoffman's Austin is a fussy type, compulsively neat and nervous,
with a smile that seems both eager and hard won.
</P>
<P>
   The center of this version appears to be the actors' midriffs:
Austin is forever fiddling with and tucking in his shirttails.
Reilly's Lee is continually stretching his upper torso to reveal
the swelling belly beneath the soiled T-shirt. These brothers are
different to the point of grotesqueness, changeling siblings, so
that when each starts to take on aspects of the other, it feels as
elemental as a fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's Austin and Hoffman's Lee are more clearly cut from the
same genetic cloth. Their voices and diction are more alike.
Granted, their metabolisms are certainly different, what with
Hoffman in a continuing state of eruption and Reilly doing the slow
burn to end all slow burns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you get the feeling that Lee's outlaw status is a conscious
choice, just as Austin's reliability comes from a steady exertion
of will. You also sense that these choices have been made by the
brothers in instinctive opposition to each other. This is the
version for psychologists, although any Freudian could make much of
the unseen presence of the boys' nasty old father in both
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Twist my arm, and I still wouldn't be able to tell you which
version of ``True West'' I prefer. There's too much wealth in each
of them. Warchus, who directed the recent film version of Shepard's
``Simpatico'' as well as the Broadway hit ``Art,'' keeps the
contours of the staging the same while allowing for the spontaneous
detour.
</P>
<P>
   He has an evocative awareness of the significance of relative
postures throughout: who's vertical, who's horizontal, who's in a
fetal curl, who's stretched out. Warchus also demonstrates a
wonderful respect for silences, starting with the deliberately
uncomfortable long pause that begins both productions, in a work
that could so easily be done as a fast gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Howell's costumes (please note the variations here in
particular) and set, a generic California living room that seems
both solidly banal and sadly fragile; Brian MacDevitt's moody
lighting; Jim van Bergen's sound design, with its emphasis on
crickets and coyotes: all of these elements conspire to create a
sense of darkness waiting to swallow everything onstage.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, ``True West'' is a four-character play, and though
its other two parts are small, they are essential and, in this
instance, perfectly cast. LuPone, with his too-easy, too-white
smile, is the ideal human oil slick of a movie producer. As the
brothers' mother, who returns for the show's blissfully boisterous
climax, Celia Weston underplays brilliantly and affectingly, when a
lesser actress might have raised the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``True West'' is less heavy on arialike monologues than
most of Shepard's work, it still has some dazzling soliloquies for
both characters, including Austin's hilarious and heartbreaking
account of how their father lost his teeth, twice.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Lee's rumination on family life as seen by someone
looking through a window from the outside. ``Like a paradise,'' he
says. ``Kinda place that sorta kills ya inside . . . Blond people
movin' in and outta the rooms, talkin' to each other. Kinda place
you sort of wish you grew up in, ya know?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when you are inside, you don't feel like you're
inside. That's Shepard's point: that no one is comfortable in his
own skin, his own house, his own mind. Even _ no, especially _ his
own family members represent an enviable otherness.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which version of this outstanding ``True West'' you
see, you'll find its spiritual center in the same place. It's an
image of two men leaning against a bright, orderly kitchen counter
with endless night stretching behind them and one of them pausing
to say to the other, ``I was wonderin' what it was like to be
you.''

 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill that would allow American victims of
state-sponsored terrorism to be compensated by the offending
countries unanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will give the United States one more weapon
in the fight against terrorism,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., who sponsored the bill with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The bill wouyld prevent victims of terrorism from being blocked
from recovering court-awarded damages the frozen assets of
terrorist countries. Countries such as Iran and Cuba have assets in
the United States frozen by the Treasury Department. The bill
excludes diplomatic properties from eligible assets.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 anti-terrorism law gave American victims the right to sue
foreign sponsors of terrorism in U.S. courts. Two years ago,
Congress passed another law that allowed victims to tap the frozen
assets of terrorist states as compensation for their injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent cases, President Clinton has waived the right of
American families to obtain damages from frozen assets in the
United States. The administration has taken the position the assets
could be used in negotiations with the terrorist nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Senate will stand with American victims of
terrorism and act to bring them the justice they deserve,'' Mack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg and Mack were joined by 23 other co-sponsors of the
bill, including Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When John McCain returns to the Senate after his
blistering campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he
will be greeted _ begrudgingly _ as a hero by his fellow
Republicans who will need his help to keep control of Congress in
the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick Arizona Republican, who said he was on a ``great
crusade'' to reform the GOP, gained astonishing celebrity during
his 14 months of campaigning on the theme that big campaign
contributions unduly influence politicians.
</P>
<P>
   His calls for campaign finance reform infuriated many fellow
Republicans who claim their party would be disproportionately hurt
because the GOP tends to pull in more contributions in the
unregulated soft money donations that McCain would ban. Soft money
contributions are given to political parties _ not candidates _ and
can come from corporations and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also alienated the Republican establishment by attacking
leaders of the religious right _ including television evangelist
Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell _ and by his personal
criticism of Republican front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's tremendous crossover appeal to Democrats and
independents, which won him victories in five New England states
and Michigan, will make him an indispensable asset for Bush and for
Republican congressional candidates desperate to corral independent
swing voters, the same ones Ross Perot appealed to in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News-Wall Street Journal poll last week showed that 23
percent of voters would vote for McCain as a third-party candidate
in a general election, compared with 34 percent for Vice President
Al Gore and 32 percent for Bush. Those numbers explain why Bush's
supporters are hoping McCain will eventually endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush can't win without McCain,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., national co-chairman of McCain's campaign and one of just
four Republican senators to back him. ``He has an appeal we haven't
seen since Bobby Kennedy. He'll come back to the Senate with a much
enhanced reputation and status.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain will be hugely popular with Republican congressional
candidates, especially senators in tight races. That list includes
Sens. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Rod Grams of Minnesota,
Spencer Abraham of Michigan and John Ashcroft of Missouri,
according to Republican analyst Marshall Wittmann.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans command a 55-45 majority in the Senate and a 222-211
majority in the House, where two members are independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his Republican colleagues are smart, they will treat him
like a conquering hero,'' Wittmann said. ``These politicians
understand when there is a new dynamic, a new force in the
electorate, and he was able to reach it. What politicians are most
attracted to is success because they want the success themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find a lot of senators who'll have a picture of
them with John McCain in the front lobby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before McCain launched his anti-establishment bid, he had
strained relationships with his GOP Senate colleagues, with many
dissenting from his efforts to overhaul the campaign finance
system. While 51 Republican senators endorsed Bush, only four _
Hagel, Sens. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, Mike DeWine of Ohio and
John L. Kyl of Arizona _ backed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Trent Lott, R-Miss., said last week that McCain
has given him ``heartburn at times'' and alienated many senators by
saying they've been corrupted by special interest money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go into a senator's state and box his ears,'' Lott
said. ``John sometimes has stepped on people's linenow that doesn't
sit too well with your 99 colleagues in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott also seems awed by McCain's success on the campaign
trail. ``He ran a whale of a campaign,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College,
said McCain is now ``probably the most famous senator and that
drives them nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitney quoted a line from a detective novel by Raymond Chandler,
saying McCain will ``encounter the plastic smiles people wear when
they're trying not to scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Whit Ayres said McCain will get ``a lot of
grudging respect for the voters he's energized and brought into the
Republican primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly captured the imagination of a number of voters
who have heretofore not been energized by previous Republican
candidates for president,'' Ayres said. ``So much of his reception
is going to be determined by whether he looks like he's going to
put his shoulder to the wheel and help to elect a Republican
president or whether he's going to continue to send signals that
the Republican party remains divided.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., McCain's long-standing opponent in
the continuing debate over campaign finance reform, said the
Arizona senator ``is going to get a very warm reception'' when he
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves respect for running such a successful campaign,''
McConnell said. But McConnell insisted that doesn't mean he will
give an inch in his campaign finance reform battle against McCain.
``That's an issue we debate every year,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the aisle will also roll out the red carpet
when McCain comes back to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators will ``embrace Sen. McCain when he comes
back,'' because he has supported many of their causes such as
campaign finance reform, said Senate Minority Leader Thomas A.
Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle added that if McCain had succeeded in becoming the
Republican presidential nominee, ``I don't think we'd be as
enthusiastic about his return.''

   MCCAIN (Sedona, Ariz.) _ Sen. John McCain, the Republican whose
insurgency became the surprise of the primary season, ended his
maverick candidacy on Thursday with the hope that he would
eventually prevail in ``making our party as big as the country we
serve.'' Two days after being soundly defeated in coast-to-coast
primaries, McCain had gracious words for Gov. George W. Bush but
stopped noticeably short of endorsing him, saying only, ``I
congratulate Governor Bush and wish him and his family well. He may
very well become the next president of the United States.'' He also
ended speculation that he might make a third-party run by repeating
once again, ``I love my party, it is my home.'' By Alison Mitchell.

   RICH-KIDS (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ Every day after school, 13
year-old Jeffrey Mendelman has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
with milk, finishes his homework _ and checks his stocks. ``My
dad's stock was going up,'' he explains of his decision to plunge
into the market, following stocks the way he once collected
baseball cards. ``Most kids here are interested in the market.
Because a lot of their dads have become pretty rich and that's why
they get to live in a gigantic house.'' A new sort of American
childhood is being forged in the land where each day brings the
dawn of an estimated 64 new millionaires. It's one in which CEOs
are the new superheroes, family dinner table conversations are
often likely to include talk of multiples and the latest IPO and
where a recent collision between two students in a high school
parking lot here, to no one's surprise, involved a brand-new Toyota
SUV Forerunner and a Mercedes 500 SL. But along with a new openness
about money and the obvious good things it can bring, have come
concerns about the effect of the Valley's unprecedented wealth on
children. By Patricia Leigh Brown.

<P>
   SHUTTLE-SAFETY (Washington) _ A new NASA report on the safety of
the space shuttle is highly critical of the privatization of launch
and service operations that has been going on in recent years. The
report of the Independent Safety Assessment Team calls for more
inspections and the hiring of more NASA people to be more deeply
involved in operations at Cape Canaveral. It listed 37 things that
should be done before the next four shuttle flights are completed.
By Warren E. Leary.

<P>
   CLINTON-TRADE (Washington) _ As the Clinton administration
conceded Thursday that it does not have the votes for a giant China
trade accord, a titanic lobbying battle was shaping up for the 110
uncommitted House members who will decide the fate of the
president's most important remaining foreign policy goal. By Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   NJ-URBAN-ENCLAVE (Newark, N.J.) _ Soaring home prices. Sclerotic
traffic. The maddening roar of new construction. Too many people,
not enough open space. Ah, the woes of a booming economy. But, in
an unlikely tale for flush times, this scenario is playing out not
in Manhattan, but in one corner of a city more often associated
with urban decay than runaway development. Newark's Ironbound
section, long a bastion of Portuguese immigrants and more recently
a magnet for Brazilians and other Latin Americans, has become one
of the hottest swaths of real estate in the region. By Andrew
Jacobs.

   HONGKONG-BOAT-PEOPLE (Hong Kong) _ Ask Nguyen Kim Lien about
life inside the barbed-wire fence of the Pillar Point Vietnamese
Refugee Camp here, and she is remarkably stoic. Her family lives in
squalor. Her husband is out of work and addicted to heroin. Yet
Mrs. Lien, 36, has found dignity amid the debris. She runs a shop
that sells Vietnamese noodles to the camp's 1,070 refugees. Her two
children, who were born in Hong Kong and have never lived outside
the camp, go to a nearby school. If Mrs. Lien has a reason to
despair, it is because after 10 years, she and her family must
leave Pillar Point by the end of May. Last month, Hong Kong
announced it was shutting down its last refugee camp for Vietnamese
boat people, ending a drama that began in May 1975. By Mark
Landler.

McCAIN SUSPENDS CAMPAIGN, YIELDS GOP NOMINATION TO BUSH 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ John McCain, whose insurgent battle against
George W. Bush had its ups and downs before finally crashing on
Super Tuesday, retreated to a northern Arizona mountaintop Thursday
to end his race for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outdoors with his wife, Cindy, at his side and a
panorama of snow-dusted, red mountains in the background, the
Arizona senator yielded to the obvious fact that his maverick,
reform-oriented campaign _ despite its appeal for independent
voters _ had never caught on with most members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his task became ``considerably more difficult''
after coast-to-coast primaries Tuesday, when ``a majority of
Republican voters made clear their preference for president is
Governor Bush.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect their decision, and ... I am no longer an active
candidate for my party's nomination for president,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, McCain, 63, chose to suspend his candidacy, rather
than formally withdraw from the presidential race. By so doing, he
will remain eligible for federal matching campaign funds and will
keep the 231 delegates he has earned to this summer's Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said he may use the power of those delegates to persuade
the party to put campaign-finance reform into the platform and high
on Bush's agenda as the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that he was yielding the GOP nomination to the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was on a bus traveling to his rally with Colorado
supporters before the primaries Friday there and in Utah and
Wyoming, when he listened to McCain's announcement over the radio.
He spoke with McCain and said he wanted to encourage him to
continue working in the Senate on campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the warm tone and his best wishes for me
and my family,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with him on a reform agenda. I'm
confident we can get a major reform package through on paycheck
protection ... to make sure the ban on corporate soft money and the
ban on labor union soft money is complete,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can find great areas of agreement,'' Bush said, insisting
they already have an important common ground: ``Making sure Al Gore
is not elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who defied Republican leaders by making campaign-finance
reform the centerpiece of his campaign, also seemed to rule out an
independent race for the White House, although he may have left
that door slightly open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my party. It is my home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I am also dedicated to the necessary cause of
reform, and I will never walk away from a fight for what I know is
right and just for our country. As I said throughout the campaign,
what is good for my country is good for my party.``
</P>
<P>
   But the senator warned Republicans that their party ``will
surely slip into the mists of history, deserving the allegiance of
none'' if the GOP does not continue his efforts to reform the
political system and broaden the party's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The fight between McCain and Bush had grown increasingly bitter
and negative as the two traded primary wins in key states during
the past two months. Religious fundamentalist supporters of Bush
had attacked McCain, and McCain, in some states, had sponsored
phone calls suggesting Bush was supported by anti-Catholic bigots.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's tone Thursday was conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate Governor Bush and wish him and his family
well,'' he said, without endorsing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may very well become the next president of the United
States. That is an honor accorded very few, and it is such a great
responsibility that he deserves the best wishes of every American.
He certainly has mine.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain, his wife and top aides drove up to his announcement
site, on the side of a mountain road overlooking Sedona, in his
campaign bus, the ``Straight Talk Express,'' on which the senator
had held virtually non-stop, on-the-record discussions with
reporters while campaigning across the country.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, he delivered his remarks from a prepared
text, took no questions and quickly departed, returning to his
vacation home in nearby Cottonwood, where he planned to host an
off-the-record barbecue for staffers and reporters later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Howard Opinsky said McCain declined to answer
questions because he was facing an ``emotional time. He made a
statement, and I think that's all he wants to say today.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign caught fire with many independent and
Democratic voters, who were crucial to his victories over Bush in
early, open primaries in New Hampshire and Michigan, spoiling the
GOP ``coronation'' that many Republicans had anticipated for the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the better-funded Bush eventually wore McCain down. The
governor scored a decisive victory over the senator in South
Carolina with a strongly conservative campaign and drew on the
support of Republican leaders and conservative GOP voters to
deliver a fatal blow in California, Ohio, New York and other states
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And, next week, McCain would have faced an intimidating lineup
of primaries in Texas, Florida and other southern states that
heavily favor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls, Bush trounced McCain among conservative
Republican voters in New York, Ohio, California and other Super
Tuesday states. McCain not only lost all 162 of California's
Republican delegates to the Texas governor, he also came in third
in that state's open primary, which the senator had hoped to
capture as a symbol of his potential ``electability'' in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent five and one-half years as
a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, said he will take his
``crusade'' back to the Senate, where he lost a battle over
campaign-finance reform last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will keep fighting to give the government back to the
people; to keep our promises to young and old alike by paying our
debts, saving Social Security and Medicare, and reforming a tax
code that benefits the powerful few at the expense of many,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE>
BRADLEY STEPS DOWN, URGES BACKERS TO SUPPORT GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ Winless from the start, Bill Bradley
Thursday abandoned his renegade race for the White House and vowed
to support Vice President Al Gore even as he rapped the Gore
campaign's ``distortions and negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, buried by the Democratic establishment in 19
consecutive states as he tried to topple the incumbent vice
president, called Gore to pledge his backing before he urged
several hundred supporters near his New Jersey headquarters to
rally behind the prospective Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the tradition of the Democratic Party to fight hard
during primaries and then unify and close ranks behind the nominee
as soon as the people have spoken,'' Bradley said. ``Now it is time
for unity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who failed to galvanize voters behind his call for
a ``new politics'' of high ideals and civility, made no secret of
his disdain for Gore's harsh campaign tactics. Bradley was hurt
badly by his unwillingness to match Gore's brawling style, even
after Gore ran television ads in Iowa that misrepresented Bradley's
position on disaster relief for the state's farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were distortions and negativity,'' Bradley
said of Gore's campaign in a news conference after his speech.
``And I hope that he'll run a better campaign in the general
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who would not elaborate on how actively he intends to
support Gore, said he will continue to ``say what I feel'' about
Gore's campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bradley made no effort to back away from his criticism
of Gore's role in the 1996 fund-raising scandals. Republicans are
expected to hammer Gore over the scandals, particularly his
appearance at a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple and his
assertion that ``no controlling legal authority'' prohibited him
from soliciting contributions by telephone from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley said Gore appeared to be moving toward trying to
blunt any backlash, he added, ``I think he needs to do it more, and
I think he needs to remove that issue by opening up on what
happened in 1996. I haven't changed my view on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would not discuss the tone or content of his
conversation with Gore, though he did say he had no interest in
joining the ticket as a candidate for vice president. Nor was there
any indication that Gore would offer Bradley the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who overcame an early scare from Bradley to prevail in the
primaries, described Bradley in a written statement ``as a good man
whom I respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am honored to have his support,'' Gore said. ``He ran a
campaign based on the highest ideals. This primary has been good
for the Democratic Party and good for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who helped Gore use the power of the White
House to stymie Bradley, also praised the former US senator and
basketball star for the tone of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at the issues he raised and the way in which he
raised them,'' Clinton told reporters, ``it recalled again how much
more substance in my judgment the debate was on the Democratic
side, on the issues, and how much more agreement there was.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley exited the national stage, he expressed little
enthusiasm for publicly analyzing his campaign's demise, though he
attributed his defeat in part to Gore's command of the party's
``entrenched power.'' He also cited his own inability to spark
enthusiasm for his calls to overhaul the health care system,
eradicate child poverty, and curb gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we didn't really get across the extent to which
this was not a campaign of self-interest,'' he said, rather than a
populist push for ``a new politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we could have done a better job of getting across that
aspect of it,'' he said. ''I think that might have been where we
had our deepest failure.''
</P>
<P>
   His top aides cited several other factors, most notably
Bradley's inability to break through the massive attention the
Republican primary received after Arizona Senator John McCain's
decisive victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters just couldn't see that there was a race going on in
the Democratic primary,'' said Bradley's campaign manager, Gina
Glantz, ``and they defaulted to the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's national chairman, Doug Berman, blamed New Hampshire
for moving its primary to Feb. 1 from Feb. 29, leaving the
Democrats without a contest for five weeks until March 7. During
that period, the Republicans held several high-profile contests
that commanded the news media's attention.
</P>
<P>
   In bowing out, Bradley would not say whether he would again seek
the presidency, a job that others had wished on him since he was a
teenager. But he invoked President Lincoln in vowing to pursue his
vision of a ``new politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Lincoln's contention that ``the cause of liberty must not
be surrendered at the end of one or even one hundred defeats,''
Bradley ended his speech by saying, ``The cause of trying to create
a new politics in this country, the cause of trying to fulfill our
promise as a nation, that cannot be defeated by one or a hundred
defeats.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he asserted that his withdrawal from the race on the
same day that McCain suspended his campaign in the Republican
primary likely signaled the death of any chance to overhaul the
campaign finance system this year. Both men had led the charge to
reduce the influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley said he would not release the 412 convention
delegates he had won because ``they've been loyal supporters and
deserve to have their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they represent a small minority of the total delegates,
Bradley's bloc would be large enough to create some havoc at the
August covention. But Bradley's deputy campaign director, Jacques
DeGraff, said, ``There is no intention to embarrass, disrupt, or be
divisive in any way at the convention.''

MIT SAYS SPREADSHEET ERROR CAUSED GRADE CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ A teaching assistant's mistaken mouse click, not a
computer hacker bent on tampering with test scores, altered the
grades of 22 students in an MIT biology class, institute officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Apologizing before the 120 undergraduates in his cell biology
course Thursday morning, Professor Harvey Lodish said one of the
class's six teaching assistants accidentally assigned students the
wrong grades after incorrectly sorting them on a computer
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Lodish, who last Thursday announced to the class that a cheating
scandal had been uncovered, would not answer questions about why it
took a week to realize the clerical error, which lowered the grades
of 20 students and raised the marks of two students.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Sauer, chairman of the biology department, said he
didn't believe there was anything strange about the lag time, and
that Lodish was sorry for unsettling the class by accusing students
of cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson that I hope was learned here is that you have to
move slow and be cautious in these kinds of cases,'' Sauer said.
``The initial interpretation was the wrong one. And that
interpretation was shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent headlines about hackers breaking into high-profile
commercial Web sites such as Yahoo.com or breaching the Pentagon's
vaunted electronic firewalls, he said, likely predisposed Lodish
and institute administrators into assuming the altered grades was
just another case of hacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, as a teacher, it immediately
sends a chill down your spine,'' Sauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Institute officials said they discovered it was human error only
after ruling out that anyone had infiltrated the biology class's
computer system, MIT spokesman Ken Campbell said. Adding to the
delay, the teaching assistant who make the mistake did realize the
error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more complicated to figure out a mistake than a
violation,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``simple slip-up,'' he explained that the teaching
assistant using the spreadsheet highlighted only a column of names,
instead of clicking on and sorting both a column of names and
grades. Officials would not identify the teaching assistant.

BRADLEY DROPS OUT OF RACE, CONGRATULATES GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley, whose ``big idea''
presidential candidacy once threatened to thwart Vice President Al
Gore's political future, officially dropped out of the race
Thursday, offering only tepid support to his former rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president and I had a stiff competition, and he won.
I congratulate him,'' Bradley said at a press conference near his
campaign headquarters. ``He will be the nominee of the Democratic
Party and I will support him in his bid to win the White House.``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a 56-year-old former pro basketball star and former
senator from New Jersey, said he plans to take a vacation with his
wife, Ernestine, before returning to campaign for his fellow
Democrats. He did not rule out a future run for president, but he
did say, as he has all along, that he would not consider becoming
Gore's running mate if he were to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I will not be a candidate for vice president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton praised Bradley and the tenor
of the Democratic nominating contest in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at the issues he raised and the way in which he
raised them, it recalled again how very much more substantive in my
judgment the debate was on the Democratic side, on the issues, and
how much more agreement there was,'' Clinton said during a
question-and-answer session with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Republican side there was far more disagreement, I
think, and it was far less rooted in issues that will really affect
the American people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that while he is bowing out of the race, he will
not release the 415 delegates he has won. He did not say what role
he plans for himself at this summer's Democratic convention, but
said he would follow the tradition of his party to close ranks
behind the nominee once the people have spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is time for unity,'' he said. ``Democrats know that the
offerings of the likely Republican nominee are opposite of where
our country should be headed.``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he telephoned Gore on Thursday morning to tell him
he would support him, but he declined to detail their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to deviate on the last day of his campaign from his usual
practice of keeping his personal feelings to himself, Bradley
paused briefly before responding:
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something I believe I gave my full heart, mind, soul
and energy to, and it didn't turn out,'' he said. ``As I said the
other night, you win and you lose. This is a loss, and I move on.``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has characterized Gore as being untruthful, said he
spoke his mind during the campaign when he felt his opponent had
engaged in distortions and negativity, and he said he would not
hesitate to speak up again during the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his call for Gore to come clean on the 1996
fund-raising scandals to remove what he considers a major
Democratic weakness in the fight against Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he'll run a better campaign in the general
election,'' Bradley said of Gore. ``I was calling it as I saw it,
but I believe that a Democratic president is better for our country
than a Republican president. He has my full support.``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also spoke of his pride in bringing a ``new politics''
to America, a politics not dominated by money, but one of core
convictions, such as his platform of improving health care,
reforming campaign-finance laws, and ending child poverty, racial
discrimination and gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my convictions,'' he said, ``convictions I do not
change because elections are won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abraham Lincoln once wrote that the cause of liberty must not
be surrendered at the end of one or even a hundred defeats,'' he
added to lengthy applause from his campaign workers. ``We have been
defeated, but the cause for which I ran has not been ... that
cannot be defeated by one or a hundred defeats.``
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley repeated his campaign refrain that in this time of
economic prosperity, America should be ``fixing our roof while the
sun is shining.``
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't seize this moment,'' he warned, ``future
generations will judge us harshly and say, `They knew what was
wrong. They had the means to make it better and they did not
act.'``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's announcement came as no surprise as the presidential
hopeful had essentially conceded defeat after Gore swept the Super
Tuesday primaries this week, collecting enough delegates to ensure
his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who once led Gore in polls in Northeastern states, came
within 4 percentage points of winning the New Hampshire primary
Feb. 1, but after that, his campaign fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore completely shut him out, winning even in
Bradley's home state of Missouri and in New York, where he played
for the Knicks. Despite Bradley's pounding on the theme of racial
unity, blacks preferred Gore by a margin of 6-to-1, and Hispanics
by 8-to-1. Union members also backed Gore as did established
abortion rights groups who rallied behind the vice president when
Bradley tried to question his commitment to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday what he thought went wrong with his campaign,
Bradley was philosophical. He said he failed to get across the
message that his campaign was not about self-interest, but was
about something much bigger than any individual involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ended his campaign, which he called ``a joyous
journey,'' by joking with reporters and conducting a mock
graduation ceremony. As his staff quietly hummed ``Pomp and
Circumstance,'' Bradley shook hands with the traveling press corps
and handed out gifts _ Tiffany key chains dangling silver high-top
tennis shoes and tins of his favorite throat lozenges, his
trademark from the campaign trail.

BUSH APPEALS TO McCAIN'S SUPPORTERS IN ATTACKING GORE 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ George W. Bush praised his erstwhile opponent John
McCain on Thursday, but showered caustic remarks on his new
opponent, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly outdoor at the Denver Broncos training facility
in suburban Englewood, Bush said he, not Gore, has the most appeal
for McCain's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to win his supporters over is when they realize
that Al Gore is no reformer, Al Gore is no John McCain,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heaping criticism on Gore, Bush said the same day the vice
president was condemning ``soft-money'' donations in political
campaigns, he was mobilizing to raise $35 million worth of the
donations from corporate, labor union and other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed ... Here's a man who stood up in front of America
yesterday and talked about ridding the system of soft money, while
evidently they're planning to raise soft money, $35 million,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who went to a Buddhist temple to raise money. My
only point is, Mr. Gore, I'm not going to let you get away with
that. I'm going to remind people of how you've conducted your
business in the past and how you're conducting it today,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed incensed by news accounts that Gore was seeking new
sums of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what he's thinking. He must be thinking we're
not paying attention. He must believe that words don't matter in
life. It's a perplexing way to lead,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic officials acknowledged that Gore will help the
party raise unregulated ``soft money, the vice president said that
the party would not halt such activities if Bush and the
Republicans refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks the Democratic Party is going to unilaterally
disarm and and jump off a cliff he has another thing coming,'' Gore
said..
</P>
<P>
   The vice president had canceled an event in Minneapolis and
rushed back to Washington to be on hand for Senate votes on two
judicial nominees. In the end Gore's tie-breaking vote was not
needed as the Senate approved the two nominees to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals by a comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech Tuesday night Gore called on Bush to
eliminate soft-money contributions. He also challenged the
Republican nominee to forgo 30- and 60-second ads and debate twice
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokesman Jenny Backus said the
upcoming fund-raisers that Gore is expected to participate in are
part of a general election strategy that has been in the works
since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure our state parties and our national
parties are in a strong position for the 2000 elections and
beyond,'' she said. ``We assumed once we had a (presidential)
nominee we would like the nominee and other Democratic party
leaders to help us raise funds and work on grass-roots support for
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic party officials said they hoped to raise about $35
million in these unregulated funds by the time of the August
convention. The party has planned a tribute to President Clinton,
which is expected to bring in $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, asked to elaborate on how he would woo McCain's loyalists,
said, ``McCain voters will be looking for someone to bring honor
and integrity to the White House. McCain voters want to hear
somebody who's got a positive vision to make sure the American
dream touches everyone's heart. McCain voters want somebody who
knows what they're talking about when it comes to education. And
McCain voters hopefully want somebody who will fight for tax
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Austin, Texas, late Thursday, Bush
campaigned in the other two Western states that have GOP primaries
Friday, Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my 24 hours (rest). Now I'm out campaigning again,'' he
said.

ADMINISTRATION BACKS MORE VISAS FOR SKILLED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The red-hot economy is forcing Congress to consider
its second increase since 1998 in the number of skilled workers
that US firms can hire from overseas, a boost vigorously supported
by high-tech companies facing a severe worker shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor groups oppose any increase in the number of foreign
workers, however, saying that employers want to tap cheap labor
rather than raise wages.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Clinton administration said it would support a
``reasonable increase'' in temporary foreign workers. But it also
said the leading Senate plan must do more to boost training
programs to prepare Americans for high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House statement came as the Senate Judiciary Committee
voted to boost the annual number of so-called H-1B visas for
skilled workers to 195,000 through 2002. The cap had been 65,000,
until lawmakers in 1998 raised it to 115,000.
</P>
<P>
   The visas are designated for foreigners working in skilled
professions, such as nursing and computer programming. They are
good for six years, but lawmakers believe that most people using
the visas intend to seek permanent US residency.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward Kennedy had proposed a more modest increase, to
145,000 visas, but the Senate committee rejected that idea.
Kennedy's proposal also called for raising the visa fee that
employers pay and using the money to expand worker training
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups say that as many as 300,000 information
technology jobs remain unfilled at US companies, including 11,000
jobs in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no question that there's a crisis right
now,'' said Jeff Lande, of the Information Technology Association
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have said they are at risk of losing business to
overseas competitors because they do not have enough workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and
they need all the workers with technical skills that they can
get,'' said Jim Klocke of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the goverment met the cap for the visas halfway through
the year, and it appears that this year's quota will also be filled
well before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But several labor groups oppose the bill. They include the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, which claims
more than 200,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   That union believes wages and working conditions for US workers
are undercut when more foreign workers are admitted on temporary
visas, said Paul Donnelly, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said that the Senate bill would actually admit
300,000 foreigners each year, not 195,000, because it does not
count people with master's or doctoral degrees toward the cap. Over
three years, the Senate bill would admit 900,000 foreigners to fill
a shortage that industry groups calculate to be 300,000 jobs,
Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said President Clinton
backs a ``reasonable increase'' in visas, though he would not say
whether 195,000 is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert also said that any increase in visas must be accompanied
by new training programs to prepare Americans for high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House liked Kennedy's training proposal, he said,
which was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of a
more modest plan. ``We certainly think that it mirrors the
principles we want to see in the legislation,'' he said of
Kennedy's plan.

TJX NAMES NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edmond ``Ted'' English, who began his retail career as a stock
boy at Filene's Basement, will assume day-to-day command of TJX
Cos., the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As successor to Bernard Cammarata, English will become chief
executive of TJX _ a nearly $9 billion retail empire _ in mid
April, according to a statement released by the Framingham, Mass.
operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains.
</P>
<P>
   Cammarata, 60, remains as chairman and will focus on the
company's long-term strategic objectives, TJX said.
</P>
<P>
   English's promotion was expected, and English, 46, said he will
continue to pursue Cammarata's vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay the course,'' said English, who played a
major role in integrating Marshalls into the TJX empire a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cammarata said he spent two years grooming English as his
successor. Last summer, TJX signaled to Wall Street that English
was the heir apparent when he was promoted to president, a title
previously held by Cammarata.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement, Cammarata said, ``concludes a
thoughtful and deliberative senior succession plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a very smooth and seamless transition,'' said
Sally H. Wallick, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Since acquiring Marshalls in 1995, TJX has often enjoyed
explosive growth. It continued to boom in fiscal 1999, though its
fourth-quarter suffered a bit from tough comparisons with the
fourth-quarter of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, TJX said it exceeded its goals for 1999's fourth quarter,
and overall results for the year were ``excellent,'' the company
said. For 1999, net income rose from $423.9 million to $521.7
million, and sales rose 11 percent to $8.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from 1976 when T.J. Maxx was a one-man
operation. For 24 years, Cammarata has focused on a single idea
known as off-price retail: selling brand-name clothing at bargain
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Others have pursued this concept and sometimes run into trouble
as they strayed from their off-price roots. Such may be the case
with Filene's Basement Corp. and Loehmann's Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But by staying focused on brand names for less, Cammarata has
built TJX into an off-price powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben has a pretty terrific formula,'' English said of
Cammarata. ``What we do works. We know this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Given TJX's momentum, Cammarata said the timing was right to
announce the succession plan.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that Cammarata and English plan to address together is
what to do with all the cash TJX is generating. One option is a
possible acquisition; another is a bigger stock buyback program.
</P>
<P>
   TJX's strong performance is reflected in its stock price,
analysts said. Like many retailers, TJX has seen its stock dip
sharply as Wall Street has grown disenchanted with old-economy
companies. Thursday TJX shares dropped 1/8 to close at 15 5/8.

SOMBER MCCAIN ANNOUNCES HE'LL SUSPEND CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Arizona _ The Straight Talk Express fell silent
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, the combative Arizona senator who gave Texas
Governor George W. Bush a serious run for his ample money, and who
at times looked set to change the way political campaigns were run
in this country, has given up his bid for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who stood atop a cliff against a spectacular backdrop of
red rocks, snow-covered ridges, and white clouds stretched against
a huge blue sky, was not the beaming, wise-cracking candidate of
yore, the man who roared past Bush in New Hampshire and then ran
headlong into Republican reality.
</P>
<P>
   He and his always garrulous aides were somber Thursday as the
senator delivered a speech that held none of his usual humor and
energy, but which echoed the feistiness that endeared him to
millions of voters _ particularly voters outside his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped our campaign would be a force for change in the
Republican Party,'' McCain said. ``And I believe we have indeed set
a course that will ultimately prevail in making our party as big as
the country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the support he had received from voters has ``ignited
the cause of reform, a cause far greater and more important than
the ambitions of any single candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, as he has many times, that he loves his party and
considers it his home. But he was not about to return to the bosom
of the GOP unconditionally, vowing to continue his push for
campaign finance reform, an issue that animated his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should our party ever abandon this principle,'' he warned,
``the American people will rightly abandon us, and we will surely
slip into the mists of history, deserving the allegiance of none.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain sounded his typical populist notes, though more softly
than usual. He vowed to continue his ``crusade'' to ``give
government back to the people,'' and overcome walls to greater
voter participation, ``be they walls of cynicism, or intolerance,
or walls raised by a self-interested elite who would exclude your
voice from the highest councils of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to marry Bush to that elite during this campaign,
and among the voters who turned out for his town hall meetings and
rallies, he succeeded. Over and over they voiced their suspicion of
the endorsement-heavy, richly financed governor, and their
admiration for McCain, the former prisoner of war who was willing
to take on the establishment. That the senator had spent 17 years
in Washington, many of those as chair of a powerful committee,
barely registered with these voters.
</P>
<P>
   But as the senator himself said Thursday, he did not convince
enough Republicans of his worthiness, as Bush had.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not endorse the governor Thursday, nor was he
expected to. That will come later, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may very well become the next president of the United
States,'' McCain said of Bush. ``That is an honor accorded very
few, and it is such a great responsibility that he deserves the
best wishes of every American. He certainly has mine.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his aides did not allow any questions after he
delivered his speech, a disorienting departure for a candidate who
has made it a habit to answer any question any reporter could
devise. The senator's address, for once, was to speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has no plans to release the delegates he has won to Bush,
his campaign manager Rick Davis said later. Instead, he will, with
his delegates, press the party at its national convention this
summer to move toward his reformist agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that capturing the McCain constituency is essential
if the GOP is win in November. ``The party needs John McCain to
broaden its base and only if it broadens its base can it beat Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is headed off for a vacation (``Somewhere cell
phones don't work,'' Davis said) ended the day hosting a barbeque
for his traveling entourage, but aides warned the press that the
entire affair was to be off the record.
</P>
<P>
   Those three words were always anathema to the McCain campaign.
Nothing the senator said was out of bounds, though aides might have
sometimes wanted it otherwise. Occasionally, when McCain was
veering into dangerous territory, they would blushed, or shoot each
other panicked looks, or mouth the words ``change the subject''
over and over.
</P>
<P>
   It rarely worked. McCain was mostly oblivious to their worries,
tripping merrily from one minefield to another.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of his candidacy's strengths, and one of its
frailties. His long days with reporters allowed McCain to edit
himself constantly, revising and refining his positions as the
questions continued, each leg of his long and frequent journeys a
chance to set the record straight or paint a subtler picture.
</P>
<P>
   But some things could not be fixed no matter how long the bus
ride. The anti-abortion senator, already under fire from
anti-abortion groups, had said that if his daughter got pregnant,
the choice of whether to have an abortion would be hers. Even a
strong statement to the contrary later in the day did nothing to
erase the effect of that admission on a constituency worried about
his reliability on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true of the Senator's characterization of Christian
Conservatives Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ``forces of
evil,'' which McCain also tried to fix with a strong statement and
an apology. Just joking, he said. But the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New Hampshire, before his spectacular victory there, his
South Carolina defeat, the negative advertising, the backbiting
about push-polls, the speech denouncing Robertson and Falwell, and
his Super Tuesday drubbing, McCain was asked whether he thought his
wide-open ways would change the way people campaigned for office.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know. But he was certain of one thing: if he
won, people would think his let-it-all-hang-out strategy was a
stroke of genius, and it would be widely imitated.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not win, aides say they would do it all the same
way again, with only a few modifications.

   Inching Toward The Inevitable
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a knotty new twist in the continuing saga of
``Hedwig and the Angry Inch.'' But considering the show's history,
that's hardly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed musical, which has been playing for more than two
years at the Jane Street Theater in Greenwich Village, saw its
sales slip late last year during an ill-conceived booking of Ally
Sheedy in the role of Hedwig, the high-gloss transsexual rocker at
the story's heart. Plans were made to close Jan. 30, but after Matt
McGrath took over the role and a strong review in The New York
Times followed, producers decided to keep the show running.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all the producers. One, Peter Askin, opted out of an
extension, leaving Susann Brinkley and James Freydberg to continue.
Both sides said that Askin's departure was amicable.
</P>
<P>
   But like old mascara, the plot thickens. Beyond being an
investor, Askin is also the director of ``Hedwig'' and, more
important, holds the lease on the Jane Street.
</P>
<P>
   Now sales for Hedwig are fluctuating again, coming dangerously
near the ``stop clause,'' which gives a theater's manager the right
to terminate a show's contract if it doesn't sell a given number of
tickets. All of which leaves Askin in the curious position of
having to consider kicking out a show that he directed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly complicated because producers of
several high-profile shows, including a new one by Eric Bogosian,
have been inquiring about the theater. With shows clamoring for
off-Broadway houses, the Jane Street is a catch: a cozy,
refurbished 260-seat theater with hip downtown cachet.
</P>
<P>
   None of which has escaped Brinkley's attention. ``Of the five
weeks of the extension, three have been in very solid profit,'' she
said. ``But we pay very close attention to the numbers.'' She added
that the show had built an advance sale of almost $50,000. No one
is saying precisely when Askin, the landlord, will ask Askin, the
director, to close the show. But he may have a serious conversation
with himself sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an emotional conflict because I love `Hedwig' and
helped create it,'' Askin said. ``Artistically I think we've
achieved above and beyond our wildest dreams. But at a certain
point I have to look at the health of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The Item About the Playwright
</P>
<P>
   Edward Albee's calendar is filling up. This month he is
directing the American premiere of his latest script, ``The Play
About the Baby,'' at the Alley Theater in Houston. The play, about
two couples and a child they share, stars Marian Seldes and runs
from April 7 to May 6. After that Albee will turn his attention to
an older play, ``The Lorca Play,'' a 1992 work about the life of
the Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lorca'' has had only one production, again in Texas, at the
University of Houston. This time, however, it's coming to New York,
though precisely where is still uncertain. Lawrence Sacharow is to
direct, and producers are aiming for a September opening in a large
off-Broadway theater.
</P>
<P>
   Who's on First?
</P>
<P>
   Word for word, it may be the best read on Broadway. Just look at
the first sentence: ``Roy Dotrice began his acting career in a
German prisoner-of-war camp in 1942. ...''
</P>
<P>
   So starts the Playbill biography of Dotrice, 76, who is
embarking on his 11th Broadway production as Phil Hogan, the
irascible pig farmer in Eugene O'Neill's ``Moon for the
Misbegotten.'' It began previews Tuesday night at the Walter Kerr
Theater. Along the way from POW to VIP, the colorful Dotrice has
had more than a few adventures, many of which are touched upon in
his 214-word stage biography. But despite his 58 years of credits,
Dotrice's bio is most exhaustive on what what he calls his greatest
accomplishment: bringing baseball to the Royal Shakespeare Company.
.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 he headed a squad that included Paul Robeson at first
base, Sam Wanamaker at second, Laurence Olivier at third and Peter
O'Toole at short. (Just imagine the dugout: ``Who's nicked my
batting crown?'') Albert Finney was catcher, Charles Laughton was
the ump, and Dotrice pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a mean curve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while he has played his share of noblemen, he says that
playing Phil, the pig man with a whiskey smile, strikes a chord.
``He's a tough little bugger, full of hearts and guts,'' he said.
``He understands it's better to get through with humor than feeling
sorry for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker, Coming and Going
</P>
<P>
   If he weren't long dead, Sunday would be quite a day for Harley
Granville Barker (1877-1946).
</P>
<P>
   The work of Barker, the British playwright, critic and close
collaborator of George Bernard Shaw, has been enjoying a
mini-renaissance in New York, and Sunday will see be both an
opening and a closing of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Birth first. At the American Place Theater, Sunday is the
opening night for ``Waste,'' Barker's 1907 tale of scandal and
politics among God-fearing Tories. The play's subject matter,
including an illicit abortion, earned it a formal ban from censors
at the time of its writing, but a 1997 revival at the Old Vic in
London saved it from history's dustbin. This is its American
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before ``Waste'' begins, the final curtain is to go down
on ``The Voysey Inheritance,'' Barker's 1903 play, which has had a
healthy run at the Mint Theater. It, too, has a social relevance
today, dealing as it does with a familial pyramid scheme in a time
of booming stock speculation.
</P>
<P>
   `Buffalo' Roams; `Ross' Rests
</P>
<P>
   The revival of David Mamet's ``American Buffalo,'' starring
William H. Macy, is off-Broadway's hottest ticket. It has broken
box office records at the Atlantic Theater Company and has been
extended for four weeks, to May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects are dimmer for another Mamet play, ``Glengarry Glen
Ross,'' which finished a celebrated run at the McCarter Theater in
Princeton, N.J., on Sunday. There had been talk of a New York
transfer, but Mamet's agent, Howard Rosenstone, said Wednesday that
the lack of a suitable theater had eliminated that possibility.

GORE, BUSH THROW THEMSELVES INTO THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ Despite the withdrawal, as predicted, of the
primary challengers in both parties Thursday, the two presidential
campaign front-runners did little to suggest they were relaxing
before the start of the harrowing eight-month general election
race. If anything, Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President
Al Gore seemed to be sending each other a message: This will be a
long, hard fight.
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with confidence, Bush held rallies in three Western
states with upcoming Republican primaries, even though that battle
was all but won. Gore also put himself in the spotlight by
unexpectedly flying to Washington, D.C., to be on hand if needed to
break a tie as the Senate voted to confirm two federal appellate
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Neither overshadowed the day's headline: that John McCain and
Bill Bradley were pulling out. Both Bush and Gore were magnanimous
toward their erstwhile opponents. Bush was particularly warm toward
McCain, who departed gracefully, expressing none of the rancor that
marked his earlier losses in the primary. And Bush's earlier
bitterness over what he described as negative campaign tactics by
McCain seemed to have all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But by late in the day, as Bush continued his attacks on Gore's
manner of raising campaign funds, the challengers already seemed to
have become an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Bush focused on Gore's assertion that he opposed unregulated
soft-money donations _ and then he cited reports that the vice
president was raising millions in soft-money donations himself.
While Bush spoke to supporters in 20-degree weather outside the
Denver Broncos' practice complex, his aides passed out a news
release to reporters with the headline: ``Gore: Soft Money is Bad,
but it Sure Comes in Handy!'' Later, at a news conference, Bush
said he was ``amazed'' by Gore's hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what he's thinking,'' Bush said. ``Must be
thinking we're not paying attention. He must believe that only
words matter in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has challenged Bush not to use soft money during the
campaign. ``All he has to do is agree to the challenge with no
conditions, no prerequisites,'' Gore said Thursday. ``All he has to
do is say `yes.' Ban all soft money from this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men allowed their departing opponents their due. Gore
issued a statement praising Bradley's campaign, saying he ran a
``campaign based on the highest ideals. . . . This primary has been
good for the Democratic Party and good for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is a good man whom I respect greatly,'' the Gore
statement said. ``I am honored to have his support.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also addressed Bradley's decision to leave the
Democratic race. During a question-and-answer session, Clinton
said: ``If you looked at the issues he raised and the way in which
he raised them, it recalled again how very much more substantive in
my judgment the debate was on the Democratic side, on the issues,
and how much more agreement there was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Republican side there was far more disagreement, I
think, and it was far less rooted in issues that will really affect
the American people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone on the Republican side had softened noticeably by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, Bush told a hushed crowd that he had spoken with McCain
earlier that day, after the senator suspended his campaign leaving
former ambassador Alan Keyes as the only other Republican still in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call, Bush thanked McCain for his ``gracious
comments'' in announcing his decision to suspend the campaign,
aides said. Bush told McCain he ``appreciated how he had handled
his decision to no longer be an active candidate,'' Bush
communications director Karen Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally in Provo, Bush elaborated on his sentiments toward
the Arizona senator. ``I want to say something publicly about the
senator: I appreciate the kind words,'' said Bush, who listened to
McCain's speech live on the radio while driving from the Denver
airport to a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate so very much the competition and the hard work
that he put into the campaign,'' he said. ``I appreciate his
commitment to reform. The best reform for America, the best reform
for this country, is to end the Clinton-Gore era in Washington,
D.C.''

   THE NEXT BEST THING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, Rupert Everett, Benjamin Bratt, Malcolm Stumpf, Michael
Vartan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Schlesinger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 107 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' but with major twists in
relationships and living arrangements. When Abbie (Madonna), a yoga
instructor, is dumped by her boyfriend (Vartan), she clings to her
best friend, Robert (Everett), who is gay. After getting drunk on
the Fourth of July, they make love and voila: a pregnancy that
grows markedly by the scene until we have little Sam (Malcolm
Stumpf).
</P>
<P>
   Assured that he is the father, Robert takes his parenting duties
to heart, and the three make up a comfy household until six years
later, when different sexual orientations finally exert their pull.
Abbie becomes involved with Ben ( Bratt), a generic investment
banker who's on the banal side but not too bad a person. Robert is
the problem, turning aggressively possessive of Sam and threatened
by what increasingly becomes a drift toward a new family alignment.
</P>
<P>
   With Abbie and Ben planning to move away and take Sam with them,
a custody struggle takes shape. Robert fights bitterly in court,
raising some thought-provoking issues of parental rights. But then
there is a major surprise and, later, a burst of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Abbie and Robert's coupling is not shown in detail, but
there is some partial nudity and much sexual discussion, gay and
straight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: A fair amount. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 12: Obviously the film is inappropriate for the very
young. As for older children, the family troubles could be
disturbing. Parents should realize that sexual issues are
continually front and center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: Neither the situation nor the characters are of
much interest to most teen-agers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HANGING UP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow, Walter Matthau &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Keaton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 92 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chirping cell phones link three fizzed-up sisters and their
difficult old dad, who in contrast to his daughters' jittery
hyperactivity is slowly sinking toward his demise. Scribbling
``It's too late'' in his hospital room, Lou (Matthau), a
79-year-old who once wrote movies for John Wayne and now can't seem
to get anything straight, relies on the middle daughter, Eve
(Ryan), for aid and comfort. That's not to say his other two girls
don't care, but it's hard focusing on Dad when you're quite this
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (Keaton), the eldest, is madly preparing the
fifth-anniversary edition of Georgia, the glossy New York magazine
she founded in honor of herself. Maddy (Kudrow), the youngest,
frets over her huge sloppy dog and a soap opera acting career that
will last exactly as long as her next relationship on ``Loving
Dangerously.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Lou understandably apprehensive and constantly
demanding. Working a cell phone with the best of them, he leans on
Eve. A professional party planner, she is the most frenzied of them
all, flitting here and there in her Land Rover, shaggy hairdo
artfully askew, crashing into a nice Iranian doctor's Mercedes, and
being as perky and addled as Ryan can be when she's on full
adorable.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the sisters collide at an event Eve has planned at the
Nixon Library. Together they thrash out some tensions between them
and rally at Lou's bedside in time to wet a hankie over the last
farewell. Cut to Thanksgiving for a reunion, some good laughs and a
food fight. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: The alcoholic Lou is a nasty drunk and when ambulatory
terrorizes a birthday party for little children with crude remarks
and violent gestures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Hailed as a wizened but still semi-potent ladies man, Lou
is a fount of salacious and often painfully tasteless
observations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Obscenities and off-color remarks sneak in here and
there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10: This isn't a film for small children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-12: Girls might buy the package, which comes with a
frothy script by Delia and Nora Ephron. That's fine as far as it
goes, but lost in the dazzle is any kind of realistic sense of
coming to terms with a dying parent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP: No harm, but teen-agers generally won't relate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   Pigeon: 45-year-old male, makes $150,000 a year, has $1 million
in assets, typically lives in the Midwest but wants to do business
with a New York broker. For such clients, sweaty-palmed but up for
a plunge, the firm J.T. Marlin, off Exit 53 on the Long Island
Expressway (that's New York, right?), has a trading (boiler) room
full of brokers barely out of high school with all kinds of risks
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Young (Affleck), J.T. Marlin's drill sergeant, instructs the
firm's recruits on the fine art of the phone spiel. As for broker
remuneration, it's not a question that the adept among them will be
making at least $1 million a year. The question is how many
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 27, describes himself as too old for the game he's
teaching. The recruits, several years younger, are crass,
beer-swilling Long Island boys. The best is Seth (Ribisi), who
dropped out of college and began running an illegal casino. That
displeases his father (Rifkin), a federal judge, so Seth considers
an overture from J.T. Marlin. ``Nobody wants to work for it
anymore, so I became a stockbroker,'' he says in a voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he is landing clients and selling stocks (``the white boy
way of slinging crack rock''). But when he overhears his boss' plan
to vacate the office in minutes if need be, his suspicions are
aroused. J.T. Marlin is selling stock in companies that don't
exist. With the feds closing in, Seth discovers his conscience. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: A loud, boorish crew, J.T. Marlin recruits beat up a
barroom antagonist and threaten brawls with up-market counterparts
who work for Wall Street firms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX: The talk gets bawdy, and Seth discreetly has sex with a
very nice $80,000-a-year J.T. Marlin secretary (Long). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: These are pretty obscene people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER 14: No, no, no, but Ribisi is a very appealing young
actor, as are Diesel (as Chris, another broker) and, of course,
Affleck. They and the get-rich-quick phenomenon could attract
children at younger ages than one might expect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14-17: This is certainly a movie for the times and, R-rated
features notwithstanding, it is quite a good one with plenty of
ratty characters but also some strong ones who stand up and do the
right thing when they have to. Parents will land on both sides of
the attendance issue.

   The New York Times plans two pages of stories and photos on the
presidential race, with the withdrawals of both McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN (Sedona, Ariz.) _ Sen. John McCain ``suspended'' his
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday and
wished his rival, Gov. George W. Bush, well, but stopped short of
endorsing him. And in an effort to make sure that his reform
message would continue to have resonance in the party, McCain said
he would hold on to his delegates until this summer's convention.

<P>
   BUSH (Denver) _ Gov. George W. Bush continues campaigning in the
mountain states ahead of Friday's primaries. By Clifford J. Levy.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY (West Orange, N.J.) _ Bill Bradley withdrew from the
race for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,
leaving the field to Vice President Al Gore. ``Following the
results of Tuesday's primaries, I have decided to withdraw from the
Democratic race for president,'' Bradley said. Bradley pledged his
support for Gore, saying, ``Now is the time for unity.'' But he
said he would not yet release the delegates that he had won. By
James Dao and Nicholas D. Kristof.

   GORE (Washington) _ Once again, Al Gore, as vice president, is
summoned to an ``important'' vote in the Senate. By Katharine Q.
Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   VOTER-TURNOUT (Washington) _ An analysis of primaries through
Super Tuesday shows turnout hit record highs for Republican
presidential primaries in 12 of the 18 completed contests. But this
was clearly a McCain phenomenon; Democratic turnout was the second
lowest in 40 years, with Clinton's uncontested renomination in 1996
the only lower. By Robin Toner. (500 words)
</P>
<P>
   VOTERS-REBELS (Undated) _ It was a tidy television package, the
sight of these vanquished politicians, McCain and Bradley, their
wives at their sides, offering their clipped exit lines to the
applause of their staffs. But something more than the
multi-million-dollar apparatus of two national campaigns was now to
be dismantled. What was disappearing from the stage with them was
something less tangible: the romance of the 2000 campaign. Not too
long ago, it looked as if this might be the year of the maverick.
Ultimately, though, these were rebels who lost their causes, beaten
back by standard-bearers of the establishment, a pair of political
heirs with proud old inside-the-beltway pedigrees and famous family
names. A political memo by Peter Marks. (925 words)

SPOTLIGHT ON A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEKONS: ``Journey to the End of the Night'' (Quarterstick/Touch
and Go). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 38th record by this fabled cosmopolitan art-punk band is a
late work in every respect, not merely because the Mekons are deep
into a seemingly endless career.
</P>
<P>
   Lateness is the album's theme and defines its tone. Its cycle
starts and ends in myth, joining a tired Hercules in his 10th
labor. In between come tales of cities in decay and late capitalism
in decline, whispered by aging bon vivants and drifters trying to
imagine what it might be like to rest. The soft, insistent music
flows forth like a lullabye that keeps you awake.
</P>
<P>
   The Mekons, whose members are scattered from London to Chicago,
have not sounded so united in a while. This album reunites the
band's Marxist brain with its decadent soul, existentialist spleen,
earthy funny bone and steady rocking American heart.
</P>
<P>
   The enticing nightmares the songs offer aren't always easy to
follow. But their disjointedness is healed by the balm of Suzy
Honeyman's violin and a mature musicality that shows this crew
isn't yet ready to sleep.

   CALIF-CASINOS (Coachella, Calif.) _ A day after California
voters approved a measure to legalize Las Vegas-style casinos on
American Indian lands throughout the state, casino companies from
Nevada, New Jersey and elsewhere started scrambling to get in on
what could become a huge gambling market. Tribal gaming in
California is significant because the state's large population
could allow California to grow quickly into one of the largest
gambling markets, perhaps rivaling New Jersey's. California could
also pose a major threat to neighboring Nevada's gambling-based
economy. By Andrew Pollack.

PANEL OK'S $2 BILLION TO INTENSIFY DRUG WAR IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Backing President Clinton, House Republicans on a
powerful committee Thursday gave their prescription for the war on
drugs: yes for $2 billion to fight drugs at their source in
Colombia, no for $1.3 billion to treat addicts at home.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside amendments by leading Democrats to delete funds
for the Colombian military and pour money into treatment of
addicts, the votes by the House Appropriations Committee boosted
the White House's ambitious plan to battle drug cultivation in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The panel planned to vote on the entire $9 billion emergency
supplemental request late Thursday, after which the measure goes to
the full House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a military solution. We want a humanitarian solution
to the war on drugs,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the
California Democrat who introduced the $1.3 billion treatment
amendment, after the vote. ``The discussion is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendments by Pelosi, the ranking Democrat on the
subcommitte on foreign oporations, and Wisconsin Democrat David R.
Obey underscored the deep unease among Democrats and some
Republicans of a foray into Colombia that the administration
estimates would last a minimum of five years. The $2 billion
funding, which the Republicans increased by $428 million over
Clinton's proposal, was for two years, but administration officials
say the final cost could easily include a few billion dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan debate Thursday at times grew heated, with
Republicans finding themselves oddly in the same corner with a
Democratic president. Some GOP members, who had pushed for
intervention in Colombia for years, chided Democrats for not
standing with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you must have confidence in your president,'' said
Representative Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican, speaking to
Obey. ``Your lack of confidence in your president is stunning to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Obey replied: ``I elect my president every four years to be my
leader, but I do not elect my president to do my thinking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the committee to at least temporarily remove $552
million from funds for the Colombian military, which has been tied
to the notorious paramilitary forces in three recent reports by
human rights organizations. Obey said more time was needed to study
the military's role in the counter-narcotics fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually none of us have the facts we need to know about this
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chairman C.W. Bill Young, a Florida Republican, said there
was no time to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential to eliminate the product where it is grown,''
Young said. ``Every day we delay eliminating these drugs, another
hundred or a thousands kids could be addicted. . . . We're not
satisfied this is the best program, but are we ever?''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan also expressed doubt about the package, calling it ``a
mile wide and an inch deep,'' but added: ``If anyone thinks drug
use in the United States is not an emergency, they better think
again.'' The committee defeated Obey's amendment 36-20.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Pelosi cited a Rand Corp. study in 1994 that found money
spent on treatment was 23 times more cost-effective than
eradication of crops and 11 times more cost-effective than
interdiction. She also noted that only 37 percent of America's 5.7
million hard-core addicts received treatment in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we neglect the obvious need in our country when
sending all that money to Colombia that is 23 times less
effective?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Edward Porter, an Illinois Republican,
answered that the Clinton administration didn't view treatment of
drug addicts as an emergency priority and didn't include it in
their package. ``We will take care of this problem'' later in
committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Young had said earlier on the military package, Michigan
Democrat Carolyn C. Kilpatrick of Michigan said action was needed
urgently for helping addicts, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergency is before our eyes,'' she said. ``How can we
pass a bill for Colombia that we're not sure will work and not
spend money for the people in our districts that we know will
help?''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's amendment lost 30-23 in a mostly party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   The $9 billion emergency bill also includes money for US troops
in Kosovo.

   DVD Format Gains a Foothold &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As DVD proliferates, so do the questions. Will DVD ever replace
VHS? Will we rent or buy the discs? Where are prices headed? As the
format becomes more mainstream, the answers refine themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among studios and distributors holds that DVD will
replace VHS within about five to seven years. But with VCRs in more
than 90 percent of households in the United States, the
videocassette may never disappear entirely, and video industry
people note that no single technology completely replaces another.
</P>
<P>
   With 5 million DVD players in use, VHS overwhelmingly
predominates, but retailers say they are noticing the beginnings of
a shift. ``The DVD player is going into the parents' room or family
room, the VCR into the kids' room,'' said Lon Weingart, a senior
vice president of Hollywood Video, the country's second largest
chain.
</P>
<P>
   The discs' cost of $25 to $39 encourages sales, but many
newcomers to DVD want to rent discs the way they do cassettes.
Meeting a big rental demand requires big inventories, which in turn
introduces all of video's legendary pricing complications.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the trick is to keep retail prices low enough to
promote sales and wholesale prices high enough to allow studios and
dealers to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood Video the DVD demand is primarily rental. Weingart
said that there had been no major customer complaints about a
shortage of hit titles, but this could change as the numbers of DVD
players and renters increase.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem the chain has with DVD is the occasional lag
between the release dates of the videocassette and the DVD, he
said. Studios generally try to get the disc out the same day as the
tape, but movies on DVD don't always appear on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most do, some don't,'' he said. One that won't is ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' due on videocassette next month.
For his own reasons, George Lucas, creator of the ``Star Wars''
films, has withheld them from DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Not producing such a big title on DVD hurts a format reaching
for the masses. ``To have to explain why a movie is available on
VHS and not DVD is a very difficult position to put our stores
in,'' Weingart said. ``It's a real customer service issue.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's to Bogart at 100 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took Warner a while to recognize Humphrey Bogart's 100th
birthday (he was born on Jan. 23, 1899), but the studio is playing
catch-up with a collection of 18 Bogart films on videocassette. The
group, released on Tuesday, includes three first-timers on tape.
The best is ``The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), with Bogart as
a hood called Rocks and Edward G. Robinson as a prominent doctor
who furthers his research into criminals by becoming one (and a
good one, too).
</P>
<P>
   The others are ``Black Legion'' (1936), with Bogart getting
involved with the Ku Klux Klan, and ``The Wagons Roll at Midnight''
(1941), with Bogart as a circus master. But for an amusing sendup
of the criminal justice system along with a lesson on how to wear a
double-breasted suit, try ``The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse.'' &QL;

   One wonders how the recorded seat-belt appeal in New York City
taxis might be amended to inform passengers about a driver who
locks them in and speeds off to underground caverns, where he
steams them to death or bloodies them some to attract swarms of
rats.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a case for the super forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme
(Denzel Washington), an imperious quadriplegic who oversees the
investigation second by second via a computer system that
instantaneously links him to anything. Left to retrieve the
corpses, his gorgeous protegee, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie),
gets the creepy end of an adventure in which, Stephen Holden wrote

SINGLE LIVER USED TO HELP TWO PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two patients who had been on the brink of death a
little over a month ago _ a 45-year-old-man and an infant _ were
smiling Thursday at the successful outcome of a still-rare type of
transplant operation in which two people split a donor liver from
one cadaver. The procedure was done at Massachusetts General
Hospital last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, donor livers are in short supply. Nearly 15,000
people with varying stages of liver disease are on a waiting list,
according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit
organization that maintains the US organ transplant waiting list
and helps set transplant policy. Fewer than 5,000 get an organ in
any given year.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted doctors at a few medical centers across the
country to perform ``split-liver'' transplants in which one donor
liver is divided into a small portion, typically given to a child,
and a larger portion, given to an adult. In 1998, the last year for
which figures are available, there were only 138 split-liver
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   At MGH, one such operation was done successfully in November,
but the families declined to make their cases public. Thursday, the
families of Larry Hause, 45, and Jazmyn Thomson Bordoy, 19 months
old, decided to share their good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The saga began at 8 p.m on January 31. Hause, a 45-year-old
Scituate man who used to install carpets and flooring for a living,
was in the hospital, with just days to live.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Hause had been so severely burned that he needed
blood transfusions. Though no one knew it at the time, those
transfusions infected him with hepatitis C, a virus that attacks
the liver. For more than 20 years he did well, but in recent months
his liver had been failing, Hause said Thursday from his room at
MGH.
</P>
<P>
   That January night, Hause was losing ground rapidly. He needed a
liver transplant and had been at the top of the transplant list for
weeks _ but no donor organs had been found. Then he got a call from
one of his specialists, Dr. Sandy Feng: MGH finally had a cadaver
liver, but there was a catch.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby room at MGH, an infant, 18-month old Jazmyn Thompson
Bordoy of Boston, was also in desperate need of a new liver. She
had been born with biliary atresia, a condition in which the bile
ducts in the liver are missing or don't function. Like Hause's,
Jazymn's blood type matched that of the donor liver.
</P>
<P>
   Feng told Hause and his family, who had just made the drive from
Scituate, of her proposal: If Hause was willing, she wanted to
split the cadaver liver so that Hause got 80 percent, enough to
save his life, and Jazmyn, the other 20 percent, enough to save
hers. Hause doesn't remember the moment. ``I was so sick. Was I
given a choice? I made the choice?''
</P>
<P>
   But his mother, Mary Hause, remembers it vividly: ``No one
opened their mouth. He decided to do this on his own. . .He was
terribly nervous and afraid, but he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor assured Hause that once they opened him up, if he
needed the whole liver he would get it, and that Jazmyn could use
her other option, a piece of her father's liver. Her father, Isaac
Bordoy, had been tested and was at MGH, ready for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The father ``was an appropriate donor,'' said Dr. Ben Cosimi,
chief of the MGH transplant unit. ``We were about to do a living
donor transplant for her almost as an emergent procedure, when this
other opportunity'' came along.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to share the donor liver with Jazymn, Hause was
taking a risk with his own chances, noted Cosimi. ``The reason this
(split liver transplants) hasn't caught on more is that there is a
slightly increased risk'' of complications.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, recipients who get partial liver transplants in general
have a 5 percent less chance of success'' than those who get a full
liver, said Cosimi. ``We presented this honestly and he said,
`That's fine, if this can help the child'. . .it was almost like he
donated the organ to someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazmyn has already gone home. Hause hopes to go home soon. His
mother says simply, ``It makes us all feel good.''

&HT;     SENATE CONFIRMS TWO CALIFORNIA NOMINEES TO 9TH CIRCUIT COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a bitter debate, the Senate on Thursday
confirmed two controversial California nominees to the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals, ending years of political wrangling over
their appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berzon, 54, a San Francisco lawyer, was approved by a
64-34 vote. Less than an hour later, the Senate confirmed U.S.
District Court Judge Richard A. Paez by a 59-39 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Paez's nomination had been stalled for four years, longer than
any other federal judicial nominee in modern history. Berzon was
nominated more than two years ago. The 9th circuit court covers
California and eight other Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the long delays, Democrats had charged that the
Republicans were resisting nominations of women and minorities.
Paez is Mexican American.
</P>
<P>
   During the floor debate, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., called the votes on the two ``long overdue.'' He added, ``I
can't imagine how anybody could rationalize, could explain why we
would put any nominee through the anguish that these two have had
to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the drama behind the final votes was played out behind
the scenes. Vice President Al Gore flew to Washington, cutting
short a Midwest campaign swing, after Daschle called him Wednesday
night saying that he, as president of the Senate, might be needed
to break a tie on Paez.
</P>
<P>
   The call came after Paez and Berzon supporters in the Senate
succeeded in halting a filibuster mounted by conservative
Republicans. At that point, Berzon was seen as easily winning
confirmation, but Paez, who had gained support from several GOP
senators, was still not a shoo-in. Chris Lehane, press secretary
for Gore's presidential campaign, quoted Daschle as saying he
``anticipated a very, very close vote'' on Paez.
</P>
<P>
   After the Thursday confirmations, Gore declared in Spanish,
``Friends, today we've finally achieved justice.'' He added, ``It
is inexcusable that the Republican Senate played politics with
these crucial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   `We've seen a troubling pattern of the Republican Party standing
against qualified judicial nominees who happen to be women and
minorities,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Paez, who was strongly supported by Hispanic groups, is a former
legal aid attorney and served as a Los Angeles Municipal Court
judge for 14 years before being named to the lower federal court in
1994. Berzon, an expert in labor law, has specialized in federal
appeals cases. She is a member of the board of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also referred to the nominees' diverse
backgrounds in hailing the votes at the end of a White House
meeting with religious leaders: ``I think maybe we're, by fits and
starts, moving toward our one America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore urged the Senate to confirm more federal court
nominees. Gore said that an ``alarming'' number of vacancies are
causing problems in the nation's justice system. ``When it comes to
our judiciary, justice delayed is still justice denied,'' he
said.Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., hailed the confirmation votes as
a ``wonderful day for justice, even though we had a long, tortuous
path to this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the two nominations were flashpoints of
controversy. Conservative Republicans argued that Paez and Berzon
were too liberal and would only add to an already liberal 9th
circuit court. Democrats countered that the two were mainstream
legal scholars and accused the GOP leadership of stalling the
nominations because of a bias against Hispanics and women.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's debate, both sides revisited those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong with this circuit,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. ``It's extremely liberal and it
will get worse with these two nominees.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader also rejected the accusations that he and
other Senate Republicans were reluctant to confirm women and
minority nominees. ``This is politics at its most crass, and I hate
to see anybody inside or outside of Washington lower themselves to
that level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Paez of being a judicial activist, Sen. Robert Smith,
R-N.H., said the judge ``feels free to say which laws he likes and
which laws he doesn't.'' Smith added: ``Judges are supposed to be
impartial. He goes over the line.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats noted that Paez has publicly stated he is against
any form of judicial activism. The Democrats also insisted that the
liberal tag has been unfairly applied to Paez, former head of the
Legal Aid Foundation, and Berzon, who has won major cases at the
Supreme Court. ``Both of these candidates have been endorsed by
numerous law enforcement groups,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif. ``How is that liberal?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the confirmation of Paez and Berzon, there are still 73
vacancies on federal courts. Republicans defended their attempt to
block the confirmations of Paez and Berzon, saying that,
historically, few judges are confirmed in the final year of a
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the People for the American Way, a liberal
advocacy group, the Senate has in fact confirmed substantial
numbers of judges at the end of previous administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four judges were confirmed in 1980, 44 in 1984, 42 in 1988
and 66 in 1992. So far, the Senate has confirmed seven judicial
nominees including Paez and Berzon this year. With their addition
to the 9th circuit court, that bench still has four vacancies.

   Capturing Insanity
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Commuters on the FDR Drive on a recent weeknight may
have been startled to see a bright celestial apparition in place of
the narrow footbridge that connects Manhattan to Wards Island.
Magnificently lighted by the cinematographer Amy Vincent and her
crew, the bridge was being transformed into part of the dream world
of Romulus Ledbetter, a homeless schizophrenic known to his
acquaintances as the Caveman.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Caveman's Valentine,'' which is being produced by Danny
DeVito's Jersey Films for release next fall by Universal, the title
character is portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Once a promising Juilliard-trained pianist, Romulus has suffered
a mental breakdown and abandoned his family to live in a cave in
Inwood Hill Park. Now a raving paranoid, he believes the world is
controlled by a mysterious being named Stuyvesant who lives at the
top of the Chrysler Building and enforces his will through an army
of faceless foot soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight,'' said the producer Stacey Sher, ``will be the big
No-Face shootout,'' the climactic confrontation that will pit
Romulus against the monsters who inhabit his hallucinations.
Shooting was scheduled to begin at sunset, and a crew was busily
covering a nearby playground with artificial snow, the unusually
warm New York weather having failed to provide the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of chicks around here,'' observed Sher, as she
watched Vincent set up her lighting in close consultation with the
film's director, Kasi Lemmons. This is the second collaboration
between Lemmons and Vincent, who worked together on Lemmons' first
film as a director, the acclaimed 1997 ``Eve's Bayou.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy and I are big believers in storyboards,'' Lemmons said.
``We draw the whole movie out, and it helps us to get things
organized in our heads. Then we tend to extrapolate from the
storyboards as we go along in the process. They give us a map that
we can deviate from.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons, 39, began her career as an actor, appearing most
notably as Jodie Foster's fellow FBI trainee in ``The Silence of
the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were plenty of less satisfying work experiences. ``I
was fed up with the triviality of my acting career,'' she said.
``So I went and studied cinematography, and that kind of added to
my way of looking at things. Definitely the combination of acting
and writing and wanting to be a director of cinematography have
added to my approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons shares credit for the screenplay of ``Caveman's
Valentine'' with George Dawes Green, author of the 1995 novel on
which the movie is based, and Scott Frank, whose work includes
``Get Shorty'' and ``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someplace between my reading George's draft and adding my
little input to it I began to visualize the film completely,'' said
Lemmons, who was then led off by an assistant to complete the
process. The camera turned, and words became images.
</P>
<P>
   Director's Jet Lag
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Nossiter is just back from the 50th Berlin
International Film Festival, and he isn't feeling so good. His new
film, ``Signs and Wonders,'' was drafted as the token independent
American film in the festival's competition section, where the
other contenders included ``The Beach,'' ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley'' and ``Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two American critics bothered to see ``Signs and Wonders,''
and both hated it, calling it pretentious and anti-American. Their
reviews appeared in the trade publications Variety and The
Hollywood Reporter, and that won't help the film's chances of
receiving major theatrical distribution. ``They weren't just
negative,'' Nossiter said. ``They were apocalyptic.''
</P>
<P>
   But others have found ``Signs and Wonders'' to be a work of
great skill and resonance. Like Nossiter's previous feature, the
1997 Sundance winner ``Sunday,'' it is an intimate psychological
portrait of a middle-aged man in crisis. (Here, Stellan Skarsgard
plays an American businessman in Athens, Greece, who leaves his
loving wife, Charlotte Rampling, for a disastrous affair with a
co-worker, Deborah Kara Unger, and then clumsily attempts to
return.)
</P>
<P>
   And like ``Sunday,'' this film is an anomaly among indie
productions in that its characters are not instantly likable,
something that seems to have deeply offended the American
reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the film is going to divide people,'' said Nossiter
over coffee near his walk-up apartment in the Little Italy section
of New York. ``I'm surprised by that. You don't set out to make a
film to divide people, but to engage as many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stellan is one of the few actors willing to embrace a
peculiarly male monstrousness. I find him immensely sympathetic
precisely because of the vulnerability and the nakedness with which
he expresses a very male mania.''
</P>
<P>
   Nossiter, 38, spent his childhood in France, England, Italy,
Greece and India, and cultural displacement remains one of the
central themes of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signs and Wonders'' takes place in an Athens unrecognizable
from the tourist brochures _ a city of concrete, sharp angles and
looming billboards for American franchises. ``I knew I was in
trouble,'' Nossiter said, ``when the first question at the press
conference was `How much did McDonald's pay you for the product
placement?'''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he decided to shoot on video rather than film because
of ``the immediacy of the relationship between physical space and
human beings that video seems to provide,'' he said. He was also
able to take advantage of new digital techniques that allowed him
to alter the color and lighting of scenes already shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, the technology was available only to big-budget
special-effects films, but in the past few months these things have
become more accessible and infinitely cheaper,'' Nossiter said.
``It's an amazing freedom for the director that is completely new.
You can go back and readjust the look of the film to fit the
emotions. These are brand new tools, and I found them incredibly
exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Vive la Streep
</P>
<P>
   Last week Meryl Streep joined Beverly Sills, the photographer
Duane Michaels and the trumpeter Clark Terry in being inducted as
an ``officier'' of the French Order of Arts and Letters in a
ceremony with French officials in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I take a film to France,'' Streep said, ``I am
struck because the journalists that I speak to engage in the most
penetrating and infuriating and passionate and interesting
conversations about film, about acting, about the state of the
world as reflected in film culture. It's such a thrill, and it
reminds me of how we just don't look at it that way back home, in
the hurly-burly of marketing movies.''

 &HT;    Bradley acknowledges `closing of this chapter'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ Having officially withdrawn from the
Democratic race and thrown his support to Vice President Al Gore,
Bill Bradley concluded his valedictory news conference Thursday
with a presentation to the national media.
</P>
<P>
   As his staff hummed an off-key rendition of ``Pomp and
Circumstance,'' the graduation march, Bradley called reporters,
producers and photographers to the podium to give each some parting
gifts _ ``two tokens of my respect,'' Bradley called them.
</P>
<P>
   The first gift was a silver Tiffany key chain with a small
basketball shoe, symbolic of Bradley's basketball playing days and
the long road he traveled to attempt the Democratic nomination. The
second was a small tin of Bradley's favorite throat lozenges, which
continually rattled in his mouth whenever he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley apologized that he didn't have gifts for everyone in the
room. ``But I wanted to make sure that we at least give a momento
for those who were here most often,'' he said, with wife Ernestine
at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was typical of Bradley, part ironic, part
genuine. It was a side to his personality that he displayed little
during his 14-month bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But as he saw the nomination slipping away in the campaign's
closing two weeks, Bradley allowed himself more of such moments. On
Thursday, the final day of what may be his only presidential
campaign, Bradley appeared very much at peace with himself, opening
his news conference with a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to begin this morning with a discussion of my favorite
books,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wasn't angry. He sounded at once philosophical and
realistic about his overwhelming defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, personally, today means the closing of this chapter,''
Bradley said. ``It is something I believe that I gave my full
heart, mind, soul and energy to. And it didn't turn out. As I said
the other night, you win and lose. This is a loss, and you move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley declined to engage in too much Monday morning
quarterbacking about how his once promising campaign came up so
short, but offered two explanations for his failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really get across the extent to which this wasn't
really a campaign of self-interest,'' Bradley said. People ``came
to support me ... because they truly believed in what we were
trying to do, in terms of the goodness of the American people, in
terms of the need for a new politics and in terms of the issues
that we thought illustrated the values I espoused. ... Maybe we
could have done a better job of getting across that aspect of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Sen. John McCain's withdrawal from the Republican
primary, Bradley said his loss also demonstrated the long odds
challengers face against incum- bents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how difficult it is to run against entrenched power
in this country,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley pledged to work for Gore, although it is unclear how
much the vice president will use Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Bradley stood by his contention that Gore had
misrepresented his record and said he hoped Gore would ``run a
better campaign in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said that he would continue to speak candidly about
Gore's involvement in the 1996 fund-raising scandals. He repeated
his assertion that Gore needs to explain more about his role in a
controversial fund-raising luncheon at a Buddhist temple in
California. But he softened his rhetoric somewhat, saying Gore's
recent acknowledgement that he made a mistake was promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to do that more,'' Bradley said. ``And I do think
that he needs to remove that issue by opening up on what happened
in 1996. I haven't changed my view on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gore said, Bradley is ``a good man whom I
respect greatly'' and commended him ``for running a good campaign
based on the highest ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his good-byes at a catering hall a short distance
from his campaign headquarters. A hundred or so of his staff
attended, cheering Bradley after his opening remarks, and jeering
when a member of the press asked if Bradley would consider being
Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be a candidate for vice president,'' Bradley said,
as his staff erupted in applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he planned to take a vacation with his wife before
returning to ``work hard'' for Gore and other Democratic candidates
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, no one, not even his closest advisers, could say
for sure what is ahead for the 56-year-old former New Jersey
senator. ``He obviously is going to continue to be active on the
issues he cares about,'' said Anita Dunn, his communications
director.

new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOILER ROOM,' starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Ben
Affleck. Written and directed by Ben Younger (R, 110 minutes).
Ribisi portrays a young stockbroker in training at a fly-by-night
company called J.T. Marlin. Like Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street,''
``Boiler Room'' tells the story of an ambitious young man's rise,
fall and redemption. And like Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, Ribisi's
Seth carries some heavy Oedipal baggage _ a troubled relationship
with his demanding, disapproving father _ onto the trading floor.
But at its best, which is awfully good, ``Boiler Room'' avoids the
thumping moralism that has made Stone the least misunderstood
director in Hollywood. It's less about selling your soul than about
feeling your oats (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple
(Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,'` starring Forest Whitaker.
Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Jarmusch
does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for
the western in ``Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of
cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative,
bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which
may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ``Ghost
Dog'' is worth seeing for Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a
modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Jarmusch's
offbeat sense of cinematic style, and for the hip-hop artist the
RZA's brilliant musical effects (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `HANGING UP,' starring Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow and
Walter Matthau. Directed by Keaton (PG-13, 92 minutes). This
chilly, unfunny comedy about three grown-up sisters dealing with
the decline and death of their dear old dad (Matthau), a fading
alcoholic screenwriter, is a series of machine-tooled Hallmark
moments guaranteed not to threaten anyone's sense of well-being.
The characters are one-dimensional, the jokes limp and Ryan more
abrasively perky than usual as a harried party planner and Little
Ms. Fixit who seems to live on her cell phone (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE NEXT BEST THING,' starring Rupert Everett and Madonna.
Directed by John Schlesinger (PG-13, 107 minutes). A contemporary
screwball comedy about a Los Angeles yoga teacher (Madonna) and her
gay best friend (Everett) who have a baby together, ``The Next Best
Thing'' intermittently fizzes in its early scenes. But once it gets
serious, the movie turns into a stumbling, poor man's ``Kramer vs.
Kramer.'' Madonna is a curt, cool cookie whose painfully flat
performance is all but devoid of feeling. Everett has a few bright
comic moments as a man who discovers the joys of fatherhood
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ONE LESS,' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by
Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama
enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself
in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's
ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei
Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed
into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary
School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off
his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can
keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title),
sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a
slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a
work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive
power of Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle Thief'' (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `PITCH BLACK,' starring Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell. Directed
by David Twohy (R, 107 minutes). This snazzily designed, crisply
paced sci-fi horror film follows the survivors of a crash-landing
on a distant planet as they fight off swarms of bat-type carnivores
who streak out of the ground after a solar eclipse plunges the
desertlike outpost into total darkness. Although the lighting never
gets as pitch dark as the title implies, the movie is scary enough
to make you remember when you needed a night light to get to sleep.
And Diesel, as a hulking, thuggish convicted murderer who turns out
not to be as evil as he first appears demonstrates major
action-hero potential (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `REINDEER GAMES,' starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Charlize
Theron. Directed by John Frankenheimer (R, 99 minutes). This is a
wheel-within-a-wheel thriller that's a lot of fun until, near the
end, it becomes a Xerox copy of a blueprint of a hit. Affleck, who
suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent _ he wants to keep
his light under a bushel, but he's not quite up to it _ plays Rudy,
an ex-con who gets dragged into a casino heist planned for the
Christmas season. Theron is the girl who lures him into the job.
The seamy kicks of one double cross after another keep the movie in
motion, and Frankenheimer's ruthless precision keeps it on track
(Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SCREAM 3,' starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney
Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this
point it goes without saying that the ``Scream'' movies are like
episodes of ``Scooby Doo.'' Like the others, ``Scream 3'' belongs
on the Cartoon Network, but this time for a better reason: The film
is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more
satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to
the spine. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real
competition is not the recent hit films ``The Blair Witch Project''
and ``The Sixth Sense'' but rather ``Scream'' itself. ``Scream 3''
doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a personality
show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?' starring Garry Shandling, Greg
Kinnear and Annette Bening. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 115
minutes). There's a lot of Shandling in this movie, which isn't
surprising since he is one of its writers. He plays Harold, an
alien whose mission is to find a woman to bear him a child he can
take back to his home planet. Eventually the flakiness of
Earthlings infects Harold as he spends more time among them; he
can't trust himself anymore. It's ``The Man Who Fell to Earth''
played for laughs. Unfortunately, ``Planet'' is just as cold
conceptually. Nichols drapes his own dry imperiousness over the
script, and this results in a romantic comedy without a romance.
This movie wants to be sweet and dark at the same time, but it is
as distant as a planet's satellite (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WHOLE NINE YARDS,' starring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis.
Directed by Jonathan Lynn (R, 100 minutes). Oz (Perry) is a
nice-guy dentist beaten down by his bored wife. When the confident
Jimmy (Willis) breezes into the house next door, Oz's anxieties are
ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It turns out that
Jimmy is a former Chicago organized-crime figure who ratted out his
associates. The movie has an intricate plot, with hit men, love
interests, large sums of money and allegiances constantly in
motion. But the film is missing the verve of someone who can take a
simple idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a
sleepwalker. Despite Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous
gunplay that accounts for the second half of the movie, ``Yards''
is underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `WONDER BOYS,' starring Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand and
Tobey Maguire. Directed by Curtis Hanson (R, 112 minutes). This
film boasts a first-rate cast, a credible literary source and a
director whose last film, ``L.A. Confidential,'' showed a
prodigious ability to capture both the headlong rhythms of a
complex plot and the particularities of a motley assortment of
characters. But even with so much going for it, this adaptation of
Michael Chabon's novel about a pot-smoking middle-aged novelist
burdened by romantic and creative problems is flat and
unconvincing. There's no shortage of screwball material: a dead
dog, an errant tuba and a very tall drag queen, for starters. But
Hanson, perhaps aiming for wry understatement, has smothered
whatever antic rhythm the story might have had. In spite of a
brilliant supporting turn by Robert Downey Jr. as a gay book
editor, ``Wonder Boys'' is like a George Cukor movie with a bad
head cold: slow, muffled and vague (Scott).

 &HT;    Rust shows, but Avery's debut `pretty good'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Steve Avery was a little preoccupied Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it might have been weird to be back on the mound in a
Braves uniform for the first time since 1996, but for him it was
weird to be back on the mound, period. Coming off the first arm
surgery of his life in August when he had an arthroscopic procedure
on his shoulder, Avery said he felt bizarre but good.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched a scoreless fourth inning in the Braves' 8-7
exhibition win over the Los Angeles Dodgers and reported no pain
afterward. It was a positive first step in Avery's bid to return to
the Braves' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's news that John Smoltz is out for the season
with a torn elbow ligament, Terry Mulholland and Bruce Chen are
slated to be the fourth and fifth starters, but Avery's lurking as
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky to be here. I guess they're going to give me every
opportunity to try to get healthy and help this team,'' Avery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see myself in there somewhere down the road, I'm just
not sure when. ...When I can get out there and start throwing four,
five, six innings and not get tired, not feel the pain, then I know
I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery's only complaint Thursday was feeling out-of-kilter
mechanically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty good,'' he said. ``I felt like I hadn't been
there in about seven and a half months. Little rusty. It was
pain-free. I got three outs so it was good. But then again, it's a
long way from where I want to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a leadoff walk to Kevin Elster, Avery cruised through
his inning by getting a pop-up from Gary Sheffield, a flyout to
center by Shawn Green and a groundout by Kevin Orie. He threw 20
pitches, 11 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good for his first time out,'' Braves manager Bobby
Cox said. ``(His mechanics may be off) until he gets out there
more, but I was satisfied with what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery threw predominantly change-ups and fastballs with one
curveball mixed in. He would have preferred to throw nothing but
fastballs to work out his kinks but needed to mix it up to get
outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do a couple things different to try to throw harder,''
Avery said. ``You're not supposed to, but that's the way sometimes
you do it when you haven't been out there very often.''

 &HT;    Visually stunning `Mission' a space odyssey fit for 2001
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It is almost 2001, so perhaps it is time
for a new ``Space Odyssey.'' Director Brian De Palma, who built a
career on homages to Alfred Hitchcock, has shifted toborrowing from
Stanley Kubrick. But just because his foray into science fiction,
``Mission to Mars,'' lacks originality does not mean it is without
merit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, see if this sounds familiar: A team of astronauts embarks
on a lengthy space voyage, runs into mechanical difficulties that
require exterior repairs, aided by the voice of the ship's
omniscient computer.
</P>
<P>
   The space jockeys reach their destination and make discoveries
that imply the existence of a higher intelligence that inspired
life on Earth. They solve a puzzle posed by the otherworldly
beings, and then one of the astronauts opts for a rebirth that will
presumably begin the life cycle again. Details vary, but in its
overall story arc, the resemblance of ``Mission to Mars to 2001: A
Space Odyssey'' is unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, ``Mission'' is stunning. The depiction of
weightlessness, whether dancing bodies, floating blood pellets or
helixes of M&AMP;Ms, is as convincing as ever captured on film. The
rocky terrain of Mars _ as played by the outskirts of Vancouver,
British Columbia _ is both beautiful and forbidding. And when the
land suddenly becomes animate and transforms itself into a
mysterious facial totem, the effect is truly awesome.
</P>
<P>
   If only there weren't so much cliched dialogue and so many
bone-headed actions by these highly trained, best-and-brightest
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay by Jim Thomas, John Thomas and Graham Yost leans
to fevered exchanges like: ``Jim, are you sure you want to do
this?'' ``I'm not sure about anything anymore.'' When the
Mars-bound, rescue-mission spaceship springs a couple of air leaks
and begins losing cabin pressure, heroic, brooding Jim McConnell
(Gary Sinise) doesn't bother to put on his helmet. This presumably
is for dramatic effect, so that he can almost expire from lack of
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   When Woody Blake (Tim Robbins) becomes adrift in space _ as
someone always does in these movies _ and his crew member wife,
Terri (Connie Nielsen), goes to save him, you can bet that common
sense will give way to emotions. And just in case you do not know
how to react, there is Ennio Morricone's heavy-handed and celestial
music score to guide the way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these wince points, there is an intelligence at work
in ``Mission to Mars,'' and not just from the Martians. Like
``2001,'' the time spent aboard ship is steeped in the mission
minutia and hardware of science fact, all the better to persuade us
of what the team finds on Mars. And who would not want to believe
that there is intelligent life out there, willing to make contact,
to connect with mere humans and share the secrets of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   As in most space flicks, the muted acting takes a backseat to
the special effects. This is the inevitable consequence of
performing while encased in a thermal suit and space helmet. The
``Mars'' cast does well enough in a low-key way, even when they
have an extraterrestrial encounter.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the first of this year's interplanetary movies to
land, with ``Red Planet,'' ``Titan A.E.'' and ``Battlefield Earth''
still to come. Those with no interest in what could be lurking
beyond our world may be excused from attendance. Those who are
drawn to the ride, and do not mind an experience more geared to
wonder than terror, will find it in ``Mission to Mars.'' Plus, the
movie should do great things for M&AMP;M sales.

TECH STOCKS PROPEL NASDAQ INDEX TO 5000-PLUS CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stock index closed above 5000 Thursday for the first
time as speculators chasing profits in technology stocks drove the
index to a summit two times higher than it was seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The high-flying Nasdaq added 154.20 points, a 3 percent gain, to
close at 5046.86. The Blue Chips of the technology industry drove
the Nasdaq to its new high, causing a 4000-point record, achieved
just 10 weeks ago, to recede in the market's rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's remarkable performance, looked at another way, has
caused a doubling in its value since Aug. 10, a phenomenon that
seasoned investment professionals said they had never before
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is the individual is leading this
market,'' said Chris Bertelsen, portfolio manager for Phoenix
Investment Partners. ``Speculation is certainly part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, hammered Tuesday as investors
fled old-line companies for tech stocks, was lifted out of an
early-day decline Thursday by strong performance in companies such
as Hewlett-Packard Co. The computer hardware maker, which traded
below $70 a share four months ago, closed Thursday at $151.875, up
$11 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Thursday closed at 10,010.73, up 154.20 points, or 1.5
percent, though the major market index is still down 13 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But attention was riveted to the Nasdaq, which has gained 24
percent this year. The Nasdaq has seen a flood of new money into
technology stocks from individual investors, both day traders and
mutual fund investors, and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisers, a division of State Street Corp., said that $97 billion
went into aggressive growth and technology-oriented stock funds
during 1999. This year alone $65 billion has already flowed into
those funds.
</P>
<P>
   By another estimate, $700 million was funneled into eight
technology and computer funds in the first five days of March,
according to California-based TrimTabs.com Investment Research Inc.
That amounted to half of the inflows into those same funds for the
entire month of February.
</P>
<P>
   A building wave of money into technology has caused the index's
performance to accelerate. It took 24 years for the once-novel
Nasdaq to top 1000 and three years more to get to 2000. Climbing to
3000 took 15 months, and 4000 only two additional months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly being driven by the Internet phenomenon,'' said
Riley. ``Whether it's PCs or semiconducutors or software companies,
their growth rates (are) projected in the future to be far suprior
to growth rates the Old Economy stocks might be offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley and others said institutional investors, under pressure to
turn in a good performance, are beginning to take note and put more
money into the technology sector, too. ``People are really caught
in the lemming syndrome right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, a note of defensiveness could be detected even in the
Nasdaq's rise. Some of the biggest gains posted by technology
stocks Thursday were large companies: Cisco Systems Inc., up
$6.9375 to $139.3125.; American Online Inc., up $6.125 to 61;
Microsoft Corp., up $4.4375 to $100 a share.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are viewed as a safer bet than, say, a start-up
that recently went public. However, some smaller companies also
soared. Network Solutions Inc. and I2 Technologies Inc. were among
10 members of the Nasdaq 100 Index to rise more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investor has been used to very high returns, and they want
to continue getting those high returns _ and they're certainly not
getting them in the traditional funds,'' said Robert Freedman,
executive vice president of John Hancock Funds, explaining the
stampede to technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Given the bubbly enthusiasm, investment experts said there is no
evidence the momentum of the Nasdaq index is losing steam. Two
separate warnings this week by Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan did little to dampen investors' enthusiasm for tech
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Four stocks rose for every three that fell on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The technology index trades for 56 times estimated earnings,
compared with 23 times profit for the consumer staples index and 24
times for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. The S&AMP;P index gained 34.99
points Thursday, closing at 1401.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it's probably going to go higher,'' said Marshall
Acuff, equity strategist for Salomon Smith Barney. ``I'm not one to
argue with momentum at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dow was dragged down in early trading Thursday by
its line-up of industrial and financial stocks, which have been
hurt by rising interest rates and the prospect they would go
higher. Fed policymakers next meet on March 21. Some Dow average
stocks fell, including International Paper Co., and Minnesota
Mining &AMP; Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are fearful that rate increases will hurt''
industrial, consumer and financial companies, said Jim Awad,
chairman of Awad Asset Management Inc., which oversees $1 billion
in investment funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seldom has an index risen as rapidly as the Nasdaq
composite has in leaping above the 5,000 mark, a hurdle it
surmounted Thursday little more than four months after it first
pushed past 3,000. Virtually never has an index done so with such
huge volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index gained 146.69 points, or 3.1 percent,
to 5,046.86 Thursday after having first traded over the mark on
Tuesday, only to fall below 4,750 during trading Wednesday before
it again began climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The move has been largely concentrated in only a handful of
sectors within the market _ biotechnology, computer technology and
telecommunications. Other sectors have generally lost value during
the period, as the decision of the Federal Reserve Board to push up
interest rates has taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Indexes of stocks that are not so concentrated in technology
have done much worse. While the Nasdaq composite is up 67 percent
since Nov. 3, 1999, the day it first closed over 3,000, the Dow
Jones industrial average is down 6 percent over the same period,
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks has risen just 3
percent.

   While most stocks were falling, the enthusiasm for the ``new
economy,'' dominated by the Internet, has only increased among
investors in recent months. And the performance of those stocks has
not matched that of biotechnology issues, which have nothing to do
with the Internet but which have suddenly come alive in their
strongest performance since 1992, when biotechnology stocks
dominated market speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has made it clear that he
expects to keep raising interest rates until the economy slows, and
he has forecast that the stock market's surge will slow or reverse,
thus dampening the wealth effect that has spurred consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Boston on Monday, Greenspan said the market was
``groping for the appropriate valuation of these companies'' and
noted that ``many analysts are now projecting that the rate of
increase in stock market wealth may soon begin to slow.'' In fact,
that has happened for most stocks, but the speculative fervor in
favored stocks has continued unabated, and margin debt _ the money
borrowed to buy stocks _ has begun to rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of shares that are rising has narrowed, pressure
has grown on money managers to buy the stocks that are working and
to shun the stocks that are not. That pressure has been intensified
by mutual fund investors, who have pulled money out of many funds
that have been poor performers while pouring cash into funds that
have been rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, valuation measures are being thrown out the
window,'' said Phillip Coburn, a strategist at Warburg Dillon Read.
He said that the average price of technology stocks, using a
measure that compares price-earnings multiples with earnings growth
rates, is now twice what investors deemed reasonable only a couple
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, money managers are only being prudent when
they load up on technology stocks. ``Given the fact that I don't
see the end in sight, I don't think they are being foolish,'' he
said. ``They are being practical, and they are making money for
their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   As the market has narrowed, even some of the large technology
stocks that had been market leaders have begun to falter. Qualcomm,
Dell Computer and Microsoft, all stars last year, are down in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses have been made up for by many other stocks,
however. ``We've had this change to lower-quality growth,'' said
Robert Farrell, a senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch. ``We
do have a hierarchy of big tech stocks,'' he added, ``but big tech
is giving way to smaller tech, to anything that has a good story.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners, the Nasdaq computer index is up 26 percent
and the Nasdaq telecommunications index has risen 19 percent since
the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains have paled next to those of the Nasdaq biotech
index, which has risen 63 percent this year and has leaped 144
percent since last Nov. 3, the day the Nasdaq composite first
topped 3,000. That is more than double the impressive move of the
overall Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   But this week the Nasdaq biotech index has fallen 10 percent,
without much in the way of news to explain the action. But then,
there was not that much news to explain the increase, other than
growing investor enthusiasm for the potential profits from new
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That volatility has beset the overall Nasdaq market as well. One
way to measure such volatility is to look at the number of days
when the Nasdaq index has closed with a gain or loss of at least 3
percent from the prior day, as it did Thursday. So far this year
there have been 12 such days _ six up and six down, an average of
more than one a week.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, during the eight years from 1988 through 1995,
there were 10 such days, an average of slightly more than one a
year. Even last year, when Nasdaq's volatility was greater than at
any time in the past, there were just 20 such days, an average of
fewer than two a month.
</P>
<P>
   That volatility has reflected the different forces competing for
investor attention. Some days the hopes for exciting new
technologies drive prices up. But on other days most Nasdaq stocks
succumb to the same concerns, often about higher interest rates,
that have bedeviled many other stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The real losers have been stocks that are vulnerable to higher
interest rates but have no competing technological allure. So far
this year, the Nasdaq bank index is down 19 percent and the Nasdaq
insurance index has lost 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Data from AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash
flows, shows that through March 8 funds specializing in the hot
areas _ aggressive growth, technology, small cap and biotech _ had
garnered 76 percent of the $93 billion investors have put into
stock funds. At that rate, said Robert Adler, the president of AMG,
the annual record for stock fund inflows will be broken by the end
of this month. In 1999, those hot sectors took in 41 percent of the
money invested in stock funds, up from 10 percent in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The massive inflows into the mutual funds are going into a
narrow group of funds,'' said L. Keith Mullins, who specializes in
small stocks as an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Clearly,
money is chasing performance.''

   MCCAIN (Sedona, Ariz.) _ Sen. John McCain, the Republican whose
insurgency became the surprise of the primary season, ended his
maverick candidacy on Thursday with the hope that he would prevail
in ``making our party as big as the country we serve.'' Two days
after being soundly defeated in coast-to-coast primaries, McCain
had gracious words for Texas Gov. George W. Bush but stopped
noticeably short of endorsing him. McCain also ended speculation
that he might make a third-party run by repeating once again, ``I
love my party, it is my home.'' By Alison Mitchell. (With photos)

include talk of multiples and the latest IPO and where a recent
collision between two students in a high school parking lot here,
to no one's surprise, involved a brand-new Toyota SUV Forerunner

Mrs. Lien, 36, has found dignity amid the debris. She runs a shop
that sells Vietnamese noodles to the camp's 1,070 refugees. Her two

announced it was shutting down its last refugee camp for Vietnamese
boat people, ending a drama that began in May 1975. By Mark

<TEXT>
<P>
   Value is scorned and ignored. Money managers who pay attention
to the traditional measures of valuation post horrible results and
see customers flee.
</P>
<P>
   But even as value is disdained by the multitude, the seeds of
its revival are being sown. This week's debacle in Procter &AMP;
Gamble, in which a moderate profit shortfall caused the maker of
Tide and Crest to shed $40 billion in market value, may be a
precursor of what will happen as other beloved stocks fall by the
wayside.
</P>
<P>
   That is not, it must be acknowledged, how a lot of people see
it. James J. Cramer, the money manager and market commentator who
is in the majority of investors who now treasure high-flying
technology stocks, sounded gleeful: ``If there is more risk in P&AMP;G
than Broadcom or Brocade but much less reward, which are you going
to be in?'' he asked rhetorically in his column on TheStreet.com.
``All of that price-to-earnings flotsam and
discount-to-normalized-earnings jetsam didn't save you today.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom and Brocade, both in the computer business, are among
the stars of the two-year boom in new offerings. They trade at more
than 300 times projected profits and at more than 30 times their
original offering prices. Anyone who worried about valuation missed
that phenomenal performance.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson that many people have taken from such stock moves is
that the old valuation measures are irrelevant. Until a few years
ago, measuring stock prices as multiples of such factors as
earnings, revenue and book value was generally accepted. Even
growth-stock investors used measures that related growth rates to
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But as share prices rose and went through traditional limits,
those who ignored the old rules profited. No new valuation concepts
arose, so what matters now is whether people are disappointed.
Stocks soar on good news, no matter how expensive they already are.
``We no longer have touchstones, because we no longer think we know
how to value companies,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist
of Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the process has accelerated. Money managers
who care about value have done badly and lost customers to managers
that buy the Broadcoms and Brocades of the world, whatever their
price.
</P>
<P>
   But even as less money has been invested by those relying on the
old notions of value, the potential importance of those concepts
may be rising. P&AMP;G had until recently been one of the favored
stocks, a big company that benefited from strong brands and the
flood of money that went into index funds tracking the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, its price-to-earnings multiple gradually expanded
until it stood at 37 at the end of 1999. Contrary to what Cramer
seems to think, it was not believers in ``price-to-earnings
flotsam'' who paid such prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news. The company disclosed that profits would
be down about 10 percent this quarter. It had not prepared analysts
for that, and suddenly a lot of shareholders wanted out. They
yelled ``sell'' all at once.
</P>
<P>
   But who would buy? The answer was that some who cared about
value were willing to step in _ once P&AMP;G fell to a multiple that
seemed reasonable under the old rules. It now trades for about 19
times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G may be prologue for many companies. Those that disappoint
will fall until they look cheap _ based on old-fashioned valuation
measures _ to the dwindling band of investors not playing the
momentum game. Then value will matter, even to those who now
disdain such ``jetsam.''

 &HT;    McCain suspends his campaign bid
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ John McCain ended his presidential campaign
Thursday, conceding that rival George W. Bush has effectively
locked up the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Red rock mountains tinged with snow provided a spectacular
backdrop as the Arizona senator announced he is suspending his
campaign for the White House, but not formally withdrawing from the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of Republican voters made clear that their
preference for president is Governor Bush. I respect their
decision,'' McCain said. ``Therefore, I announce today ... that I
am no longer an active candidate for my party's nomination for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointedly offered Bush his ``best wishes'' but not his
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before McCain bowed out, Bill Bradley quit the race for
the Democratic nomination and said he will support Vice President
Al Gore because ``it is time for unity'' to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator telephoned Gore to pledge support.
But at a news conference in West Orange, N.J., Bradley said he will
not release his delegates, saying they had earned a voice at the
Democratic National Convention. He had 412 _ more than 1,000 behind
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's decision to suspend his campaign rather than withdraw
may allow him to collect his full allotment of federal campaign
funds, including convention expenses. It also gives himleverage in
his battle to ensure that the GOP heeds his twin campaign themes of
campaign finance reform and inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also retained control of his 231 delegates, a fraction of
the 1,034 needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides did not read much into the distinction between
withdrawing and suspending the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got out of the race today by any stretch of the
explanation,'' said Howard Opinsky, McCain's campaign press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, with his wife Cindy beside him, had few warm words for
Bush. The Republican primary fight bruised feelings in both camps
and left McCain unable to say that Bush had run an honorable
campaign when he was asked about it last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Colorado, congratulated his former rival
``for fighting the good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said he had ``a very short'' telephone
conversation with McCain, but didn't ask for his endorsement. ``I
intend to talk with him at his convenience,'' Bush told reporters.
``There needs to be some time to settle out. John needed some time
to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to McCain said they are waiting to see how far Bush is
willing to go to adopt some of their candidate's views and to heal
any wounds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain referred to himself as a loyal Republican, seemingly
closing the door on a third-party run for the presidency. ``I love
my party. It is my home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he told supporters to continue the fight for reform, and
said he would join them. ``I will never walk away from a fight for
what I know is right and just for our country,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator wore the same ``lucky'' thick-soled shoes that he
first put on in New Hampshire, then continued to wear after he won
the primary there.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke for seven minutes and did not take questions, a rare
one-sided encounter with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sparked more enthusiasm and won more votes than anyone
could have imagined when he started his campaign 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a startlingly large victory in New Hampshire, he
captured seven primaries and posed a serious obstacle to Bush's
march to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain never connected with Republican voters in the same
way he drew Democrats and independents. Bush began to pile up
primary victories by attracting enough votes from Republicans to
withstand crossover votes for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   After winning nine of 13 state contests Tuesday, Bush had
amassed enough convention delegates to show that he could not be
stopped. He may clinch the nomination by Tuesday, when Texas and
five other Southern states hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain met Wednesday with family members, senior aides and major
financial backers at his vacation home here in northern Arizona.
They quickly concluded that continuing the campaign would be futile
and might damage the public's perception of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew precisely what he wanted to do,'' said John
Raidt, a longtime aide to the senator.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scrapped his campaign schedule that was to have taken him
to Colorado and Illinois on Thursday and today.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the discussion focused on how best to make sure his
message continues to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for McCain's supporters has already begun. Both Bush
and Gore have made appeals to independent voters who flocked to
McCain in state after state.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain voters could well determine the outcome of this
election,'' Raidt said.

WITH RETURN OF PINOCHET, TENSIONS GROW IN CHILE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Twenty-seven years ago, it was an unusual mix
of characters that led to this country's darkest and most violent
moment: A newly elected socialist president, an omnipotent general
and a powerful, disciplined army in a conservative but divided
South American nation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chile is nervously facing a similar set of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Lagos will be sworn in Saturday as the country's first
socialist president since 1973. General Augusto Pinochet, the
iron-fisted leader who overthrew the last socialist leader,
Salvador Allende, came home last week to a hero's welcome after 16
months of house arrest in London for human rights violations. And
the military, still loyal to its beloved general, has defiantly
backed away from attempts to find the remains of victims killed
during Pinochet's dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, almost no one in Chile expects another coup d'etat,
largely because of the catastrophic effects it would have on the
economy and international relations, and because of the confidence
Chileans have in their young democracy. But there is an uncertainty
hanging over this arid and mountainous land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Hollywood sequel in a way,'' said Nicolas Lozano,
a 26-year-old poet. ``Only this time the ending would be different.
I think there will be some nervousness, but mostly peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the unease felt here is not so much about the
84-year-old Pinochet, who doctors have portrayed as physically and
mentally weak and who still faces 65 lawsuits at home from the
deaths and disappearances of foes during his dictatorship. Nor is
it about Lagos, who despite his socialist label has offered mostly
centrist economic and social policy ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The questions largely surround the army, which controlled nearly
every major office during Pinochet's rule, including the ``death
caravans'' that hunted down his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions arose last week, when the retired general returned
home. When Pinochet's plane _ a military jet that had been
especially equipped for him _ touched down, a contingent of
decorated officers, an army band and a group of close friends and
family offered him a brief welcoming reception on the tarmac. The
first person to embrace Pinochet as he rose from his wheelchair was
Army Chief General Ricardo Izurieta.
</P>
<P>
   The reception and heavy security given the former dictator was
immediately denounced by the government as an act of defiance
because of Pinochet's legal troubles. An appellate judge earlier
this week recommended that Pinochet's parliamentary immunity be
revoked so that he could stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials, however, saw the homecoming as ``a modest
act'' for a historic figure unjustly held in a foreign land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an official ceremony and it was never meant to be
one,'' said army spokesman Hermez Lopez. ``(Pinochet) has been
threatened many times so the security was necessary for his own
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, much of the anger expressed by anti-Pinochet
protesters this week has been also aimed at the armed forces. When
3,000 demonstrators marched along a downtown Santiago avenue on
Saturday demanding Pinochet be brought to trial, the throng stopped
outside the army's headquarters and pelted bottles, rocks and
stones at the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet should be held responsible for what he did,'' said
one marcher, community activist Edmundo Borrego. ``But we shouldn't
ignore the role of the entire military, because they were the ones
who carried out his orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists have also blamed military leaders for
stalling the work of a government-sponsored committee that has
asked military cooperation in investigating the disappearances of
hundreds of people during the dicatatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials were implicated Thursday in a story published
in the Argentine newspaper Clarin, which reported that the officers
had secretly masterminded a legal defense strategy for Pinochet
that was based on pressuring judges not to remove the former
strongman's immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the controversy, officers in all three armed forces
branches have insisted that today's military is different from the
one nearly three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized by analysts as the most disciplined force in Latin
America, Chile's 51,000-member army has been under a modernization
plan during the last several years, upgrading everything from its
management and training to its hardware, including the possible
purchase of US-made F-16 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a force that has tried to change as Chile has become
more modern,'' said Tom Cardamone, editor of the Washington-based
Arms Trade News. ``It has less domestic political influence since
the Pinochet era, but clear-cut civilian control is not there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Pinochet, whose 17-year dictatorship was known mostly for
its brutality and firm imposition of a free-market economy, the
military flourished with funds and power. Military rule ended in
1990, when Chile returned to civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some military experts say, the main issue for Chile's
armed forces is money. The army, navy and air force depend on
government allocations to pay its payroll, which has remained
relatively stable, but use a portion of revenues from Chile's state
copper mining company for equipment purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main issues that will most influence the
relationship between the new president and the military will be
money, for higher wages and better housing,'' said Armen
Kouyoumdjian, a Chilean military analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers and even some military officials predicted
Pinochet's legal fortunes may affect the relationship between
Chile's armed forces and the new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, (Pinochet) is still our hero and symbol,'' one army
soldier in Santiago, who refused to give his name, said earlier
this week. ``If he goes down, then others will follow, and no one
here wants to see that happen.''

BLAIR BARRED THE DOOR; RED KEN STORMS THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ken Livingstone is the ghost of Labor past, an
unsettling reminder to Prime Minister Tony Blair of the antic
politics, overheated oratory and excessive promises that the
British leader believes made the party he pointedly now calls New
Labor unelectable for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   With Livingstone's declaration this week that he will be an
independent candidate opposing the official Labor choice for the
first elected mayor for London, the disruptive specter once known
as ``Red Ken'' has returned, posing nightmarish problems for a
government with a horror of reliving its party's quarrelsome
history, little tolerance for defiance from within, and no talent
at admitting mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an energetic effort by the Blair government to discredit
him _ or more likely because of it _ Livingstone, 54, already looks
to be a winner in the May 4 election. A poll published in The
Guardian shows him with 68 percent support to only 13 percent for
the Labor candidate, Blair's former health secretary, Frank Dobson,
59. Steven Norris, 54, the Conservative, was at 11 percent and
Susan Kramer, 49, the Liberal Democrat, at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the London mayor's powers are limited, the office will
have a larger popular mandate than any other in British public life
and comes with Livingstone's favored piece of furniture: a soapbox.
Armed with a tart tongue, a passion for power and a gleeful
eagerness to stick his finger in the eye of authority, he looms as
the first opposition to Labor of any concern since the party turned
the Conservatives out of power in the electoral rout of May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal to a majority of London's 5 million voters seems at
the moment to be entirely a personal one. Issues have not come up.
His initial success is evidence that ideology and party political
control, while they may matter in national contests, do not count
for much in local elections like this, the first of its kind in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   London had a limited form of local government until 1986, when
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London
Council, then headed by Livingstone, and turned the running of the
city over to the national government. The unrelated position of
lord mayor, dating from 1215, is an appointive office filled by a a
business leader to oversee the City of London financial center for
a year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The raffish Livingstone mixture of cheek and brash
self-confidence that has alienated the Blair people has proved to
be the principal attraction to Londoners. Blair's overall
leadership is not threatened; he still has his sizable majority in
Parliament, the Conservative opposition is feckless, and there is
little doubt that he will get a second term in the next national
election, expected in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Though Blair remains the most popular prime minister in British
history, polling has shown that even his supporters fault him for
his iron command of his party. Standing up to that authority has
been what has enhanced Livingstone with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The savvy political operatives around Blair lost their touch
when it came to trying to halt Livingstone. Efforts by 10 Downing
St. to demonize him backfired. Blair from the outset has called the
prospect of Livingstone in office a ``disaster,'' and the party
devised a serpentine electoral college selection process to keep
him off the ballot. It allowed Dobson to emerge as the approved
candidate even though Livingstone got more votes, a result that was
greeted with ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's attempts to manipulate the rules of the political game
were so obvious that even the House of Lords was able to posture as
a champion of unfettered elections, forcing the government this
week to agree to finance the cost of mailing campaign literature
from all candidates to every voter.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of being bullied by Labor headquarters gave
Livingstone his chance to explain away his decision to break with
the party despite repeated pledges in recent months that he would
not. ``I offer no weasel words of equivocation, and I apologize,''
he said. ``But what I do not intend to do is take any lectures from
those who have set new standards in ballot rigging.''
</P>
<P>
   Stealing Blair's favorite possessive, he proclaimed his effort a
``people's campaign'' and appealed for donations to increase his
war chest from its current $32,000 to the $800,000 total he said
other parties would be spending.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his bent for opportunism, he staged the
announcement of his rebellion on Monday just hours before the
campaign of Dobson was being officially launched.
</P>
<P>
   It was Blair's proposal, made early in his administration, for
creating an elected mayor for London that gave Livingstone his
opportunity for political resurrection. Livingstone had had such a
big impact on British politics in the early 1980s that he was
almost as well known as Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Ousted by her action of shutting down the Greater London
Council, he became a member of Parliament in 1987 and sank from
view. ``It's the GLC everyone remembers,'' he said ruefully in
1988. ``You had a billion a year to spend and you made a lot of
news. Now I am just one of 650-odd MPs, with no power. All I can do
is talk.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not only did no one listen but his Labor colleagues shunned him
as the party shed its radical socialist and union past and moved to
the political center to win over the voters of middle England who
had kept the Conservatives in office for 18 straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone's arrival on the scene in 1981 was a
characteristically blustery one. Within hours of being elected to
the council, he staged a spectacular and ruthless coup, ousting the
longtime leader and taking over the post himself in the name of
populist politics.
</P>
<P>
   He attracted public attention by cutting fares on buses and
subways by a third, supporting minority rights, embracing the Irish
republican movement, supporting a ``Babies Against the Bomb''
program to build day-care centers for the children of peace
protesters, and calling for the party to resist Thatcher by
proclaiming its dedication to socialism.
</P>
<P>
   He hung out a huge banner listing unemployment figures across
the facade of the grand Edwardian county building that sits across
the Thames from Parliament, and he flew red flags from its roof. As
Britain moved to the right under Thatcher, the Labor militants
became known as the ``Loony Left,'' with Livingstone at once their
court jester and their king.
</P>
<P>
   His flamboyantly insurgent posture cost him his job then, and a
repetition could cause him problems if he gets into office now.
Though the new mayor will manage a budget of $5 billion, almost all
of it comes from the national treasury, now in the tight fists of a
sworn enemy, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone can also expect little support among the 25 members
of the new Greater London Assembly, who have the power to
substitute their own budget for his and will be following the lead
of party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the problem is perceived to be Blair's.
A front-page cartoon in The Times of London showed the four
candidates taking their marks for the beginning of the race. The
starter's pistol was in the prime minister's hand. He was aiming it
at his own foot.

 &HT;    South Carolina setting for Roberts' latest romance
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Romance novels have changed since Nora Roberts began writing two
decades ago, but love hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rush you have when you fall in love, and all the emotions,
are universal and a constant,'' says Roberts, 49, who has published
134 novels and sold more than 106 million books.
</P>
<P>
   It's the romance genre that's different. Half-naked pirates
still rip the bodices of their beautiful captives, but not as
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started writing in 1979,'' Roberts says, ``the heroine
was 18 and a virgin, and the hero was a great deal older and the
richest man in the free world. These days, they're more likely to
be closer in age and partners. The man doesn't have to ride in on a
white charger and rescue her.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' latest best seller, ``Carolina Moon'' (Putnam, $24.95),
mixes romance with mystery as a woman returns to her hometown in
South Carolina to solve the murder of a childhood friend. In the
midst of searching for the killer, she falls in love with a wealthy
cotton farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts says she chose South Carolina because she was looking
for a place with marshes and cotton farms. ``South Carolina fit the
bill. I've been there a few times, but I did most of my research on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything Roberts writes becomes a best seller, but that
wasn't the case when she began. Stuck at her Maryland home during a
blizzard in 1979, Roberts wrote her first romance out of boredom.
That novel and her next six efforts were rejected before ``Irish
Thoroughbred'' was published in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The prolific Roberts writes _ and sells _ as many as six novels
a year. ``I'm driven to tell stories,'' she says. ``And it's
something I love. I wouldn't do it if it weren't fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts will sign books at 7 tonight at Waldenbooks at North
Point Mall in Alpharetta. 770-740-
</P>
<P>
   8341.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Short-listed: Four American authors are among the seven
finalists for the world's richest literary prize. Toni Morrison
(``Paradise''), Michael Cunningham (``The Hours''), Alice McDermott
(``Charming Billy'') and Philip Roth (``I Married a Communist'')
all made the cut from an original list of 101 nominees for the
$130,000 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. Other finalists
are English writer Nicola Barker (``Wide Open''), Scottish author
Jackie Kay (``The Trumpet'') and Irish writer Colum McCann (``This
Side of Brightness''). The winner will be announced May 9 in Dublin
Castle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prose that pays: Some authors' books are not only
page-turners, but also dollar-earners. The richest writers and
their annual earnings, according to Forbes magazine, are Tom Clancy
($66 million), Stephen King ($65 million), John Grisham ($36
million), Dean Koontz ($34 million) and Michael Crichton ($33.5
million). Crichton's earnings have dropped, Forbes notes, because
he has made a deal to take lower film advances in favor of bigger
back-end deals. Universal recently bought the movie rights to
``Timeline'' for $1, but agreed to pay Crichton 15 percent of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary portraits: The Margaret Mitchell House &AMP; Museum has
gathered most of the major Southern writers under one roof. Well,
their portraits anyway. Images of Pat Conroy, Patricia Cornwell,
Anne Rivers Siddons, James Dickey, Anne Rice, William Styron,
Shelby Foote and others from David Spielman's book, ``Southern
Writers,'' are spotlighted in an exhibit through the end of June.
To see and hear one of the writers in the flesh, however, stop by
the Margaret Mitchell House, 999 Peachtree St., at 8 tonight for a
reading by Atlanta playwright and novelist Jim Grimsley.
Information: 404-249-7015.

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Soaring home prices. Sclerotic traffic. The
maddening roar of new construction. Too many people, not enough
open space.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the woes of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, in an unlikely tale for flush times, the locale in question
is in Manhattan or Westchester County, N.Y., but in a corner of
Newark, a city left for dead after the 1967 riots, where almost a
third of the residents still live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Newark's Ironbound section, long a bastion of Portuguese
immigrants and more recently a magnet for Brazilians and other
Latin Americans, has become one of the hottest swaths of real
estate in the region. More than 900 homes have been built in the
Ironbound in the last three years, real estate values have nearly
doubled, and most homes are snapped up after just days on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been out of this world,'' said Jack DaSilva, a local
developer who recently sold 150 new homes in the Ironbound before
even a single foundation had been poured.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many residents complain that this bustling neighborhood of
about 50,000 people has become too prosperous for its own good.
Steep housing prices are forcing families to double and triple up,
the population boom has made parking nightmarish, and local schools
are overwhelmed by the influx of new students, many of them Latin
American immigrants who speak little English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our quality of life has gone down the tubes,'' said Mary
Correia, 39, the daughter of Portuguese parents who works in the
neighborhood but recently moved to the suburbs. ``This is no place
to raise a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Overdevelopment is also feeding tensions between the Portuguese,
who are widely credited with saving the neighborhood during
Newark's darkest days, and the newly arrived Brazilians, who often
get blamed for the crowded streets and steep housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moacir Weirich, a Lutheran clergyman who runs a
storefront ministry here, said the problems associated with
explosive growth have given life to long-buried animosities between
the faded imperial power and its former colony. ``People are angry,
and they're just looking for someone to blame,'' said Weirich, who
is Brazilian. ``They make easy targets for each another.''
</P>
<P>
   A hodgepodge of vinyl-sided homes and 19th-century factories,
the Ironbound has always been a gritty, working-class place named
for the railroad tracks that once surrounded it. Even after the
1967 riots, when Newark suffered decades of depopulation,
disinvestment and a crippling loss of faith, the Ironbound,
bolstered by Portuguese immigration, remained a pocket of
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Although downtown Newark has benefited from a new performing
arts center, a minor-league baseball stadium and the promise of a
professional sports complex, New Jersey's largest city remains
mired in poverty, with a quarter of its 267,000 residents on some
form of public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders might find it hard to appreciate the lure of the
Ironbound, a densely packed neighborhood where $300,000 homes _
most without yards _ are raked by the whoosh of planes landing at
nearby Newark International Airport. There are few parks or
playgrounds here, and highways, railroad tracks and derelict loft
buildings are among the area's more prominent features. Many new
homes sit atop toxic soil, a legacy of the area's industrial past.
</P>
<P>
   Augusto Amador, the local councilman, said people are drawn here
by easy access to jobs, proximity to the state's main highways and
good public transportation. It also helps that immigrants can
navigate daily life without worrying about their limited English,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a hard-working immigrant and you want to settle down
in a safe, secure neighborhood, there's no better place to be,''
said Amador, who came here from Portugal when he was 17. ``You
don't find this kind of stability elsewhere in Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   That stability has been fostered by the neighborhood's physical
isolation and the Portuguese, who began arriving in the late 1960s,
replacing the Italians, Polish and Irish who came before them.
</P>
<P>
   With its modest two-and-three family homes, the Ironbound is
house proud but not fussy. Charles Cummings, Newark's official
historian, calls it ``our Greenwich Village, without the
Bohemians.''
</P>
<P>
   Its vibrant street life is striking as one passes beneath the
elevated tracks separating the neighborhood from downtown, with its
fenced-in parking lots, vacant office buildings and forlorn
sidewalks. By contrast, the Ironbound's main commercial artery,
Ferry Street, is lined with restaurants and bakeries, its sidewalks
thick with pedestrians. ``I defy you to find an empty storefront on
Ferry Street,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, thousands of Brazilians, Portuguese and other
visitors from the metropolitan area flock to Ferry Street, clogging
traffic and double parking on the side streets. On most afternoons,
the desperate honking of blocked-in drivers fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   For business owners like Jose Moreira, the throngs are a good
thing. ``On weekends you can't even walk around in here,'' Moreira
said on a recent Sunday as he held court at his restaurant, Casa
Nova. Brazilian families gathered at tables loaded with barbecue
meats, known as churrascarria, while single men sat along the
counter trading gossip and sipping cafezhino or Brazilian beer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreira, 33, who arrived here in 1988 and spent years working as
a landscaper, has done well in Newark. Last year he opened his
third restaurant in the neighborhood, and he has plans to open a
fourth. ``As long as the Brazilians keep coming, I'm going to do
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his home state of Minas Gerais, Newark is something of a
household word, known as a place that promises steady employment to
those unintimidated by work hard. The men find jobs as construction
workers, landscapers, or bakers; the women are usually hired as
baby sitters or housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreira, too, has become something of a celebrity, and every day
freshly arrived Brazilians, dragging their luggage behind them,
walk into Casa Nova seeking advice, apartments and the comfort of
compatriots. Last week it was Elio Lana, 34, a truck driver from
Ipatinga who came directly from Newark Airport with questions about
work. Asked why he came to Newark and not New York City, the
legendary landing pad for immigrants, he smiled. ``Everyone knows
Newark is much easier than New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are no figures on how many Brazilians live in the
Ironbound, but realtors estimate that about 60 percent of the homes
on the market are bought by Brazilians; the remaining buyers are a
mix of Portuguese, Ecuadoreans, Peruvians and Mexicans.

 &HT;    American art gets second look
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Winslow Homer is one of America's most revered
artists, but his work is as scarce as trolley cars in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, however, viewers have the opportunity to see
the scope of his achievement in ``Winslow Homer: Facing Nature,''
his first major Georgia one-man show, brought to town by the
Marietta/Cobb Museum of Art in Georgia. Organized by the Portland
Museum of Art in Maine, the exhibition spans Homer's long,
productive career, from his Harper's Weekly illustrations of the
Civil War to his idyllic watercolors of the Adirondack Mountains
and the paintings inspired by observations of life in Prouts Neck,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the only first. Brenau University in Gainesville
is bringing the sculpture of Marisol to Georgia for her first solo
show in the state. The only woman commonly associated with the pop
art movement, the Venezuela-born artist traveled her own path, with
her singular portraits carved into and out of chunky blocks of
wood. The sweep of Marisol's subject matter is apparent in this
show, whose subjects, all from the 1990s, range from a famous
Indian chief to President Kennedy's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Add the John Henry Twachtman exhibition at the High Museum of
Art to the list of uncommon displays. The High, which owns two
works by the late-19th-century artist, has organized the touring
show ``John Henry Twachtman: An American Impressionist.'' The first
such retrospective in this generation, it reveals an artist who,
though influenced by French impressionism, followed his own,
American course. The High provides a context for his explorations
in ``American Art Circa 1900,'' a group show drawn largely from its
permanent collection. Some 42 artists display the range of American
production at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   From another continent entirely, but just as unusual,
hallucinogenic paintings by contemporary Australian Aboriginal
artists are part of a yearlong celebration of culture Down Under at
Kennesaw State University.

 &HT;    Fall's golden with a wealth of rich fabrics and luxurious
details
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 12.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We return to you _ after a month roaming the runways of New
York, Milan and Paris _ with good and bad news from the fashion
capitals regarding womenswear for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Good news first: You trendsetters out there have a good six
months before you really have to worry whether you're dressed
right.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news next: That leaves less than 200 days until a) you've
decided which of the many new styles look right on you; and b)
you've squirreled away enough time, money, nerve and motivation to
wear them.
</P>
<P>
   Even the niftiest new styles are diamonds in the rough. They've
got all the wardrobe-enhancing potential in the world. But
potential's hardly ever fully realized. N'est-ce pas?
</P>
<P>
   Next fall's forecast calls for new colors, cuts, costs and
attitudes to get used to. Nowhere is the word ``comfort''
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Six months out, the new requirements for appearing best-dressed
seem unreasonable. But, about 200 days from now, this city's
trendsetters will thank heaven for foresight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TWEED SURRENDER: Donegals, herringbones and other woolly
plaids dominated a great many collections. Though they often showed
up in somber shades of black, gray and brown, the way designers
played with the dimensions of tweed (i.e. herringbones the size of
whale bones) and the materials they could be made from (think mink)
added novelty to the classic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SHORT SHIFT: Tongues will wag around the office if women take
designers up on this fall proposition: hemlines hiked high up on
the thigh. The majority of skirts shown still hovered around the
knee. But short, slit or asymmetrically slashed skirts will signal
how attuned you are to new styles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  KNIT PICKING: Take extra care when adding sweaters to your
wardrobe: Blouses are the new ``in'' thing. A sweater will have to
be extra-special to score style points with it. Blouses shown were
breezy, rather sheer and featured scarfed necklines. Sweaters were
extra-bulky and had cowl necklines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HEAD GAMES: For once in a long while, designers topped
ensembles with hip-looking hats and caps. Styles ranged from cowboy
hats to fedoras to berets. The emphasis on headwear's just another
indication of how ``finished'' women will be expected to appear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SLACKING UP: Pants will play an important role in the fall.
Generally, pants will ride a bit higher on the hip but still fit
tight on the thigh. Something to get accustomed to _ as European
women already have _ is wearing pants cropped at midcalf. Denim _
trimmed with fur or embroidery _ will maintain its prominence.
Other features that'll distinguish the new from the old:
razor-sharp creases, gold belts and buckles, logo pocket stitching
and patchwork leathers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SUIT YOURSELF: Tailored suits were a hallmark of the
collections' emphasis on formality. Pinstripes and tweeds made them
look that much dressier. In most cases, jackets were trim-fitting
and cropped high on the waist.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MATERIAL, GIRL: Fall styles will be judged as much by what
they're made of as what they look like. Suddenly, cashmere's no
longer the most luxurious material to wear. Exotic skins (i.e.,
snake and crocodile), furs and precious silks will be prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  VOLUME CONTROL: Fall's styles will look curvier and more
voluminous as angular silhouettes go by the wayside. Pants will
tend to flare from the knee down, and skirts will widen out from
the waist down. Coats look fluffier by virtue of all the fur
involved, and they sweep toward the floor for more dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  COLOR CODING: Black's coming back (no surprise there). But
there's also an abundance of clothes in turquoise, purple and rosy
or winey shades of red. Mossy green and cream shades will be
factors. Gold, however, will stand out as the key accent color for
fall, both in apparel and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DETAIL-ORIENTED: Accessories will be key components of the
dressed-up look. Handbags will be smaller but showier, in fur,
animal prints, skins or richly embellished versions. Coats will be
belted robe style, or closed with gold buckles or zippers. Footwear
will be high-heeled or knee-booted. Skirts will be ruffled. And
both dresses and blouses will feature scarves dangling from the
neck, shoulder or waist.

 NEWARK: and Mexicans.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many entrepreneurs, Kenneth Rocco has met the influx by
hiring more Brazilians at his travel agency, Monica Travel, which
also provides immigration, money wiring and long-distance telephone
services. Five of his six employees, he said, are from Brazil.
``Brazilians are our future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Portuguese are becoming extinct. They remain the
neighborhood's most prominent business leaders and are behind
nearly all of the new construction. Jacinto Rodrigues, for example,
one of the city's largest builders, is also an owner of Crown Bank,
a local lending institution that provides many Ironbound home
buyers with mortgages. Some of the biggest employers in Newark are
the Ironbound's Portuguese bakeries and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is indisputable: as Brazilians continue to flood
into the area, immigration from Portugal has all but dried up, with
many Portuguese families moving to the suburbs and a growing number
of the elderly retiring to homes they built in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Once Western Europe's most backward nation, Portugal has
prospered since joining the European Union in 1986. During the
1970s, when the country was still emerging from its agrarian past,
an average of 8,500 Portuguese each year legally immigrated to the
United States, with about 20 percent settling in Newark, according
to immigration figures. By 1998, with Portugal's economy the second
fastest-growing in Europe, that number had dropped to 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for young people to come anymore,'' said
Fernando Santos, the news editor of Luso-Americano, a
Portuguese-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The community has five newspapers aimed at Brazilians and two at
Portuguese; to broaden its appeal, the Luso-Americano recently
added a section with news and sports from Brazil. The local soccer
league once had 10 Portuguese teams; today there are only three,
and the rest are either Brazilian or Latin American. ``You go down
Ferry Street,'' Santos said, ``and all you see are the yellow and
green colors of the Brazilian flag.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The shifting demographics have fueled strife between the two
groups, although everyone agrees that the conflict finds its worst
expression in off-color jokes. ``We basically make the same silly
cracks about each other,'' said Alessandra Braganca, 27, a travel
agent who moved to Newark from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, six years
ago. ``They think we're stupid, we think they're snobs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they mock each other's manner of speech, which are
about as different as British and American English.
</P>
<P>
   Still, longtime Portuguese residents bemoan the changing
landscape. Manny Lopes, 42, the owner of Newark Hardware since
1973, said the Brazilians are not as committed to the neighborhood
as the Portuguese were. ``We were so busy in the '70s, fixing up
the houses. There were always people in here buying materials,
paint and hardware,'' he said. ``The Brazilians, they don't invest
like we do. They come for a few months and then go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some realtors worry that many of the new immigrants buying new
homes are in over their head. Much of the buying frenzy, they said,
has been fueled by subsidized loan programs or mortgages that allow
buyers to put down as little as three percent on a $300,000 house.
And because many home buyers work in construction, an industry
notoriously susceptible to economic vagaries, a recession could hit
the Ironbound especially hard. ``If there's a downturn, there are
going to be a lot of people defaulting on their mortgages,'' said
Carlos Couto, the owner of Re/Max United, a real estate brokerage
on Ferry Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the neighborhood's schools have become the most
crowded in the state, with many classrooms exceeding 40 students.
In February, hundreds of angry parents packed a series of town
meetings and demanded that the city provide some relief. Officials
said they would try to install temporary modular units in the
coming months and build three schools within the decade, but some
parents say they cannot wait. ``People are moving out as soon as
their kids reach high school,'' said Nancy Zak, a longtime resident
and a leader of the Ironbound Community Corp., a nonprofit group.
``We're turning into a transient place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mayor Sharpe James admits that the pace of development has
been a bit too heady. ``The success of the Ironbound could be its
downfall as well,'' he said. Some people are calling for a
moratorium on new housing, although that is unlikely to happen. In
the meantime, many homeowners are bracing for a revaluation of
property taxes, the first reassessment since 1961. City officials
say that some tax bills could double or triple, something that
lifelong residents like Linda Rodrigues fear could bring disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues, 49, a Portuguese professor at the New School in New
York City, said she and many other property owners might be driven
out by rising taxes. ``I've stayed here through some of Newark's
darkest moments,'' said Rodrigues, who serves on the boards of the
Newark Museum, the performing arts center and the public library.
``But between overdevelopment and the reassessment, I don't know if
I can survive much longer.''

 &HT;    Horror meister turns a page
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King, who bypassed the traditional paper-and-ink format
with his recent audio-only book ``Smoke and Blood,'' is turning to
the Internet for his next work.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Tuesday, King's 16,000-word ghost story, ``Riding the
Bullet,'' will be available only on the Web as an e-book for $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will be able to download the 66-page novella from computers
at www.netlibrary.com or onto Palm organizers and other handheld
computing devices through peanutpress.com, a division of the
Boulder, Colo.-based netLibrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious to see what sort of response there is and whether
or not this is the future,'' said King, who described ``Riding the
Bullet'' as ``a ghost story in the grand manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is a co-publication between Scribner and Philtgrum
Press and electronically published through Simon &AMP; Schuster online.
King wrote the novella shortly after his near-fatal accident when
he was hit by a van in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that e-books will replace books,'' said King's
agent, Ralph Vicinanza. ``It's a new format that will exist side by
side with the traditional outlets for bookselling.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster favors the method because it cuts costs and
time. Normally, it takes a year to bring a book from manuscript to
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can get more information and read a three-page excerpt at

BELIEVE IT! DIRECT MARKETER DRAFT WORLDWIDE WILL ACQUIRE AG
WORLDWIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)  By   STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an odd coupling that makes Felix and Oscar seem almost like
clones, Draft Worldwide, a giant direct marketing agency owned by
the Interpublic Group of Companies, is joining forces with AG
Worldwide, the brand strategy and advertising agency owned by the
iconoclastic creative executive Peter Arnell.
</P>
<P>
   Draft, based in Chicago, is expected to announce formally Friday
that it is acquiring a majority stake in AG, based in New York, for
undisclosed terms. AG is known for developing and strengthening
brand identities for advertisers like Banana Republic, Hanes
hosiery, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Ray-Ban and Samsung. Draft
handles direct and promotional marketing accounts with estimated
billings of $2.7 billion for clients like American Express, Compaq,
General Motors, Stamps.com and the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal of the deal, which calls for AG to operate as
an autonomous unit of Draft, is to improve client service offerings
of both agencies. Draft, known for hard-working direct sales
pitches, is hoping to benefit from AG's penchant for producing
brand images perceived as chic and trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last five years, direct and promotional marketers
have been forced to become builders of brands,'' said Howard Draft,
chairman and chief executive at Draft. ``You've got to sell the
product and build the brand at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where our clients are pushing us is more to Peter's model,''
he added, ``powerful creative that drives results immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft, which has made a skein of acquisitions since being bought
by Interpublic in 1996, also seeks to capitalize on the Internet
marketing experience of an AG subsidiary, Surge Interactive. Draft,
which now handles interactive marketing in-house, is also acquiring
a majority stake in Surge, where Chad Stoller, 28, will continue as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both recognize the shift to a digital economy,'' said
Jordan H. Rednor, president and worldwide chief operating officer
at Draft. ``Direct marketing is where the Web is today, a
one-to-one dialogue with consumers, and Surge will serve as a
bridge between our cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   AG, for its part, is hoping to benefit from the Draft abilities
to develop so-called direct response campaigns as well as access to
the Draft worldwide network, composed of 3,200 employees in 25
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of multinational clients,'' said Arnell,
chairman and executive creative director at AG, which also has
offices in London and Tokyo, ``but there has been strong resistance
to allowing us to manage brands globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really felt we had to get into the larger world,'' he
added, which can now be accomplished by opening AG outposts in
Draft offices overseas. Current AG clients, in addition to Samsung,
include Consolidated Edison, Indulge.com, Playboy Enterprises,
Polaroid, the Rockport division of Reebok International and the
Universal Music Group unit of the Seagram Co. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As disparate as the new partners are, Messrs. Arnell, Draft and
Rednor offered several explanations for their unexpected
cohabitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard understands who we are and wants us to be more of who
we are,'' said Arnell, 40, who joins the Draft executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Arnell is known for his photography and design projects as well
as iconic ad ideas. He listed among his and his agency's signature
work the poster for Samsung showing ``a beautiful boy holding a
microwave oven''; a commercial for Chanel No. 5 ``bringing Marilyn
Monroe back from the dead'' by inserting footage of her into
contemporary settings; and print ads for fashion brands like DKNY
photographed in black and white rather than color.
</P>
<P>
   Arnell is also known as an independent-minded executive who is
never shy about trying to get his way. His voluble disagreements
with clients and employees are a staple of Madison Avenue gossip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a brash, entrepreneurial spirit,'' Arnell said. So can he
work for someone else, particularly someone owned by Interpublic,
the behemoth agency company headed by the gruff, no-nonsense Philip
H. Geier Jr.? ``It's probably one of the most unusual marriages
you've ever heard,'' Arnell said. ``That's what's so hot about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, if the partnership fails, ``in the next
couple years you'll have a good story to write.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft, 46, laughed as he suggested a headline for this column:
```Hard to believe,''' then added, ``We at Draft are pretty
independent guys, too. The last thing I'd want is not to have Peter
come into the office every morning and feel he's in charge,'' Draft
said, adding that Geier endorsed the deal by declaring ```Go for
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rednor, 45, said he found more similarities between Draft and AG
than might be evident at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies are about the same age, he said, Draft dating to
1978 and AG to 1979. And both have gone by many monikers. Previous
Draft names include Kobs &AMP; Brady and Draft Direct. Previous AG
names include Arnell Group Brand Consulting and Arnell/Bickford.
</P>
<P>
   Arnell said he became acquainted with Draft through Rednor, a
friend for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a previous career, Rednor was ``in charge of the advertising
group at Chemical Bank,'' Arnell recalled, ``and when we didn't
have a line of credit _ or a MasterCard or Visa _ we had Jordan.''

 &HT;    Adviser urges Floridians to vote for McCain, despite `suspended'
campaign
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ John McCain may have been captured by the
forces of George W. Bush, but the former Marine general leading his
Florida campaign is urging his troops to storm the polls Tuesday
and vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have something to say,'' said Bob Milligan, state
comptroller and McCain's Florida campaign director. ``Our votes
still count and we want to make sure that John McCain's voice is
still heard.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain all but ended his campaign Thursday when the Arizona
senator said he was ``suspending'' it. Handily defeated in most of
this week's primaries, McCain refused to formally end his campaign,
giving small hope to his supporters that a miracle could still
happen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's name remains on next Tuesday's Florida primary ballot.
So does the name of former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley who was
soundly defeated this week by Vice President Al Gore. Bradley
formerly dropped out of the race Thursday and gave his support to
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Texas Gov. George W. Bush nor Gore are taking anything
for granted next Tuesday, even though their party rivals have
faded. Bush will campaign Sunday in the Little Havana section of
Miami. He will spend most of the day in Florida, according to his
campaign staff, with details of his visit rapidly changing. Gore
will be in Orlando and Miami on Monday, according to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore expect Florida to be a key state in the
November election. Bush, who likely will be nominated by the
Republican Party at its Philadelphia convention this summer, could
face opposition from McCain loyalists in forming the party's
convention theme. Party rules say that any candidate who has won
six states will have a voice in the convention proceedings. McCain
has won seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what election turnout is going to be because of
what happened this week,'' said Milligan,'' but if enough people
feel strongly about John McCain and his message, then I still think
we can have an impact on the Republican campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, however, Milligan said he will be
loyal to the party nominee. ``I'm a conservative and I'm a
Republican and I'll support George W.,'' Milligan said. ``But I
still want his campaign to reflect the philosophy of John McCain.''

SILICON VALLEY WEALTH CREATES NEW KIND OF CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Every day after school, 13-year-old Jeffrey
Mendelman has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with milk,
finishes his homework _ and checks his stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's stock was going up,'' he explains of his decision to
plunge into the market, and he now follows stocks the way he
collects autographs and baseball cards. ``Most kids here are
interested in the market. Because a lot of their dads have become
pretty rich and that's why they get to live in a gigantic house.''
</P>
<P>
   A new sort of American childhood is being forged in the land
where each day brings the dawn of an estimated 60 new millionaires.
It is one in which CEOs are the new superheroes, family banter is
often likely to include talk of multiples and the latest IPO, and
where a recent collision between two students in a high school
parking lot involved a Toyota SUV Forerunner and a Mercedes 500 SL.
</P>
<P>
   But along with a new openness about money, and the obvious good
things it can bring, have come concerns about the effect of Silicon
Valley's bountiful wealth on children, issues that are likely to
escalate as the post-adolescent entrepreneurs, barely old enough
themselves to have graduated from Ramen noodles on a hot plate,
come of age.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar challenges of wealth, or what is now being referred
to in the Valley as ``the sudden wealth syndrome,'' have themselves
spawned a variety of enterprises dedicated to helping the rich be
rich, or what Judy G. Barber, a marriage and family counselor,
calls ``the unique issues that children of affluence face.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber, with offices in Napa, San Francisco and Palo Alto, also
publishes the newsletter ``Family Money: Commentary on the Unspoken
Issues Related to Wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Dr. Stephen Goldbart, a psychologist,
co-founded the Money, Meaning and Choices Institute, a private
practice in San Francisco, to ``explore the psychological
opportunities and emotional challenges of having and inheriting
money.'' Goldbart calls the Bay area ``ground zero for the expanded
upper class,'' foreshadowing the ``largest intergenerational
transfer of wealth in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions are also responding to the needs of a
growing number of ultra-wealthy clients nationally. Merrill Lynch,
for one, recently instituted a ``financial parenting'' program
geared toward children to ``heighten awareness of wealth's
responsibilities,'' said Scott Cooper, a senior client relationship
manager.
</P>
<P>
   It includes investment lessons for children as well as guidance
on the so-called ``affluenza syndrome,'' helping clients answer
such questions as ``Daddy, why are we flying a private plane?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``We've had a little luck but we've worked hard for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On El Camino Real, the Champs-Elysees of the new economy, Liz
Gannes, a senior at Palo Alto Senior High, reflected on the unusual
environment of her youth, of going to organized ``schmooze fests''
for techies with her parents and weddings where people ``eat, talk
and make deals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to ground ourselves sometimes,'' Gannes observed,
echoing the feelings of many of her peers. ``The things we hear on
the news are happening all around us. We're living on top of this
bubble and we're not able to see below us.''
</P>
<P>
   On jogging trails and bridle paths here, money and how it
affects children _ a subject that was once more taboo than sex and
death _ has become a major topic of parenting.
</P>
<P>
   One high-net-worth mother in Portola Valley, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said: ``My kids have absolutely no idea we
have more money than other kids, but at ages 5 and 8 that's easy to
enforce. Soon, all they'll have to do to find out their fathers'
net worth is look on the Internet or read the paper. It's
embarrassing. I'm nervous for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   The landscape of 17-year-old Alexa T.'s childhood in Atherton is
one of swimming pools, guest houses and gardener-maintained
property where full-grown trees are helicoptered in, and it brings
this view: ``In school you're learning as fast as you can so you
can apply it as fast as you can so that you can become rich and
successful by age 24, because that's what happens here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Elizabeth, complains: ``It's the money that comes
first. They're not talking about the Ph.D. They're talking about
the $20 million and the house in Atherton.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid pace of technological change, the long hours required
of start-ups, the making of vast fortunes at an early age, have
brought with them new challenges for families, said Paul Schervish,
a professor of sociology at Boston College who is studying the
effects nationally of the recent surge in family wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material life of this period has accelerated way beyond
our spiritual understanding of it,'' Schervish said. ``For the
first time we can no longer use `we can't afford it' as a cultural
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents themselves are living a more intense life, working
faster and harder. Part of the new economy is this notion that you
either move forward or you'll fall back, and those pressures and
values are getting passed on to children. Parents feel more of a
connection between what their kids are doing now and their fortunes
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   To Kris Goodrich, a former early-childhood teacher and a
co-founder of the Child and Family Institute, a nonprofit center in
Menlo Park, the fear ``that you're the only one that can't keep
up'' has become pervasive. Her center offers stress classes for
preteen-agers and family discussion programs about values. Goodrich
said: ``Children look at the middle class as poverty, and going to
Hawaii only once a year is considered the bottom rung.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loud voice, the Silicon voice, says, `If you're not
constantly updating and going the next jump every day, you're
replaceable. That puts a tremendous strain on parents. They look at
the children and think, `I've got to give them everything.' They
overprovide, because they want them to keep up.''

AETNA APOLOGIZES FOR 1850S POLICIES ON SLAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. expressed regret for its apparent role as an insurer
for slaveowners in the 1850s, joining a string of major
institutions that have recently apologized for their past conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the big Hartford, Conn. insurer, had previously disclosed
papers in its archives showing it wrote at least four policies
related to individual slaves, in effect providing
property-insurance for their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in response to a critic in New York, the company went
a step further and issued a statement saying that it feels ``deep
regret over any participation at all in this deplorable practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement is the latest in a series of official acts of
contrition by institutions for past misdeeds. This weekend, Pope
John Paul II is expected to apologize for the Catholic Church's
``faults of the past,'' including aspects of the Crusades and the
Inquisition. Swiss banks and German automakers have also apologized
in recent years for their treatment of Jews and other minorities
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized these statements as cheap posturing, while
others say they are important for a full understanding of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very welcome when a company has the moral courage to
admit a serious transgression against a group,'' said Harvard Law
School professor Charles Ogletree Jr. He is part of a group of
black intellectuals who may seek reparation payments for decendants
of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Aetna was brought by another activist,
Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, an African-American woman who graduated
from the New England College of Law in Boston last year and now
lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer-Paellmann wrote to Aetna last month seeking both an
apology and some financial compensation. ``These companies have
inherited wealth that doesn't belong to them,'' she said in an
interview Thursday. ``They have a moral obligation to the heirs''
of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna disagreed and said it was unclear whether it had ever
collected any premiums for the policies, which typically had a face
value of $600, or paid any off. It said further that any
obligations it might have were offset by ``our strong, consistent
commitment to diversity over many years'' and its philanthropic
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The company cited grants to the NAACP and many African-American
colleges, and noted its directors included the late Arthur Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer-Paellmann said she hopes to change Aetna's mind. She also
has asked FleetBoston Financial Corp. to explain its relationship
to The Providence Bank, which she said earned profits from the the
traffic in slaves to the New World.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal shows the complexity of the issue, however, since the
bank's officials seem to have included abolitionists. Fleet
spokesman James Mahoney said the Providence Bank was only one of a
dozen or so predecessor companies to Fleet. While the matter is
still under review, payments aren't being discussed with
Farmer-Paellmann, he said. ``The connection between our current
company and the banking entity founded in 1791 is very distant,''
he said.

   ``They spent two weeks in luxury, with unlimited room service,''
Bell said. ``When they came back to school, the friends were
telling friends, and the girls suddenly started getting a lot of
social invitations. Even the coaches on teams were being
deferential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other kids see the preferential treatment and get mad. So
these kids get a double-whammy, asking themselves, `Do they like me
or do they just want to get invited to Gstaad?'''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of parents staking their claim to Silicon Valley
gold can be desolate. Laura M., a poised 17-year-old in leather
pumps, spoke softly in recalling her mother's plunge into a
start-up: ``My mom said, `I'm going to spend a lot of time at work.
Is that OK with you?' I would have felt bad saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years Laura's mother did not come home from the
office until 11 p.m. ``The big problem,'' Laura said, ``was I was
used to having her around to say `Don't talk on the phone' and
`Don't watch TV.'''
</P>
<P>
   Laura's grades plummeted, prompting her parents to pull back on
their hours somewhat. ``The thing I really hate is coming home to
the dark,'' Laura said. ``It's a big house.''
</P>
<P>
   An undercurrent of parental regret runs through the
conversations of some teen-agers whose parents feel they have
somehow missed the boom. ``My parents are doctors,'' Lisa M., 17,
said. ``But when they see tons of money, I think they feel sort of
left out. Compared to the CEO of Cisco Systems, my dad feels
totally insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   At Palo Alto Senior High, a school with robotics classes and
electronic lockers, Esther Wojcicki, a revered teacher, has noticed
a change in role models among her students. Rather than Michael
Jordan and Michelle Kwan, Wojcicki said: ``Their heroes are the
20-year-olds with start-up companies who've made $20 million. It's
made more intense, because they know them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a milieu that respects divergent thinking, even students
themselves are becoming legends for their exploits. Among them is
Hans Pang, 17, the son of a bank teller and an acupuncturist.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a friend's father, Dominic Orr, the chief
executive of Alteon Web Systems, in San Jose, offered Pang a summer
job after hearing about his computer wizardry. Pang's performance
was such that last year the company, which was going public,
offered him employee stock options in lieu of salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said yes, since I'd heard about IPOs skyrocketing and had a
good feeling about the company,'' Pang said. His shares are
currently worth about $75,000, on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was earning $10 an hour, which wasn't bad,'' he said. ``I
was happy. But obviously this has made me more happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pang, who has a buzz cut and doles out business cards, added:
``I've always wanted to be independent. I don't really have people
I admire. I just do what's best for myself. You get lots of
opportunities here in Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bloom, an economics teacher at Paly, as the high school is
known, realized the culture had shifted, when he began noticing
that some students were becoming bored when simulated stocks were
introduced in class. ``It turned out they already had their own
real ones,'' Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   A positive side of all this, some of the parents and children
say, is a feeling that success is just a step away, rather than a
climb up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the dot-com millionaires come of age, parents, educators
and mental-health professionals worry that the sense of entitlement
that has long characterized the proverbial indolent trust-funder
will flourish. ``It used to be `My daddy can beat up your daddy,'''
said Mark Walsh, founder of VerticalNet Inc., a Web-site company in
suburban Philadelphia. ``Now it's `My daddy can buy your daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Lonergan, head of the Castilleja School, a private school
for girls, said wealth is one of the biggest issues facing parents.
``People here aren't brain-dead,'' Lonergan said. ``They're looking
hard at values, because everything in the community is focused on
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are using their wealth to reconfigure values.
Richard Lowenthal, 47, for instance, retired three years ago after
his telecommunications company, Stratacom, was bought by Cisco
Systems. The father of two girls, ages 15 and 11, he now spends
half his time in community service and is mayor-elect of the Valley
town of Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenthal, noting that there are no 12-step programs for
workaholics, said: ``I've been through that intensity. People whose
own self-worth is measured by how much money they have are far more
common here than people who can give it a rest. We need more people
to set an example for being more whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Engel, 47, a single mother of two, retired recently from
3Com Corp., which she joined when it was a start-up. Engel said she
had set ``a number I aspired to'' that she felt would financially
allow her to be at home full time with her children, now 10 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great believer that making your own way in the world is
important to who you are and who you become,'' she said. ``Many of
us have come by this wealth serendipitously. How do my children
develop a sense that that's unusual?''
</P>
<P>
   One of Engel's strategies has been to involve her children in
philanthropy, including helping make decisions on where the money
goes and visiting inner-city nonprofit organizations that she has
helped finance. Having money, she observed, ``allows you to not be
automatic.'' She added: ``It can make you think, `How should I
live?' You not only get tested in life when bad things happen, but
when good things happen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people like Minal Hasan, 17, who has an entrepreneur
mother and a venture-capitalist father, seem acutely aware of the
unusualness of their lives, of intense family discussions about
first- and second-round financing, of school-lunch chatter about
Bloomberg, of endlessly winding driveways with underground garages.
``Some day,'' she observed, ``this whole time period will be in the
textbooks, like the Vietnam War.''

ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS MEET IN EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt _ After over a month of sniping at each
other, Israeli and Palestinian officials met Thursday for an
informal lunch and pep talk from President Hosni Mubarak as they
prepared to resume peace talks in Washington this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, acting as host and coach, gave the only public
statement of the day after emerging from brief discussions with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met here in a very friendly atmosphere, overcoming so many
obstacles,'' Mubarak said after he had escorted the two men into a
hotel conference room in this Red Sea resort. ``The good relations
between the two leaders give great hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene bore a strong resemblance to one on Wednesday in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, where the U.S. envoy, Dennis Ross, also
spoke on behalf of the Israeli and Palestinian sides in announcing
a resumption of the stalled negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The strong American and Egyptian intervention reassured some
Palestinian leaders who have wanted higher-profile mediation in
their dealings with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of Mubarak and Ross was not just symbolic,'' said
Yasser Abed Rabbo, chief negotiator for the Palestinian side and
the information minister of the Palestinian Authority. ``It was
meant to provide guarantees that the Israelis would be committed to
implement the understandings already reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides said Thursday that Israel was prepared
to make a few conciliatory gestures, including the release of some
Palestinian prisoners from its jails and a reconsideration of how a
``safe passage'' route between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
would operate.
</P>
<P>
   There were no clear answers on the core issue of land _ where,
when and how it will be transferred to the Palestinians _ that is
at the heart of the 7-year-old peace process. But there were hints.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yatom, Barak's senior diplomatic and security adviser,
told Israel radio on Thursday that he could not rule out the
possibility that some or all of the Arab towns near the edge of
Jerusalem could be given over to the Palestinians before a final
peace treaty is negotiated. The two sides have announced Sept. 13
as a deadline for the final accord.
</P>
<P>
   The towns mentioned by Yatom for possible transfer were Abu-Dis,
el-Azariya and A-Ram, all Jerusalem suburbs that have been on a
Palestinian wish list. The towns would be the closest geographic
link to Arab East Jerusalem, which they want as the capital of a
new state but which has been nearly surrounded by Jewish
neighborhoods for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has refused to include any land in the Jerusalem area in
the next scheduled transfer of territory, which is supposed to
amount to an additional 6.1 percent of the occupied West Bank. With
that land, the Palestinian Authority would control civil life or
security or both in 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Another dispute has been over what will happen after that
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have pushed to have all the occupied land, with
the exception of Jewish settlements and military outposts, turned
over to them before the talks on the final status. The final
negotiations are supposed to deal with especially sensitive topics
like the settlements, Jerusalem, borders between Israel and a
Palestinian entity, and the rights of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary peace deal struck by Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization in 1993 envisioned that most of the
occupied territory would be in Palestinian hands by the time a
final treaty was on the table. But Barak has been vague about
whether he would go so far.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last two days, Israeli and Palestinian officials have
hinted that as a result of Egyptian and U.S. mediation Barak might
be willing to cede a substantial section of the Israeli-occupied
West Bank in advance of a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outlines of what Israel might or might not be willing
to do in the next round of talks are not clear. Israeli officials
publicly denied that any deals had been struck about how much land
would be handed over in the course of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet decided, prior to any progress having been
made, whether it will be a single percent, less than 1 percent or a
little more than 1 percent,'' the foreign minister of Israel, David
Levy, said after returning from Egypt. ``All that depends on
progress, Israel's interests and what we achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, Abed Rabbo said he would also reserve
his opinion. ``We will try now to observe and see if the Israelis
really desire to deal seriously with the issues or if they are just
maneuvering to calm the situation on Palestinian track so they can
deal with crisis on other tracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That same chilliness was in the air at the meeting here of the
Palestinian and Israeli leaders. There was a clasping of hands, as
well as a few public pats on the back and brief bear hugs. But
Barak and Arafat had the air of exhausted football players being
sent back onto the field for another bruising quarter of play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mubarak's attempt to be inspirational _ he cheerily
predicted that ``soon the problem of the Middle East will be
finished'' _ the two leaders showed little warmth toward each
other. Their aides were even less jolly.

 &HT;    Kenseth rolls to Busch pole
 &HT;    Michael Carvell and Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Matt Kenseth is focusing this year on his rookie
season in Winston Cup, but he's also having quite a year as a
part-time campaigner on the Busch Grand National Series.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Kenseth won the pole for
Saturday's Aaron's 312 with a lap at 185.704 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth won the Busch race at Daytona and, after strong runs at
Rockingham and Las Vegas, leads the series point standings. That
soon will end because he plans to run only those Busch races that
are held in conjunction with Winston Cup events.
</P>
<P>
   The car he drove at Atlanta is the same car that Tim Bender put
on the pole in the Busch race at AMS in the spring of 1997. It also
has been wrecked and repaired numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real heavy and real old, but it's a good driving car,''
Kenseth said.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Chaffin took the outside pole in a car prepared by former
Winston Cup driver Jimmy Means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was almost perfect,'' said Chaffin, a short-track
veteran who started his racing career at Nashville Speedway. ``I
ran wide open all the way around the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Anthony Lazzaro from Acworth, Ga., will start fifth in
his first race at his home track. His season is off to a slow start
since injuries forced him to skip the season opener at Daytona, and
he failed to qualify last week at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come here for the first time and put it fifth on the grid
says a lot for this team,'' Lazzaro said. ``After we missed the
race last week, this certainly shows that our team knows how to
rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Georgians had miserable qualifying efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Jones of Tucker was one of the fastest cars in
practice, but the adjustments his crew made in an effort to get the
pole backfired. He was 32nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thing pushed like a dump truck,'' Jones said. ``Sometimes
when you go for the pole it can bite you, and it bit us hard
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Young from Conyers was 52nd of the 53 drivers who are trying
to start the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to be here, but we've got a lot of work to do,''
Young said. ``It's hard when you show up here without much
experience or know-how.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he plans to ask Jones to try his car this morning.
``I want to see if the car's that bad off or if it's me,'' Young
said.
</P>
<P>
   HELTON SEES EXCITEMENT
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's chief operating officer Mike Helton said this week that
he disagrees with recent news articles saying the early season
Winston Cup races have been boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our records show that we've had 44 lead changes among 20
drivers in the first three races,'' Helton said. ``We have more
cars than ever finishing on the lead lap, and people in the garage
tell us that the competition is so close today that it's not as
easy to blow by people as it once was.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the increased level of competition has forced drivers to
rethink race strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the guy in front of them is running almost as good
as they are so they have to think a little bit about how to get
around him,'' Helton said. ``We still think it's exciting.''

NEW YORK WILL ALLOW PICKUP TRUCKS ON PARKWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARCIA BIEDERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beware the Ides of March? For commuters in and around
New York City, that might be an overreaction, but a new era will
begin next Wednesday as pickup trucks become eligible to join the
traffic crush on parkways.
</P>
<P>
   New state rules will allow all but the heaviest personal-use
pickups to be registered as passenger vehicles. For the first time,
they will be allowed to use roads, like the parkways, that bar
commercial traffic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Current regulations, requiring commercial plates on virtually
all pickups with open beds, ``penalize some drivers simply because
of the vehicles they drive, and make no sense,'' said Gov. George
Pataki in a statement announcing the change. The effort began last
July and included a period of public comment, which ran 3-to-1 in
favor of the change, which was made through administrative
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, open-bed pickups with an unloaded weight of
5,000 pounds or less and no advertising are eligible for
passenger-vehicle plates. Previously, pickups could not have
passenger plates unless they were permanently modified with camper
tops over their cargo beds, plus seats or other camping equipment,
like a stove. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But before a jacked-up F-150 with chrome air horns can roll onto
the FDR Drive or the Sprain Parkway, its owner must exchange its
commercial plates for passenger tags. Ken Brown, a spokesman for
the Department of Motor Vehicles, said the switch could be made at
any motor vehicle office for $6.50. The owner must present the
vehicle's title to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   More than 485,000 vehicles could qualify for the change, Brown
said, though current registrations do not indicate how many of
these trucks are used commercially.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule will bring New York in line with states like
Connecticut and New Jersey, where pickup owners can choose between
commercial and other plates. Trucks with noncommercial plates from
other states will also gain access to New York parkways, though
drivers could be ticketed if the trucks exceed the weight
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers lobbied for the change in hopes of spurring pickup
sales. Last year, pickups accounted for less than 3 percent of
new-vehicle registrations in New York City and the counties of
Putnam, Rockland and Westchester, compared with about 19 percent
nationally, according to the Polk Co., which tracks registration
data.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect personal-use trucks to catch on in the city, where
open beds pose security problems. But in Westchester, which is
laced with parkways, ``if it doesn't help, it won't harm,'' said
Leon Geller, president of Beck Chevrolet in Yonkers. He said he had
been selling more trucks recently, ``but it's not like out West.''

MIGRATION RULES UNDER ATTACK IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's long-entrenched controls over where people may
live and work have become a subject of unusual public debate here,
with critics attacking the stringent efforts by cities to curb the
entrance of rural migrants and bar them from choice jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions hold down economic growth, the critics say,
worsen the country's growing disparities in wealth and violate the
basic rights of the rural majority of China's population.
</P>
<P>
   After simmering in academic circles, the debate recently spilled
into popular newspapers, a rarely permitted occurrence for a topic
so politically charged, perhaps indicating that some high officials
also harbor doubts about the controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a market economy, the right to seek employment is
fundamental,'' said Mao Yushi, a leading economist here and one of
the most outspoken critics, in an interview. ``If that opportunity
is blocked, how can people earn their bread?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue goes beyond economics,'' said Mao, the 71-year-old
chairman of the Unirule Institute for Economics, a private group.
``It's an issue of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, China has rigidly registered the residence of every
person and for most, it remains hard to legally move, especially
from countryside to city.
</P>
<P>
   As the urban need for low-skilled workers has soared, cities
have given out temporary certificates to migrants working in
construction, for example. More villagers have streamed in without
papers to fill bottom-rung jobs like garbage sorting, vending and
moving goods by cycle where they can earn far more than on
overcrowded farms back home.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, more than 50 million rural people are working
in the cities at any one time, where they often face discrimination
and police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the registration system was part of Communist social
planning and it helped China avoid the growth of huge urban slums.
But many economists now see the controls as costly interference in
the labor market, punishing more than half the population while
propping up urban wages. That protection of urban workers is, of
course, one strong reason the government clings to its policy,
especially at a time of growing urban unemployment and fears of
worker unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The debate surfaced this winter after Beijing said it planned to
reduce the number of migrants in the city by several hundred
thousand, from more than 2.5 million believed to live here along
with 10 million official residents.
</P>
<P>
   It gained energy in December, when the Beijing government
published a list of 103 job categories from which migrants are
legally barred, including service jobs in hotels, tourist guiding,
accounting and corporate sales or planning.
</P>
<P>
   Then in February the central government issued an emergency call
for cities to limit the number of migrants moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Mao and a few other economists attacked the restrictions in
print, while several newspapers have asked probing questions in
editorials and featured personal pleas from migrants.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, in a typical example, The China Business Times asked
in an editorial whether the limits on rural workers would slow
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is understandable that urban administrators, facing
employment pressures from laid-off workers, will want to play up
local protectionism,'' the newspaper said. But shouldn't more
senior officials, it asked, consider the national picture?
</P>
<P>
   Days later, The China Youth Daily carried a commentary by a
reader who had returned from years in Japan, saying: ``I can't
believe what I'm seeing and hearing. A country that is
enthusiastically demanding to join the World Trade Organization is
treating its precious labor resources as a burden and inhibiting
the economic interests, the very livelihoods, of tens of millions
of rural laborers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Chinese New Year holiday in early February, when many
migrants returned home to see their families, The China Economic
Times noted that residents of Beijing and Shanghai had suddenly
faced inconveniences: Nannies were scarce, milk deliveries were
halted because of the lack of delivery workers and coal bricks were
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put baldly,'' the paper said, city officials ``don't want
migrants stealing local residents' rice bowls.'' But in fact, it
said, many vacancies in the Beijing labor market had gone unfilled
because ``Beijing locals turned up their noses at them.''
</P>
<P>
   But without careful administration of the stream of migrants
entering Beijing, one city official said in response, the stability
of the capital could be jeopardized. ``That could be terrifying,''
he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology issues paced a strong stock-market rally
Thursday as the Nasdaq composite index soared through the 5,000
mark for the first time while the broadest market gauge of all, the
Wilshire total market index, surged above 14,000, also a record.
</P>
<P>
   After some early losses, prices climbed steadily without benefit
of any obvious trigger as investors piling again into
computer-related and other technology stocks were joined by those
seeking bargains in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech had a great day and drugs had a great day,'' said Matthew
W. Johnson, chief Nasdaq trader at Lehman Brothers. ``There's money
that wants to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market gained 149.60 points, or 3.05 percent, to
finish at 5,046.86, surpassing the previous high, set last Friday,
of 4,914.79, and solidly above the 5,000 benchmark it had briefly
reached on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other major gauges also surged, with the Dow Jones industrial
average pulling out of an early 118-point hole to end with a gain
of 154.20, or 1.56 percent, to finish back above the 10,000 mark.
At 10,010.73, the blue-chip average is now less than twice the
Nasdaq composite compared with five times as much in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 advanced 34.99 points, or 2.56
percent, to end at 1,401.69. Of its components, 340 posted gains
while 141 declined and 19 were unchanged. Leading the way, Cisco
gained 6 15/16 to 139 5/16, Microsoft 4 7/16 to 100 and America
Online 6 3/8 to 61 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the winners chasing the winners,'' said Ned Riley Jr.,
chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in
Boston. He predicted that investors would continue to favor
highflying technology issues for another three or four months until
it became clear that the Federal Reserve was succeeding, as he said
it inevitably would, in slowing down a white-hot economy.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term investors, however, might want to start looking
elsewhere to pick up bargains, Riley suggested.
</P>
<P>
   For a second straight day, it was the beaten-down drug sector
that captured much of this attention. Bristol-Myers jumped 6 to 53
3/4 and Warner-Lambert 5 11/16 to 91 1/2, with Lilly, Merck and
American Home Products advancing more than four points each. Some
analysts said the threat of government intervention to restrict
price increases seems to have receded with the winnowing of the
presidential field, while others said that drug stocks had simply
gotten too cheap to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perfect example of a group that was oversold,''
Johnson said of drug stocks, several of which have double-digit
percentage losses this year. ``People began to realize these things
are valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, whose stock reached 99 7/8 last spring and which an
institutional holder wants to see auctioned off piecemeal, advanced
2 7/8 to 57.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Lehman Brothers recommended several producers
of depressed specialty chemicals but those stocks showed little
response.
</P>
<P>
   And PaineWebber found little enthusiasm despite a spurt in
quarterly profits for H.J. Heinz, which traded as high as 54 last
May but closed Thursday at 34 1/2, up 1/4. The firm cut its target
price to 36 from 44.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, clobbered earlier in the week, was little
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilshire 5000 index, which covers nearly every American
stock, climbed into positive territory for the year, advancing
338.45 points, or 2.48 percent, to 14,006.37.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,682 issues gained while 1,299
lost ground, but 52-week lows still far exceeded new highs, this
time by 175 to 65. Volume edged down to 1.12 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, major indexes rose about 2 percent in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, and London but fell about .05 percent in Tokyo and
Frankfurt. Hong Kong stocks fell 1.75 percent.

FLOOD-HIT CARS SOAK PURCHASERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 Wilmington (N.C.) Morning Star   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ AAA Carolinas estimates that 75,000 cars were
flooded by Hurricane Floyd, and of that, one third, or 25,000, are
in circulation across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The latest estimate represents five times more than the original
15,000 cars thought damaged by flood water last September. It
includes vehicles that weren't necessarily submerged, but had water
up to their floorboards or weren't left in water very long,
explained Tom Crosby, an AAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 25,000 cars in circulation ``could end up anywhere''
for resale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a couple of complaints,'' Crosby said, generally
``from people who were fortunate enough to avoid them.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina attorney general's office has investigated
several complaints from people who suspect that unscrupulous
sellers soaked them by not disclosing the car's history.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, it is a misdemeanor not to tell a buyer a
vehicle was involved in an accident in which the cost exceeded 25
percent of the vehicle's value, or that a vehicle was flooded,
reconstructed or salvaged. That information must also be listed on
title and registration cards unless it meets certain criteria for
repair. Removing the title or supporting documents from a vehicle
with the intent to conceal damage is also a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Automobile Dealers Association, which has a
policy of full disclosure for its members, estimates that nearly a
third of auto sales are made outside a dealership _ person to
person _ making it important that people investigate any car they
want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Callers who can provide a Vehicle Identification Number can have
the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles in Raleigh check
its records to see if a car was salvaged or flooded. The DMV
customer service line is (919) 715-7000
</P>
<P>
   Also, the state attorney general's office has set up a Web site
_ www.jus.state.nc.us/cpframe.htm _ where people can find if a car
was titled as ``flood'' or ``water damaged'' in North Carolina. The
site includes a VIN list of flooded vehicles that were properly
titled in the state. The site also provides a link where people can
request a complete title history on a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office cautions that when cars are
retitled out of state, the flood designation can be lost; so a
visit to the Web site or a gathering a title history is a good idea
for prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, the dealers association has designed and
distributed to its members supplemental damage reports for car
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about the consumer impact down the chain of
flood vehicles,'' said executive vice president Robert Glaser.
``The form is a level of assurance,'' he said, so buyers will
``know the history of a vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more immediate ways to tell if a car might have been
in a flood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first tip-offs is a strong, musty odor of mildew.
Rust around the dashboard area and electrical problems _
particularly with automatic door locks and windows that have wiring
and switches in the doors _ are also sometimes evidence that a car
was underwater.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA warns that flooded cars can be dangerous to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some could run OK, but on the other hand, the water that got
into the engine could cause corrosion,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser said a person could be driving down the road and have a
car die without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the old days where you could just jump-start the
car,'' he said. ``Today's cars are all circuitry.''
</P>
<P>
   Another danger with flooded cars is unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never know when the impact of the flood is going to
take place,'' Glaser said. It could be two weeks after a car is
purchased, or six months later.

   COACHELLA, Calif. _ The modest Indian gambling hall near a truck
stop here in the desert has little of the flamboyance of Donald
Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J., or of numerous Las Vegas
resorts. About the only glitz is provided by illuminated
star-shaped wall plaques autographed by Tom Jones, Crystal Gale,
Shirley Bassey and other entertainers who have performed at the
casino's combination theater-bingo hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taj has incredible crystal chandeliers that will
absolutely knock your eyes out,'' said Charles J. Irwin, general
manager of the Spotlight 29 Casino here and a former vice chairman
of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. ``The Vegas places
have water effects and pirate ships and that kind of thing. This is
just a small Indian casino.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not for long. Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts announced
Wednesday that it had signed a letter of intent with the
Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians to take over the
Spotlight's management. The tribe and Trump Hotels will raise up to
$60 million to turn the betting parlor into more of a resort, which
is expected to take on the Trump brand name and a dash of Trump's
trademark extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after California voters approved a
measure to legalize Las Vegas-style casinos on Indian lands
throughout the state, setting off a scramble by tribes to expand
existing casinos or open new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Casino companies from Nevada, New Jersey and elsewhere are
angling to get in on what could become a huge gambling market.
Three Las Vegas companies _ Harrah's Entertainment, Anchor Gaming
and Station Casinos _ have already announced deals to build and
manage tribal casinos, each costing roughly $100 million. Lakes
Gaming, a Minnesota company that specializes in managing Indian
casinos, says it has signed up two tribes. Other deals are expected
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal gaming, of course, is already widespread. But the
expansion of tribal casinos in California is noteworthy because the
large population could allow the state to grow quickly into one of
the largest gambling markets, perhaps rivaling New Jersey. Bear,
Stearns has estimated that casino revenue in California will grow
to $4.7 billion in 2004 from about $1 billion a year now. By
contrast, Nevada has about $9 billion in casino revenue and New
Jersey $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is also noteworthy because California, next door to Nevada,
supplies about a third of the visitors to Las Vegas and an even
higher percentage to Laughlin, Reno and Lake Tahoe. California
could thus pose a bigger threat than other states to Nevada's
gambling-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a positive for Las Vegas, I can tell you that,'' said
Trump, whose company runs three casinos in Atlantic City and one in
Indiana but none in Las Vegas. One of the most attractive spots, he
and others said, is this area around Palm Springs, already a
sizable tourist spot. People from Los Angeles can drive here in
about two hours, less than half the time needed to get to Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada casinos spent more than $20 million to try to defeat a
ballot measure in 1998 to legalize California tribal gambling. The
measure was approved overwhelmingly, though it was later overturned
in court. So this year the casinos did not oppose the measure,
which got 65 percent of the vote, and instead are trying for a
slice of the tribal revenues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even the master casino builder Stephen A. Wynn has been
scouting, although the planned acquisition of his company Mirage
Resorts by MGM Grand will take any decision out of his hands. The
Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, which runs a casino a few minutes'
drive from the Spotlight, has held talks with Mirage and other
casino companies, said Brenda Soulliere, first vice chairman, who
said no decision had been made yet.
</P>
<P>
   There are already about 40 tribal casinos in California with
about 19,000 slot machines. But the state constitution bans
Nevada-style gambling, so officials had threatened to shut the
casinos down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, casinos will be able to put in full-fledged slot machines,
not the so-called video lottery terminals they have now, which do
not have arms to pull and print out winnings on a piece of paper.
The tribes will also be able to have card games like blackjack in
which players play against the house. (Now players pay 50 cents or
a dollar a hand into a pool that is used to pay winners.) But craps
and roulette will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   All this could make gambling more attractive in California. But
more important, with the threat of shutdown eliminated, the tribes
will find it easier to get financing to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so relieved,'' said Richard M. Milanovich, chairman
of the Tribal Council of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla
Indians, which spent millions of dollars to win approval of
Indian-run gambling. The tribe's five-year-old Spa Casino is housed
mainly in a huge canvas tent that stands somewhat incongruously in
the middle of upscale Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tribe is wasting little time. On Monday, the tribe is
expected to announce plans to invest more than $100 million to
build a permanent casino with a theater and restaurants, and to
replace the adjacent Spa hotel with one twice as large. The tribe,
one of California's wealthiest, is also expected to announce an
investment of $50 million or more to build a second casino nearby.
The total number of slot machines is expected to grow to 2,000 from
1,150.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal officials dispute predictions of an explosion of
gambling in California or a huge influx of Nevada companies. Some
deals now being announced or proposed will not get financing or
prove economically feasible. Some still require tribes to obtain
land and could face local opposition. Many reservations in remote
locations could not support a casino of any size.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to have a lot of significant operations,''
said Howard L. Dickstein, a Sacramento lawyer who represents
several tribes. He said more than half the existing casinos had
fewer than 350 slot machines each. &UR;  &LR;  For casino companies as well,
the opportunity is somewhat limited. Under federal law, outside
companies cannot own tribal casinos and management contracts last
no more than seven years, and usually five.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world I would rather own 100 percent,'' said
Glenn C. Christenson, chief financial officer of Station Casinos.
Still, he said, such deals can be profitable. Station will get 22.5
percent of the net revenue of the casino it will build with the
United Auburn Indian Community near Sacramento, a few miles from
the highway that links San Francisco and Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some casino executives say it makes little sense to set
up a competitor only to be kicked out after five or seven years.
Some tribes, having already run their own casinos, do not need
outside help and do not want to split the profits. Some tribes also
have lingering resentment against the casinos that tried to defeat
the 1998 ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   For slot machine makers the opportunity is less ambiguous.
``It's probably one of the biggest markets that ever opened up all
at one time,'' said Ed Rogich, vice president for marketing at
International Game Technology, the largest manufacturer of slot
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between tribes and the state, the number of
slot machines could more than double, to about 45,000 _ more than
New Jersey's 36,000 but far behind Nevada's 200,000. And some
analysts say the agreement could be interpreted to allow even more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Each tribe will be allowed up to 2,000 machines; most big Las
Vegas resorts, Rogich said, have 2,000 to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the shaky legal ground of the California casinos, the
leading slot machine makers would not sell to them before for fear
of losing their own licenses. The machines in use at the tribal
casinos here, with names like Native American Gold or Native
Nickels, are crude compared with the machines now available
elsewhere, which have themes like Wheel of Fortune or Monopoly, and
bonus rounds. And without clanging coins, these are no doubt some
of the quietest casinos around.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas itself is not expected to suffer much because its
billion-dollar resorts offer entertainment beyond gambling. The
city has continued to grow despite the advent of gambling in
numerous other states. Indeed, there is some evidence that gambling
elsewhere only whets people's appetite for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Las Vegas is going to be reproduced in Palm
Springs,'' said Ellis Landau, chief financial officer of Boyd
Gaming, which runs four hotels in Las Vegas. While there are four
casinos in the Palm Springs area, they are spread apart.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno and Laughlin, which have fewer nongambling amenities
and are more dependent than Las Vegas on people driving from
California, could be hit harder. Harry C. Curtis, an analyst at
Robertson Stephens, estimates that casino earnings in those cities
could drop 15 to 20 percent in 2001, but recover later.
</P>
<P>
   Harry York, chief executive of the Reno-Sparks Chamber of
Commerce, said the expansion of California gaming was ``definitely
something we have to reckon with and deal with, but it's not going
to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city was renovating its downtown and advertising
itself as a place for more than just gambling. And while 30 percent
of the economy is directly dependent on gambling, that number has
dropped as the city has diversified. For example, it has attracted
a big Amazon.com distribution center.
</P>
<P>
   But some people gambling here say they already visit Nevada
less. ``It's better than having to drive to Vegas,'' said Rita
Recio, from near Los Angeles, who was playing a slot machine in the
Palm Springs casino. The lack of clanging coins and the makeshift
environment did not bother her. ``I didn't even notice it was a
tent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people interviewed said they supported the casinos, which
they said had helped the economy and provided entertainment for the
many retirees here. But there was some concern about casinos
growing too rapidly or the area becoming too much like Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see the smallness of it change,'' said Marjorie
Young, who has lived in Palm Springs for 24 years and gambles at
the Spa Casino twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Palms Springs casino has attracted some local opposition,
especially because of its garish electric sign, which some see as
clashing with the city's more subdued ambience. But Milanovich, the
tribal chairman, said the new casino would blend in.
</P>
<P>
   As for Trump, some gamblers were puzzled about what a big
developer could want with a little casino like this. ``Compared to
Mirage and MGM Grand it seems a rather small type of thing,'' said
Joe Preece, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some said the money could help. Elaine Pandl, visiting
from Wisconsin, said she found the casino a bit ``tacky,'' but when
she heard of Trump's involvement added, ``Maybe he'll put in a new
carpet.''

COMMENTARY: THE WATER'S EDGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So I was starting to envy the political reporters, because there
seemed to be no foreign policy in this year's presidential primary
campaign. But then I realized that there was no policy in this
campaign, let alone foreign policy, so there was really nothing to
envy. So far, this has been a campaign about campaigning _ who has
the best ad strategy for distorting the other guy's position and
re-inventing his own in order to mislead voters.
</P>
<P>
   We had a primary in New York in which people actually discussed
whether John McCain was for or against breast cancer, and George W.
Bush, who presides over one of the most polluted states in the
nation, ran as the candidate from Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that distortion is part of campaigning, but when did
it become campaigning? I guess the true measure of how little
foreign policy figured in the primaries was the fact that none of
the candidates felt impelled to even distort the other's
foreign-policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of foreign policy is due in part to the relative
peace and prosperity America now enjoys, but there are other
factors at play. To begin with, the substantive differences between
the center of the Democratic and Republican parties on many key
foreign-policy questions has narrowed. Face it, President Clinton
has done to the Republicans on foreign policy exactly what he did
to them on domestic policy: He took all their favorite issues and
left them with the garbage. The Republicans wanted NATO expansion,
so Clinton expanded NATO. The Republicans initiated NAFTA, and
Clinton got it ratified. The Republicans were in favor of
ballistic-missile defense, so Clinton made it part of the
Democratic plank too. There aren't a lot of global wedge issues
left.
</P>
<P>
   The differences have also narrowed because some of the key
issues have become too complicated to distort. They are so complex
they don't fit on a bumper sticker at all. You'd need the whole
bumper to describe them.
</P>
<P>
   America's obvious national interest today is sustainable
globalization. Just that term is a mouthful. But the fact is, it's
America's products, technologies, ideas, values, culture and style
of capitalism that are being most globalized today. So surely our
overriding interest is to keep that going _ by both stabilizing the
world system militarily and democratizing it economically and
politically, so that more people in more places benefit from this
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory. The practice is even more complicated,
particularly in an age when Americans are held responsible for
everything in the world but don't want to die for anything. As
such, the practice of sustainable globalization is a quirky
combination of cruise missiles and Web servers. It means deploying
classic deterrence against Iraq; pursuing arms control, IMF aid and
containment vis-a-vis Russia; combining gunboats, trade and
Internet investment to move China along; and deterrence and
potatoes to induce North Korea not to go nuclear. It is not heroic
stuff, but so far it's kept the peace and globalization alive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the differences have narrowed because for a lot of
citizens the biggest foreign-policy issue is now the biggest
domestic issue: education. Just as the Soviet launch of Sputnik
elevated the importance of science education in the early Cold War,
the onset of globalization and intensified economic competition is
elevating the importance of technology education today. In the Cold
War we thought we had to get smarter to survive in a world of
walls, and in this era of globalization we think we need to get
smarter to survive in a world without walls.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the center of both parties, argues Robert Pastor,
an Emory University political scientist, what's left that really
differentiates them is attitude _ ``how they define American
leadership'' _ with the Democrats tending to believe that the best
way to pursue our interests is by working with coalitions of
allies, the U.N. and through international treaties, and the
Republicans at least talking about more unilateral approaches and
rejecting treaties, such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But
how much even those differences are real and how much they grow out
of who's in office and who's not is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Both George W. Bush and Al Gore would drive with
roughly the same foreign-policy map. It's really a question of who
you'd trust with the car keys.

POLICE CHARGE MAN, 29, IN ATTEMPTED RAPE OF WEB CHUM, 14 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITMAN, Mass. _ The 14-year-old girl was among millions of
teenagers staring at their computer screens one night last year,
tapping out instant messages to her friends, when she first met
Jason Sterling in a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting himself as an 18-year-old, he seductively wove
himself into her web of friends by using his older-boy charm, his
advice about the opposite sex and his promises of unrequited love
for her, according to family and police.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, police said, Sterling, a 29-year-old recent graduate
of the Massachusetts School of Law, befriended the girl, moved near
her home, and then, one day, broke into her house, dragged her to
her bedroom, and attempted to rape her. More charges could be filed
against him, police said, adding that they believe he may have
contacted 20 or more children on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to the shock of the girl's family and some national
specialists in cyber stalking, Sterling remains free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   On arraignment, he pleaded not guilty, claiming he was invited
into the girl's house. He is scheduled to appear in Brockton
District Court this month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the country's leading specialist on cyber crimes is
calling the case one of the most treacherous yet of cyber stalking
_ and perhaps the first time that a false Internet friendship has
led to breaking and entering of a private home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we have always feared,'' said Parry Aftab, the
executive director of Cyberangels, a national Internet safety
organization. ``When I first heard about this case, I just
gasped.''
</P>
<P>
   As the story continues to unfold in this small
shoe-manufacturing town 20 miles South of Boston, the mother of the
alleged victim as well as the mother of the girl's best friend, who
also met Sterling, said they hope the case gives parents a glimpse
at just how vulnerable children are every time they click on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this story to shake up parents and force them to stop
sticking their heads in the sand,'' said the best friend's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a nightmare,'' said the mother of the 14-year-old
girl. ``We are now trying to bring some normalcy to our lives. A
parent can do but so much to protect their child.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Sterling, who did not respond to repeated
messages for an interview, still insists that he loves the girl. He
contends, said police, that he is not capable of hurting a child.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that is just one of Sterling's many lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a predator of children,'' said Whitman police detective
Scott Benton. ``The lowest form of human being there is. He used
the computer as a tool, a tool to get sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling and the girl met in the chat room about a year ago,
said police and parents. The girl introduced him to her other
friends, beginning a string of frequent chat room meetings between
Sterling and five girls.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Sterling's e-mails included intentional misspelling
and youthful banter to disguise his age. He flattered the girls by
giving them attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to be some knight in shining armor, but when they
find out he is closer to 30 than 20, it is sickening to them,''
</P>
<P>
   Benton said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sterling's most infamous and seductive messages,
according to police, was a daily note he sent out called ``Jason's
quote of the day.'' In the message, said police and one parent, he
bragged about helping women in distress.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling used another trick, said Whitman patrolman Sean
Reynolds, who is examining copies of Sterling's and the girls'
e-mail messages: He would ask gossipy questions about one of the
girls whenever she left the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how he'd find out their weaknesses,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities said the Internet messages became more and more
sexual. Even after the alleged attack, said police, he told another
of the five girls that he would take her to Planned Parenthood,
apparently for birth control. Another time, said police, Sterling
said he wanted to perform oral sex on one of the girls but the girl
was so young that she didn't even know what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Police said months earlier Sterling had met with the 14-year-old
girl at Whitman-Hanson High School, then showered her with gifts,
and eventually moved from Lowell, north of Boston, to an apartment
just a half-block away from her house. After the move, the girl's
parents, realizing he was much older than he had pretended to be,
asked him to stay away, police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 5, the girl's parents filed their first restraining
order against him.
</P>
<P>
   But family and police said he did not stop trying to make
contact with her. He continued to chat online and on the telephone
with the girl's best friend. The best friend's mother said she was
hesitant to allow her daughter to continue talking to Sterling on
the telephone because she believed he was lying about his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, he said his name was Brian,'' the mother said. ``I
knew something about him was wrong. I am from the city. ... you
can't fool me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sterling left the woman's daughter a tiny computerized
organizer as well as a bowl of cookies on her doorstep. She said he
also bought several of the other girls presents, including a pager.
</P>
<P>
   The best friend's mother said she finally met Sterling at a
football game where he drove a Jeep and wore green highlights in
his hair to look younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `You are 18?' '' she recalled. ``I later told him `If
you ever come near my daughter, or even look at her, I will kill
you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But police said he continued to pursue the girl he is accused of
trying to rape.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the alleged victim was walking
home from school with a male friend last month when Sterling
appeared behind her and tapped her on her shoulder. Although the
girl said she repeatedly told Sterling that day to get away from
her, she claimed he pushed her into her house as soon as she stuck
her key into the lock.
</P>
<P>
   The girl told police he dragged her up to her room, pinned her
down: ``Me screaming `Get off me. What the hell are you doing?''
she said in court documents. ``He says `I can give you everything
when you're 18.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to police, the girl's mother walked in the house
and called police, who arrested Sterling as he struggled to hide
under the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 the FBI has arrested 515 people accused of luring
children on the computer, said Peter Gullotta Jr., special agent in
the Baltimore division. He said the number of cases continues to
grow. In 1998 the agency investigated 1,500 new cases, double that
of the previous year.

JUDGE PREPARES TO RULE ON CUBAN BOY'S CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)  (jw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a federal hearing that could be the first step in the
return of Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba, lawyers for the
6-year-old boy argued that he had been denied the due process
granted to all other aliens who came to this country seeking
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the government countered that he was too young to
read or even understand an application for asylum and that his
father in Cuba, who is demanding the boy's return, had the legal
right to speak for his son.
</P>
<P>
   That is how such cases are traditionally decided, in this
country and around the world, based on common sense, said Edwin S.
Kneedler, deputy U.S. solicitor general, in a hearing Thursday
morning on a lawsuit filed by Elian's relatives in Miami, who seek
an asylum hearing by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge K. Michael Moore of U.S. District Court here, who is
also considering whether his court, and not just the immigration
service, has jurisdiction in the emotionally charged custody case,
did not rule on anything Thursday, and would not say when he would.
</P>
<P>
   It was an anti-climactic end to three hours of courtroom
wrangling about who has the legal right to speak for the boy. The
judge must decide whether to dismiss the relatives' lawsuit
outright and leave the case in the hands of the immigration
service, removing a major obstacle to the boy's return to Cuba. Or
Moore could order the immigration service, which has already denied
Elian an asylum hearing, to grant him one.
</P>
<P>
   But that, said lawyers for the government, would ignore an
established principle in U.S. and international law: that it is the
parent who represents the interests of the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian Gonzalez has a legal representative, and that
representative is his father,'' said Kneedler. ``The surviving
parent is the sole legal representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a doorman
in the resort city of Varadero, Cuba, Kneedler added that ``this is
a universal, expected norm,'' and that to ignore it in Elian's case
could put American children in jeopardy around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in countries unfriendly to the United States could,
with such a precedent, just keep visiting American children and
ignore parents' rights to their children. ``Parents speak for their
children,'' Kneedler said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives argued that there was
no age limit in immigration laws for someone seeking asylum, and
that Elian, who was found floating on an inner tube off South
Florida on Thanksgiving Day, has formally requested asylum.
</P>
<P>
   He has signed a request for asylum, ``and he understands it,''
said Barbara Lagoa, a lawyer for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, whose mother, Elizabet Brotons, drowned along with 10
other Cubans in the crossing attempt, has said he wants to remain
in Miami, and understands that a request for asylum would allow
that, said lawyers and relatives here in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Lagoa, one of eight lawyers gathered around the plaintiff's
table, used immigration law as a hammer to pound out her argument
for an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alien may apply for asylum, without exception,'' said
Lagoa. ``The statute applies to any alien, and a child's right to
seek asylum is well-established. The statute is as inclusive as
Congress could have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore pressed Kneedler on the way the immigration service had
handled the case, asking him why, if Juan Gonzalez was the only one
who could speak for the boy's legal rights, did the agency turn
Elian over to the great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't put him in the custody of the father,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler said Elian was already traumatized by his ordeal _ he
had drifted in the Atlantic on an inner tube for two days and was
terrified and dehydrated _ and that it made sense to put the child
in the care of the relatives who showed up at the hospital in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fast-moving situation, and it was a perfectly human
response,'' to place the child in the care of family, said
Kneedler.
</P>
<P>
   The family's lawyers noted that, if the father was in legal
control of his son's immigration status, why was he not here in
court, fighting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who has the backing of Cuban President Fidel Castro,
has said he would not come to plead for his son in what he called a
corrupt American court.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, he told the Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, that he
was confident that Elian would soon come home. ``In spite of
everything, I am sure the boy will come back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The child, legally, is in the custody of Attorney General Janet
Reno, not the family. The attorney general and President Clinton
have said the boy should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here had expected the judge to rule simply that his
court had no jurisdiction, which would have almost certainly led to
the boy's return to Cuba, without an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore, who ran the hearing on a tight time schedule, seemed
sympathetic to the plaintiffs while shooting hard questions at the
government's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge asked the same questions I had,'' said Jose Garcia
Pedrosa, one of the lawyers for the family. ``I think it was a
productive hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was also hopeful after
hearing the arguments and the judge's reaction to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank the judge,'' he said. ``All this is in the hands of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides argued inside the beautiful old courtroom in
downtown Miami _ the same courtroom in which the government tried
its case against Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian dictator _
a group of about 50 supporters of the family's lawsuit sang and
waved Cuban flags and signs just outside. In Miami's exile
community, many people believe it is Castro who really wants the
boy returned, and that the child's father is a puppet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's under the thumb of the regime,'' said Linda Osberg-Braun,
a lawyer for the family.

GORE, BUSH THROW THEMSELVES INTO THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ Despite the withdrawal, as predicted, of the
primary challengers in both parties Thursday, the two presidential
campaign front-runners did little to suggest they were relaxing
before the start of the harrowing eight-month general election
race. If anything, Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President
Al Gore seemed to be sending each other a message: This will be a
long, hard fight.
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with confidence, Bush held rallies in three Western
states with upcoming Republican primaries, even though that battle
was all but won. Gore also put himself in the spotlight by
unexpectedly flying to Washington, D.C., to be on hand if needed to
break a tie as the Senate voted to confirm two federal appellate
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Neither overshadowed the day's headline: that John McCain and
Bill Bradley were pulling out. Both Bush and Gore were magnanimous
toward their erstwhile opponents. Bush was particularly warm toward
McCain, who departed gracefully, expressing none of the rancor that
marked his earlier losses in the primary. And Bush's earlier
bitterness over what he described as negative campaign tactics by
McCain seemed to have all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But by late in the day, as Bush continued his attacks on Gore's
manner of raising campaign funds, the challengers already seemed to
have become an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Bush focused on Gore's assertion that he opposed unregulated
soft-money donations _ and then he cited reports that the vice
president was raising millions in soft-money donations himself.
While Bush spoke to supporters in 20-degree weather outside the
Denver Broncos' practice complex, his aides passed out a news
release to reporters with the headline: ``Gore: Soft Money is Bad,
but it Sure Comes in Handy!'' Later, at a news conference, Bush
said he was ``amazed'' by Gore's hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what he's thinking,'' Bush said. ``Must be
thinking we're not paying attention. He must believe that only
words matter in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has challenged Bush not to use soft money during the
campaign. ``All he has to do is agree to the challenge with no
conditions, no prerequisites,'' Gore said Thursday. ``All he has to
do is say `yes.' Ban all soft money from this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men allowed their departing opponents their due. Gore
issued a statement praising Bradley's campaign, saying he ran a
``campaign based on the highest ideals. . . . This primary has been
good for the Democratic Party and good for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is a good man whom I respect greatly,'' the Gore
statement said. ``I am honored to have his support.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also addressed Bradley's decision to leave the
Democratic race. During a question-and-answer session, Clinton
said: ``If you looked at the issues he raised and the way in which
he raised them, it recalled again how very much more substantive in
my judgment the debate was on the Democratic side, on the issues,
and how much more agreement there was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Republican side there was far more disagreement, I
think, and it was far less rooted in issues that will really affect
the American people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone on the Republican side had softened noticeably by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, Bush told a hushed crowd that he had spoken with McCain
earlier that day, after the senator suspended his campaign leaving
former ambassador Alan Keyes as the only other Republican still in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call, Bush thanked McCain for his ``gracious
comments'' in announcing his decision to suspend the campaign,
aides said. Bush told McCain he ``appreciated how he had handled
his decision to no longer be an active candidate,'' Bush
communications director Karen Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally in Provo, Bush elaborated on his sentiments toward
the Arizona senator. ``I want to say something publicly about the
senator: I appreciate the kind words,'' said Bush, who listened to
McCain's speech live on the radio while driving from the Denver
airport to a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate so very much the competition and the hard work
that he put into the campaign,'' he said. ``I appreciate his
commitment to reform. The best reform for America, the best reform
for this country, is to end the Clinton-Gore era in Washington,
D.C.''

COMMENTARY: THE MORNING AFTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gore-Bush. Deep down, we all knew it would come to this.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-Gore. Maybe it will be good for our character. It's really
superficial, you know, this desire for a chief executive with
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be fine, in time. Our citizenship has been tested with
much worse match-ups _ remember Reagan-Mondale? Dukakis-Bush?
Clinton-Dole? But it's going to take a while to accept the fact
that we've been left alone with these two guys for the next eight
months.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months. How many times can Al Gore casually drop the fact
that he was in the Army in Vietnam over that long a stretch? How
many times will George W. Bush announce that he doesn't just want
to lower the toll on the road to the middle class, he wants to tear
down the tollbooth? How many times will he screw it up? The man has
an MBA from Harvard, but he cannot get this tollbooth thing down
right. Some days he wants to tear down the toll, sometimes he wants
to lower the booth.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, they're stronger than we are. Never before have we
had a presidential contest involving people in such good physical
shape. In the prime of life, by our new flexible baby-boom
standards, they're fitness fiends. Put George W. down for a rest
stop, and he's off on a three-mile run like an unleashed beagle.
Leave the vice president alone behind closed doors and he'll start
doing sit-ups. Both camps now assure us they are going to use this
energy to leap directly into a 34-week non-stop conflict in which
punches will be thrown and mutilation inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strap on your seat belts, we're in for a roller coaster
ride,'' said Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Politics as an Iron Man Triathlon _ did anybody ask the public
about this? Could be a blessing, though. It may lead to revisionist
thinking about William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedal to the metal!'' said Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, truth to tell, is better at these endurance
tests than Bush, who whined his way through several states yearning
for his family, his dog and his own no-steam shaving mirror back
home. Gore just seems to be real, real good at enduring discomfort.
In the age of indulgence, we've got a stoic running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the days grow longer, we become stronger!'' said Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore celebrated his victory Tuesday night by morphing into
McCain. Admitting past sins, he embraced campaign finance reform _
for real this time, cross my heart _ and embarked on a series of
town hall meetings. Bush had already had his turn to become McCain
during his ``reformer with results'' reincarnation after New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Enoughenough. By all rights, today should be reserved for
bidding farewell to the original John McCain and to Bill Bradley,
who made the last few months a whole lot more interesting than we'd
anticipated. They both withdrew from combat Thursday, expressing
controlled disdain for their former opponents. McCain was by far
the frostier, offering Bush the political equivalent of ``Good
luck, you'll need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Arizona will never have to wonder whether he
could have gone further if he had tried harder. All the McCain team
worked like maniacs. (``Throw up on your own time,'' one of his
supporters gibed at another when flu struck the Straight Talk
Express in South Carolina.) Win or lose, he's had a political
adventure on a level nobody but Bill Clinton has experienced,
without the impeachment downside.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's candidacy, on the other hand, just sort of faded away.
It was one of those campaigns where the high points are the
announcement and the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, a certain amount of showmanship is required,''
sighed Kathy Boland, a nurse who stood through a Bradley rally in
the Seattle rain. His audiences were full of the helping
professions, and people with great insurance coverage worrying
about universal health care. Bill Bradley had the nicest supporters
of any candidate. There just weren't very many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated candidates are now off to vacation with their
wives, leaving us in what currently feels like a battle to the
death between More of the Same and Less of the Same. We miss them
already.

THE SEASON FOR OLD PSAL NAMES TO REMINISCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Mass., N.Y.)   By   DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``This time of year,'' Dolph Schayes was saying.
``This is when I really start to think basketball: the NCAA and the
NIT, then the NBA playoffs. This is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the time to remember basketball in other eras, as
Schayes, Nate (Tiny) Archibald, Andrew (Fuzzy) Levane, Floyd Layne,
Zeke Sinicola and Alex Isaacs did Thursday _ New York names that
many of today's pro, college and high school players should know
but probably never heard of because they're too busy dunking.
</P>
<P>
   These old names had gathered among the Carnegie Deli's
corned-beef sandwiches to reminisce about another alphabetic
tournament, the 98th PSAL (alias the Public Schools Athletic
League) championships Sunday at the Garden: Lincoln vs. Kennedy
(Boys A), Roosevelt vs. Hale (Boys B) and Sheepshead Bay-Bergtraum
(Girls B).
</P>
<P>
   Schayes and Archibald are enshrined in the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., but their roots were
planted two decades apart at DeWitt Clinton High School in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Now 72, Schayes, who was an all-American at New York University
when college basketball ruled the Garden half a century ago, should
have been a Knick instead of the Syracuse Nationals' six-time
first-team All-Star forward. If he had been a Knick, maybe the
Knicks would have won a National Basketball Association title
before 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the Knicks' first-round choice, but that year their
boss, Ned Irish, had the NBA institute what amounted to a salary
cap _ $100,000 for the team, $5,000 for a rookie,'' Schayes
recalled. ``That's all the Knicks could offer me, but Syracuse,
which then was in the rival National Basketball League before the
merger, offered me $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irish couldn't give me more than $5,000 because he would be
busting the salary cap that had been his idea, but since I had an
engineering degree at NYU, the Knicks told me they'd get me a job
with the Port Authority in the off-season as an extra salary. But
nobody told me what the job was. For all I knew, I'd be taking
tolls at a bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget that at the time, $5,000 was pretty good money,''
he added. ``That came out to $100 a week and I remember telling my
mother when I graduated, `If I can make $100 a week the rest of my
life, I'll be happy.' And when I took the Nats' $7,500, I told her,
`I'll just play one year.' But that one year turned into 16
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1955 Syracuse Nats, with Schayes averaging 18.5 points and
12.3 rebounds, won the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Archibald, the point guard on the 1981 champion Boston Celtics,
was on Clinton's 1963 PSAL title team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year before, we lost to Boys High in the final at the
Garden,'' Archibald recalled. ``What a great atmosphere that was
for high school kids to be in, but that was when they had the riot.
After the game ended, people were coming out of the stands, guys
were breaking things, just going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years after that riot, the PSAL championships were
banned from the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next year, we won the title,'' Archibald said, ``but we
played the final in Queens. Just two teams, two referees, no
spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   After having been in the Garden, playing for the title at a high
school gym, Archibald recalled, ``was like a punishment.'' Levane,
a longtime Knicks scout and briefly the Knicks' coach four decades
ago, was on James Madison's 1938 champions before starring at St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were undefeated, 23 and 0,'' he said. ``We had what I don't
think any other high school team ever had _ six guys who went on to
play pro. I was with the Rochester Royals; the Rader twins, Lenny
and Howie, and Stan Waxman were with Buffalo; Fred Lewis was with
Sheboygan, all in the old NBL, and Larry Baxter was with Paterson
of the old American Basketball League.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs, whose father, John, had played for the legendary
Renaissance Ballroom team, was on Taft's 1975 champions, three
decades after Sinicola and Layne were teammates at Benjamin
Franklin High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat Erasmus for the 1946 title,'' said Sinicola, who went
on to Niagara University and the Fort Wayne Pistons. ``We had one
of the legends of high school basketball in those years, Rabbit
Walthour.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that name, Layne, who was later the point guard on City
College's unprecedented and unmatched 1950 sweep of both the
National Collegiate Athletic Association and National Invitation
Tournament titles, held up his long fingers and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``See all the knobs on these fingers,'' said Layne, now the
coach at Prospect Heights High in Brooklyn. ``I was fortunate to be
at the end of the passes that Rabbit and Zeke threw, but I had I
don't know how many sprained fingers I got from catching those
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Layne, who later coached at CCNY, was among the Beaver players
convicted of shaving points in the 1951 scandal that tarnished his
chances of joining an NBA team as an assistant coach. He was
interviewed twice, once with the Knicks and once with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the scandal hurt me, I wouldn't say that,'' he said
without any bitterness in his voice. ``That's for others to say.'' &QL;

FATE OF CUBAN BOY STILL UP IN THE AIR 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After three months of a political tug-of-war, the fate
of 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez remains
uncertain after a federal judge Thursday raised questions about the
government's handling of the boy's petition for political asylum,
but issued no ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Though U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore could reach a
decision as early as next week on a petition filed on behalf of the
boy's Miami family, the issue may take months, if not years, to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was considering a lawsuit brought by Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is trying to keep the child with
Miami relatives in the United States _ rather than have the boy
sent back to his father in communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   If Moore rules in favor of the U.S. Justice Department, which
has said the boy should be returned, attorneys for the family have
said they may file appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,
if necessary. And if Moore allows the boy to file for political
asylum, that process could take at least 60 days before reaching an
immigration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that the court's resolution will make it
possible for this little boy to go back to his father and put an
end to this extraordinary stress on the family,'' said Patricia
Maher, deputy assistant U.S. Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was rescued off the coast of Fort Lauderdale last
Thanksgiving by a pair of fishermen who found him floating adrift
strapped to an inner tube. He was one of three survivors on an
ill-fated boat trip to the United States from Cuba. His mother, who
had taken him on the journey without informing family members in
Cuba, was among 11 people who drowned on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since his rescue, Elian has been at the center of a
political maelstrom pitting Miami's Cuban exile community, which
wants him to remain in the United States, and Cuban dictator Fidel
Castro, who has rallied support around Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides accuse the other of using Elian as a political pawn.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-hour hearing Thursday morning, a Justice Department
attorney argued that no court had the jurisdiction to remove the
authority from the U.S. Attorney General's office in an immigration
issue. However, attorneys for Elian's Miami's family claimed the
boy was unjustly denied his right to seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin S. Kneedler, deputy solicitor general of the United
States, said the INS twice rejected political asylum applications
filed on behalf of the boy _ decisions upheld by Attorney General
Janet Reno. The agency determined that Elian's father, as the boy's
sole legal guardian, was the only person who could seek asylum on
behalf of the boy. Reno withdrew the applications at the request of
the father, Juan Gonzalez, who asked that his son be returned to
him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler argued that a federal court did not have the
jurisdiction to review a decision by the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Elian's Miami family, however, said the boy's
political asylum applications should have never been withdrawn
because he had the same rights as any illegal immigrant to petition
for protection under the Refugee Act of 1980. They filed affidavits
supporting their claims that a dismal, if not perilous, future
awaits the boy if he is returned to Cuba. Attorneys declined to
comment about the affidavits, which were sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is that a child, Elian Gonzalez, regardless of
the fact that he is 6 years old has the right to file a petition
for asylum. That's it. That's the question. And the government is
trying to distort the law and not follow the law,'' said Barbara
Lagoa, one of the Gonzalez family attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Moore asked Kneedler why the INS had not
resolved the issue in an immigration court rather than denying the
application without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   If that course had been taken, Moore said the issue probably
would have been resolved by now.
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler said the INS was not compelled to consider the
application after the boy's father asked to have it removed. Also,
he said a 6-year-old, because of juvenile status, cannot seek
asylum on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does it say in the statute if you're under six (years
old you cannot apply?) Where does it say who is authorized to
speak? When I look at the law it states any alien is eligible to
apply,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the INS has the prerogative to accept the application
and then let an immigration court decide whether it should be
denied, but that the agency ``can't have it both ways.``
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler said the boy had not been admitted into the United
States, and that he had been paroled into the care of his great
uncle Lazaro Gonzalez only until the INS could determine the boy's
status.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in early January spoke to the boy's father in Cuba
and determined he had maintained an ongoing relationship with his
son and was a fit father.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, about 60 demonstrators _ most of them
supporters of Elian's staying in the United States _ waved huge
Cuban flags, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Ira Kurzban, an adjunct law professor
specializing in immigration law at the University of Miami, said
Kneedler concentrated too much on defending Reno and her decision
rather than arguing the father's parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense of the father was secondary and that may make a
difference,'' he said. Thus far, events have favored efforts to
keep the boy in Miami, which he described as a ``long stall.''

FOR BURNS, IT'S HOCKEY AS USUAL, DESPITE THE PRESSURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Untying his skates as a pizza arrived in the
coaches room at the Entertainment and Sports Arena Thursday
following practice, Bruins coach Pat Burns made it clear. ``You can
talk to me, but I don't want to talk about Ray Bourque, Marty
McSorley, Harry Sinden, or Jeremy Jacobs.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs spoke on a wide variety of topics in both Boston
newspapers Thursday, and he softened _ if not backpedaled from _
his previous criticism of the Bruins' coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   So that couldn't be ignored, and Burns eventually chose to speak
on the topic one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Jacobs...,'' Burns said, then paused. ``I've said
things that have been taken out of context and written all kinds of
ways, and the way I see it, he's not a bad person and I never felt
that he was. I think what he was trying to get was an explanation
of why these things were happening. It's normal. And of course
you're trying to do that, you own the team. Of course you're
scratching your head trying to figure it out. But he's far from
being a bad person. I've got to know him a little bit from the
certain amount of times I've met him. He's been very cordial to me.
Very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs told the Globe's Kevin Paul Dupont, ``I don't know if
changing Burns is the right thing, I really don't . . .'' After
being critical of the Bruins' penalty-killing unit _ which dropped
from first to last in a year _ in a Will McDonough column a few
weeks ago, Jacobs said, ``I was critical, but it wasn't of Burns,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Thursday that when he first read Jacobs's criticism,
``I was shocked. I was shocked like everybody else was shocked.
What the hell was this?'' Yet he understood the owner saying what
he had to say and he didn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dislike anybody in this organization,'' said Burns.
``I've said it before and I'll say it again, I like Harry. I love
going fishing with Harry. We have fun. We disagree on certain
things. I'm doing the best I can with what I've got. That's all I
can give. It's not where I want to be with this team. I agree it's
not where this team should be. We should be better. But changes and
things have happened and it's been very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets frustrated and things are said and then there's
a counter to that. It becomes, like I said, a mudslinging affair
and it gets ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even heard I was responsible for Ray's departure. That's so
stupid. Ray had an opportunity to go somewhere. He has a chance to
win a Cup and Harry being the great hockey man he is, acknowledged
that and he put him on a pretty good team. I don't know if he'll
play next year but he's a great individual, a great person, and a
great hockey player. This is not the first time this has come up
with Ray Bourque. If the team would have been doing better maybe he
wouldn't have asked for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he's not going to take anything to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think until Mr. Jacobs talks to me personally and tells me
exactly what he said, I'm not going to believe anything,'' said
Burns. ``If he wants to talk to me personally I'd definitely
entertain an occasion to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Jacobs's long-distance ownership is no different than
some of the owners he's played for in the past. Though he might
have seen his bosses in Montreal and Toronto more, he didn't speak
to them that much, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is normal for me,'' said Burns. ``I know the trend now is
for owners to be more hands on, and if that's the case, fine. We're
employees and they're the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has his teaching cap on, and said a few days ago he wanted
to enjoy his team the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players need to go out and have fun and play together and
work,'' said Burns. ``Management wants to see these young players,
so we're going to see them. So now you're trying to pull for them
to do their best. I think it's more than wins right now. There's a
lot of pressure on them, so I don't want to be sitting behind them
and over their shoulder, but I do want to correct things and try to
make them better players for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had fun in (the Buffalo game Wednesday) except for one
mental mistake at the end, and then it was back to square one, so
today you've got to bring them back up again and say, `Hey, we
played 60 hard minutes and we had fun doing it and we tried
something new, and the guys liked it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Burns may have the reputation of being a tough coach, but he
won't be a screamer now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put them out there and when they come back and we see
something we tell them, but they have to find their own way,'' he
said. ``This is a different league. It's gone beyond taking a guy
aside for the rest of the year and say you have to do this and do
that. We're asking players to do what they do best and we have to
see whether it's good enough or not to play for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs expressed disappointment with Sergei Samsonov because his
play has tailed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (Jason) Allison, Samsonov never had the centerman who
he had all those points with,'' said Burns. ``He ends up playing
with Joe (Thornton) and things haven't clicked. They're young.
They're two 20-year-olds. (Actually Samsonov is 21). They're out
there every night, and asking them to win games for us all the time
is tough. I know they're going to struggle in areas, but when they
have the opportunities to score they have to finish them. Sergei's
a hard worker. He's one of the hardest workers on the team. He's
not a big guy and other teams know that . . . they're banging him
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said on several occasions he's had to refocus the team,
especially lately in light of Bourque's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told everybody to shut up (about the Bourque
situation),'' Burns said. ``Forget talking about it and the
mudslinging. Everybody's just got to be quiet and do their job and
get through this thing. We have five weeks to go and that's a long
time to bury your head. I think it's getting through. You see the
players aren't really involved in this mess. They're not the cause
of what happened and shouldn't be implicated.''
</P>
<P>
   For so much of Burns's career, he's been battling for and in the
playoffs. Not now. While he has a plan for the players, what's the
plan for himself? How does he keep from getting discouraged?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job, simple as that,'' said Burns. ``I could go in
there and yell and scream at them, but am I going to get anywhere?
I don't think so. They do have some experience. At this time of the
year, you don't yell and scream and punish, punish, punish. We do a
lot of correcting and that's what keeps us upbeat. We're a very
young and inexperienced team right now. We have three guys with 300
games or more, that's not a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The players knew Bourque's days were numbered, and some now feel
Burns may be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's another coach then the players will like that
coach,'' Burns said. ``That doesn't change. If Pat Burns had to
leave tomorrow or at the end of the season or midway through the
season next year, that's not gonna change. The players just feel .
. . is it wrong when players want to play for a coach? The game has
changed. This is not your kick-in-the-pants-all-the-time anymore or
stick-over-the-head stuff, or bench 'em stuff. Players know what to
expect from you. But there's been so many changes with this club
all year, players up and down, up and down. It's very difficult to
have any kind of system.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he's trying to find new leaders. He chatted Thursday
with Kyle McLaren and told him, ``If you want to be a leader on the
club, you have to lead by example. You have to bring the level of
your game up to be able to say, `Hey, let's go.' If you're not
doing it, it's very difficult to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say it's difficult for Burns to lead under the
circumstances, that his situation is now becoming a death watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be an evaluation at the end of the year,'' Burns
said. ``That's fine. I just have to go about my business and do the
best job I can do.''

GROUP CITES RISE IN ANTI-GAY HARASSMENT IN MILITARY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reports of anti-gay harassment in the military more
than doubled last year, despite renewed Pentagon efforts to curb
such abuse after the killing of a gay soldier in his barracks, a
legal aid group for gay service members said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network received reports of 968
cases of verbal abuse and physical assaults last year, according to
the group's annual report. It was the worst year for harassment
since the group began monitoring the military's ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hearing from service members that harassment is very bad
and in some commands it is getting worse,'' said Michelle M.
Benecke, co-executive director of the group. ``People are getting
fed up at being put in situations where they have to choose between
safety and staying in the service.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Thursday that he would read the report
and ``take appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this report is accurate, I would expect to see a
substantial improvement this year. Substantial,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has called for the elimination of the
policy, saying that ``gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve
their country without discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican candidate
for president, supports the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which
allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military as long as
they keep their sexual orientation to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said Thursday that while they had no figures
to support the claim of an increase in abuse of gays, they would
study the new report by the private group and investigate the
incidents it cited.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are specifics in this report that talk about
harassment, we will follow up,'' said Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a
spokesman for the Pentagon. ``I don't want to belittle it, but we
just need to take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Army Pfc. Barry Winchell at Fort Campbell, Ky.,
marked a turning point in the debate over the Pentagon's policy.
</P>
<P>
   After a much publicized conviction of Pvt. Calvin Glover in that
killing, the president said in a radio interview that the ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy was ``out of whack.'' Soon afterward,
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen ordered the Pentagon's
inspector general to investigate the extent of anti-gay harassment.
He also ordered all service members, from privates to generals, to
receive training this year on the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report will be issued later this month.
So far, the military has largely judged how well the policy was
working by keeping track of the number of service members
discharged for being gay. In 1999, 10 percent fewer were discharged
for being gay: 1,034 compared with 1,145 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's report, entitled ``Conduct Unbecoming,'' argued
that the policy was ``a tortured law'' that was difficult to
understand and apply. ``This details the dramatic and horrifying
results of a bad policy made worse by failed leadership,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the policy had resulted in the discharges of
three people a day on grounds of being gay. Several Pentagon
officials say there is evidence that some service members declare
they are gay solely to leave the military with honorable
discharges. Benecke disputed that contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are overwhelmingly coming out because of harassment,
which is not an easy way to get out of the service'' Benecke said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal aid group said that its methods of reporting these
incidents had improved and that more service members knew about the
group. But the group said that this did not account for the 142
percent increase in harassment reports over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted an increase in anti-gay graffiti, verbal abuse
and harassment of lesbians. Women were being discharged at the
highest rate in two decades, according to the report, which singled
out the Defense Language Institute at Monterey, Calif., for
discharging 12 Air Force women.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the group said there had been some
improvements, in particular ``physical abuse by investigators and
criminal prosecutions of lesbian, gay and bisexual service members
have all subsided.''

 NEWS ANALYSIS: McCAIN AS NONCANDIDATE IS STILL PROBLEM FOR BUSH  
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has not even been officially crowned the Republican
presidential nominee, but already Gov. George W. Bush finds himself
confronted with a classic predicament, one that poses a significant
test to his leadership skills: How does he win over Sen. John
McCain _ and his crucial block of independent and Democratic
loyalists _ without antagonizing the Republican establishment that
pulled Bush to victory?
</P>
<P>
   It is a ticklish spot: Bush cannot win the election in November
unless large numbers of McCain's supporters rally behind him. The
simplest way for that to happen is for the Arizona senator to rally
behind Bush first.
</P>
<P>
   Already top Bush lieutenants are quietly reaching out to
McCain's camp, sending signals that they respect him and want to
work with him.
</P>
<P>
   But many people close to McCain said he might not be inclined to
play along, at least not enthusiastically, unless Bush embraces the
centerpiece of his candidacy: his sweeping campaign-finance
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary for Bush is that his advisers say it would be
inconceivable for the Texas governor to sign on to McCain's
prescription for campaign reform, because its ban on unregulated
soft money has been scorned by crucial elements of the Republican
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Bush demonstrated the sensitivity
of the matter by not ridiculing the McCain proposal as he usually
does. Instead, he dodged a question about whether he would embrace
a ban on soft money, saying, ``We'll just see at the time.'' He
went on to press for his own proposal that would ban union dues
from being used for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Bush drew so much support so early from
governors, members of Congress and interest groups _ and that
McCain did so poorly with those same categories _ is that he vowed
never to do anything to jeopardize the Republicans' financial
advantages. The governor is not about to risk alienating those
groups now, especially when some are planning to run independent
advertising campaigns that would benefit his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate situation because Bush is no longer the
front-runner _ he is in effect the nominee _ and he therefore has a
responsibility to lead the party,'' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican
strategist who supports Bush. ``But at the same time, the key to
victory in November is an appeal to many of the voters McCain
appealed to in February and March.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush adopted McCain's campaign-finance plan, Gillespie said,
``he would be whipsawed from the left and from the right.''
</P>
<P>
   That's only part of the problem. Bush could risk looking like a
compliant pushover if he were to fold. After all, he derided
McCain's finance plan at one of their debates by saying: ``It is
bad for Republicans and it's going to hurt the conservative
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain is not about to settle for the far less sweeping
campaign-reform plan that Bush introduced just before the South
Carolina primary, in a move to trump the senator's reform
credentials. McCain called it a ``camouflage and a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush would get into a little consistency trap,'' said Don
Sipple, a media consultant for the governor's past campaigns.
``He's staked out his position pretty well. He would look
unprincipled and opportunistic and hypocritical if he was to lurch
over on that one issue for instant gratification. Whatever you get
at the end of that process is just not worth what you gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Bush does not somehow find a way to mollify McCain, even
more trouble could lie ahead. There is a rich history in the
Republican Party of struggles between the party's establishment and
wings on one side or another. Barry Goldwater, who was nominated on
a right-wing crusade in 1964, never succeeded in reaching out to
Nelson Rockefeller or his more moderate supporters. He lost in that
November.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992, President George Bush reached out _ in hindsight
too eagerly _ to the insurgent who had tried to topple his campaign
from the right, Pat Buchanan. Buchanan's irate speech at the
nominating convention haunted the party for months, even years, to
come _ and played a part in dooming Bush's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans close to the Bush campaign said one possibility is
that the governor would put out an explicit or tacit signal to
McCain that he could take issue publicly with Bush on prized topics
like campaign finance and taxes but still be welcomed on good
terms. The important thing, they said, is that he support Bush as
the far preferable alternative to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It may be wishful thinking, but Bush advisers are also primed
with examples of other politicians who are close to McCain but take
issue with his position on campaign finance. For example, Sen.
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a top McCain adviser, did not vote for the
campaign-finance measure, and Bob Dole opposed it as well _ even
though he and McCain are close.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican official familiar with the talks between the two
camps said of McCain, ``He's going to be watching to see how Bush
talks about reform'' _ and to make sure that his ``reformer with
results'' self-description is more than a slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem for Bush is that he, of course, can only
play one side of the equation. It is not clear yet what McCain
expects _ or might demand _ from Bush or from the committee that
will draft the party platform for the convention in Philadelphia in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Few clues could be gleaned from the senator's enigmatic speech
in the mountains of Arizona on Thursday. After making clear that
the Republican Party ``is my home,'' McCain once again raised his
signature issue that so many Republicans despise. ``I'm also
dedicated to the necessary cause of reform,'' he said, ``and I will
never walk away from a fight for what I know is right and just for
our country.''

POLITICAL MEMO: BOWING OUT, MCCAIN AND BRADLEY FIND COMMON GROUND
ANEW
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they did so vividly three months ago in Claremont, N.H., the
campaigns of John McCain and Bill Bradley again found common ground
Thursday. In mirror-image speeches barely an hour apart, the
conservative Republican and the liberal Democrat abandoned the
presidential race, leaving the country to puzzle over the demise of
a pair of candidacies that had once so captured the fancy of the
American press and public.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tidy television package, the sight of these vanquished
politicians, their wives at their sides, offering their clipped
exit lines to the applause of their staffs. But something more than
the multimillion-dollar apparatus of two national campaigns was now
to be dismantled. What was disappearing from the stage with them
was something less tangible: the romance of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, it looked as if this might be the year of the
maverick. In the months before the caucuses and primaries began,
the insurgent candidacies of Bradley and McCain seemed to click
with voters in an elemental way. It was as if a fairly prosperous
electorate, content for the most part with how the machinery of
government was functioning, wanted something spiritually deeper in
its next commander-in-chief. The sentiment was sensed by reporters:
``Authenticity'' was the first buzzword of the season, another way
of saying that in the race for a successor to President Clinton, it
appeared that character was going to count for a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Though insiders by virtue of their Washington credentials,
McCain, the senator from Arizona, and Bradley, the former senator
from New Jersey. were the embodiments of outsider-ness on the
stump. McCain's instantly legendary campaign bus, the Straight Talk
Express, became a rolling metaphor for this ethos of unfiltered
politics: it was ``The Real World'' on wheels. And Bradley's
stoop-shouldered naturalness _ a man ``comfortable in his own
skin,'' was how the scribes put it _ sent the Hydralike campaign of
Vice President Al Gore into a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Gore was closing down shop in Washington and _ mimicking
Bradley's decision to place his headquarters in a nondescript
medical-office building in West Orange, N.J. _ relocated his
operation back home, in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The news media were dazzled, especially by McCain, a Republican
from a wing of the party not known for harboring a deep affection
for the national press. And unlike some mavericks of the past,
including Pat Buchanan or Ross Perot, the McCain and Bradley
candidacies, as the conservative commentator William Kristol has
noted, were optimistic in tone. Each had a highly media-genic story
and an apparent zeal to shake things up: one, a swashbuckling war
hero crusading for campaign finance reform, the other, an
introspective former basketball star asking the nation to embrace
the politics of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Their idealistic appeals had their moments; it even looked for a
time _ more recently for McCain than Bradley _ that they would pull
off something close to impossible in modern presidential politics,
melt the heart of a major party with the heat of insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, these were rebels who lost their causes,
beaten back by standard-bearers of the establishment, a pair of
political heirs with proud old inside-the-beltway pedigrees and
famous family names.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fate, complicated by a monthlong dormancy in the
Democratic primary-election schedule and the more intense media
focus on the Republican contest, had seemed sealed in the weeks
after his crushing defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire, where he
invested millions of dollars. But the end of McCain's joy ride came
on Super Tuesday with astonishing swiftness, after a seesaw battle
with Gov. George W. Bush that kept the nation entertained and
talking politics for much of the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Party primaries are essentially family feuds. And as countless
commentators noted, it was always going to be hugely difficult for
Bradley or McCain to appropriate the seat at the head of the table
from a sitting vice president or a big-state governor who could
count on the blessings of virtually all the party elders.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the decks were stacked against them, the two
insurgents saw their auras dissipate as the race progressed.
Bradley's lethargic demeanor and laid-back campaigning style looked
increasingly like indifference, and the vigor of McCain turned ever
more vinegary under the relentless pressure, in the form of attack
ads, applied by forces allied with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, their opponents' campaigns began to understand that
Bradley and McCain had tapped into an unease in the population
about the two front-runners: it seemed that a scripted candidate,
in an age of casual Fridays and blockbuster movies made with
hand-held cameras, was something of a throwback. So they tried to
draw on the outsider aura. Gore now showed up at events in his
shirt sleeves; Bush tried to co-opt his rival's mantle of reform:
he was not only a compassionate conservative, but also a reformer
with results.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the missteps he might have made in recent weeks,
McCain had supplied much of the primary season's adrenalin, and one
could almost sense it draining out of the race Thursday as he stood
disconsolately at the podium, promising to continue his crusade in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As Jonathan Alter, the commentator for NBC News and Newsweek,
put it, ``It's just the end of the fun.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ After an often bitter 14-month, $30-million
campaign in which he failed to win a single primary, former Sen.
Bill Bradley ended his quest for the presidency Thursday, saying
the time had come to unite the Democratic Party behind Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bradley pledged to work for Gore's victory in the
general election in November, he did not release his roughly 400
delegates, presumably to give him more influence at the Democratic
National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bradley said he would not hesitate to criticize the
vice president if he engaged in the same kind of negative
campaigning against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive
Republican nominee, that Bradley had accused Gore of using during
the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he'll run a better campaign in the general
election,'' Bradley said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before teary-eyed aides in a hall near his national
headquarters here, Bradley, whose party loyalty was questioned by
Gore during the campaign, called it a Democratic tradition ``to
fight hard during primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And now it is time for unity,'' said Bradley, his wife,
Ernestine, at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats know that the offerings of the likely Republican
nominee and his party are the opposite of where our country should
be headed,'' he said. ``This country needs Democratic leadership,
and I will work to ensure a Democratic White House and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he called Gore earlier Thursday to offer his
support and congratulations, though he declined to discuss details
of their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore released a statement in which he praised Bradley as ``a
good man'' and then made an appeal to his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend Bill, Ernestine, and all their staff and supporters
for running a good campaign based on the highest ideals,'' Gore
said. ``They showed real courage, conviction and commitment in
taking their message to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were ample signs Thursday that it would not be easy
for Gore to win over Bradley's core supporters. There was, for
example, talk among some of Bradley's aides of ``guerrilla action''
against the Gore campaign. His staff groaned when Bradley was asked
whether he would run as Gore's vice president, and cheered when he
said no.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed in a news conference to explain why he had not used the
word ``endorse,'' Bradley showed a flash of irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had this a number of times in the campaign,'' he said.
``I'm not parsing words today, I'm saying very clearly, I have
called him, I said I would support him, I intend to support him,
and I intend to work for the Democratic ticket and for Democrats to
regain control of the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications director,
asserted that Bradley was using ``endorse'' and ``support''
interchangeably. ``He likes to say he supports candidates and
endorses checks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While his aides blinked back tears, Bradley looked relaxed and
cheerful. He even opened his speech with a joke for reporters,
saying, ``I want to begin this morning with a discussion of my
favorite books.'' (During the campaign, Bradley would routinely
brush aside questions about his favorite books, films, philosophers
or foods.)
</P>
<P>
   When the news conference was over, he tried to show that he had
no hard feelings toward the press corps that has followed him since
last fall by giving each member two gifts: a box of the same kinds
of lozenges he rolled in his mouth during events and a key chain
with a silver basketball shoe from Tiffany &AMP; Co. (The New York
Times' policy prohibits staff members from accepting gifts of more
than trivial value. The key chain will be returned with thanks.)
</P>
<P>
   But the gifts could not hide the fact that many of Bradley's
advisers feel that he was unfairly written off by the news media
after he lost the New Hampshire on Feb. 1, five weeks before
Tuesday's climactic primaries and caucuses in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech was uncharacteristically short, lasting about
five minutes. His news conference, on the other hand, was one of
the longest he has given in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he refused to expand on what his campaign did wrong,
drawing an almost mystical analogy to Marcel Proust's seven-volume
novel, ``Remembrance of Things Past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that the seven volumes are written, and by the
end of the seventh volume, he says `Well, now I think I really know
what it is to write,''' Bradley said. ``And that might apply to
this campaign, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not say whether he would run again for president,
saying that his only plan was to take a vacation. Asked to explain
what the defeat meant, he said: ``For me personally, today means,
you know, the closing of this chapter. It is something that I
believe I gave my full heart, mind, soul and energy to. And it
didn't turn out.''

OFFSHORE BANKING BILL ATTACKED AS SCHUMER VOWS TO TOUGHEN
PROPOSAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa)    By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Promising a ``fight on the floor of the Senate,''
Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday that he planned to
``toughen up'' legislation proposed by the Clinton administration
to combat money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's main criticism of a White House proposal announced on
Wednesday was that penalties against offshore banks or countries
would be left to the discretion of U.S. authorities rather than
being set off automatically when money-laundering abuses are
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a hearing on money laundering convened by Rep. Jim
Leach, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking
Committee, Schumer said that an effective policy against money
laundering required that suspect offshore banks be automatically
forbidden access to the U.S. banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my years as a legislator, I've observed time and again that
in the international arena, discretion is usually a code word for
delay and avoid,'' Schumer said. ``There is no reason to allow any
of these banks to exist because we know their sole _ and only _
purpose is money laundering. What discretion do we need?''
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering refers to the practice of filtering profits
from illegal activities through banks to disguise their origin. The
White House initiative is a response to heightened awareness of
money laundering that emerged after the disclosure last year that
$7 billion in suspect Russian funds had moved through the Bank of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department has proposed an array of legislative and
regulatory initiatives aimed at money laundering, including the
designation of metropolitan areas deemed high-risk zones for such
activities. The department is also asking Congress for broad new
powers to combat money laundering, including the authority to ban
financial transactions between United States banks or brokerage
houses and offshore financial centers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal has been criticized by some in
Washington as too little, too late. The House and Senate Banking
committees have already submitted anti-money-laundering
legislation, and members of both committees have been working
closely together to devise a compromise bill. That legislation
would place a greater burden on financial institutions to determine
the actual beneficiaries of bank and brokerage accounts and to
police money-laundering problems themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Leach and Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., have been more
supportive of the administration's proposal. They introduced the
administration's anti-money-laundering bill into the House
Thursday, saying that it ``builds in a constructive, although more
limited, basis'' on their own legislation. Leach said he hoped
Congress and the White House could ``pass meaningful
anti-money-laundering legislation this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat, deputy secretary of the Treasury, testified
Thursday that penalties against offshore banks and jurisdictions
should be discretionary ``so that the response we make is
proportionate to the problem.'' He said he saw a ``potential for
real problems'' if penalties were imposed on ``automatic pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said the administration would push to add political
corruption to the list of crimes that would fall under the legal
umbrella of money laundering. Investigators examining the suspect
transactions at the Bank of New York think that some of the funds
may represent the proceeds of political graft in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Leach had planned to subpoena Peter Berlin and Lucy Edwards, two
main suspects in the Bank of New York investigation, to testify
before his committee Thursday but decided not to do so at the
request of the Justice Department. Berlin and Edwards recently
pleaded guilty to money laundering and are cooperating with federal
investigators. Leach said, however, that his ``patience in this
regard has its limits'' and that he would seek the couple's
testimony at the earliest possible date. A member of Leach's staff
said the couple would be asked to testify no later than this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan M. Winer, a former deputy assistant secretary of state,
testified that a Bank of New York affiliate based in Geneva _ Bank
of New York-Inter Maritime _ was a leading provider of banking
services to Internet gambling companies based in the Caribbean.
Winer said such activities were troubling because ``Internet casino
gambling, among other innovative financial solutions, has the
potential to provide an open invitation to money launderers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York declined to comment. Officials at the Bank
of New York-Inter Maritime could not be reached for comment.

<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain, whose insurgency became the
surprise of the presidential primary season, on Wednesday ended his
maverick bid for the Republican nomination with the hope that he
would eventually prevail in ``making our party as big as the
country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after being defeated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush in
primaries from coast to coast, the Arizona senator, standing with
striated mountains and the glorious Verde Valley as his backdrop,
acknowledged that no matter how many crossover voters he had
attracted, he was not the preference of the majority in his own
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore I announce today, on this fine Arizona morning and
in this beautiful place, that I am not longer an active candidate
for my party's nomination for president,'' McCain said, his wife,
Cindy, at his side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had gracious words for Bush, congratulating him but
stopping short of endorsing him. The senator also said he would not
``walk away from'' his fight for reform, adding: ``What is good for
my country is good for my party. Should our party ever abandon this
principle, the American people will rightly abandon us, and we will
surely slip into the mists of history, deserving the allegiance of
none.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made his announcement only an hour after former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey withdrew from the Democratic race. Their
decisions brought an abrupt end to the primary season and set the
stage for what promises to be a costly and bitter battle between
Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Colorado, congratulated McCain ``for
fighting the good fight'' and called the senator's concession
``gracious.'' The governor also said he had a short telephone
conversation with McCain. He said there was no timetable for longer
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us have just come off a tough campaign,'' Bush said,
``John needs some time to think. I need some time. But I believe
that when it's all said and done that we can have a good
dialogue,'' Bush said. ``I intend to talk with him at his
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone call followed a series of back-door conversations
between supporters of Bush and Washington-based supporters of
McCain. It began what many Republicans hope will be a process of
reconciliation that could lead to McCain's eventual endorsement of
Bush and allow the Republican nominee to hold on to many of the
independents and new voters that had flocked to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But the hurdles for the party go beyond the personal
rapprochement needed after such a bitter campaign. With McCain
insisting that he would continue his fight for reform, he and Bush
will have to bridge fundamental differences between their agendas,
in particular McCain's advocacy of overhauling the campaign finance
system and his support of a tax cut plan that is at odds with
Republican orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they thought avenues of compromise could
emerge.``There's no way you're going to be able to meld everything
Bush said and McCain said and get a broth that's eatable,'' said
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is close to McCain and who has been
working to smooth the way for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question you'll have to sand off the edges to fit
it,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also seemed to leave open the option of using his 231
delegates, from seven state delegations as a force to press for
changes in the party platform at the Republican National Convention
this summer. Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said the
senator was keeping an organization together to ``maintain contact
with our delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will press for measures that are germane for reform,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis downplayed any idea that platform fight would be
necessary and and spoke like a loyal Republican of the necessity of
defeating Gore.

WHITE HOUSE STILL LACKS VOTES TO PASS CHINA TRADE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Miss., Calif., Ore., N.Y., S.D., Minn., Texas, Mich.,
Ariz.)   (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in `w' news file)  
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration conceded Thursday that
it did not yet have the votes to pass a decisive China trade
accord, as a lobbying battle was shaping up for the 130 or so
uncommitted House members who will decide the fate of the
president's most important remaining foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over whether to grant permanent normal trading
privileges to China reveals fault lines in the nation's political
and business communities that will surely grow by June, when the
House will probably vote. Odd coalitions have sprung up in
opposition, from liberal Democrats who abhor China's labor and
environmental standards to conservative Republicans who criticize
Beijing's human rights record and threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clinton formally called on lawmakers to approve the
accord, the administration's point man on the measure, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, conceded that the outcome, particularly in
the House, is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably don't have the votes right now,'' Daley told
reporters Thursday after briefing executives on the accord.
``Members are still trying to grapple with this. They're still
wondering whether it's going to happen. It's very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, especially the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers, has made defeating the accord its top legislative priority
this year, both to preserve jobs at home and to put pressure on
China to raise its labor standards. Business groups, on the other
hand, last weekend kicked off a $1.5 million advertising campaign
to expound on the benefits of expanded trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's pulled a gun on me yet, but the lobbying is
significant,'' said Rep. Bart Gordon, an uncommitted Democrat from
Tennessee whose late switch in 1993 to support the North American
Free Trade Agreement provided Clinton with a crucial vote to pass
that landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   In another complication for Clinton, some conservatives are
considering amending the bill to increase military ties between
Taiwan and the United States, a move that China and the White House
strongly oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, last
week urged Clinton to act positively on Taiwan's request for
advanced weaponry, including four warships equipped with
sophisticated radar and anti-missile systems, which are built in
Pascagoula, Miss., and Bath, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The administration last fall promised Beijing that it would work
to grant China permanent trade status as part of a larger package
to bring China into the World Trade Organization. In the bilateral
deal, China agreed to open a wide range of its markets, from
agriculture to telecommunications, a potential boon to American
farmers and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing China into the rules-based trading system is a
win-win-win for American workers, American businesses and American
values,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To close the deal, Congress is being asked to give up its annual
review of China's trade status and grant it the permanent trading
privileges that the United States gives most other countries.
Congress has always approved this status.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if Congress votes down normal trade relations
is a subject of some debate. China would probably still join the
World Trade Organization. But the administration says that American
companies would not enjoy the benefits of the agreement _ lower
tariffs on their goods and greater access to China's markets _
while Europe and Japan would be able to get those benefits.
</P>
<P>
   However, as a matter of power politics, China may decide it is
economically unwise to anger the U.S., and so might for a time
accept a continuation of the status quo, keeping the trade status
up for renewal but withholding the market-opening measures.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the votes on Capitol Hill is crucial. The
administration is pushing for votes by the Memorial Day recess to
avoid bumping up against the political parties' conventions this
summer, and to reduce the chances that new provocations by China
would undercut support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his Cabinet are meeting with lawmakers regularly to
win support. Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman plan to
take groups of wavering legislators to China next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the president believes that if he rushes this
through before members can fully understand what's in the
agreement, he can win,'' said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., who
opposes permanent trade status. ``The longer this sits, the more
probability we have of beating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the bill's passage seem good in the Senate, which
is typically more supportive of trade agreements than the House. In
a test vote last July, the Senate rejected, 87-12, a nonbinding
measure to end normal trading relations with China. No one expects
the Senate to duplicate that margin for permanent trade status, but
supporters now count at least 60 votes, the magic number needed to
end a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the administration will probably try to get the
Senate to vote first, with a vote in the pro-trade Senate Finance
Committee by late April, reversing the usual order of trade bills
starting in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be well received in the Senate,'' said Sen. Daniel
P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., who strongly supports permanent trade
relations with China and who complained two weeks ago that the
White House needed to act soon.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., the Democratic
leader, this week predicted Senate approval after a spirited
debate.

   Senate opponents concede they face an uphill struggle, but said
momentum has shifted in the past three months. ``I don't say we
have the votes to defeat this, but it's going to be a more intense
fight than people thought,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
Wellstone is among those who oppose the bill because, he says,
allowing China into the trade organization would cause the U.S.
trade deficit with China to balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the House right now is like herding cats. But
according to vote-counters on both sides, here is what the math
looks like:
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, about 150 Republicans and 110
Democrats have voted to grant China normal trading status as part
of the annual review. A bill needs 218 votes to pass the House if
all members vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republican vote-counters say they can probably produce at least
135 votes for granting permanent normal trade status, barring any
new provocations by China, although they are short of that now.
Democratic supporters say they can count on about 50 to 60 firm
``yes'' votes now, but insist that aggressive lobbying by business
groups, Clinton and his top aides will harvest dozens of
uncommitted Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   By the count of some pro-trade lobbyists, at least 60 House
Democrats are uncommitted. Some House critics say that number is
closer to 20 to 30, and that the remainder are leaning toward
``no.'' Republicans say perhaps 70 of their rank and file are also
uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said Thursday that the administration is focusing its
efforts on about 50 of those 130 uncommitted members.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in farm states and in high-tech districts in
California are under particular pressure from local interests to
approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who fought Clinton over impeachment last
year, are well aware that they would be delivering the majority of
votes needed to cement a foreign policy triumph for the president.
</P>
<P>
   So they are trying to put pressure on the Democrats, aides say.
That way, if the measure fails, Republicans can blame the White
House for not turning out its party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president gets us 100 Democrats, we'll be fine,'' Rep.
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip who supports the trade
bill, said in a brief interview. Other supporters say that figure
is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
Democrat, said that 128 of 211 House Democrats were opposing the
measure. He added that 30 of those opponents had supported China in
annual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an early stage but the momentum is with us,'' Bonior
said in an interview Thursday. ``People are moving toward our
position.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be true in some cases. Rep. John Conyers Jr., a senior
liberal Democrat from Michigan who has voted for giving China
normal trade status on a yearly basis, said in an interview that he
would oppose permanent status because it would be a mistake to
surrender the leverage of an annual vote.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with about one-third of the 30 representatives
that Bonior said had switched to opposing permanent status, some
said they truly had not made up their minds. ``I'm undecided,''
said Rep. Martin T. Meehan, D-Mass. ``I'm willing to look at the
administration's arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., said he had heard from labor activists
who oppose the bill, as well as from orange growers, cotton farmers
and executives from technology companies like Motorola and
Honeywell in his district who support permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the fence,'' he said.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN RAMSEY CASE DECLINES TO SEEK RE-ELECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney
leading the investigation of the killing of JonBenet Ramsey,
announced Thursday that he would leave his office at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to seek an eighth four-year term was
influenced, he said, more by family considerations than by the
Ramsey case, despite widespread criticism over his handling of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the body of the 6-year-old girl was found in her parents'
home more than three years ago, no one has been arrested. Hunter
adjourned a grand jury last fall after his prosecutors failed to
produce enough evidence to indict anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hunter, 63, defended his work and said he would
remain active in the case through the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is the American public would like to hang
somebody for this case,'' he said in an interview. ``So would Alex
Hunter and 10 other prosecutors who have said there is not enough
evidence. But by not filing a case, it means we've done the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no apologies to make,'' he added, ``even if the public
has a different take on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter burst into public view after Dec. 29, 1996, the day
JonBenet's body was found, bound and strangled.
</P>
<P>
   The case drew instant worldwide attention because of the age of
the victim and videotapes released by the Ramsey family that showed
her dressed like a little cowgirl, singing and dancing in child
beauty contests.
</P>
<P>
   But sloppy police work on the morning the body was discovered
compromised evidence, leading to quick public denunciations of
Hunter and Boulder investigators. Criticism continued over the next
several years as investigators failed to develop enough evidence to
charge anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said in October after dismissing the grand jury that the
investigation would continue with the girl's parents, John and
Patsy Ramsey, ``under the umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   But little has changed since then, and investigators seem no
closer now to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the son of a former mayor of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.,
said that after he leaves office he plans to spend more time with
his five children, two of whom are lawyers in private practice.

WHITE HOUSE STILL LACKS VOTES TO PASS CHINA TRADE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Miss., Calif., Ore., N.Y., S.D., Minn., Texas, Mich.,
Ariz.)   (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in `i' news file)  
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration conceded Thursday that
it did not yet have the votes to pass a decisive China trade
accord, as a lobbying battle was shaping up for the 130 or so
uncommitted House members who will decide the fate of the
president's most important remaining foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over whether to grant permanent normal trading
privileges to China reveals fault lines in the nation's political
and business communities that will surely grow by June, when the
House will probably vote. Odd coalitions have sprung up in
opposition, from liberal Democrats who abhor China's labor and
environmental standards to conservative Republicans who criticize
Beijing's human rights record and threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clinton formally called on lawmakers to approve the
accord, the administration's point man on the measure, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, conceded that the outcome, particularly in
the House, is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably don't have the votes right now,'' Daley told
reporters Thursday after briefing executives on the accord.
``Members are still trying to grapple with this. They're still
wondering whether it's going to happen. It's very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, especially the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers, has made defeating the accord its top legislative priority
this year, both to preserve jobs at home and to put pressure on
China to raise its labor standards. Business groups, on the other
hand, last weekend kicked off a $1.5 million advertising campaign
to expound on the benefits of expanded trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's pulled a gun on me yet, but the lobbying is
significant,'' said Rep. Bart Gordon, an uncommitted Democrat from
Tennessee whose late switch in 1993 to support the North American
Free Trade Agreement provided Clinton with a crucial vote to pass
that landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   In another complication for Clinton, some conservatives are
considering amending the bill to increase military ties between
Taiwan and the United States, a move that China and the White House
strongly oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, last
week urged Clinton to act positively on Taiwan's request for
advanced weaponry, including four warships equipped with
sophisticated radar and anti-missile systems, which are built in
Pascagoula, Miss., and Bath, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The administration last fall promised Beijing that it would work
to grant China permanent trade status as part of a larger package
to bring China into the World Trade Organization. In the bilateral
deal, China agreed to open a wide range of its markets, from
agriculture to telecommunications, a potential boon to American
farmers and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing China into the rules-based trading system is a
win-win-win for American workers, American businesses and American
values,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To close the deal, Congress is being asked to give up its annual
review of China's trade status and grant it the permanent trading
privileges that the United States gives most other countries.
Congress has always approved this status.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if Congress votes down normal trade relations
is a subject of some debate. China would probably still join the
World Trade Organization. But the administration says that American
companies would not enjoy the benefits of the agreement _ lower
tariffs on their goods and greater access to China's markets _
while Europe and Japan would be able to get those benefits.
</P>
<P>
   However, as a matter of power politics, China may decide it is
economically unwise to anger the U.S., and so might for a time
accept a continuation of the status quo, keeping the trade status
up for renewal but withholding the market-opening measures.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the votes on Capitol Hill is crucial. The
administration is pushing for votes by the Memorial Day recess to
avoid bumping up against the political parties' conventions this
summer, and to reduce the chances that new provocations by China
would undercut support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his Cabinet are meeting with lawmakers regularly to
win support. Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman plan to
take groups of wavering legislators to China next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the president believes that if he rushes this
through before members can fully understand what's in the
agreement, he can win,'' said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., who
opposes permanent trade status. ``The longer this sits, the more
probability we have of beating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the bill's passage seem good in the Senate, which
is typically more supportive of trade agreements than the House. In
a test vote last July, the Senate rejected, 87-12, a nonbinding
measure to end normal trading relations with China. No one expects
the Senate to duplicate that margin for permanent trade status, but
supporters now count at least 60 votes, the magic number needed to

VIETNAMESE REFUGEES IN HONG KONG TO FACE LIFE OUTSIDE THE CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Ask Nguyen Kim Lien about life inside the
barbed-wire fence of the Pillar Point Vietnamese Refugee Camp here
and she is remarkably stoic. Her family lives in squalor _ a couple
of rooms in a dilapidated housing block, where rats prowl brazenly
outside the door. Her husband, who is out of work and addicted to
heroin, spends his days wandering the camp in a haze.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nguyen Kim Lien, 36, has found dignity amid the debris. She
runs a shop that sells Vietnamese noodles to the camp's 1,070
refugees. Her two children, who were born in Hong Kong and have
never lived outside the camp, go to a nearby school, where they are
learning to read and write Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   If she has a reason to despair, it is because in two months she
and her family must leave Pillar Point and find a way to support
themselves elsewhere in Hong Kong. Last month, this former British
colony announced it was shutting down its only remaining refugee
camp, ending a drama that began in May 1975, a month after the fall
of Saigon, when the first boat laden with refugees came ashore
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' said Lien, who fled Vietnam in 1988 and has been
in Pillar Point since 1991. ``Inside the camp, I can support
myself. But outside, I don't know. I'm scared that I won't get used
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   People like Nguyen Kim Lien are the ebb tide of a vast diaspora.
Of the more than 800,000 Vietnamese who passed through camps in
Southeast Asian countries between 1975 and the late-1980s, about
224,000 came to Hong Kong. Most of these went on to settle in the
United States, Canada and other countries. At its peak in 1979,
there were 68,695 refugees crowded into camps throughout the
colony.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong says it treated the boat people better than other
Asian countries, welcoming them sooner and taking care of them
longer. But it granted residency to only a small number of ethnic
Chinese refugees and by the mid-1990s it had put 94,700 people on
planes back to Vietnam _ often dragging them up the ramp.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,900 boat people left in Hong Kong have fallen between all
the cracks. After more than a decade of filing applications, they
cannot gain asylum anywhere else. And they either cannot or will
not return to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Hong Kong has closed its doors to immigrants from
mainland China, it is no longer willing to take care of these
holdouts. In February, it agreed to give them legal status here,
but also imposed a deadline: move into society by May 31. They can
choose to remain refugees, but Hong Kong will no longer try to find
them homes overseas. It will also stop paying for their housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to close this chapter of history,'' said
Regina Ip, Hong Kong's secretary of security, who handles
immigration policy. ``It's been a problem for Hong Kong for a
quarter of a century.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong's ultimatum sounds abrupt, few people fault
the government for imposing it. Even critics say the continued
existence of Pillar Point has become an intractable hurdle to the
efforts of the Vietnamese to get on with their lives. A grim,
isolated compound, it is a breeding ground for drug abuse, petty
crime and sporadic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the camps were virtual prisons, but now Pillar
Point is open, and residents are encouraged to find jobs outside.
But the housing blocks were meant to be temporary structures, and
they now look like abandoned army barracks. Even after more than a
decade, life for the refugees still feels tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, police broke up a riot between Vietnamese and ethnic
Chinese refugees, also from Vietnam, who live uneasily next to each
other. Sixteen people were injured in the melee. A chain-link fence
topped with barbed wire now slices through the camp to separate the
two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The condition of the camp is appalling,'' said Pam Baker, a
British lawyer who has represented boat people in cases against the
government. ``It really is a purpose-built den of iniquity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has prodded the refugees to move into
their own apartments, it refused to grant them legal status, and
the accompanying identification cards. That makes it hard for them
to find decent work. With rents in Hong Kong among the highest in
Asia, the lure of free housing pulls many back into the camp. Along
with residency, the refugees would get ID cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a logical conclusion, but it's not a complete
conclusion,'' Baker said. ``What's going to happen to those people
who are not accepted for residency? What's going to happen to those
who are not allowed to apply?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 130 people would seem to fall into one of those
categories. Most have been classified as illegal immigrants or
economic migrants rather than refugees. The Vietnamese government
has refused to take many back because they have criminal records or
health problems. Hong Kong insists it will continue trying to
repatriate them, though it is vague about what it will do if that
fails.
</P>
<P>
   For those who gain residency, the biggest challenge may be
shedding the habits and attitudes developed in years of camp life.
Diep Long Anh, an ethnic Chinese who fled Ho Chi Minh City in 1990,
said she thought about moving out several times. But the free
housing allows Diep, 42, to stay home with her son while her
husband works as a laborer on a construction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't want to work,'' Diep said. ``We're not
lazy. It's just that we worry about getting jobs. It's so expensive
to live outside.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees still nourish dreams of moving to California or
Canada. This is despite the fact that Hong Kong resettled only 71
people in 1999, and a single person so far this year. The U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, which had helped process applications,
is so beset with refugee problems in Africa and the Balkans that it
no longer finances its program here. In a few months, it will
reassign its local officer and oversee Hong Kong from its Beijing
office. Officials here note that the United Nations owes $149
million for the upkeep of the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hong Kong's financial outlays, the sense of futility
among many refugees has mutated into bitterness toward their
adopted home. Some blame their predicament on Hong Kong's return to
China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here because we wanted freedom, but now Hong Kong is a
Communist country,'' said Nguyen Van Thang, a wiry man with hollow
eyes who looks older than his 28 years. Thang said he still hoped
to move to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the refugees regard their future with dread. Pham Thi
Binh, a 33-year-old woman who arrived in Hong Kong in 1988, has
bounced in and out of Pillar Point a few times as she and her
husband have tried to make it outside. They both work on a
construction site; she as a welder and concrete pourer. Binh is
determined to succeed, not least because she wants her 11-year-old
son to mix with local children.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years in Hong Kong, we know we just have to
work hard,'' she said. ``If I save enough, I'll go back and invest
in Vietnam,'' she added, with a smile so broad that it briefly
lifted the camp's gloom.

   WASHINGTON _ Efforts to cut the costs of operating the space
shuttle are eroding safety, and NASA needs to immediately take a
more active role in shuttle operations by private contractors to
reduce risks, an independent study group said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, one of the most significant of shuttle safety since
the Challenger disaster in 1986, was organized by NASA in September
to review maintenance practices for the four-shuttle fleet. Turning
shuttle operations over to private contractors four years ago has
streamlined operations and greatly reduced costs, the panel said in
a report. However, it said, these changes may have gone too far,
resulting in systemic problems that threaten safety.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of key staff members through personnel reductions,
increased workloads and stress on remaining workers, and
simplifying operational procedures raises major concerns that
safety in the shuttle program is being eroded, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report has identified significant problems that must be
addressed to maintain an effective program,'' the committee wrote.
The panel said the problems it found ``appear to be systemic in
nature and not confined to any one shuttle sub-system or element.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended an immediate increase in the workforce
servicing and monitoring the shuttles. Implying that NASA may have
stepped back too far in allowing contractors to run shuttle
operations, the panel said the new workers should be NASA
employees, not contract workers. NASA needs more hands-on
involvement in maintenance and safety, the report said, and not
just serve as a ``safety auditor'' of contractor activities.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member group, headed by Dr. Henry McDonald, director of
NASA's Ames Research Center in California, and including experts in
civilian and military aviation, made 81 recommendations for
improving shuttle maintenance and operations. Some called for
immediate action, which NASA said it had carried out, while others
called for changes to be put into place over the next six months
and later.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph H. Rothenberg, NASA's associate administrator for space
flight, told a news conference that safety continues to be the
agency's main priority for the shuttle program and that NASA would
study the recommendations and act upon them as soon as possible.
However, he said the panel listed some practices and changes in its
recommendations that are valid for aircraft and airline operations,
but that may not apply to the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``We're not going to dismiss any of these
recommendations out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg noted that the panel supported the continued flight
of shuttles while its recommendations were being considered and
acted upon. ``They endorsed the shuttle as safe to fly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA put together the study group because of maintenance
questions that arose after a flight last July by the shuttle
Columbia. On that flight, a short circuit in a wire where
insulation had been worn away knocked out a computerized controller
for one of the three main engines, and a backup had to take over.
In addition, a small pin came loose in one engine and damaged
liquid hydrogen lines in an engine nozzle, resulting in the shuttle
going into a slightly lower than expected orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Resulting inspections found damage caused by maintenance workers
in all four shuttles, resulting in the fleet being grounded for
months for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The panel made four recommendations concerning safety
inspections _ including one to have shuttle managers re-examine 76
critical electrical areas for which there are no backups _ that
NASA acted upon before shuttles began flying again in December,
Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, another study group, NASA's Aerospace Safety
Advisory Panel, expressed similar concerns about the shortages of
skilled engineers and technicians brought about by past staff
reductions. The panel said cutbacks and reorganizations within NASA
and contractors had created problems that could affect safety.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA administrator, said the agency was
aware of these staffing problems and had asked for money in next
year's budget to start hiring 1,850 new employees to make up for
past attrition by retirements and buyouts. He said new employees
were needed to add people with certain skills and experience, with
an emphasis on safety engineers.

MEXICO'S CHIEF JUSTICE STRIVES TO OIL A CREAKING SYSTEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Seated at his desk, Chief Justice Genaro Gongora
Pimentel was partly hidden behind an 18-inch stack of judicial
papers. With assembly line rhythm, a clerk was pulling writs and
rulings from atop the pile, sliding scores of them, one after the
other, under the chief justice's hand for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   This clerical drudgery took much of an hour. It is not
uncharacteristic of routines at the Mexican Supreme Court, where
the caseload is overwhelming. Last year Gongora and his 10
colleagues issued 6,573 rulings. The U.S. Supreme Court issued 75.
</P>
<P>
   The workload is one sign of the archaic state of the Mexican
judiciary, the weak sister in the country's out-of-kilter system of
checks and balances. The opposition-led Congress, though still
dominated by an overwhelmingly powerful executive branch, is
flexing new muscles. But the court system remains feeble.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the chief justice says he is determined to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to modernize our federal judiciary,'' he said during a
recent 90-minute interview in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began a four-year term as chief justice last year,
Gongora has lobbied publicly for measures to reduce the court's
workload and to strengthen its role as a referee between the
executive and legislative powers. He has endorsed Mexico's
evolution toward democracy more forcefully than any previous chief
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to be upset,'' he told reporters as he left
a tumultuous session of Congress last fall in which President
Ernesto Zedillo had been heckled and raucous booing had drowned out
the speech of an opposition member. ``This was a display of
pluralism. We Mexicans need to get used to new times.''
</P>
<P>
   His public candor has won him many admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court was silent before,'' said Hector Fix Zamudio, a
prominent Mexican constitutional scholar. ``Justice Gongora has
given it an active voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his initiatives have drawn criticism, too. The court's
appointment of about 50 new federal judges last fall under an
expedited process that sidestepped requirements for a competitive
examination aroused a furor in legal circles here. Many of the new
judges have close professional ties to Supreme Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to confront the judiciary's problems, which is
praiseworthy,'' said Jose Ramon Cossio Diaz, the law dean at Mexico
City's Autonomous Technological Institute, whom Gongora invited to
serve on a judicial reform commission. ``But the way he's gone
about trying to strengthen the court is dangerous and could bring
the judiciary into general discredit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican judiciary has never enjoyed the prestige of the
executive branch. A prominent lawyer returned from studies at
Harvard University in 1972 convinced of the need to strengthen the
Supreme Court, and urged a leader of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party to seek appointment as its chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to be Mexico's John Marshall,'' the lawyer said,
referring to 19th-century America's pioneering chief justice. The
party leader just laughed. ``He said I didn't know how things
worked, that to be on the Supreme Court was just to be in limbo,''
the lawyer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Three presidents in this century have simply dismissed Mexico's
entire Supreme Court. One was Zedillo, who in his first month in
office removed all 26 justices, installing a new 11-member court.
</P>
<P>
   Gongora, who is 62, was one of Zedillo's new appointments.
Before his nomination, he served as a judge, appellate magistrate
and law professor. His colleagues voted him chief justice in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, in a speech before Zedillo and hundreds of
other senior officials, Gongora urged constitutional amendments to
increase the Supreme Court's power. Approved last June, they
relieved the court of the obligation to rule on hundreds of arcane
jurisdictional disputes that had clogged its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But its caseload remains extraordinary, and Gongora's most
ambitious initiative to date is in part aimed at reducing it
further. He has invited judges, lawyers and law professors to draft
a new, simpler law governing the fundamental procedure by which
Mexicans appeal sentences, file habeas corpus petitions, seek
injunctions and contest the constitutionality of laws.
</P>
<P>
   A curious feature of the system is that Supreme Court rulings
declaring laws unconstitutional apply only to the victorious
plaintiff. All other Mexicans must continue to obey the flawed law
or file their own constitutional challenges, forcing the court to
review the same law over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Gongora's sense of the urgency of judicial reform stems in part
from his belief that Mexico must modernize its institutions to
compete economically in a changing world.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he visited Washington and came away intrigued by
the American Supreme Court's power to reject cases considered
constitutionally irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfasting with other justices, he described how the American
court received about 7,000 appeals last year, but refused to
consider most of them. He also recalled reading that Justice
William O. Douglas had enjoyed white-water kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't that be great?'' Gongora added slyly to his
colleagues. ``If we had that much time, we'd be out there kayaking
too!''
</P>
<P>
   He said later he had meant no criticism of the American system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its crowded agenda, Mexico's Supreme Court has issued
several recent rulings that scholars say have moved it somewhat
from the president's shadow. In one, the court sided with a
defector from the governing party who challenged a law written
specifically to bar him from running for mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often rule against the government,'' Gongora said.
</P>
<P>
   But legal scholars could recall no court ruling that had
circumscribed presidential power significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't dare,'' said Elisur Arteaga Nava, the author of
a standard four-volume text on Mexican constitutional law. ``Our
presidents are still far too powerful.''

PEREZ AND HIS CONTRACT BEING WATCHED CLOSELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - When it comes to the opening-day
roster, Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez's contract might have
something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Daly, managing general partner and CEO of the Dodgers, said
all issues will be considered when it's time to fill the 25-man
roster that opens the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take into account everything,'' Daly said of
evaluating a player.
</P>
<P>
   Daly stressed the decisions will be left to general manager
Kevin Malone and manager Davey Johnson. But certain instances might
exist in which the front office gets more involved. One such case
could be Perez, who is owed $12.6 million over the next two
seasons. Though Perez could be sent to Triple-A Albuquerque, the
club might not be willing to send such a high-priced player to the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's an issue the Dodgers don't want to deal with
now, especially since he's pitched only once this spring. His next
outing is Saturday against St. Louis, but the whirlwind surrounding
him intensified when he allowed five runs in two innings in his
first appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that the next time out there, he'll have a little
better outing, show some signs,'' Johnson said. ``I'm looking for
him to have a better breaking ball, locate better. I don't want any
guy thinking they have to go out there, first time out, and start
tricking people with a changeup, split, curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is there's some competition going on in that
area. It's not one of those where you can kind of gear it up and
just peak at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   While other pitchers are cut slack, Perez is scrutinized for two
reasons: He's owed money and he was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if Carlos Perez doesn't have a much
better year than he did last year,'' Daly said. ``What role he
plays is a question. That's up to Davey to decide who starts. We
have a commitment to him. I have to assume the glass is half
full.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing helping Perez right now is the pitching of
rookie right-hander Eric Gagne. Though Gagne is expected to make
the rotation, he's competing with Perez and Orel Hershiser for one
of two spots. And for the second time in as many outings, he was
hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne allowed five runs, including a 420-foot, three-run blast
by Andruw Jones, in three innings Thursday against Atlanta. He's
allowed 12 runs in 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spring training and I'm not here to throw no-hitters
every day,'' Gagne said. ``I'm here to get ready for a season. I'm
seeing the hitter, the catcher, the stands. Usually, in the season,
all I see is the glove. The last couple innings, my focus was a lot
better. The offseason, you lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Lefty Onan Masaoka was sharp in one scoreless
inning against Kansas City. It was his first action of the spring
after spraining his left ankle two weeks ago.... An MRI on the
shoulder of Kevin Gibbs, a minor-league outfielder with speed whom
Johnson likes, was negative. He's day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. HOUSTON
</P>
<P>
   When/Where: 10:05 a.m., Osceola County Stadium, Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Radio: XTRA 1150 AM (tape delay begins at 5:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: Manager Davey Johnson sees an old friend today as
Astros RH Doc Gooden faces the Dodgers. Going for the Dodgers is RH
Darren Dreifort, who is relishing not having to prove his worth as
a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's results: The losing continued as the Dodgers lost a
pair of games to fall to 1-8. Alan Mills allowed four runs in the
eighth inning of a 5-2 loss to Kansas City at Dodgertown.
Meanwhile, the Dodgers scored seven times in the ninth to tie it
but lost 8-7 to Atlanta on Tim Unroe's homer in the bottom of the
inning at Disney's Wide World of Sports. &QL;

COKE CEO TIES MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION TO ACHIEVEMENTS IN 
 DIVERSITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a striking move intended to counter accusations that the
Coca-Cola Co. has not cared enough about building a diverse work
force, Coke's chairman and chief executive said Thursday that
management compensation at the company, including his own, will be
closely tied to still-unannounced diversity goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets measured gets done,'' said the executive, Douglas N.
Daft, who was elevated to Coke's top job last month. ``Diversity,
in its broadest sense, is a clear business imperative for our
company and its future, and it is a top priority for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The definition is broad, to be sure. A company spokesman, Ben
Deutsch, said diversity would ``include, but not be limited to
race, gender, lifestyle, national origin, age and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been criticized for failing to promote black
employees, which resulted in a Federal lawsuit filed 11 months ago
by a group of current and former Coke workers. It has no women
among its senior and executive vice presidents, and except for Carl
Ware, a black executive vice president who was persuaded to call
off his retirement in January, white men control most of the power
in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Daft plans shortly to appoint a vice president for diversity
strategies, who will monitor efforts toward diversifying the work
force and report directly to him. ``My own success and compensation
will be tied to these diversity goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A possible candidate is Ingrid S. Jones, a vice president, who
is black and who has served on committees trying to improve Coke's
diversity. Deutsch, the spokesman, would not comment on candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement, made in a memo sent to all employees,
is a major shift for Coca-Cola, which is being sued by eight
current and former black employees who say they were unfairly
treated because of their race. The recommendation to name an
executive to supervise the diversity efforts came from the
company's diversity council, formed by the then-chairman and chief
executive, M. Douglas Ivester, after the lawsuit was filed in
April.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is one of several developments over the last year that
have stained the company's public image. It may have contributed to
Ivester's decision to retire last month at the age of 52.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs called the announcement ``a
spectacular victory'' and said it would improve conditions at the
company. ``This is the first step toward moving Coca-Cola from a
laggard to a leader on diversity,'' the lawyer, Cyrus Mehri, said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 consultant's report recommended ``developing a direct
link between diversity and other business objectives,'' although no
policy was outlined at that time.
</P>
<P>
   A report the same year from Ware made observations about life
for blacks within Coke like: ``Some African Americans are viewed
inappropriately as lacking the skills and intelligence to succeed
in certain areas.'' Ware's report also said that several black
executives who met to discuss diversity ``had been humiliated,
ignored, overlooked or unacknowledged,'' and relied on each other
``to provide sanity checks,'' which ``allowed many of them to
retain their psychological health.''
</P>
<P>
   His report, now more than four years old, called at the time for
specific diversity goals to be set.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst with Salomon Smith Barney,
said: ``The most important thing Coke needs to do is mend its
global public image. And if this helps in that respect, the
shareholders are going to benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft has signaled his intention to resolve the lawsuit as
quickly as possible. In January, the federal judge overseeing the
case ordered the contesting parties to try to reach a settlement.
To date, no talks have been held.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people, many of them Coke employees, held a rally in
Atlanta on Saturday in which they said they might boycott the
company over its diversity record.

said as he worked to calm a citywide furor over a march on City
Hall last Friday by a large and angry part of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of officers deserted their beats, startling residents, to
protest the mayor's firing of the police chief, Eugene Sherrard,
who without the mayor's knowledge had approved valor awards for two
officers at the heart of the simmering racial controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The awards for the two officers, both white, resulted from an
alleyway encounter last May in which they killed an unarmed black
car-theft suspect with a fusillade of 22 shots, an incident widely
denounced by blacks as an abuse of police power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, when the police marched down here, it left the
average citizen in a quandary, wondering one thing: Who's watching
over us?'' said the mayor, grim-faced from the protest, where, with
Sherrard in attendance, shouting officers cut off downtown traffic
and left the lights on their cruisers flashing ominously outside
the seat of government as they called for the mayor's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   To underline the resistance, the top nine commanders of the
720-member force also attended the rally and, in a dramatic
gesture, threw their badges down in sympathy with Sherrard.
</P>
<P>
   While the city is boiling with doubts about police fidelity,
majority support has quickly grown on the Board of Aldermen,
Louisville's legislative body, for a law that would increase
civilian oversight of the department through an appointed review
board.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, a 58-year-old Democrat with deep criminal-justice
roots as a past prosecutor and state attorney general often
endorsed by organizations of police officers, opposes the measure
for the same reason he felt obliged to fire Sherrard:
Accountability to the people, he stresses, must reside with
elected, not appointed, officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that complicated,'' the mayor said in his office,
which is a tense, busy place as he reaches out to church, business
and civic leaders to treat what he sadly terms a traumatic wound.
``There's one person the chief has to make happy, and that's the
elected representative of the people. And that did not happen, so I
removed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's standoff with the police continues. The rate of
misdemeanor arrests has begun dropping as the police union, though
denying ``blue flu'' resentment, accuses the mayor of ruining
morale. The union, Chapter 6 of the Fraternal Order of Police, is
planning another street protest on March 17, this time with the
city permit it lacked last Friday. It is distributing hundreds of
``Armstrong's Wrong'' T-shirts to citizens, contending that the
will of the majority is being overridden by the mayor, not the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor fell to a whole lot of political pressure from part
of the black community,'' Rick McCubbin, Chapter 6 president,
contended in defending the valor awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reacted in a threatening situation and unfortunately took
a life,'' McCubbin said of the two officers. ``But they won, if you
will,'' he added, alluding to a grand jury inquiry that cleared
them of criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual initiative, however, the grand jurors
ordered the city to conduct a special investigation of police
procedures to answer a series of troubling questions, among them
why detectives waited more than a week before questioning residents
near the scene of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The alleyway incident, in which the officers said they fired as
the suspect prepared to run them over with a vehicle, followed the
beating and jailhouse death of a black suspect that heightened
complaints about the state of criminal justice here. The trial of a
jail guard on homicide charges is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of that case and continuing investigations
into the alleyway shooting, Armstrong felt blindsided by Sherrard's
decision on the valor awards, part of an annual list for 63
officers deemed to have been put at risk in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The chief let a month go by before telling City Hall, on the eve
of the awards dinner, causing chagrin in Armstrong, who had proudly
selected Sherrard for the top spot from the ranks of the department
14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible; it was a breach of trust,'' Armstrong said
of the award decision, emphasizing the highly delicate state of
affairs in this city of 269,000 people, of whom 70 percent are
white and 30 percent black. (The police force is 16 percent black.)
</P>
<P>
   As the furor grew, Sherrard apologized, saying, ``Unfortunately
I failed to anticipate some of the sentiment of the community.''
But the mayor, who, like Sherrard is white, decided the chief had
already demonstrated that he was more invested in the morale of his
rank and file than in the city's larger sensitivities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After he was fired, Sherrard was photographed proudly accepting
support at the headquarters of the union, which demanded his
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' the mayor said, ``is maybe a symptom of a small group
of folks on the force who have a culture. And this culture only
adds to the hostility of minorities who feel they are treated by
the police as second-class citizens, without respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Any doubter should drive in blackface in Louisville and ``find
out how often you're stopped,'' he advised, vowing to reform police
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sat on the sidelines and seen a lot of this stuff where
I couldn't make a decision,'' said Armstrong, referring to past
national criminal justice studies he took part in that focused on
race, police enforcement and accountability. Now that he is
directly responsible to the people, he said, his decision is firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't work in our city,'' he said of the valor awards.
``It's fundamentally wrong.''

SIGNS OF MORE SERIOUS FRAUD   SEEN IN BREAST CANCER STUDY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Mass., South Africa)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New details emerging from an investigation into research fraud
in a South African breast cancer study suggest that the deception
and violations of ethics were even more serious than initially
recognized, and may have included patients being given experimental
treatment without their knowledge or consent.
</P>
<P>
   The study, revealed last month to be fraudulent, had claimed
that bone-marrow transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy could
prolong the lives of women with advanced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The research was conducted by Dr. Werner Bezwoda of the
University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who presented it last
May in Atlanta at a major meeting of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology. Of five bone-marrow transplant studies presented
at that conference, Bezwoda's was the only one to show a benefit
for the grueling procedure. It was widely publicized and seen as a
ray of hope by many patients.
</P>
<P>
   But when American researchers visited Bezwoda's laboratory, in
preparation for trying his techniques here, they found that he had
falsified some of his data. Bezwoda admitted the deception, and the
study was discredited.
</P>
<P>
   Bezwoda, who had been highly respected and had trained many
other cancer specialists in his country, is to face a tribunal
Friday at the University of Witwatersrand, which will decide
whether he will be dismissed. Several American researchers who
audited his study are to testify at the tribunal, and a report of
their findings will be posted Friday on the Web site of a medical
journal, The Lancet, at www.thelancet.com.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the researchers said they could find no consent
forms for any patient, leaving open the question of whether the
women, who were mostly blacks, had given consent, known what drugs
they were receiving or even known that they were part of an
experiment. In addition, Bezwoda admitted that patients in the
study who were said to have been given a standard form of
chemotherapy for breast cancer were actually given a different,
less effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all based on a myth,'' said Dr. Raymond Weiss, an
oncologist and clinical professor of medicine at Georgetown
University, and one of the investigators. ``There are so many
problems with this research. We don't know whether the patients
exist, we don't know whether there was truly a study and, if there
was, we don't know that the patients knew it or that there was a
consent. It's a likelihood that no consents were signed and they
didn't know they were in a study.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said they were shocked by what they found. One
of them, Dr. F. Marc Stewart, chief of hematology and oncology at
the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in
Worcester, said: ``A number of us were transplant physicians. This
was not a group biased against transplantation. We were initially
excited to confirm the results, which we hoped would be verified.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before they left for Johannesburg, Weiss said, there
were warning signs. Bezwoda would permit the group only two days to
conduct their review, and allow only four researchers to visit. At
one point, he changed his mind and said they could not come at all.
He later relented. He took several months to provide the team a
copy of his research protocol, the plan for the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the protocol was written for our benefit, but who
knows,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems continued when the investigators arrived in
Johannesburg. Stewart said, ``The first concern was that we were
not permitted to see the charts of patients treated on the control
arm of the study.''
</P>
<P>
   Those women accounted for about half the patients. Some records
from the experimental group were also withheld, he said; Bezwoda
showed investigators charts for only 58 of 75 women in that group.
One of the charts, Weiss said, consisted of only a single page.
</P>
<P>
   Bezwoda repeatedly refused to provide the missing charts. Even
the charts they were allowed to see revealed problems, Stewart
said. For a study to be valid, the patients have to be clearly
defined in terms of age and diagnosis; otherwise, researchers will
be comparing apples and oranges, and the results will be
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Bezwoda's patients did not meet the criteria that he
had established for the study. ``In some cases, patients were older
than the protocol specified,'' Stewart said. ``In some cases the
disease stage did not correspond to the protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Cleaton-Jones, chairman of the university's committee
for research on human subjects, said Bezwoda had never cleared his
study with the committee. Cleaton-Jones, who graduated from medical
school with Bezwoda in 1967, said he could not imagine why his
classmate would falsify his work. ``I'm quite fascinated to try to
understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the university said that Bezwoda declined to
be interviewed. &QL;

RUN BY MCCAIN SWELLED GOP PRIMARY TURNOUT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Turnout for Republican presidential primaries hit
record highs in 12 of the 18 states that have held them so far, and
it was clearly a result of John McCain's candidacy, now suspended,
according to a new nonpartisan analysis of voting.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Democratic turnout was the second-lowest in 40
years. Only President Clinton's uncontested run for the nomination
in 1996 drew fewer voters to the polls, according to the analysis,
by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's analysis found that 13.6 percent of the
voting-age population had gone to the polls in Republican primaries
so far this year, up 4.3 percentage points from Republican
primaries in those states four years ago and the highest level of
Republican turnout since Sen. Barry Goldwater's primary campaign in
1964. The influence of McCain, who ran well among independents, was
apparent in the open and semiopen Republican primaries, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of this primary season,'' said Curtis Gans, the
committee's director, ``was McCain: McCain mobilizing alienated
independents and disaffected Democrats into Republican primaries;
McCain spawning an organizational counterrevolution'' by Christian
conservatives and Republican regulars ``who had vested their future
in Gov. George Bush.'' Moreover, Gans said, the five-week lull in
Democratic primaries between New Hampshire and Super Tuesday helped
McCain dominate the political news.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, turnout was 10.1 percent of the
voting-age population in the states that held primaries through
Super Tuesday, slightly higher than in 1996 but substantially below
previous levels _ for example, 25 percent lower than in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gans added that nothing in the primary season so far was
predictive of turnout this November. ``There was too much, and too
ill-founded, euphoria about the McCain-driven turnout increases,''
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three weeks ago, Polly Paez, a Mexican-American
woman with immense pride in her son, who is a federal judge in Los
Angeles, decided she had to do something to save his long-stalled
nomination to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paez, 76, called Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate's
second-ranking Democratic leader and a fellow member of the Mormon
Church, and asked him to reach out to the other Mormons in the
Senate and tell them her son was a good person and worthy of
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's what I did,'' Reid said on Thursday after the Senate
confirmed Judge Richard A. Paez by a vote of 59-39 to a seat on the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and
several western states. Four of the votes in favor of Paez were
cast by Mormons, three of them Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the votes of the Mormon Republicans were only one of
several factors behind the confirmation of Paez, which came after a
four-year delay.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Paez grew well beyond an ordinary dispute on
nominations. By the time the vote was taken late on Thursday, the
debate touched on a range of issues including presidential
politics, the political fund-raising scandals of 1996, whether
Senate Republicans were tougher on Hispanic and female nominees and
the ideology of the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Senate opponents of the nomination had criticized Paez as too
liberal, based on several of his rulings on the lower court. Many
of them had hoped to avoid a vote, fearing that colleagues who were
privately opposed to the nomination would vote to confirm Paez for
fear of offending Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore interrupted his campaign to fly back to
Washington from Detroit late Wednesday night in case his vote was
needed to break a tie on the Paez nomination. Gore's presence was
almost certainly not needed but it provided a flourish to the day
and his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists said that they had the votes without Gore
but that his presence had the effect of assuring that enough
Republicans would support the nomination to avoid giving him the
opportunity to make a heroic appearance. ``We sure weren't going to
let him come riding in on a horse to save the day,'' said one
senior Republican staff aide.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate also confirmed Marsha L. Berzon, a San
Francisco lawyer, to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Berzon had
waited more than two years for a vote. She was confirmed by a vote
of 64-34.
</P>
<P>
   After complaints last year from groups that presented statistics
showing that female and Hispanic candidates waited longer than
white male candidates, Sen. Trent Lott, the Senate Republican
leader, promised a vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations by
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' strategy was to collect at least six Republican
votes to add to the 45 from their own party. One of the ways to get
those votes, Reid said, was to ``play the Mormon card but also the
Hispanic card, the fairness card and any other card I could think
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said he had urged Mrs. Paez to come to Washington to lobby
on behalf of her son. ``But she's kind of ailing,'' Reid said. ``So
she asked me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He lobbied fellow Mormons and several Republican senators: Orrin
G. Hatch and Robert F. Bennett of Utah, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon,
and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho. Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, had long supported the Paez nomination. Of that group,
only Crapo voted against the Paez nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said that when he telephoned Judge Paez on Thursday to
congratulate him, he told him, ``Your mother really helped do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Paez declined to be interviewed but said in a statement
that he was grateful to his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against Judge Paez was led by Sens. Robert C. Smith
of New Hampshire and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Smith argued that the 9th Circuit was far too liberal and that
adding Judge Paez would increase its ideological tilt. Sessions
argued that Judge Paez should be denied a seat on the court because
he had accepted a plea agreement that allowed John Huang, a central
figure in the Democratic fund-raising scandals, to avoid going to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions asserted that Judge Paez had also flouted federal
sentencing guidelines in the case, suggesting that he had been
lenient with Huang in order to help promote his candidacy for the
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is the ranking
member of the Judiciary Committee, ridiculed the charge. Leahy said
that the case had been randomly assigned to Judge Paez and that all
he did was accept a plea bargain approved by the prosecution and
the probation service.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton celebrated the confirmations
but lamented how long it had taken for both candidates to be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to repeat that dozens of other qualified judicial
nominees still await confirmation,'' he said. ``Meanwhile, case
loads rise and backlogs mount.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton said many nominees were being held up because of
election-year politics. Democrats like Leahy complain that the
traditional slowdown in confirmations before a presidential
election has been started far too early by the Republicans.
Republicans dispute suggestions that they have slowed the process
in hope of preserving as many vacancies as possible in case they
retake the White House.

<P>
   Stock market regulators censured and fined Prudential Securities
Inc. $100,000 on Thursday over allegations that the company tried
to avoid competing on price to manage a 1996 initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory arm of the National Association of Securities
Dealers had contended that Prudential had asked a regional
investment bank, Friedman Billings Ramsey, to step aside as lead
manager of the $60 million public offering and instead accept a
secondary role to Prudential. Because Prudential planned to charge
more than Friedman Billings, Prudential's plan would have cost the
issuer, a California mortgage lender, about $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman Billings, which is based in Arlington, Va., refused to
do so, kept its fee at 6 percent rather than the 7 percent
Prudential would have charged, and won the deal, according to the
NASD.
</P>
<P>
   In paying the fine, Prudential, one of Wall Street's largest
securities firms, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing on the
NASD's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been firmly committed to closely following all
rules and regulations of the NASD,'' Prudential said in a
statement. ``We are pleased to have put this matter behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement between Prudential and the NASD highlights one of
Wall Street's great ironies. The securities firms that form the
nerve center of American capitalism hate to cut their prices, and
nowhere is that fact more apparent than in the lucrative business
of underwriting initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Wall Street has charged companies a standard fee of
7 percent to sell their shares to the public. Only one in five
companies pays an underwriting fee of less than 7 percent, and the
percentage of issuers that pays less has decreased in recent years,
even as the average size of new offerings has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies are paying more money than ever in
underwriting fees. In 1999, initial public offering fees totaled
almost $5 billion, up from $1.3 billion in 1991, according to
Thomson Financial Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly that firms ought to compete in this area
on all terms _ price and quality of service,'' said Barry
Goldsmith, executive vice president of enforcement for NASD
Regulation. ``The conduct here certainly has the potential to
thwart that free and open competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman Billings declined to comment on the case, which
involved the June 1996 underwriting of First Alliance Corp., a
company in Irvine, Calif., that specializes in making mortgage
loans to people with bad credit. According to the NASD, First
Alliance decided to sell shares to the public in late 1995 and
began to interview securities firms to pick a lead underwriter, a
process known as a beauty contest.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street firms typically underwrite offerings in teams,
the lead underwriter, or manager, of the offering has primary
responsibility for selling the offering and reaps much of the fees
and profit. Traditionally, firms in a beauty contest compete on
their ability to find buyers for the offering and the skills of
their research analysts, who will cover the company after it is
public. They do not compete on price.
</P>
<P>
   But First Alliance, which felt it was a strong company in a hot
market sector, did not want to pay the usual 7 percent fee,
according to the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real easy IPO, and the market was responsive at that
point too,'' said Brian Chisick, chairman and chief executive of
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   So, in February 1996, First Alliance appointed Friedman
Billings, which had agreed to charge a 6 percent fee, and
Prudential, which had stuck with the traditional rate, as
co-managers of the offering. Then First Alliance told Prudential
that Prudential could be lead manager if it cut its fee to 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Prudential would not cut its fee, the NASD contended.
Instead, Prudential repeatedly tried to get Friedman Billings to
defer to it and accept a co-manager position, with Prudential
leading the deal and charging 7 percent. If Friedman Billings ``had
agreed to Prudential's requests, it would have effectively taken
itself out of consideration for the lead,'' the NASD said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman Billings refused to back down and eventually managed
the First Alliance offering as sole underwriter for a 6 percent
fee.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was completed in July 1996, raising $59.5 million
for First Alliance. Of that, $3.57 million went to the
underwriters, $595,000 less than would have been charged if
Prudential had led the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to Friedman Billings, and they said they would do it
for 6 percent, and we were delighted,'' Chisick said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, First Alliance's stock nearly doubled. Since
then, it has fallen more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of underwriting fees has caught the attention of the
Justice Department, which disclosed last year that it had opened an
investigation into ``the possibility of anticompetitive practices''
at leading Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, and Goldman, Sachs. The investigation is under
way, a Justice Department spokeswoman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts said the 7 percent fee is fair, given the costs
of managing an initial public offering and the difficulty of
pricing a stock and finding the right buyers for a company.
</P>

   Investment firms compete on the basis of ``how much time are you
going to commit to due diligence and drafting the documents and
helping to articulate a growth story,'' said Scott Sipprelle, the
former head of U.S. equity capital markets for Morgan Stanley and
the founder of Midtown Research, a New York firm that specializes
in investing in newly public companies. ``I would argue strongly
that 7 percent is not excessive.''

IMPROPER MEDICARE PAYMENTS ROSE SLIGHTLY IN '99 TO $13.5 BILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Ill.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Improper Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals
and other health care providers increased slightly last year, after
falling sharply in 1997 and 1998, federal investigators said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services, said the improper payments cost the government
$13.5 billion last year, up slightly from $12.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In previous reports, Brown estimated that improper payments cost
Medicare $23.2 billion in 1996 and $20.3 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Brown said
the government had resolved ``a lot of the easier problems'' in its
campaign against Medicare waste, fraud and abuse. ``It will take
some intensive work'' to reduce errors further, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Brown said, about 8 percent of all payments in the
traditional fee-for-service Medicare program were improper. The
error rate appears to have leveled off, after dropping to 7.1
percent in 1998, from 14 percent in 1996 and 11 percent in 1997,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare provides care for 39 million people who are elderly or
disabled. Every dollar saved is another dollar that can be used for
new benefits like prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that 75 percent of the improper Medicare payments
last year went to four kinds of providers: hospitals, which
accounted for $3.6 billion, doctors at $3 billion, suppliers of
medical equipment accounting for $1.8 billion and home health care
agencies, also responsible for $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes, hospices, kidney dialysis centers and medical
laboratories received a total of $2.2 billion in improper payments
last year, the inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she suspected that fraud accounted for ``a small
proportion'' of the improper payments. But she emphasized that the
audit focused only on billing mistakes. ``If a doctor's signature
has been forged or if a roomful of medical records was
fabricated,'' she said, ``we would not necessarily detect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care providers need to improve the documentation of
claims, Brown said, and Medicare officials should make more
aggressive efforts to collect debts owed to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Payments were classified as improper if, for example, there was
no medical record to justify a treatment, if the service was not
performed or if the treatment was not covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not scrutinize payments to health maintenance
organizations. Brown and other officials have repeatedly said that
Medicare is overpaying HMOs. The managed care industry disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said Medicare payments were often
excessive but not illegal. He held up a syringe and said Medicare
buys it for $2.93 while the Department of Veterans Affairs pays
$1.89. For a bag of saline solution, he said, the disparity is even
greater, $7.90 as against $2.38.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore often says the Clinton administration has
reduced fraud and improved service to the public with a seven-year
effort to ``reinvent government.''
</P>
<P>
   But in response to a question at Thursday's hearing, Brown said
the White House Office of Management and Budget had rejected her
request for $15 million to have federal auditors work year-round at
the insurance companies that review and pay Medicare claims for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was inspector general of the Defense Department from
1987 to 1989, said the Pentagon regularly assigned auditors to work
in the offices of large military contractors. But, she said,
``there has been virtually no audit oversight'' of Medicare
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recently told Medicare officials to improve supervision
of the contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, former president of the American Medical
Association, criticized the inspector general's testimony as
``irresponsible grandstanding.'' Dickey said doctors wanted to
comply with Medicare rules, but had difficulty because the rules
were as complex as the tax code. Moreover, Dickey said, the
propriety of Medicare payments often involves subtle questions
about whether a test or a procedure is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, the federal agency that runs Medicare,
said the improper payments to doctors often involved simple
questions: ``Did you see a patient, or did you not? Did you perform
the service, or did you not?''
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said she would soon establish a toll-free telephone
service to answer doctors' questions about billing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said more ``criminal prosecutions may
be the appropriate therapy'' for providers who intentionally
overcharge Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association also raised questions about the
statistical methods used by the inspector general to estimate
improper payments. Brown said the latest estimate was based on a
review of 5,223 claims for $5.4 million worth of services provided
to 600 beneficiaries, and she insisted that the sample was
``statistically valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said officials did not have adequate control over the huge
amounts of cash that flowed through Medicare every day. For
example, she said, a bank in Chicago has routinely withdrawn more
money from the Federal Reserve system than it needs to pay Medicare
contractors. In a recent 11-day period, she said, the excessive
withdrawals ranged from $100 million to $420 million a day, and the
bank earned more than $700,000 in interest by investing the money
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials told the bank to stop the practice, but bank
officials believed that they were entitled to this ``perquisite,''
Brown said.

CAREW: NO RESPECT FROM ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Former Angels hitting coach Rod Carew walked
onto the field at Tempe Diablo Stadium Thursday morning and
immediately was greeted by Angels staff members and players. Now
the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, Carew smiled and
hugged his way to the visiting dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But Carew hasn't completely gotten over being let go by the
Angels after last season, his eighth with the club. It wasn't so
much that new manager Mike Scioscia decided to bring in his own
staff, including Mickey Hatcher as the hitting coach, but how he
was let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that bothered me the most was the way
(general manager Bill) Stoneman went about it,'' Carew said. ``It
was like it was no big deal, like when they retired me in '85. I
walked away bitter in '85 but this time I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Carew said he has never spoken with Stoneman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to call to find out what was going on,'' Carew said.
``They didn't give me a courtesy call, I had to call them. At least
they could have given me some respect. That's all anybody wants.
But that's water under the bridge. It's a business, it's something
I have to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a call from Baseball Operations,'' said Angels
spokesman Tim Mead. ``(Assistant GM) Ken Forsch called him. We all
appreciate everything Rodney did. It was a difficult off-season to
say the least. We've all moved on. He's in a good situation now.
Our staff feels the same way about our current staff. Change is not
an indictment of individuals. It's just change.''
</P>
<P>
   Carew said he likes his new situation with the Brewers, but it
wasn't easy to end his tenure with the Angels after last year's
debacle when the offense was last in the league in runs and batting
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I would have liked to stay was because of
what we went through last year,'' Carew said. ``Nobody wants to
leave on a sour note after what happened to the offense. Nobody
wants to walk away from an opportunity to correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn returned to camp Thursday and was back in the starting
lineup after missing Wednesday's game because of a corneal abrasion
to his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something fell in the room,'' Vaughn said. ``I woke up in the
morning and I had particles in my eye. I'm all right. I'm at full
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has been staying at his aunt's house in the area, which
got manager Mike Scioscia to suggest Vaughn buy his aunt a new
house. Responded Vaughn: ``She's got a new house! She's waiting for
me to leave so she can sell this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn not only went 1 for 2 with an RBI in the game, but he
stole second base with a head-first slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo Vaughn thinks he can steal bases, he takes it as a personal
affront when they play behind him,'' manager Mike Scioscia said.
``He says 'You guys don't know I'm an athlete.' He wants guys to at
least play him honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he likes Vaughn's passion for the game, but he
said he told Vaughn he doesn't want Vaughn to risk an injury by
diving into the bag. And since Vaughn hasn't stolen a base in a
regular season game since 1997, Scioscia said he got the base and
presented it to Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this is your first and last stolen base this season,''
Scioscia said. ``He didn't like that part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn has a strained muscle in his right side, just
below the rib cage, and is the same injury he had last year that
cause him to miss seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he won't be out as long this time, but a timetable for
his return hasn't been determined. And it certainly won't help his
case in trying to win a spot in the starting rotation, which is why
he didn't tell anyone when he first felt pain in his first start
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what it was but I didn't say anything because I
knew they wouldn't let me pitch,'' Washburn said. ``I wanted to see
if I could pitch with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't. In his second start, Washburn walked four in 2 2/3
innings, giving up three runs and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it (his side) on every pitch,'' Washburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Brian Cooper gave up six runs and four hits in
two innings in the Angels' 7-6 win over the Brewers at Tempe Diablo
Stadium. He didn't get help from second baseman Justin Baughman,
whose two errors led to two unearned runs. Outfielder Mike
Colangelo drove in the game-winner in the bottom of the ninth,
scoring Orlando Palmeiro from second with a single to right field.
Tim Salmon hit a three-run homer in the third inning for the Angels
(3-3). ... Pitcher Tim Belcher threw off the mound Thursday for the
first time this spring. Coming off surgery to repair a torn muscle
in his right elbow, Belcher threw to a catcher who was standing up
in front of the plate. ... Outfielder Jeff DaVanon, who has a torn
labrum in his left shoulder, will have surgery next Friday and will
will miss most of the season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain, whose powerful insurgency
became the surprise of the presidential primary season, on Thursday
ended his maverick bid for the Republican nomination with the hope
that he would eventually prevail in ``making our party as big as
the country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after being defeated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush in
primaries from coast to coast, the Arizona senator, standing with
striated mountains and the glorious Verde Valley as his backdrop,
acknowledged that no matter how many crossover voters he had
attracted, he was not the preference of the majority in his own
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore I announce today, on this fine Arizona morning and
in this beautiful place, that I am not longer an active candidate
for my party's nomination for president,'' McCain said, his wife,
Cindy, at his side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had gracious words for Bush, congratulating him but
stopping short of endorsing him. The senator also said he would not
``walk away from'' his fight for reform, adding: ``What is good for
my country is good for my party. Should our party ever abandon this
principle, the American people will rightly abandon us, and we will
surely slip into the mists of history, deserving the allegiance of
none.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made his announcement only an hour after former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey withdrew from the Democratic race. Their
decisions brought an abrupt end to the primary season and set the
stage for what promises to be a costly and bitter battle between
Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Colorado, congratulated McCain ``for
fighting the good fight'' and called the senator's concession
``gracious.'' The governor also said he had a short telephone
conversation with McCain. He said there was no timetable for longer
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us have just come off a tough campaign,'' Bush said,
``John needs some time to think. I need some time. But I believe
that when it's all said and done that we can have a good
dialogue,'' Bush said. ``I intend to talk with him at his
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone call followed a series of back-door conversations
between supporters of Bush and Washington-based supporters of
McCain. It began what many Republicans hope will be a process of
reconciliation that could lead to McCain's eventual endorsement of
Bush and allow the Republican nominee to hold on to many of the
independents and new voters that had flocked to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But the hurdles for the party go beyond the personal
rapprochement needed after such a bitter campaign. With McCain
insisting that he would continue his fight for reform, he and Bush
will have to bridge fundamental differences between their agendas,
in particular McCain's advocacy of overhauling the campaign finance
system and his support of a tax cut plan that is at odds with
Republican orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they thought avenues of compromise could
emerge.``There's no way you're going to be able to meld everything
Bush said and McCain said and get a broth that's eatable,'' said
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is close to McCain and who has been
working to smooth the way for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question you'll have to sand off the edges to fit
it,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also seemed to leave open the option of using his 231
delegates, from seven state delegations as a force to press for
changes in the party platform at the Republican National Convention
this summer. Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said the
senator was keeping an organization together to ``maintain contact
with our delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will press for measures that are germane for reform,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis downplayed any idea that platform fight would be
necessary and and spoke like a loyal Republican of the necessity of
defeating Gore.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCain's candidacy turned out to be the surprise of the primary
season as he went from obscurity to political phenomenon, drawing
Democrats and independents and winning the New Hampshire primary by
a landslide. He appealed to voters hungry for change with his
compelling biography as a former prisoner of war in Vietnam and his
promises that ``I will never lie to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while he looked like he might defeat Bush despite the
governor's advantage in resources and establishment support. But as
the campaign became more brutal, McCain began to lose his appeal to
members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   His hopes of carrying California and New York disappeared
Tuesday when he was only able to prevail in New England.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made his speech stepping out of the race and had his
first contact with Bush on Thursday only after two days of talks
between the Bush and McCain camps, conversations that bypassed
McCain's immediate campaign staff, who have been more combative
than some of the senator's Washington allies.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans close to the two sides said Sen. Paul Coverdell of
Georgia, who is a prominent Bush backer, conferred with Hagel while
Karl Rove, Bush's senior strategist, consulted with Kenneth
Duberstein, a former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan and
a member of McCain's kitchen cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning before McCain delivered his statement in
Arizona, Rove was told by Duberstein ``you'll like what you hear,''
according to Republican who supported Bush. But he was also told
that it was too early to suggest or broker a visit. McCain was
leaving immediately for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCain did not rule out a future endorsement but
said that Bush would have to take steps towards some of McCain's
agenda, such as campaign finance overhaul and a dedication to
shoring up Social Security to win the senator's support.
</P>
<P>
   Davis on Thursday characterized the reconciliation as a
step-by-step process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step was to take ourselves of the nominating
process,'' he said. ``That way it was clear to the Bush campaign
that they can save their resources and their efforts toward winning
the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Thursday several times publicly sent signals that he
understood McCain's significance by linking the senator to reform.
Of McCain's supporters, he said, ``What's going to win his
supporters over is when they realize Al Gore is no reformer and Al
Gore is no John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain put a damper on speculation that he would mount a
third-party candidacy, saying ``I love my party. It is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   He also implored all the new and untraditional voters who had
come to his side, ``Promise me that you will never give up that you
will continue your service in the worthy cause of revitalizing our
democracy, Our crusade will never accomplish all its goals if your
voices fall silent in the national debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the surest sign that McCain's wild ride was over, the
ever accessible candidate ended his speech and departed without
taking any questions.

TUFTS TO BEGIN MODEL CLIMATE-CHANGE STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tufts University is about to launch a groundbreaking three-year
study on the effects of climate change in Eastern Massachusetts, an
area that Thursday set an all-time high daily temperature for
March.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the project
will examine how a warming planet, from rising sea levels to
increasingly erratic weather, affects vital water, sewer, highway,
and other infrastructure systems that serve the city and
metropolitan region. The $900,000 study may serve as a national
model for the potential effects of climate change on coastal
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warming of the Earth's atmosphere could have a profound
effect on every aspect of life in the metropolitan Boston area,''
said Mindy Lubber, the acting EPA New England administrator.
``Tunnels, communications lines, power plants, buildings, sewers,
water systems, and every possible physical structure in the region
could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Lubber said the project will begin finding out what these
impacts might be and how the region can plan accordingly to
minimize the risks and possible damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufts, which is teaming with Boston University on the study,
will begin work at a March 24 meeting on its Medford, Mass. campus
of university researchers, government officials, and industry
leaders. The study comes amid a surge of new findings on global
warming and climate change. By some accounts, the planet has warmed
as much as 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, and will
warm by another 2 to 8 degrees in the next.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week alone, the Worldwatch Institute reported that
the planet's glaciers, icecaps, and sea ice are melting at the
fastest rate since the start of record-keeping 150 years ago. The
EPA reported that America's industrial air emissions, which fuel
global warming, rose 0.5 percent from 1997 to 1998 despite efforts
to reduce them. The European Union proposed an international
emissions trading system to combat global warming.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the world's blueprint for solving global
warming _ the Kyoto Protocol _ remains stalled. The agreement was
signed in 1997 by more than 150 countries, including the United
States, calling for a range of emissions reductions by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The countries must ratify the agreement for it to take effect,
and by a complicated formula, ratification by the United States is
pivotal. But the White House has yet to submit it to the US Senate
for ratification, as the Senate has made it clear it will reject
it, arguing that it fails to impose emissions reductions on
developing countries like China.
</P>
<P>
   But as those developments suggest, much of the news about global
warming, and the research on which it is based, tends to be global
in nature. The Tufts study stands out in focusing on a specific
metropolitan region, reflecting a need for more information of that
kind as well as the reality that most Americans now live in urban
and suburban areas, and by 2050, most of the world will.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's important that we begin to think about the impacts of
climate change on these areas,'' said Paul Kirshen, a research
associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at
Tufts. He is overseeing a team of 15 researchers on the study, the
first he said of its kind in the country. The Metropolitan Area
Planning Council is also assisting.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshen said the study will focus on such potential problems as
the vulnerability of tall buildings to howling winds and rising
water tables, the latter weakening foundations. Those winds may
also blow down transmission towers and lines, jeopardizing energy
supplies. As the heat rises, so too may heat related health
problems from asthma to insect infestation. More wet, stormy
weather may result in more frequent transportation delays and
overwhelm sewer systems already stressed by those rising water
tables, which could seep more water into sewer lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People may react differently in a warmer city, exacerbating some
of those physical impacts, and that too will be studied, Kirshen
said. For instance, the warmer the weather, the more water and
energy people use. ``So the infrastructure may get it in two ways _
the physical impacts, and the social and economic impacts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't address these issues, the price we pay may be
huge,'' said Lubber, of the EPA. ``Disruptions to infrastructure
can be costly, as we in the Boston area learned during the flood of
1996. This extreme weather caused $70 million in property damage
and disrupted transportation for thousands of people. (Boston's
``Big Dig'') Central Artery project has shown us that the costs of
modifying and repairing our infrastructure can be exorbitant.''

New York's Republican presidential primary system ``absolute
nonsense,'' Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican leader of the State
Senate, called Thursday for top-to-bottom reform, making ballots
easier to understand, and making it simpler for candidates to get
on the ballot. Voters said they had difficulty understanding the
Republican primary ballot, which showed delegates' names in large

negative news about Sotheby's and Christie's since the federal
antitrust investigation heated up last month has left many
wondering what these auction houses will have to sell at their
important spring sales. So Christie's was eager to send out the
word that one of the stars of its sale of Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist works on May 8 will be what it calls the most
important Caillebotte ever to reach the auction block: ``Man on the
Balcony, Boulevard Haussmann'' (1880). (Christie's/The New York

daguerreotype images he made of her for his exhibiton at
Pace/MacGill. ``I have always attempted to create images that

DAGUERREOTYPE-ART-1 -- The artist Chuck Close, left, and the
daguerreotypist Jerry Spagnoli prepared to photograph a model in
Spagnoli's Chelsea studio. In Spagnoli's opinion, a daguerreotype
is not a photograph at all but an ``optical system'' involving the
plate, the viewer and light. ``The closer you get to a
daguerreotype, the more you see,'' said Spagnoli. ``In some ways
it's the opposite of a painting, which breaks down into brush
strokes.'' (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times) *LITE

everyone, particularly those who work in it, feel less than they

The Spotlight 29 Casino owned by the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of

Casino Resorts Inc. announced that it has signed a letter of intent
with the owners to take over the management of the casino. The

Overcoming resistance from Republican conservatives but not

make their New York recital debuts singing chamber music. Yet that
is what Vivica Genaux, 30, an American mezzo-soprano, plans to do
Monday evening at Weill Recital Hall. Then again, little about
Genaux's career has been conventional. She has hurtled from her
1994 professional debut at the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee to a
dramatic debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1997 and regular

gray. But the voice - the rolling baritone, with its sense of droll
self-deprecation - is undiminished in strength or clarity. On the

FAA TO CONSULT AIRLINES ON AVOIDING TRAFFIC DELAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After huge numbers of air traffic delays last
summer, the Clinton administration has decided to take a markedly
different approach this year: asking the airlines what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than deciding on its own how to handle thunderstorms and
other problems, the Federal Aviation Administration will consult
with the airlines every two hours, with conference calls and
computer hookups. The federal government will also open military
airspace off the East Coast, try to route more planes over Canada
and use a new computer system to get hourly updates on how many
planes the airlines want to fly, rather than the semimonthly
updates it gets now.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Jane F. Garvey, the FAA administrator, and
representatives of airlines, the air traffic controllers' union,
and the pilots' union are to announce the changes on Friday at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are going to be much more involved in the
decision making,'' said John Hotard, a spokesman for American
Airlines. ``That can only improve the situation we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines and the agency say that in addition to fewer
delays, this ``collaborative decision making'' will give airlines a
clear idea of delays hours in advance, so they can tell passengers
well before boarding time how late a flight will probably be. With
more realistic expectations, people involved in announcing the
changes say, the airlines may also choose to cancel flights early,
rather than load passengers, push back from the gate and wait for
hours, then and finally cancel anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said that the agency and the airlines were showing
unaccustomed signs of flexibility. The airlines fear that extensive
delays will prompt expensive ``passenger rights'' legislation, one
participant said, and the agency is eager to avoid further
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Last July the FAA recorded 45,162 air traffic delays, up 76
percent from the level the year before. The agency blamed weather
and new equipment. April, May and August 1999 were also far worse
than those months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Garvey, speaking at a conference here on Wednesday, warned
that the changes planned for this summer were ``not the silver
bullet.'' What the system really needs is more modernization, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, the agency predicted continued strong growth
in air traffic. About 4,300 large passenger jets are registered in
this country, plus 1,000 big planes carrying freight, express
packages and mail. Other experts say, however, that air traffic
could be reduced if the price of oil stays high.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials would not comment on details of the plan Thursday,
in advance of the scheduled announcement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But an important part of the plan, according to airline managers
and others involved in the planning, is to have the major airlines
negotiate with the agency in six or eight daily sessions of
conference calls and Web links to deal with detours and delays
required by bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it runs now, they just dictate to us,'' said one
airline manager who has been involved in the planning for the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to officials at the agency and the airlines, they
will develop a consensus about detour routes and delays. If a long
north-south line of thunderstorms developed, under the current
system, the FAA would probably shift all traffic around it in one
direction, say, to the north, creating a traffic jam in the sky,
according to air traffic experts. Under the new method, some
airlines might propose diverting south, or, using better weather
information that they would share with the agency, finding a hole
to fly through.
</P>
<P>
   Another change involves centralizing authority in the FAA so
that its System Command Center in Herndon, Va., has more power to
direct each of the 20 main traffic control centers to accept more
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the changes will take effect on Sunday, though
others are still under development. Many changes are related to
thunderstorms or the threat of such storms, which last summer
disrupted air traffic as the FAA held planes on the ground in
anticipation of bad weather en route. In some cases, the bad
weather did not develop, air traffic control experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the points to be announced, participants said, are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency and the airlines will develop forecasts based on
weather reports available to the airlines as well as those
available to the agency, and both parties will follow up through
the day to ensure that they are not reacting to forecast storms
that fail to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   _ If disruptive thunderstorms develop, the Defense Department,
principally the Navy, will promptly relinquish control of a slice
of its airspace off the East Coast, for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   _ When thunderstorms restrict air routes, some jetliners will be
offered routes at 18,000 feet and below for extended periods, even
though this burns more fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines and the FAA will have to plan ahead to use low-altitude
routes, because in many cases it will require loading extra fuel
before takeoff or removing some cargo or passengers.

 (ATTN: Colo., Utah, Wyo.)  
 WITH McCAIN GONE, BUSH JUST PLOWS AHEAD  
(lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEYENNE, Wyo. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas briskly returned
to the campaign trail Thursday as if his competition had not
withered away, seeking to sustain the momentum from his climactic
victories on Tuesday and hone his attacks on Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, mindful that a languid start in the general election was
the undoing of some past presidential nominees, courted voters in
three states that hold primaries on Friday _ Colorado, Utah and
Wyoming _ even though victories are assured in this conservative
region.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made a brief call to Sen. John McCain after McCain
announced Thursday that he was suspending his campaign. Bush
thanked him for making what the governor termed a gracious exit
from the race, but the two men did not discuss holding some sort of
peace parley, Bush aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain did not indicate whether he would campaign for
Bush _ or even endorse him _ Bush had only kind words for McCain on
Thursday, hoping to heal the wounds from an unexpectedly fractious
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate so very much the competition and the hard work he
put into the campaign,'' Bush said of McCain at a rally before
several hundred people at the airport in Provo, Utah. ``I
appreciate his commitment to reform.'' He paused, and then
continued, ``The best reform for America, the best reform for this
country, is to end the Clinton-Gore era in Washington D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters Thursday how he would win over McCain
supporters who might harbor resentment from the primary, Bush spoke
of his own credentials as a reformer, while ridiculing Gore's
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose an issue that McCain found had strong appeal with
independents: campaign-finance reform. And as he had with McCain,
Bush tried to turn the issue against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and McCain favor a ban on the largely unregulated
political contributions known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that even as Gore was calling for such a ban, the
vice president and his aides were planning an aggressive effort to
collect such donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's not going to be fooled by the difference between
rhetoric and reality,'' Bush said at a rally at the Denver Broncos'
training facility in Englewood, Colo. ``We are not going to be
fooled by somebody who says one thing and goes out and absolutely
does something else. He must think that we have amnesia. He must
think that we have forgotten Buddhist temples and fund-raising
scams.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was using a strategy popular among politicians who oppose a
broad overhaul of the campaign-finance laws: questioning why
proponents of the measures do not voluntarily live by the proposals
they are espousing. The Democratic response to such attacks has
also been typical: that it would be political suicide to
unilaterally reject such fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a less far-reaching plan that would ban soft-money
donations from corporations and unions, but not from individuals.
At a news conference Thursday, he brushed aside a question about
why he did not voluntarily refrain from raising corporate and labor
soft money, given his backing for such a ban. Instead, he repeated
his criticism of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign said in a statement that Bush was trying to
shift attention from his tactics in the Republican primary.
Christopher Lehane, a Gore campaign spokesman, renewed Gore's call
for a soft-money ban and for debates between the two candidates
twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's attack is a wily attempt to avoid fallout from John
McCain's complaint about possible illegal campaign spending,''
Lehane said. ``George Bush opposes real campaign-finance reform. He
is flouting all the campaign spending limits currently on the
books. And his millionaire friends spent big bucks on negative TV
ads to bash John McCain.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his comments Thursday, Bush also promoted a measure, long
popular with Republicans, that would bar unions from making
political contributions without their members' consent. The measure
is anathema to Democrats, who receive the lion's share of labor
donations. Republicans have often cited the Democrats' opposition
as evidence of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have true reform, we must say to the union bosses,
you can't spend union people's money without their permission,''
Bush said.

MICROSOFT SEEKS SHARE OF VIDEOGAME MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an ambitious step beyond its stronghold in personal
computing, Microsoft Corp. is announcing plans Friday to challenge
Sony, Nintendo and Sega with a videogame machine called the X-Box.
</P>
<P>
   At an industry conference in San Jose, Calif., Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, will sketch out his company's plans to
capture a sizable share of the $20 billion-a-year worldwide
videogame market.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Microsoft, a name synonymous with software, has
pretty much limited its forays into hardware to keyboards and mice.
The X-Box is more ambitious _ basically a powerful personal
computer customized to function as a very powerful videogame
console with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   A latecomer to the videogame market, Microsoft is hoping it can
persuade game developers, most of whom already design games for PCs
and video consoles, to add designs for the X-Box. It will argue
that they will be working with familiar technology _ Pentium or
Pentium clone hardware and an operating system based on its
industry-standard Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic message to developers is that the basic systems in
this machine will be personal computer technology,'' said Robbie
Bach, who will be vice president of a new games division at
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But the videogame business is very different from the personal
computer industry. And Microsoft's move is the start of what
promises to be a multibillion-dollar effort over the next few years
to become a leader in digital home entertainment _ a fast-growing
field in which the computer, the television and the Internet are
converging.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been increasingly positioning itself to address
that market, as it has earmarked markets beyond the personal
computer for future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Box fits squarely with how we've redefined this company
in the last year or so,'' said Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's
president and chief executive. ``We want to have the hot device
that people use in their family room on their TV that is linked to
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-Box will not go on sale until the fall of 2001. But
industry consultants who have been briefed by Microsoft are
impressed by the company's plans and technical specifications for
the machine. Running at 600 megahertz, its microprocessor will be
faster than all but the most powerful personal computers today.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would not say Thursday who would supply the chip, and
there have been reports that Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the
second-largest microprocessor maker for PCs, was the front-runner.
But one industry consultant said Thursday that Intel Corp., the
largest chip maker and the maker of Pentium processors, won the
design contest for the X-Box.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics chip for the X-Box, made by Nvidia Corp., is
extremely fast, able to process more than 300 million polygons a
second, which analysts said is well ahead of the Sony Playstation
2, which went on sale in Japan just last week. And the X-Box uses
Microsoft's game-development software technology, called DirectX.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Box has a DVD player that can play movies and
high-performance games, and a standard Ethernet network card for
high-speed Internet connections. Unlike the Sony Playstation 2, the
Microsoft X-Box also has a hard drive _ of eight gigabytes _ for
storing games or adding more audio to the sports, action and arcade
games popular with players.
</P>
<P>
   But whether a few technical advantages will give Microsoft any
edge over Sony, in particular, is uncertain. In the first four days
in Japanese stores, Sony sold more than 1 million Playstation 2
machines. The Playstation 2 is expected to go on sale in the United
States this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In videogame machines, a product generation comes every five
years or so. Microsoft has an opening as this generation of
products comes to market. Nintendo's new game player, Dolphin, is
expected to premier sometime next year. But Microsoft is arriving
late, and Sony holds a commanding position with nearly 60 percent
of the console market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big-time gamble for Microsoft,'' said Richard
Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford,
N.Y. ``But there are huge changes going on in the consumer market.
Microsoft can't afford to be left out of that, and it does not want
to depend just on the PC.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Microsoft has fielded people from around the company to work on
its consumer games effort. Starting last July, Rick Thompson, who
had led the company's hardware unit, split off a team of 20 people
to work on the X-Box initiative. J. Allard, one of the early
Internet advocates within Microsoft, has led the work on the
stripped-down operating system embedded in the X-Box. For graphics
work, Microsoft even tapped its research division, including Jim
Blinn, a leading computer graphics researcher who came from NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's PC games, like Age of Empires 2 and Flight
Simulator, will be included in the new games division. Ed Fries
will be the division's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the X-Box program is new terrain for Microsoft. ``The
technology is familiar, but the business model is not the PC model
at all,'' Bach said. ``This is a consumer product. Our view is that
technologies converge, but devices don't.''

plate, the viewer and light. ``The closer you get to a

it's the opposite of a painting, which breaks down into brush
strokes.'' (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times) *LITE

 _ SF CHRON  
 Ikea Experience Coming to the Bay Area  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It is rare that a single store opening is significant enough to
noticeably alter the way people shop.
<P>
   But it is also rare that a single store is as big as a Home
Depot, a Wal-Mart, a Safeway and an Old Navy combined.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Swedish home goods retailer Ikea opens a
274,000-square-foot megastore in Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   The store, decked out in the blue and yellow of the Swedish
flag, is the size of five football fields and surrounded by 9 acres
of parking. Starting April 12, shoppers will be able to buy
virtually everything for the home and office there, from armoires
to vases to flooring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ikea has three really big advantages,'' said Marc Friedman, a
retail consultant with McMillan/Doolittle. ``The stores are easy to
shop, they have the widest assortment you'll find and they're a
very good value. For much of what they carry, you can't find the
same things at a comparable price anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, including HomeLife, J.C. Penney and Cost Plus, will
be looking over their shoulders as Ikea enters the $2.2 billion
local home-goods market.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea's prices are low because its furniture tends to be made
from low-cost materials and is sold ready-to-assemble, meaning that
shoppers buy a boxed set of pieces they put together at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea can also buy merchandise from its suppliers more cheaply
than smaller competitors and pass the savings along to shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, where Ikea was founded in 1943, these advantages have
translated into an astonishing 30 percent share of spending on
furniture and home goods.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Ikea to attain a comparable share in the United
States, a much larger and more diverse market than Sweden
(population 9 million).
</P>
<P>
   But if other U.S. cities are any example, Ikea will take a
sizable chunk of sales here _ and bring a distinctly Scandinavian
aesthetic to many Bay Area homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, after just five years, Ikea has already become the
most popular furniture seller.
</P>
<P>
   Some 19.3 percent of local furniture shoppers made a purchase at
Seattle's lone Ikea store between September 1998 and August 1999,
according to a survey conducted for Ikea by Scarborough Research.
</P>
<P>
   The Bon Marche department store chain came in second with 18.5
percent; J.C. Penney, 16.5 percent; HomeLife, 13.4 percent; Pier 1,
11.8 percent; and Levitz, 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea's ascent has been rapid; one year earlier, it was third in
the line-up, according to Bjorn Bayley, the Seattle store's
co-owner and a past president of Ikea North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Emeryville store is expected to generate $55 million in
sales its first year and $100 million the second.
</P>
<P>
   But Ikea tends to make conservative forecasts. Sales at a
Chicago store that opened in November 1998 came in more than 50
percent above the projected $60 million in first-year sales. That
prompted the addition of 50,000 square feet to the existing
450,000-square-foot structure.
</P>
<P>
   In Emeryville, an extra 30,000 square feet are available for
future growth. Ikea is also negotiating for a site in East Palo
Alto and, if all goes well, it may open more Bay Area outlets down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kjellman, Ikea North America's chief executive, expects a
Bay Area market share of 5 to 6 percent in about three years. In
the future, probably after more stores have opened, the goal is as
high as 20 percent in the Bay Area and other major markets.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Ikea, which runs about 160 stores in 28
countries, is like the slow-and-steady tortoise in a race against
fast-growing, publicly traded retail hares.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Ikea opens just 10 to 12 stores around the world,
compared with the 200 stores Home Depot hopes to open worldwide
this year, financing its growth through cash flow, rather than
debt. It chooses sites carefully and rarely closes a store.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea even buys most of its sites rather than leasing, a
commitment that few retailers are willing to make. In Emeryville,
Ikea invested $46 million in its 15-acre property and building.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea's growth strategy is dictated by founder Ingvar Kamprad,
whose initials make up the first two letters of the acronym Ikea.
(The rest comes from Elmtyard, the farm where Kamprad grew up, and
Agunnaryd, his hometown.)
</P>
<P>
   Kamprad is determined to run Ikea his way, employing egalitarian
Swedish values and keeping an eye on the long term.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Ikea safe from potential acquirers who might feel
otherwise, Kamprad created a foundation that functions as a holding
company for Ikea and based the organization in the Netherlands,
where laws make takeovers nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ikea doesn't have public shareholders to answer to, it
can go into a new market, such as Russia, which it will enter this
month, and lose money for years. But it's all part of the strategy:
In the long run, such markets make tremendous contributions to both
sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Ikea operates just 13 stores and plans to
open no more than three new ones a year for the foreseeable future.
At this pace, the United States could exceed Germany as Ikea's
biggest market in five years. Eventually, the U.S. business, which
racked up $881 million in sales last year, could be 10 times that
size, said Kjellman.
</P>
<P>
   Retail experts downplay the impact of the Emeryville store on
local furniture merchants, at least in the near term. They say Ikea
tends to increase the amount spent on home furnishings in new
markets, so not every dollar spent there is a dollar taken from
another retailer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, retail consultant Steen Kantor, a past president of
Ikea North America, gives Ikea credit for popularizing duvets,
fluffy feather- or foam-filled comforters that have replaced
blankets on many American beds.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers have made money from duvets, not just Ikea,
Kantor said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman agrees that Ikea's high-profile grand opening and
continued advertising will generate more interest in home goods
generally. He estimates the Emeryville store will ring up around 3
percent of Bay Area furniture sales in its first year or two. ``But
if they create 2 to 3 percent growth, no one loses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that sales are diverted from other merchants, the
impact will be spread among many stores including Cost Plus,
HomeLife, J.C. Penney and small specialty stores, retail experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Petaluma's Scandinavian Designs, which sells ready-to-assemble
furniture in styles similar to Ikea's, appears to have the most to
lose. But Van Scotto, general manager, said his company has
successfully competed against Ikea in both Seattle and Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually more happy than not that they're here because
they expand awareness of RTA  &LR; (ready-to-assemble) furniture and
help people become more accepting of it,'' Scotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavian Designs, which operates eight stores in the Bay
Area, also offers more hands-on service and slightly more upscale
furniture than Ikea, Scotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea prides itself on its egalitarian Swedish values. Sales
associates, who the company insists on calling ``co-workers,'' make
a competitive hourly wage of $7.75 to $18 in the Bay Area, plus
medical, dental and vision coverage for both full-time and
part-time staff, said Michael O'Rourke, general manager of the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Ikea generated headlines by donating a full day's
sales to its employees. Tens of thousands of workers around the
world, from truck drivers to corporate presidents, received
identical payouts of close to $2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Ikea has stumbled more than once since opening its first U.S.
store in Philadelphia in 1985. In 1992, Ikea bought three Southern
California stores from a competitor called Stor cq &LR;   &LR; (after first
winning a copyright suit against Stor for knocking off Ikea's
concept).
</P>
<P>
   Those locations lost money for several years and, eventually,
one location was closed. The early '90s recession didn't help. ``If
Ikea had been public, we probably would have had to leave the
U.S.,'' Kjellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamprad also came under fire five years ago after a newspaper
revealed that he was actively involved in the Nazi Party in his
youth. Kamprad has publicly apologized and Ikea is now planning to
open a store in Israel.

   John Carlson, a conservative talk-show host who led the
successful campaign to persuade Washington state voters to pass an
anti-affirmative-action initiative in 1998, has been telling
friends that he plans to run for governor this fall, The Associated
Press reported. Carlson would run for the Republican nomination
against Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   One friend whom Carlson told of his plans was the state's
Republican chairman, Dale Foreman, who seemed irked: Foreman said
Thursday that he was going to run for the job. He said that Carlson
had told him he would support his candidacy. Carlson could not be

announcement next week.

<P>
   DIM HOPES
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons Sen. John McCain dropped out of the
presidential race was his impossible position in next week's
Southern primaries. New polls, most conducted before his defeats on
Tuesday, show how far behind he was. In Florida, he was behind Gov.
George W. Bush by 26 points, according to a McLaughlin and
Associates poll. A series of Mason-Dixon polls showed that in
Oklahoma he was behind by 48 points; in Mississippi, by 56 points;
and in Texas, Bush's home state, by 69 points.

   A third Hutchinson has entered the political arena. Jeremy
Hutchinson, the 26-year-old son of Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., won
a seat in the Arkansas House in a special election on Tuesday.
Hutchinson, a conservative Republican like his father, and his
uncle, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, also of Arkansas, is an investment

   Schumer Vows Fight for Money Laundering Bill
</P>
<P>
   Promising a ``fight on the floor of the Senate,'' Sen. Charles
E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said that he planned to ``toughen up''
legislation proposed by the Clinton administration to combat money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's main criticism of the proposal is that penalties
against offshore banks or countries would be left to the discretion
of the U.S. authorities rather than being set off automatically
when money-laundering abuses are uncovered. He said that an
effective policy required that suspect offshore banks be
automatically forbidden access to the U.S. banking system.

billion. With $1.2 trillion in assets, the new Deutsche Bank would
be second only to the forthcoming union between three of Japan's

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY MISSED THIS /  &UR; ALSO MOVING IN
THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to that premise of linking the sacred and
secular in everyday life. It's not just a message Moore preaches,
but one he himself lives out, whether walking on the beach with his
family, cooking a meal or visiting with friends. &LR; s &QR; 2K

``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;

<P>
   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edited by Tom Grimes (Hyperion, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DISH'' &QL; 
By Jeannette Walls (Spike, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the
columns of Walter Winchell in the 1920s and the gossip reporters
who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,
and leave the rest to the tabloids. &QL;

DEUTSCHE BANK ANNOUNCES MERGER PLANS WITH RIVAL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Declaring the era of ``Germany Inc.'' had
ended, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank AG outlined a radical
plan Thursday to merge with its main rival and spin off their
retail businesses serving 10 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Though its main elements were already known, Deutsche Bank's
planned combination with Dresdner Bank is one of the most
far-reaching overhauls for Germany's huge banks since the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It would also unravel the labyrinthine cross-holdings that have
bound together German banks and insurance companies, a move that
could accelerate the pace of corporate change in Europe's biggest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The headline for this is disentanglement and thus another
facet in the farewell from Germany Inc.,'' said Rolf-Ernst Breuer,
Deutsche Bank's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could have an impact on Germany's other big private
banks _ Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt and Hypovereinsbank AG in
Munich. Both would be far overshadowed by the Deutsche-Dresdner
colossus, and German newspapers were already carrying unconfirmed
reports that Commerzbank had become a takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Deutsche will essentially acquire Dresdner in a
stock exchange worth about $30 billion. With $1.2 trillion in
assets and operations around the globe, the new Deutsche Bank would
be second only to the forthcoming union between three of Japan's
biggest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Under a complex deal with the German insurance conglomerate
Allianz AG, which holds stakes in both banks, Deutsche will spin
off both banks' retail branch networks in a new entity that will be
called Bank 24. Allianz will then reduce its stake in the two banks
but acquire 49 percent of Bank 24. Allianz will also acquire
Deutsche's big mutual fund business, called DWS, as well as
Deutsche's own insurance subsidiary, Deutsche Herold.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Breuer told reporters and analysts Thursday, the bank
merger would make it possible to eliminate 16,000 jobs around the
world. About 5,900 jobs would be cut by reducing the number of
local branch offices in Germany, while most of the rest would come
from combining investment banking businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the bank merger would have little impact
on American banks, in part because Dresdner has little presence in
the United States. But the merger goes a long way toward solving
Deutsche's biggest problem, which is its huge and costly network of
retail branch offices across Germany.
</P>
<P>
   That network barely makes a profit, and analysts believe that
Dresdner's local branch operations are running substantial losses.
Both banks are suffering the same problem: a huge oversupply of
branches and cutthroat price competition from Germany's savings
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise is Deutsche Bank's decision to jettison the
entire retail business, only keeping enough control to be able to
still sell its own financial products through them.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives have speculated at length on this kind of
outcome, and Breuer himself has hinted strongly in recent weeks
that the rise of electronic banking over the Internet makes it far
less important now to serve customers through physical branch
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many analysts have been skeptical that Deutsche
would give up such a big stake, because it means losing control
over a distribution channel to millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's merger is the latest in a wave of bank consolidations
across Europe, from the merger of Banque National de Paris and
Paribas in France to deals in Spain, Belgium, Italy and
Scandinavia. Until Thursday, Germany had been behind most other
countries even though the banking market here is extremely crowded.
Though experts and industry executives have agreed that mergers are
the only possible source of relief, the four big private banks have
spent years wrestling over who would cede control.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the deal Thursday was a ``merger of equals.'' But
Deutsche Bank is clearly in charge. Though the exact exchange ratio
was not set, Deutsche shareholders will own between 60 percent and
64 percent of the company and Dresdner shareholders will own the
rest. The new bank will be called Deutsche Bank but will use
Dresdner's green logo. Dresdner's chief executive, Bernhard Walter,
will share the top post with Breuer.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both banks soared when news of the merger surfaced
Tuesday. But Dresdner shares fell 11 percent Thursday and Deutsche
shares fell almost 13 percent as investors assessed the
cost-cutting plans.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer predicted that the combined bank would be able to save
about $2.9 billion a year, though that figure was considerably more
optimistic than some investment analysts had calculated.  &QL;

GORE SCENTS A STARRING ROLE AND SEIZES IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was clear Thursday that the Senate would vote
for President Clinton's judicial nominees, but so what? Vice
President Al Gore had a chance _ his third in five weeks _ to cast
his shadow over Senate Republicans. So he took it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore diverted his campaign plane to Washington from Detroit late
Wednesday after Senate Democrats told him he might be needed to
break a tie vote on the nomination of Judge Richard A. Paez to the
federal bench. Paez is a Mexican-American whose appointment has
been advocated by Hispanic groups and blocked by Republicans for
four years, longer than that of any other federal judicial nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say he is too liberal. Nonetheless, several,
including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the Judiciary
Committee, signaled over the last several days that they would vote
for Paez, and they did. Thursday's final tally: 59 in favor,
including 14 Republicans, and 39 against.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Gore rush off the campaign trail to Capitol Hill?
</P>
<P>
   This was better than the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   It gave Gore a chance to show that just the threat of his vote
could change Republican minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew that I had such influence in the Republican
Party,'' Gore told reporters. ``I used to joke that every time I
vote, we win. I think it's getting better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But his opening remarks also gave a powerful hint of his
motivation. ``Amigos, hoy finalmente hemos logrado justicia,'' Gore
said. ``Friends, today finally we have seen justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination has been a cause celebre among the nation's
increasingly influential Hispanic voters, and Gore will face a
tough fight with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely
Republican nominee, for their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used his appearance to position himself against
congressional Republicans, with whom Bush has often been allied.
Gore said there was ``a troubling pattern'' of Senate Republicans'
opposing ``qualified judicial nominees who happen to be women and
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of threatening to break close votes and claim credit
was not lost on Gore, who suggested that this might be an
increasingly common strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I can come back soon to get the Republicans to
change their minds and pass a real patients' bill of rights and
pass a prescription-drug benefit,'' Gore said.

``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;

   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in

   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Loss a microcosm of season for Cremins
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Going into his final ACC Tournament as Georgia
Tech's coach, Bobby Cremins said he wasn't worried about winning
and losing. He just wanted his team to play well. If it had to end,
he wanted it to end with his team playing good basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cremins did not get his wish Thursday night as
the problems which made Georgia Tech an inconsistent team all
season were painfully on display as the Yellow Jackets lost to
Florida State 63-62. It was the fourth consecutive year that the
Yellow Jackets had been eliminated in their first ACC Tournament
game.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, Cremins received a standing ovation from the
sold-out crowd at the Charlotte Coliseum. But those warm moments
hardly soothed the disappointment of what had transpired in the
previous two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech faithful turned out in force to support their
coach of the past 19 years. Both of Cremins' brothers, Johnny and
Frank, were in the Georgia Tech section, as was wife Carolyn, who
received her fair share of hugs before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Several writers and broadcasters along press row, including
Woody Durham, the voice of the North Carolina Tar Heels, wore
yellow ties and blue shirts to honor the man whose association with
the ACC dated back to 1966, when he was a player for South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   During the pregame announcement of the starting lineup, the
spotlight lingered on Cremins for a few seconds as he recieved the
polite applause of the crowd. He acknowledged it, but seemed
embarrassed by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   They all came here Thursday night hoping to see Cremins win at
least one game and advance to today's second round against
Maryland. Losing to Maryland, one of the hottest teams in the
nation, would not have seemed such a bad way for Cremins to go out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what they got was a reminder of why Cremins believes
``the program needs new leadership.'' Tech played one one of its
worst halves of basketball this season, hitting only 7 of 23 shots
from the field and an inexplicable 5 of 16 from the free throw
line. The Yellow Jackets turned it over nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Only an equally wretched half by Florida State made it a close
game at halftime, as Georgia Tech trailed 25-23.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech trailed by as many as nine in the second half and
finally made its run, closing the margin to 53-52 with 3:24 left.
By then the Coliseum was full and, except for the 2,000 Florida
State fans, they were all pulling for Cremins. But Georgia Tech
could not make the plays down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Cremins went through his postgame rituals for
the final time. He spoke to his team. He spoke to the media. He did
his radio and TV show. There will be some other loose ends to tie
up. He'll fly out to the West Coast Monday to do Gary Miller's Up
Close show on ESPN. Wednesday, he and Carolyn are headed to an
Alabama resort for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Cremins had allowed himself to dream. There was part of
him that believed his guys could get hot, make a little run in the
tournament, and give these folks in Charlotte something to remember
him by.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of this night was the same as 30 years ago, when
his career as a player was suddenly cut short in this very town in
this very tournament. The basketball has no feelings. You make your
shots, you win. You miss your shots, you lose. It knows or cares
nothing about proper goodbyes.

UNION POLLS WORKING WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey released Thursday found that one-fourth of working
women hold a job that requires them to work at night or on
weekends, while nearly half of working women work shifts different
from those of their spouses or partners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by the AFL-CIO, found that many working
women felt stressed and overstretched, with many complaining that
their employers did not offer flexible hours, paid sick leave or
child-care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 765 working women over 18 years of age found that
60 percent of working women toiled 40 or more hours a week and that
women with minor children were more likely than other women to work
different shifts from their husbands. Fifty-one percent of women
with children under 18 work different hours from their spouses or
partners, while 46 percent of all working women do.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted to articulate what issues are important
to women with an eye to pressuring politicians to heed their
concerns. Many priorities expressed by the women surveyed
dovetailed with the AFL-CIO's legislative program, which calls for
making quality health care more affordable and strengthening laws
to provide benefits and better pay for part-time and temporary
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by Lake Snell Perry &AMP; Associates, found
that the No. 1 legislative priority for women was stronger
equal-pay laws, because many women were unhappy that women earn on
average 73 cents for every dollar that men earn. Eighty-seven
percent of women surveyed said such laws were a priority, while 84
percent said that quality, affordable health care was a priority,
and 83 percent stressed expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act
to provide paid leave.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points, also found that 34 percent of women
said their employers did not provide them with flexible hours.

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES AID TO COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Wis., Va., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House appropriations committee on Thursday
night easily approved an emergency aid package of $1.7 billion to
shore up Colombia's tottering democracy and enable its military to
step up its war against narcotics traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 33-13, with opponents noting the abysmal
human-rights record of the Colombian army, which will receive much
of the money and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The House package, which was crafted by the Republican
leadership and was an increase over the original request from
President Clinton, included more money to help with human rights
and judicial reform in Colombia and to help neighboring countries
fight the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we move the druggies out of Colombia, we don't want them to
land in another country in the region,'' said Rep. Bill Young,
R-Fla., chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked for $1.2 billion for his two-year plan to
support Colombia's democracy and bolster its military efforts to
fight the drug trade by reducing the booming production of cocaine
and heroin in Colombia. The House panel on Thursday added $500
million to the program's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the country is embroiled in a three-sided civil war
including rebels and paramilitary groups that are lavishly
supported by the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected to what they said was the hastiness of
Thursday's action, arguing that the administration may believe it
is only fighting a war against drugs in Colombia but could find
itself unwittingly pulled into the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Citing lessons learned from Vietnam, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
said that while he didn't think the administration had any plans to
send U.S. troops to fight in Colombia, he worried that there
``could be a confluence of events that could lead to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Obey failed to persuade the committee to withhold temporarily
the $500 million of military aid earmarked for training and
equipping two army counternarcotics battalions. He said Congress
needed to know more about their mission to gain control over two
cocaine-producing provinces in southern Colombia before approving
the money.
</P>
<P>
   The House package also includes money for 30 Blackhawk and 30
Huey helicopters for the Colombian army and police forces and
$115.5 million for the national police.
</P>
<P>
   The entire $9 billion emergency spending bill _ which also
includes aid for the Kosovo and East Timor peacekeeping missions,
natural-disaster assistance, and money to pay the Pentagon's rising
fuel bill _ will go to the floor of the House within two weeks,
according to committee aides.
</P>
<P>
   Central to Thursday's debate was the sense that Colombia's
president, Andres Pastrana, may be running out of time to implement
his ``Plan Colombia'' to strengthen democracy, a program that is
also seeking money from Europe and international financial
institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats praised Pastrana on Thursday for
treating human rights as a priority and for trying to negotiate
peace with the guerrillas, even though he has failed to reach a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in the middle, he is trying to lead Colombia into the
modern world,'' said Rep. James Moran, R-Va. ``If we don't help him
now, it may be too late later.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Democratic opponents of the bills argued that it
would be better to provide economic and humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Pastrana is a brave and courageous leader. Should we
strengthen his hand by strengthening his military or by giving him
humanitarian and economic assistance?'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif.

   NEWARK, N.J. _ Soaring home prices. Sclerotic traffic. The
maddening roar of new construction. Too many people, not enough
open space.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the woes of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, in an unlikely tale for flush times, the locale in question
is in Manhattan or Westchester County, N.Y., but in a corner of
Newark, a city left for dead after the 1967 riots, where almost a
third of the residents still live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Newark's Ironbound section, long a bastion of Portuguese
immigrants and more recently a magnet for Brazilians and other
Latin Americans, has become one of the hottest swaths of real
estate in the region. More than 900 homes have been built in the
Ironbound in the last three years, real estate values have nearly
doubled, and most homes are snapped up after just days on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been out of this world,'' said Jack DaSilva, a local
developer who recently sold 150 new homes in the Ironbound before
even a single foundation had been poured.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many residents complain that this bustling neighborhood of
about 50,000 people has become too prosperous for its own good.
Steep housing prices are forcing families to double and triple up,
the population boom has made parking nightmarish, and local schools
are overwhelmed by the influx of new students, many of them Latin
American immigrants who speak little English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our quality of life has gone down the tubes,'' said Mary
Correia, 39, the daughter of Portuguese parents who works in the
neighborhood but recently moved to the suburbs. ``This is no place
to raise a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Overdevelopment is also feeding tensions between the Portuguese,
who are widely credited with saving the neighborhood during
Newark's darkest days, and the newly arrived Brazilians, who often
get blamed for the crowded streets and steep housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Moacir Weirich, a Lutheran clergyman who runs a
storefront ministry here, said the problems associated with
explosive growth have given life to long-buried animosities between
the faded imperial power and its former colony. ``People are angry,
and they're just looking for someone to blame,'' said Weirich, who
is Brazilian. ``They make easy targets for each another.''
</P>
<P>
   A hodgepodge of vinyl-sided homes and 19th-century factories,
the Ironbound has always been a gritty, working-class place named
for the railroad tracks that once surrounded it. Even after the
1967 riots, when Newark suffered decades of depopulation,
disinvestment and a crippling loss of faith, the Ironbound,
bolstered by Portuguese immigration, remained a pocket of
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Although downtown Newark has benefited from a new performing
arts center, a minor-league baseball stadium and the promise of a
professional sports complex, New Jersey's largest city remains
mired in poverty, with a quarter of its 267,000 residents on some
form of public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders might find it hard to appreciate the lure of the
Ironbound, a densely packed neighborhood where $300,000 homes _
most without yards _ are raked by the whoosh of planes landing at
nearby Newark International Airport. There are few parks or
playgrounds here, and highways, railroad tracks and derelict loft
buildings are among the area's more prominent features. Many new
homes sit atop toxic soil, a legacy of the area's industrial past.
</P>
<P>
   Augusto Amador, the Ironbound district's representative on the
Newark City Council, said people are drawn here by easy access to
jobs, proximity to the state's main highways and good public
transportation. It also helps that immigrants can navigate daily
life without worrying about their limited English, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a hard-working immigrant and you want to settle down
in a safe, secure neighborhood, there's no better place to be,''
said Amador, who came here from Portugal when he was 17. ``You
don't find this kind of stability elsewhere in Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   That stability has been fostered by the neighborhood's physical
isolation and the Portuguese, who began arriving in the late 1960s,
replacing the Italians, Polish and Irish who came before them.
</P>
<P>
   With its modest two-and-three family homes, the Ironbound is
house proud but not fussy. Charles Cummings, Newark's official
historian, calls it ``our Greenwich Village, without the
Bohemians.''
</P>
<P>
   Its vibrant street life is striking as one passes beneath the
elevated tracks separating the neighborhood from downtown, with its
fenced-in parking lots, vacant office buildings and forlorn
sidewalks. By contrast, the Ironbound's main commercial artery,
Ferry Street, is lined with restaurants and bakeries, its sidewalks
thick with pedestrians. ``I defy you to find an empty storefront on
Ferry Street,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, thousands of Brazilians, Portuguese and other
visitors from the metropolitan area flock to Ferry Street, clogging
traffic and double parking on the side streets. On most afternoons,
the desperate honking of blocked-in drivers fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   For business owners like Jose Moreira, the throngs are a good
thing. ``On weekends you can't even walk around in here,'' Moreira
said on a recent Sunday as he held court at his restaurant, Casa
Nova. Brazilian families gathered at tables loaded with barbecue
meats, known as churrascarria, while single men sat along the
counter trading gossip and sipping cafezhino or Brazilian beer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreira, 33, who arrived here in 1988 and spent years working as
a landscaper, has done well in Newark. Last year he opened his
third restaurant in the neighborhood, and he has plans to open a
fourth. ``As long as the Brazilians keep coming, I'm going to do
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his home state of Minas Gerais, Newark is something of a
household word, known as a place that promises steady employment to
those unintimidated by work hard. The men find jobs as construction
workers, landscapers, or bakers; the women are usually hired as
baby sitters or housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreira, too, has become something of a celebrity, and every day
freshly arrived Brazilians, dragging their luggage behind them,
walk into Casa Nova seeking advice, apartments and the comfort of
compatriots. Last week it was Elio Lana, 34, a truck driver from
Ipatinga who came directly from Newark Airport with questions about
work. Asked why he came to Newark and not New York City, the
legendary landing pad for immigrants, he smiled. ``Everyone knows
Newark is much easier than New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are no figures on how many Brazilians live in the
Ironbound, but realtors estimate that about 60 percent of the homes
on the market are bought by Brazilians; the remaining buyers are a
mix of Portuguese, Ecuadoreans, Peruvians and Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like many entrepreneurs, Kenneth Rocco has met the influx by
hiring more Brazilians at his travel agency, Monica Travel, which
also provides immigration, money wiring and long-distance telephone
services. Five of his six employees, he said, are from Brazil.
``Brazilians are our future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Portuguese are becoming extinct. They remain the
neighborhood's most prominent business leaders and are behind
nearly all of the new construction. Jacinto Rodrigues, for example,
one of the city's largest builders, is also an owner of Crown Bank,
a local lending institution that provides many Ironbound home
buyers with mortgages. Some of the biggest employers in Newark are
the Ironbound's Portuguese bakeries and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is indisputable: as Brazilians continue to flood
into the area, immigration from Portugal has all but dried up, with
many Portuguese families moving to the suburbs and a growing number
of the elderly retiring to homes they built in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Once Western Europe's most backward nation, Portugal has
prospered since joining the European Union in 1986. During the
1970s, when the country was still emerging from its agrarian past,
an average of 8,500 Portuguese each year legally immigrated to the
United States, with about 20 percent settling in Newark, according
to immigration figures. By 1998, with Portugal's economy the second
fastest-growing in Europe, that number had dropped to 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for young people to come anymore,'' said
Fernando Santos, the news editor of Luso-Americano, a
Portuguese-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The community has five newspapers aimed at Brazilians and two at
Portuguese; to broaden its appeal, the Luso-Americano recently
added a section with news and sports from Brazil. The local soccer
league once had 10 Portuguese teams; today there are only three,
and the rest are either Brazilian or Latin American. ``You go down
Ferry Street,'' Santos said, ``and all you see are the yellow and
green colors of the Brazilian flag.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The shifting demographics have fueled strife between the two
groups, although everyone agrees that the conflict finds its worst
expression in off-color jokes. ``We basically make the same silly
cracks about each other,'' said Alessandra Braganca, 27, a travel
agent who moved to Newark from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, six years
ago. ``They think we're stupid; we think they're snobs.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they mock each other's manner of speech, which are
about as different as British and American English.
</P>
<P>
   Still, longtime Portuguese residents bemoan the changing
landscape. Manny Lopes, 42, the owner of Newark Hardware since
1973, said the Brazilians are not as committed to the neighborhood
as the Portuguese were. ``We were so busy in the '70s, fixing up
the houses. There were always people in here buying materials,
paint and hardware,'' he said. ``The Brazilians, they don't invest
like we do. They come for a few months and then go elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some realtors worry that many of the new immigrants buying new
homes are in over their head. Much of the buying frenzy, they said,
has been fueled by subsidized loan programs or mortgages that allow
buyers to put down as little as three percent on a $300,000 house.
And because many home buyers work in construction, an industry
notoriously susceptible to economic vagaries, a recession could hit
the Ironbound especially hard. ``If there's a downturn, there are
going to be a lot of people defaulting on their mortgages,'' said
Carlos Couto, the owner of Re/Max United, a real estate brokerage
on Ferry Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the neighborhood's schools have become the most
crowded in the state, with many classrooms exceeding 40 students.
In February, hundreds of angry parents packed a series of town
meetings and demanded that the city provide some relief. Officials
said they would try to install temporary modular units in the
coming months and build three schools within the decade, but some
parents say they cannot wait. ``People are moving out as soon as
their kids reach high school,'' said Nancy Zak, a longtime resident
and a leader of the Ironbound Community Corp., a nonprofit group.
``We're turning into a transient place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mayor Sharpe James admits that the pace of development has
been a bit too heady. ``The success of the Ironbound could be its
downfall as well,'' he said. Some people are calling for a
moratorium on new housing, although that is unlikely to happen. In
the meantime, many homeowners are bracing for a revaluation of
property taxes, the first reassessment since 1961. City officials
say that some tax bills could double or triple, something that
lifelong residents like Linda Rodrigues fear could bring disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues, 49, a Portuguese professor at the New School in New
York City, said she and many other property owners might be driven
out by rising taxes. ``I've stayed here through some of Newark's
darkest moments,'' said Rodrigues, who serves on the boards of the
Newark Museum, the performing arts center and the public library.
``But between overdevelopment and the reassessment, I don't know if
I can survive much longer.''

EXCERPTS FROM BRADLEY'S PARTING SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BRADLEY) 
(mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech in West Orange, N.J., on
Thursday in which former Sen. Bill Bradley announced his withdrawal
from the presidential race, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   I've decided to withdraw from the Democratic race for president.
And while I'm not _ and while I'm bowing out, I'm not releasing the
delegates that are on my side. They've been loyal supporters and
deserve to have their voices heard.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and I had a stiff competition, and he won. I
congratulate him. He will be the nominee of the Democratic Party,
and I will support him in his bid to win the White House. And this
morning I called him and told him all that.
</P>
<P>
   It is the tradition of the Democratic Party to fight hard during
primaries and then unify in closed ranks behind the nominee as soon
as the people have spoken. And now it is time for unity. Democrats
know that the offerings of the likely Republican nominee and his
party are the opposite of where our country should be headed. This
country needs Democratic leadership, and I will work to ensure a
Democratic White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   I will also continue to work for a new politics and for the
values I laid out in the campaign. What do I mean by creating a new
politics in America?
</P>
<P>
   I mean a politics that's not polluted by money; a politics in
which leaders speak from their core convictions and not from polls
or focus groups; a politics that's about lifting people up, not
tearing your opponent down; a politics that reflects the best in
what is in us as Americans and not the worst; a politics that
inspires us all to live up, or try to live up, to our potential as
citizens and human beings.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also talking about a politics that listens more closely to
the voices that are not usually heard; a politics that has a
special responsibility to leave no one behind.
</P>
<P>
   A president is president of all the people, wealthy as well as
poor. But a president must listen more closely because the voices
of those who have been less fortunate are not as loud and insistent
as those who have been more fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson once divided politicians into two camps: those who
secretly fear and distrust the people and think they know better,
and those who consider the people the wisest guide of the public
interest. That is what the new politics is all about, the oldest
instinct in our democracy: trusting the people.
</P>
<P>
   The values I cherish and laid out in this campaign are embodied
in issues such as access to health care for all Americans,
elimination of child poverty, bold steps to get guns off of our
streets, genuine racial unity, education that works for everyone
and fundamental campaign finance reform. These are not and never
have been political slogans for me. They are and always have been
my convictions, convictions I do not change because an election is
won or lost. What makes this a special moment in America is that we
can afford to do all these things now, especially since we're
living in a time of unprecedented prosperity. And if we did these
things, we would all be stronger....
</P>
<P>
   I want to leave this race the same way I got in....And that is
with a minimum of politics as usual and a maximum of respect for
the American people and their dreams. I believe these dreams can be
the foundation of a new politics that can truly make our country
soar.

 &HT;    Dell recalls notebook computers because of flawed memory chips
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Up to one-third of the notebook computers Dell
Computer Corp. produced last year may have defective memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Dell began alerting customers during the past few weeks that
some of its Latitude corporate laptops and Inspiron consumer
machines may encounter an unexpected glitch when coming out of
suspension mode, a power-saving function when computers aren't in
use. Because of a memory-chip problem, some notebooks will freeze
or crash, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects between 200,000 and 400,000 of the notebooks
made between February and November 1999. Dell produced about 1.2
million notebooks last year, including 540,000 units in the fourth
quarter, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said it will replace the memory modules at no cost to
customers, whom it began informing by letter in recent weeks. Those
customers also are receiving diagnostic tools that will determine
whether their machines are affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue screens and system hangs happen for numerous reasons,''
said Dell spokesman Rob Crawley. ``That doesn't necessarily mean
it's bad memory. That's one of the reasons it took awhile to nail
down the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said the majority of the laptops in question are
Latitudes, which are generally purchased by corporate customers.
Because Dell uses multiple memory-chip suppliers, not all laptops
have the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The affected computers came with either 32 megabytes or 64
megabytes of memory in modules made by Micron Technology Inc. of
Boise, Idaho. Micron spokeswoman Julie Nash said Micron's chips met
Dell's initial specifications, but there was a problem when Dell
added an auto-refresh feature.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said it will either send customers new chips, which
customers can install themselves, or they'll send a tech-support
person to replace the memory modules.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Micron say they are working out the financial details.
</P>
<P>
   But both companies say the cost of replacing the chips will not
have a financial impact. Analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those chips don't cost much,'' said Jimmy Johnson, an analyst
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``I don't think that's going
to be any big deal. These things happen all the time, but most of
them aren't published. It's no different than when Microsoft has a
problem with its (operating system) and they make a patch
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Micron's retail prices for those modules currently range from
$58.50 to $90. Under a worst-case scenario, the cost is $23.4
million to $36 million, which is less than Dell's daily sales over
the Internet of about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody like Dell could absorb that quite easily,'' said
Brian Matas, a chip-industry analyst with IC Insights in
Scottsdale, Ariz. ``You'd see it, but it wouldn't impact the bottom
line too much. You want to jump on it right away and take care of
that problem. The bad P.R. would be far more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although word of the problem spread throughout the day Thursday,
Dell's stock enjoyed one of its biggest gains in a long time,
rising $3.50 to close at $50.44. It was Dell's first venture above
$50 since late December. Micron rose $9 to $110 per share.

TRACES OF DEADLY VIRUS FOUND IN HIBERNATING MOSQUITOES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal health investigators have found genetic
evidence in hibernating mosquitoes collected recently in
northeastern Queens that suggests the West Nile virus that killed
seven people in the New York region last year survived the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes extracted from bunkers at the historic Fort Totten _
in three of 69 samples examined _ had low but detectable levels of
a genetic material associated with the mosquito-borne virus, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.
Another 22 samples collected from spots including the Whitestone
Bridge in Queens and storm sewers next to the Bronx Zoo found no
hint of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not necessarily mean the disease is coming back when
it warms up in the New York area,'' said Dr. Stephen M. Ostroff,
associate director at the National Center for Infectious Diseases
in Atlanta, a division of the CDC. ``But this raises the
possibility that it might. There is at least some evidence that it
is still present in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   City and state health officials said they were not surprised by
the findings, given the first confirmation last summer that the
virus _ prevalent in Africa, West Asia and the Middle East _ had
somehow been carried to the United States. But the latest findings
added urgency to a campaign scheduled to begin next month in New
York City to kill mosquito larva and reduce mosquito breeding
sites, and they raised the possibility the city might return to
widespread aerial pesticide spraying this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to kill as many of those critters as possible,''
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Department of Health issued an alert Thursday
to medical professionals citywide warning them of the latest
findings and urging them, beginning May 1 when mosquitoes become
more prevalent, to immediately report to the city any suspected
cases of viral encephalitis, a brain infection that can result
after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in addition to seven deaths, 62 serious illnesses
were attributed to the virus in the New York area, with the largest
number confirmed in Queens and the Bronx. Its symptoms resemble a
severe flu, with fever, as well as poor muscle control or mental
disorientation. The federal government, as previously planned, is
also distributing $2.9 million in special grants to mid-Atlantic
states to enhance testing this summer of mosquitoes, as well as
birds, which can spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts were somewhat split on the significance of the
CDC findings, which were published in Thursday's issue of the
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Dr. John Edman, director of
the Center for Vector Borne Disease Research at the University of
California in Davis, cautioned against overreacting, given that the
tests found no evidence of live virus, only genetic traces, meaning
the virus may not reproduce and cause infection.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a scientist at the University of
California in Irvine who helped diagnose West Nile virus as the
cause of deaths in New York last year, said the findings were
``definitely a cause for concern.'' And Dr. Andrew Spielman, a
professor of tropical public health at Harvard School of Public
Health, said he was now more concerned that the virus might be on
its way to establishing itself as a permanent health threat in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big biological question was would the mosquitoes become
infected before going into hibernation? It looks like the answer is
yes,'' Dr. Spielman said Thursday. ``Now the question is, have
enough of them gone into hibernation with the infection so that the
cycle will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, and State
Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia C. Novello joined the calls
Thursday for the public not to overreact, noting, for example, that
the species of mosquito most associated with the virus does not
emerge until later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers need not avoid outdoor activities,'' Dr. Novello
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the city urged property owners Thursday to unclog roof
gutters, empty or chlorinate unused swimming pools, discard old
tires and buckets and change water in bird baths at least once a
week, steps that would eliminate pools of water that could serve as
mosquito breeding sites. Starting next month, the city will also be
placing larvicide in storm and sewer drains and other areas where
standing water cannot be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, several scientists said, will be a test of just how
long-lasting, or fleeting, the West Nile virus scare will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a new introduction to the Western Hemisphere,'' said
Ostroff of the CDC. ``This year will be critical in terms of
determining if it is going to establish itself in North America or
burn itself out.''

JUDGE CONVICTS VOODOO PRIEST ON 2 MINOR CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tangled trial of a voodoo priest accused of trying to burn a
Haitian pop singer to death in a religious ritual ended Thursday in
Newark, N.J., with the priest convicted only of two minor charges.
</P>
<P>
   During the monthlong trial, Judge Paul J. Vichness threw out
charges that the 43-year-old priest, Pierrot Charles of Irvington,
N.J., had conspired to murder the singer, Sheila DeGraff, 29, and
had intentionally set her on fire in a voodoo ceremony in October
1997. On Thursday, Vichness, who conducted the trial without a
jury, threw out another charge, aggravated assault, and found
Charles guilty of simple assault, based on negligence, and criminal
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in New Jersey courts, convictions on such charges
carry a sentence of probation. The original charges against Charles
carried a sentence of up to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' lawyer, James M. Weinberg, said that he and his client
had mixed emotions about the outcome. ``We're happy the worst
didn't happen and the main charges were thrown out,'' he said.
``But we're not happy because an innocent man was convicted.''
Weinberg contended during trial that the second- and third-degree
burns DeGraff suffered to her face and neck during the ritual had
occurred accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Jean Valme, DeGraff's former boyfriend, were
originally indicted on charges of conspiracy to murder and
attempted murder, and went on trial together on Feb. 8. But the
prosecution's case was troubled by too few witnesses and by weak,
contradictory testimony that did not support the theory that the
two men wanted to kill DeGraff to spare Valme from repaying a
$25,000 loan.
</P>
<P>
   DeGraff testified that the hood of her robe caught fire during
the ritual after Charles poured an alcohol-based, flammable liquid
known as Florida Water on it.
</P>
<P>
   In midtrial, the prosecutor dropped all charges against Valme in
exchange for his testimony against Charles. Valme denied the
existence of a murder plot and said the hood started burning as
Charles held a candle near it as he sprinkled it with Florida
Water.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday that he
considered an artwork that alludes to him and the Nazis offensive,
but that he would not ask the Whitney Museum of American Art to
remove it from a forthcoming exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League, however, harshly criticized the
museum for including the piece in its Biennial exhibition, charging
that the work trivializes the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for the German-born artist, Hans Haacke, who created
the work, it was just another workday in Westbeth, the Greenwich
Village artists' community where he lives, except that his
telephone rang constantly. Labeling the contretemps ``a bit
amusing,'' he said he would not speak in detail about the work,
which is called ``Sanitation,'' until after its installation next
week, in part because he was still working on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfortunate that before a work is completed, it is
being talked about,'' Haacke said. ``It's all hypothetical. It
probably won't change, but who knows? I may discover that something
may not work and I may have to adjust it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unadjusted, ``Sanitation'' consists of a wall displaying a
gold-framed reproduction of the First Amendment and six quotations,
printed in the Fraktur Gothic typeface favored by Hitler and the
Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Three quotes are from the mayor and refer to his opposition to
``Sensation,'' the exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art last
fall that included works Giuliani considered offensive. The three
other passages are from conservative politicians who have taken
stands against the National Endowment for the Arts and much
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the quotations, Haacke plans to place a row of eight to
12 garbage cans, each with a speaker playing the sounds of marching
troops.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Giuliani said that the city would take no
action on the piece, which the Whitney commissioned without knowing
its precise contents. ``The real concern of the city has to be when
public money is being used,'' he said. ``If this is privately
funded, and I believe that it is, then the governmental objection
to it passes away. The government has no right to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added, however, that he did find the piece offensive.
``There is an issue here about demeaning the whole historical and
contemporary importance of the Holocaust,'' he said. ``When people
misuse descriptions like that, in essence they do a grave injustice
to the people who suffered in the Holocaust and to the reality of
what the Holocaust was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the same objection, the Anti-Defamation League's national
director, Abraham H. Foxman, took issue with the Whitney's decision
to show the work in the Biennial, which opens on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Maxwell L. Anderson, the museum's director,
Foxman berated the Whitney for denigrating the memory of those who
were killed by the Nazis. ``We do not deny Haacke the artistic
freedom to create what he chooses,'' the letter said. ``We would,
however, have expected that the leadership of the Whitney would
have chosen not to contribute to his trivialization of the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Foxman added that he found the work to
be ``a very harsh political statement, inappropriate in an election
period.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Anderson said that ``the museum would never
deliberately do anything to offend those affected by the Holocaust,
and we do not believe that this was the artist's intent. We
continue to support artists' right to free expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, as those familiar with his work know, was simply doing
what he always does. Over the years, Ronald Reagan, George Bush,
Margaret Thatcher, Sen. Jesse Helms, Daimler-Benz, Mobil Oil,
Philip Morris, Benetton and dozens of other individuals,
corporations, governments and institutions have felt Haacke's
sting.
</P>
<P>
   He has even taken on one of Giuliani's targets: Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi, the advertising agency founded by Charles Saatchi, who
owns the works in ``Sensation'' and helped sponsor the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   As John Weber, who has been Haacke's dealer for 30 years, said,
``He is the grandfather of this contemporary political art that
everyone is now doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, 67, began making political statements in the 1960s,
around the time he moved here from Germany. He has never become an
American citizen and has said that his politics are eclectic and
cannot be labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Sol Lewitt, a well-known conceptual artist and a longtime friend
of Haacke, said: ``He has had a vast amount of influence, and
anyone who does anything with political content owes a great debt
to him. He is the first and the best.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Haacke's best-known pieces was the most talked-about work
at the 1993 Venice Biennale. Visitors to the German pavilion, which
was built in the 1930s, came upon a huge gold Deutsche mark coin
above the door and a blown-up picture of Hitler inspecting the 1934
Venice Biennale. As they passed the photo to enter the grand hall,
they found nothing except ``Germania'' emblazoned on the wall:
Haacke had taken a jackhammer to the marble floor, leaving it in
ruins. ``People were in tears,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, Haacke had created a giant pack of
cigarettes using the Marlboro colors and logo type, and labeled it
``Helmsboro.'' A picture of Helms, R-N.C., was placed inside the
cameo insignia and ``Philip Morris funds Jesse Helms'' was printed
on each cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Haacke had to teach to make a living, and he became a
tenured professor at Cooper Union. Now his works sell for $25,000
to $200,000, but he still teaches. ``I like to retain my
independence from the art market,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early in the second half of a major upset Thursday
afternoon, Lee Scruggs of Georgetown defended against Etan Thomas
of Syracuse by throwing a high, hard elbow. ``Cut it out!'' shouted
an official, who called a foul.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs smiled, shrugged and gestured with his hands as if to
say, ``Knock off what?'' This, after all, is the way the Hoyas
played all day against Thomas and have played against almost
everyone. Scruggs and his teammates did not exactly knock Thomas'
block off, but they used a rugged defense among other weapons to
knock off the top-seeded Orangemen by 76-72 in the quarterfinals of
the Big East conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown (18-13), which is seeded ninth and won only 6-of-16
league games in the regular season, will meet Connecticut (23-8)
Friday night in the first of two semifinal games at Madison Square
Garden. The Huskies, defending a national championship as well as
this tournament's title, advanced by beating Seton Hall, 79-64, in
the second quarterfinal Thursday afternoon behind 30 points from
Khalid El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown played its best game of the season, just about
everyone agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy right now,'' said Kevin Braswell, the point
guard, who scored 20 points and added eight assists, ``because we
just knocked the No. 1-seeded team off.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs, a center, also scored 20 points and had nine rebounds.
``We kind of held Etan in check, and that was the outcome of the
game,'' the 6-foot-10-inch Scruggs said, referring to the best
Syracuse player. ``Coach emphasized that and said every time a shot
went up somebody's got to get a piece of him. I think we kept him
off the boards pretty much.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a 6-9 senior center, managed 17 points and 13 rebounds,
above his season averages, but the Hoyas wore him down, ganging up
on him, substituting frequently with a rotation of big men, forcing
him to commit four fouls while defending his own basket.
Georgetown's Ruben Boumtje Boumtje, who missed Tuesday's
first-round game with a sprained ankle, was part of the rotation,
playing 27 minutes, scoring 12 points and grabbing four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs hit short jumpers from the lane on turnaround moves and
layups from beneath the basket and follow shots after misses by
teammates. He showed emotion with facial expressions and body
language.
</P>
<P>
   After he fouled Thomas, he pounded his fist into the padded
pillar that holds up the basket. But he had better things to do
with his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started putting him at the free-throw line against their
zone rather than on the baseline and wing,'' said Craig Esherick,
the Georgetown coach. ``Lee did a great job. He's capable of
hitting that jump shot. He's a two-guard in a 6-11 body. I thought
Lee did a good job in the middle of that zone, both hitting the
shot and getting the ball inside to Ruben.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Boeheim, the Syracuse coach, was not giving the victors
too much praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problem with this game was Syracuse,'' Boeheim said. ``It has
nothing to do with Georgetown. This is the worst we've played the
whole year. I didn't see any leadership. I didn't see any effort
until about 10 minutes to go in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked how his team would rally from this, Boeheim
said, ``I'm sure they're back there having a party.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse, which fell to 24-5, lost its regular-season finale at
Connecticut and is 5-5 in its last 10 games. Boeheim criticized the
play of Damone Brown, who scored 15 points, and Jason Hart, who
scored 11. When asked about DeShaun Williams, who scored 11 points,
Boeheim said: ``We're going to have put up with his defensive
shortcomings. He can't guard anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas seemed more composed than his coach and chose not to find
fault. ``When you lose, everyone wants to point the finger,''
Thomas said. ``All isn't lost. Everyone has to stay positive. We
can't listen to the wrong people too much and get our heads down.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said his teammates tried hard and that they are not
``shattered'' as they look forward to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament next week.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown would be a long shot for an at-large selection in the
64-team field, but would go automatically if it wins the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Esherick said, ``I don't know what the tournament committee
would do if we lost our next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall fell to 20-9 and still hopes for a bid. The Pirates
cut Connecticut's 16-point lead to three points early in the second
half, but fell beneath the weight of El-Amin's entertaining show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a player starts feeling good, he thinks he can hit
anything,'' El-Amin said. ``I was just going at the defense and
attacking the defense like I should.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have won their last five games. For those who
doubted the defending champions during an 8-7 slump before that,
El-Amin said: ``People were counting us out. We can compete with
anyone. We can play with anyone. We can beat anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly beat Seton Hall, which got 21 points from Shaheen
Holloway and 11 each from Samuel Dalembert and Rimas Kaukenas.
Coach Tommy Amaker got a technical foul, a rarity for him.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there should have been a foul called and I said
so,'' Amaker said. He also said El-Amin played a great ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any answers for him in the first half,'' Amaker
said, referring to El-Amin's 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Darius Lane scored only four points for Seton Hall, which was
outrebounded by 41-25.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Saunders, working back into the good graces of Huskies
Coach Jim Calhoun, scored 14 points and added nine rebounds.
Calhoun praised Kevin Freeman for covering Lane and many others for
all the rebounding. ``We dominated the boards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking toward the semifinals, Calhoun said to his players:
``Friday night, New York City, the best teams in the neighborhood
playing. A lot of fun for basketball competitors.''

FIRE THAT LED TO 3 KILLINGS WAS ARSON, INVESTIGATORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS _ Investigators established Thursday that arson was the
cause of the blaze that drew firefighters to a suburban home on
Wednesday afternoon where two firefighters and a sheriff's deputy
were shot to death, as well as the wife of the prime suspect in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   But no motive was evident yet, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Across this city Thursday, outrage at the seemingly senseless
shootings mixed with sympathy for the families of the victims, who
spent their day making funeral arrangements. Flags flew at half
staff and people left mementos at the shooting site.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they expected to charge Frederick Williams, a
41-year-old firefighter, with multiple counts of first-degree
murder and arson. They said the fire was started by igniting
clothes and bed sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings began when firefighters responded to a call at the
brick house in a middle-class subdivision on the city's southeast
edge. As they were preparing to fight the fire, a man who witnesses
identified as Williams shot at them, killing Lt. Javier Lerma, 41,
and Pvt. William Blakemore, 48, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Peete, 45, a sheriff's deputy, who had been flagged down
by a passer-by, arrived at the house and was also fired upon and
killed. The passer-by, who had gotten out of her car to stop Peete,
was hit in the face by a bullet, but her injuries were not
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers who arrived later shot and wounded Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Stacey Williams, 32, a postal worker, was found
shot to death inside the burning house. The couple had married been
three weeks ago on Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis police director Walter Crews said, ``It appears this all
might have begun with some sort of domestic disagreement between
the suspect and his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews said Stacey Williams had filed a domestic violence
complaint against Williams in October, and he was scheduled to
appear in court on the charge next week. Crews also indicated that
Williams might have made an emergency call before the ambush to
report the fire at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was being questioned Thursday at a local hospital. He
suffered a broken leg when he was hit by police gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of comments and messages of condolence from all over
the country were posted on the Web site www.Firehouse.com. The
comments included a message from a Memphis firefighter and
paramedic: ``I am deeply saddened, hurt, angry and embarrassed that
'one of our own could do this. My thoughts go out to each and every
one of these families who have suffered a very tragic, senseless
loss.''

 &HT;    FSU ends Cremins era
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ When it was all said and done, there was
little left to say about the Bobby Cremins Era at Georgia Tech.
Other than it is indeed over.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State defeated the Yellow Jackets 63-62 Thursday night
in the opening game of the ACC Tournament, ending Tech's season at
13-17, and finishing Cremins' 19-year stint.
</P>
<P>
   For a night, the Charlotte Coliseum became ``Bobby's House,''
with the crowd cheering on the likeable coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Cremins' last dance started out more as a tumbling two-step
than a smooth waltz before the Yellow Jackets made an inspired
charge that was more frantic than fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a full-court, trapping defense in the second half for
one of the few times all season, Tech began to chip away at a
nine-point FSU lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Jones slammed home a spinning, two-handed dunk, and the
Jackets were 53-52 with 3 minutes, 24 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun Fein's 3-pointer got Tech's deficit to 59-57, and after a
shot-clock violation against the 'Noles at :30.4, the Jackets had
the ball _ and a chance.
</P>
<P>
   It slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Collier's's hook from the left block went awry, and FSU
took possession after Tech knocked the ball out of bounds. FSU made
four of four free throws to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Collier, a senior, had 19 points in his final game at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Jackets tossed up 3-point attempts with wild
abandon, while 7-foot Collier and 6-foot-11 Jones got few touches.
</P>
<P>
   Six of Tech's first 11 field-goal attempts were from beyond
3-point range, but they made only one and fell down to the
Seminoles 11-4. Yet, FSU wasn't feeling it from outside, either.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-4 Tech run, fueled by five Seminoles turnovers, got the
Bobby backers into the game, and T.J. Vines fed Fein on a breakaway
layup that put the Jackets ahead 17-15.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Jackets would score only eight points over the
final 7:22 of the first half, and trailed 25-23 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   During the first 20 minutes, Tech made only 30 percent of its
field-goal tries, and was four of 15 from long range. Tony Akins
and Jason Floyd were a combined three of 11 on 3-point attempts.
Worse than that, though, was a five of 16 free-throw line showing.
</P>
<P>
   Collier, who led the Jackets in regular-season scoring (16.5
ppg.), managed only four points and had as many turnovers (3) as
field-goal tries in the first half.

VETO LIKELY AS HOUSE TIES TAX CUT TO $1 BOOST IN MINIMUM WAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House easily approved a $1 raise in the minimum
wage Thursday, a move that could boost the average pay for a
full-time worker by $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure appears headed for a presidential veto because
Republican leaders insisted on attaching it to a $123 billion tax
cut that President Clinton said could jeopardize the nation's
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again the Republican leadership has derailed what should
be a simple vote on the minimum wage with a maximum of political
maneuvering,'' Clinton said, complaining about the linkage of the
wage issue with a tax-cut measure he insisted would hurt the
government's ability to preserve Social Security and pay down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should send me a bill I can sign, not one that I have
to veto.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 boost in the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $6.15
over two years was approved 246-179. The tax cut, which reduces
estate or so-called ``death'' taxes by more than $78 billion over
10 years, passed 257-169. The bill would also help businesses
cushion the cost of implementing the wage increase through various
tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have long been opposed to any increase in the
minimum wage, preferring to let market forces determine pay levels.
But with the November elections approaching, moderate Republicans,
especially in the Northeast, threw their support behind it out of
concern that labor unions and Democrats might use the issue against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, however, insisted that the minimum wage
measure be tied to a tax relief bill containing provisions from the
$792 billion tax-cut package they failed to get signed into law
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the linkage between the two is designed
to ``kill the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they think the American people are stupid?'' asked Rep. Mel
Watt, D-N.C., during the debate. ``It's obvious that the Republican
leadership does not want to pass a minimum wage increase ... That's
why they've attached it to a tax-cut bill that they know is going
to get vetoed.''
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver of linking the wage measure to a tax bill is part
of a election-year strategy by Republican leaders designed to make
it look like they are addressing controversial matters, such as the
minimum wage and health care reform, that could become issues in
the fall campaign. But GOP aides acknowledge that the primary goal
of the strategy is to force the Democrats to deal with the tax-cut
proposals that Clinton rejected last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Republican tax bill is a poison pill designed to defeat
the increase in the minimum wage,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats called on Republican leaders to separate the two
issues, but they refused. They also refused to allow a separate
vote on a smaller $38 billion substitute tax bill offered by Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y,. that was paid for by closing other tax
loopholes. The Rangel bill also contained a targeted tax break for
small businesses that might be affected by the wage increase and a
cut in estate taxes aimed primarily at farmers.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
accused the Democrats of trying to cast the debate over the minimum
wage and tax cuts as ``class warfare'' by charging that the GOP
bill would benefit the rich.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the bill also contains provisions to help the
self-employed buy health insurance and to encourage investment in
poor communities. The tax package would also increase the amount
allowed for business meal deductions and gradually expand
retirement contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats still can't stop the `tax cut for the rich' broken
record,'' Archer said, complaining about the argument Democrats
have long used against GOP-sponsored tax relief legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again Democrats are fighting any tax relief and all tax
relief,'' Archer added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fighting against any tax relief, we're fighting for
fair tax relief,'' Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich, shot back,
challenging his Republican colleagues to bring the minimum wage
measure and the Democratic tax relief substitute up for separate
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a White House appearance earlier this week promoting
the minimum wage increase, served notice that Democrats would
remind voters in November if Republicans failed to back the $1
raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to stop nickel-and-diming the American working
people out of the money that they need and deserve,'' he said.
''This is just wrong ... We have destroyed every single argument
against raising the minimum wage. They're gone. All you've got now
is legislative game-playing, and it's wrong.``
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed its own version of the minimum wage measure
last month, but it would phase in a $1.05 increase over three years
instead of two, a delay that Democrats say will cost hourly workers
$1,000 in annual earnings. The Senate measure would increase the
wage by 35 cents this year, 35 cents next March and 35 cents in
2002. The House bill would increase the hourly rate by 50 cents
this year and 50 cents next year.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate versions will now have to be melded into a
compromise package and sent to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Thursday that he still wants a ``clean'' minimum
wage bill free of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have not ruled out the possibility of compromise
with Clinton. But Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said GOP members will
insist that the wage hike be tied to a tax break of some kind for
businesses that may be forced to pay a higher salary to their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to cushion the impact on the economy, particularly
small business,'' Portman said.

   COACHELLA, Calif. _ The modest Indian gambling hall near a truck
stop here in the desert has little of the flamboyance of Donald
Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J., or of numerous Las Vegas
resorts. About the only glitz is provided by illuminated
star-shaped wall plaques autographed by Tom Jones, Crystal Gale,
Shirley Bassey and other entertainers who have performed at the
casino's combination theater-bingo hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taj has incredible crystal chandeliers that will
absolutely knock your eyes out,'' said Charles J. Irwin, general
manager of the Spotlight 29 Casino here and a former vice chairman
of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. ``The Vegas places
have water effects and pirate ships and that kind of thing. This is
just a small Indian casino.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not for long. Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts announced
Wednesday that it had signed a letter of intent with the
Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians to take over the
Spotlight's management. The tribe and Trump Hotels will raise up to
$60 million to turn the betting parlor into more of a resort, which
is expected to take on the Trump brand name and a dash of Trump's
trademark extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after California voters approved a
measure to legalize Las Vegas-style casinos on Indian lands
throughout the state, setting off a scramble by tribes to expand
existing casinos or open new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Casino companies from Nevada, New Jersey and elsewhere are
angling to get in on what could become a huge gambling market.
Three Las Vegas companies _ Harrah's Entertainment, Anchor Gaming
and Station Casinos _ have already announced deals to build and
manage tribal casinos, each costing roughly $100 million. Lakes
Gaming, a Minnesota company that specializes in managing Indian
casinos, says it has signed up two tribes. Other deals are expected
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal gaming, of course, is already widespread. But the
expansion of tribal casinos in California is noteworthy because the
large population could allow the state to grow quickly into one of
the largest gambling markets, perhaps rivaling New Jersey. Bear,
Stearns has estimated that casino revenue in California will grow
to $4.7 billion in 2004 from about $1 billion a year now. But
Robertson Stephens estimates the California market will reach only
$2.6 billion by then. By contrast, Nevada has about $9 billion in
casino revenue and New Jersey $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is also noteworthy because California, next door to Nevada,
supplies about a third of the visitors to Las Vegas and an even
higher percentage to Laughlin, Reno and Lake Tahoe. California
could thus pose a bigger threat than other states to Nevada's
gambling-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a positive for Las Vegas, I can tell you that,'' said
Trump, whose company runs three casinos in Atlantic City and one in
Indiana but none in Las Vegas. One of the most attractive markets,
he and others said, is this area around Palm Springs, already a
sizable tourist spot. People from Los Angeles can drive here in
about two hours, less than half the time needed to get to Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada casinos spent more than $20 million to try to defeat a
ballot measure in 1998 to legalize California tribal gambling. The
measure was approved overwhelmingly, though it was later overturned
in court. So this year the casinos did not oppose the measure,
which got 65 percent of the vote, and instead are trying for a
slice of the tribal revenues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even the master casino builder Stephen A. Wynn has been
scouting, although the planned acquisition of his company Mirage
Resorts by MGM Grand will take any decision out of his hands. The
Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, which runs a casino a few minutes'
drive from the Spotlight, has held talks with Mirage and other
casino companies, said Brenda Soulliere, first vice chairman, who
said no decision had been made yet.
</P>
<P>
   There are already about 40 tribal casinos in California with
about 19,000 slot machines. But the state constitution bans
Nevada-style gambling, so officials had threatened to shut the
casinos down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, casinos will be able to put in full-fledged slot machines,
not the so-called video lottery terminals they have now, which do
not have arms to pull and print out winnings on a piece of paper.
The tribes will also be able to have card games like blackjack in
which players play against the house. (Now players pay 50 cents or
a dollar a hand into a pool that is used to pay winners.) But craps
and roulette will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   All this could make gambling more attractive in California. But
more important, with the threat of shutdown eliminated, the tribes
will find it easier to get financing to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so relieved,'' said Richard M. Milanovich, chairman
of the Tribal Council of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla
Indians, which spent millions of dollars to win approval of
Indian-run gambling. The tribe's five-year-old Spa Casino is housed
mainly in a huge canvas tent that stands somewhat incongruously in
the middle of upscale Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tribe is wasting little time. On Monday, the tribe is
expected to announce plans to invest more than $100 million to
build a permanent casino with an entertainment center and
restaurants, and to replace the adjacent Spa hotel with a larger
one. The tribe, one of California's wealthiest, is also expected to
announce an investment of $80 million or more to build a second
casino nearby. The total number of slot machines is expected to
grow to 2,000 from 1,150.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal officials dispute predictions of an explosion of
gambling in California or a huge influx of Nevada companies. Some
deals now being announced or proposed will not get financing or
prove economically feasible. Some still require tribes to obtain
land and could face local opposition. Many reservations in remote
locations could not support a casino of any size.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to have a lot of significant operations,''
said Howard L. Dickstein, a Sacramento lawyer who represents
several tribes. He said more than half the existing casinos had
fewer than 350 slot machines each.
</P>
<P>
   For casino companies as well, the opportunity is somewhat
limited. Under federal law, outside companies cannot own tribal
casinos and management contracts last no more than seven years, and
usually five.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world I would rather own 100 percent,'' said
Glenn C. Christenson, chief financial officer of Station Casinos.
Still, he said, such deals can be profitable. Station will get 22.5
percent of the net revenue of the casino it will build with the
United Auburn Indian Community near Sacramento, a few miles from
the highway that links San Francisco and Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some casino executives say it makes little sense to set
up a competitor only to be kicked out after five or seven years.
Some tribes, having already run their own casinos, do not need
outside help and do not want to split the profits. Some tribes also
have lingering resentment against the casinos that tried to defeat
the 1998 ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   For slot machine makers the opportunity is less ambiguous.
``It's probably one of the biggest markets that ever opened up all
at one time,'' said Ed Rogich, vice president for marketing at
International Game Technology, the largest manufacturer of slot
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between tribes and the state, the number of
slot machines could more than double, to about 45,000 _ more than
New Jersey's 36,000 but far behind Nevada's 200,000. And some
analysts say the agreement could be interpreted to allow even more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Each tribe will be allowed up to 2,000 machines; most big Las
Vegas resorts, Rogich said, have 2,000 to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the shaky legal ground of the California casinos, the
leading slot machine makers would not sell to them before for fear
of losing their own licenses. The machines in use at the tribal
casinos here, with names like Native American Gold or Native
Nickels, are crude compared with the machines now available
elsewhere, which have themes like Wheel of Fortune or Monopoly, and
bonus rounds. And without clanging coins, these are no doubt some
of the quietest casinos around.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas itself is not expected to suffer much because its
billion-dollar resorts offer entertainment beyond gambling. The
city has continued to grow despite the advent of gambling in
numerous other states. Indeed, there is some evidence that gambling
elsewhere only whets people's appetite for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Las Vegas is going to be reproduced in Palm
Springs,'' said Ellis Landau, chief financial officer of Boyd
Gaming, which runs four hotels in Las Vegas. While there are four
casinos in the Palm Springs area, they are spread apart.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno and Laughlin, which have fewer nongambling amenities
and are more dependent than Las Vegas on people driving from
California, could be hit harder. Harry C. Curtis, an analyst at
Robertson Stephens, estimates that casino earnings in those cities
could drop 15 to 20 percent in 2001, but recover later.
</P>
<P>
   Harry York, chief executive of the Reno-Sparks Chamber of
Commerce, said the expansion of California gaming was ``definitely
something we have to reckon with and deal with, but it's not going
to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city was renovating its downtown and advertising
itself as a place for more than just gambling. And while 30 percent
of the economy is directly dependent on gambling, that number has
dropped as the city has diversified. For example, it has attracted
a big Amazon.com distribution center.
</P>
<P>
   But some people gambling here say they already visit Nevada
less. ``It's better than having to drive to Vegas,'' said Rita
Recio, from near Los Angeles, who was playing a slot machine in the
Palm Springs casino. The lack of clanging coins and the makeshift
environment did not bother her. ``I didn't even notice it was a
tent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people interviewed said they supported the casinos, which
they said had helped the economy and provided entertainment for the
many retirees here. But there was some concern about casinos
growing too rapidly or the area becoming too much like Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see the smallness of it change,'' said Marjorie
Young, who has lived in Palm Springs for 24 years and gambles at
the Spa Casino twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Palms Springs casino has attracted some local opposition,
especially because of its garish electric sign, which some see as
clashing with the city's more subdued ambience. But Milanovich, the
tribal chairman, said the new casino would blend in.
</P>
<P>
   As for Trump, some gamblers were puzzled about what a big
developer could want with a little casino like this. ``Compared to
Mirage and MGM Grand it seems a rather small type of thing,'' said
Joe Preece, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some said the money could help. Elaine Pandl, visiting
from Wisconsin, said she found the casino a bit ``tacky,'' but when
she heard of Trump's involvement added, ``Maybe he'll put in a new
carpet.''

NEW YORK PLAN ADDRESSES ABANDONMENT OF NEWBORNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Desperate parents who do not want their newborn
babies would be able to abandon them at hospitals or other safe
places without fear of criminal prosecution, under legislation
endorsed Thursday by the Republican leaders of the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators said the proposal was intended to address the
growing problem of infants who are left to die every year in trash
containers, bathrooms and other dangerous hiding places. Under
state law, a mother who leaves a baby at a hospital without
identifying herself or taking other legal steps for adoption faces
arrest for child abandonment, a felony with a maximum penalty of 16
months to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Most hospitals routinely notify law-enforcement officials about
babies left at their doors, but many of the parents are never
prosecuted. The number of arrests for child abandonment has
declined statewide, from 78 in 1997 to 57 last year, according to
statistics provided by the Division of Criminal Justice Services.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's main sponsor, Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann,
R-Syracuse, said a young unwed mother can be so afraid, or ashamed
to tell her parents about her pregnancy, that she will hide it at
any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost impossible to anybody who hasn't been there to
understand how any woman or young girl can go all the way through a
full-term pregnancy without getting help for herself and her unborn
child,'' she said. ``But that is a fact of life. We're not going to
be able to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal seemingly unites a diverse group of family
advocates and lawmakers, although the Democratic leaders of the
Assembly have not yet taken a position.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen states, including New Jersey and California,
have introduced legislation that would allow parents to avoid
prosecution for abandonment, provided that the infant is left in a
safe place or with a responsible person, like an emergency-room
worker. In September, Texas became the first state to enact such a
law, but children's advocates said it was still too early to tell
whether the law had made an impact.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the change in the law would essentially legalize a
practice that has been in place for years in Syracuse and western
parts of the state, several lawmakers and prosecutors said.
Although no statistics are available, Hoffmann said she had worked
with prosecutors and hospitals to ensure that desperate parents
could leave their babies at certain hospitals without being charged
with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers on Thursday also endorsed a pilot program
for the Albany region that would offer amnesty to parents who
abandon infants within 72 hours of their birth at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth R. Bruno, the Rensselaer County district attorney, said
he was contacting district attorneys and hospitals to participate
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be criticism of this program,'' Bruno said,
``but we all believe it is much more important to try to prevent a
homicide from happening than it is to deal with someone who
abandons their child.'' His father, Joseph Bruno, the Senate
majority leader, endorsed the pilot project and the bill on
Thursday at a Capitol news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cases in which babies are found dead in trash bins or other
hiding places tend to get a lot of attention, like the one
involving a New Jersey teen-ager who gave birth in the bathroom at
her senior prom and left the newborn wrapped in plastic. But there
are only sketchy national statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 105 abandonments in public places, and 33 of
the babies were found dead, according to a review of news reports
by the Department of Health and Human Services that suggested such
incidents were on the rise. That same year, officials said, 31,000
babies were left at hospitals, many by drug addicted or
HIV-positive mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann's bill, which was submitted last month, calls for an
``affirmative defense'' that would allow parents to avoid criminal
prosecution for abandonment if their intention was to safeguard
their babies' lives by leaving them in a safe place. Joseph Bruno
said the bill would be amended in the next few weeks as lawmakers
studied the legislation in Texas and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill would most likely outline a comprehensive
approach to addressing the problem of abandoned babies, Hoffmann
said. In Syracuse, for instance, local officials not only contacted
hospitals but also tried to inform young parents about their
options by broadcasting radio and television commercials, passing
out fliers in schools and establishing a crisis hot line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Joan Christensen, D-Syracuse, who has worked with
Hoffmann on this issue, is sponsoring a version of the legislation
in the Democratic-controlled Assembly. But Assembly leaders,
including Speaker Sheldon Silver, have not yet taken a position.
Patricia Lynch, Silver's spokeswoman, said it was under review.
</P>
<P>
   Several advocacy groups for children and families expressed
their support Thursday. ``Women in these desperate circumstances
need a safe place to turn to,'' said Patricia McGeown, executive
director of the Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood in Albany. But she
also stressed that more sex education and counseling programs were
needed to prevent the unwanted pregnancies.

MORE TALK, BUT NO WORD ON JETS DEALING JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson's future with the New York Jets remained in
limbo Thursday, even as a high-ranking team official said that the
trade talk surrounding Johnson this week has been overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Clark, the Cleveland Browns' vice president and director
of football operations, acknowledged Thursday that Bill Parcells
had spoken with the Browns' coach, Chris Palmer, but Clark said no
trade had been offered and that Parcells had just been testing the
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who hold the 13th and 27th overall
picks in the draft, have also spoken with Parcells, the Jets'
director of football operations. Parcells may be trying to
accumulate picks in an effort to offer an enticing package to a
team that holds one of the top few choices.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has talked with at least six teams about Johnson, a
National Football League executive said, including the teams that
hold the top five picks: Cleveland, Washington (which has the
second and third selections), Cincinnati and Baltimore. Ultimately,
though, the Jets' new head coach, Al Groh, has the final say on
personnel matters, a power that Parcells himself ceded to Groh when
he named Groh as his successor. The Jets declined comment Thursday
through a team spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, with the top pick in the April draft, had once
seemed unlikely to trade away the chance to select the Florida
State wide receiver Peter Warrick. But after seeing the Penn State
defensive lineman Courtney Brown _ whom Parcells is thought to
covet _ and his college teammate, linebacker LaVar Arrington, Clark
said the Browns' plans may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   That could affect the Jets. After a woeful expansion season, the
Browns might be hard-pressed to ignore a deal for several draft
picks. The Jets already have the 16th and 18th picks in the first
round, and if a deal is completed for Johnson, the Jets would
likely package whatever picks are gained from the trade to try to
move up into the top four slots of a draft that is thought to have
just four superstar players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we'll keep the pick,'' Clark said. ``But if
there's an unbelievable deal that comes across, then we'll have to
take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark added: ``Coach Parcells is very sly. And he plays this
cat-and-mouse game better than anybody. So if he's saying Courtney
Brown, you really have no idea. He could be saying Courtney Brown
to throw everybody off or it could be true. Who knows? I personally
think he wants LaVar Arrington, because LaVar Arrington is Lawrence
Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals, a team with a well-known desire to keep costs down,
are not opposed to moving down in the draft, the team's director of
pro personnel, Jim Lippincott, said. The Ravens, too, seem
interested in trying to make a deal with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But the window of opportunity may be rapidly closing. Ravens
Coach Brian Billick, who has been remarkably candid about his
team's interest in Johnson, said Thursday that the Ravens would
probably call the Jets last night or Friday morning to ask them
what is going on. Ever since the Ravens told the Jets the
parameters in which they would work to try to make a deal _ the
Ravens want to talk to Johnson and his agent, Jerome Stanley _ they
have not heard back from the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the gamesmanship you play,'' Billick said. ``We've
set some parameters as far as how far we can go time-wise. There is
coming a point very quickly where this is prohibiting us from doing
other things. There comes a point where our timetable is going to
force us to say, `You need to respond or we'll move on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Billick said he would not like to see the Ravens' involvement
drag on past the weekend if the Jets do not indicate interest in
working toward a deal. Still, Billick remains optimistic that if
the Jets are interested, a deal could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the right place and we have the resources available
to us, because we've been cap conservative,'' Billick said.  &QL;

GIULIANI DREW DONATIONS FROM 49 STATES LAST YEAR
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Senate campaign received
contributions last year from donors in every state except North
Dakota, attracting an even broader geographic spectrum of financial
support than his rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a
report Thursday by a nonpartisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, by the Center for Responsive Politics,
criticized the Giuliani campaign sharply for failing to provide
full disclosure of its largest donors, saying that 21 percent of
those contributing $200 or more had not specified their occupations
or employers in filings with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that data, it is impossible to identify the donors'
economic interests,'' said the report, which followed a separate
report in late February by the same group on Clinton's
contributors. It found that the Clinton campaign had identified the
occupations and employers of more than 90 percent of its donors who
gave $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism provoked a sharp exchange between campaign
advisers, with Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, charging in a
news release that the Giuliani camp was ``evading campaign laws by
refusing to tell the people of New York what his donors do for a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Although federal election guidelines require candidates to seek
and disclose information on their donors' employment, there is a
gray area in that donors are under no obligation to disclose what
they do or where they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton's press secretary either doesn't know what he is
talking about or doesn't care,'' said John H. Gross, the Giuliani
campaign treasurer. He said the mayor's campaign staff had ``fully
complied'' with federal rules by asking for employment information
in its direct mailings to potential donors and in follow-up letters
to people who sent contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Giuliani's campaign raised $11.8 million
last year from donors in 49 states, compared with Clinton's
campaign contributions of $8.1 million from donors in 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   It said that the largest source of financial support for the
mayor came from people in the financial industry, based in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier report on the Clinton campaign found its biggest
source of support was among lawyers and people in the entertainment
industry.

<P>
   William Donald Hamilton, one of the towering figures of modern
biology and the man who helped to unify Darwin's principles of
natural selection with a rigorous understanding of Mendelian
genetics, died on Tuesday in Oxford, England. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was best known for a theory offering a genetic basis
for altruism, the inspiration for Richard Dawkins' best-selling
popularization, ``The Selfish Gene,'' and for such well-known work
by E.O. Wilson as ``Sociobiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex Hospital in London, where Hamilton had spent the
previous six weeks, said the cause of death was malaria contracted
on a recent expedition to Congo. He was there seeking evidence to
bolster a radical hypothesis that the AIDS epidemic can be traced
to contaminated polio vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Hamilton said his zealous pursuit of the theory
was characteristic of his unslakable intellectual curiosity and his
interest in ideas that others might initially dismiss as
half-baked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed that if you have a weird idea that sounds wrong at
first, you should give it a chance before you throw it out,'' said
Nancy Moran, a biologist at the University of Arizona who studied
with Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a professor at Oxford University since 1984, burst
into the field of evolution while still a graduate student at
Cambridge University. In 1963 and 1964, he published two papers
based on his doctoral work that have proved so seminal to
evolutionary biology that it is virtually impossible to read a
contemporary study in the discipline without encountering his name
and the term he coined, inclusive fitness, also known as kin
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Through the model of inclusive fitness, Hamilton proposed an
elegant and mathematically sophisticated way of understanding
altruistic behavior, a problem that had baffled naturalists from
Darwin onward.
</P>
<P>
   If organisms are inherently selfish, and supposedly devoted to
personal survival and reproduction, why, scientists wondered, do so
many species display seemingly self-sacrificial behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Why, for example, do worker bees forsake the opportunity to
breed in favor of caring for the queen's young? And why will those
infertile auntie bees commit suicide in defense of the hive?
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton realized that the unusual genetic structure of the bees
resulted in the workers' being so closely related to one another
that, in slaving for the hive, they were essentially slaving for
the persistence of their own gene pool. In other words, although
they appeared altruistic, they were, from a gene's-eye view,
behaving with characteristic selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton thus recast the concept of fitness, that is, an
individual's success in reproducing, to incorporate the survival
and reproductive success of the creature's close relatives _ hence
the term inclusive fitness. In so doing, he merged Darwin's focus
on individual animals' competing for the privilege of siring the
next generation with Mendel's studies of how distinct genetic
traits are transmitted over time.
</P>
<P>
   The idea can be roughly understood by one biologist's remark in
a pub that he would ``gladly die for two brothers, four cousins or
eight second cousins,'' each of them carrying the requisite
percentage of the individual's genes to compensate for the mortal
deed.
</P>
<P>
   Though human altruism is more complicated than that, and people
are capable of behaving with profound self-sacrifice for
nonrelatives, research has shown that the general principles of
inclusive fitness and kin selection apply throughout the natural
world, and in many human transactions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton also published important papers explaining what he
called ``extraordinary'' sex ratios, which occur when an organism
produces far more offspring of one sex than the other.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he sought to understand the existence of sex, and
why most species propagate sexually rather than asexually. He
suggested that sexual reproduction, by continually shaking up the
genome, helps to keep organisms one step ahead of their parasites,
which might be capable of annihilating a population of asexually
spawned clones. The parasite-avoidance hypothesis of sex remains
debatable, but many studies of how animals choose their mates at
least partly support it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who made insects the focus of his work, was as
renowned as a natural historian as he was as a theorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best field biologist I've ever met,'' said Marlene
Zuk, a biologist at the University of California at Riverside who
studied with him in the 1980s at the University of Michigan. ``If
you went out with him in England, he could identify every bird,
every plant, every insect, practically every microorganism he
encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   He had feelings of fraternity with the objects he studied, even
when they were, say, wingless male fig wasps in combat. In a 1996
collection of his papers called ``Narrow Roads of Gene Land,'' he
wrote, ``A male's fighting movements can be summarized thus: touch,
freeze, approach slowly, strike, and recoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the wasp's fighting style might look cowardly, he
continued, it becomes understandable if one likens it ``in human
terms to a darkened room of full of jostling people'' among whom
are ``a dozen or so maniacal homicides armed with knives.''
</P>
<P>
   William Donald Hamilton was born on Aug. 1, 1936, in Cairo, but
moved to England as a young child. He was educated at Tonbridge
School and St. John's College, Cambridge. He was a large, vigorous
man with a full head of white hair, who could be seen in the early
morning doing pull-ups from a tree. Friends said he was reclusive,
almost shy, but that he was also a risk-taker, physically as well
as intellectually. As a teen-ager, he blew off parts of two fingers
in an experiment with explosive chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's close observations of the natural world made him
rethink phenomena that others took for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he suggested that autumn leaves turn brilliant colors
not simply as a result of their loss of green chlorophyll, as is
commonly believed, but as a way to warn off insect pests that might
lay eggs on the tree, red and orange being common warning colors in
nature. He has also argued that cloud formations are actually
bacterial dispersal vehicles, for microbes have been found in
abundance in clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was a member of the Royal Society of London and the
winner of many prizes, including the Darwin Medal, the Linnean
Medal and the Crafoord Prize, awarded by the Swedish Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   He was separated from his wife, Christine Friess. He is survived
by their three daughters and by his partner, Luisa Bozzi.  &QL;

QWEST FAILS TO PERSUADE US WEST TO BACK DEUTSCHE TELEKOM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A last-ditch effort by Qwest Communications International to
rekindle its negotiations to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom of
Germany ended Thursday as Qwest failed to persuade US West, its
previous merger partner, to go along with a Deutsche Telekom deal.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, which has never publicly acknowledged that it was in
talks with the German company, said in a statement Thursday night
that a ``major telecommunications company has withdrawn from
discussions to acquire Qwest and US West.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks between Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telephone
company, and Qwest effectively ended on Tuesday when the German
company realized that any deal with Qwest would be plagued by
complications. Most important, there was no realistic way to
extricate Qwest from its previous agreement to acquire US West, the
smallest of the Bell local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   US West, a relatively stodgy old-line phone company, was far
less attractive to Deutsche Telekom than was Qwest, a young upstart
that has built an advanced national fiber-optic network and that is
selling Internet services to exploit that system. Deutsche Telekom
would have had to pay at least $100 billion to acquire the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman, indicated that
he was exploring ways to negate his deal to acquire US West. But
had Qwest tried to back out of its deal with US West to pursue a
solo acquisition by Deutsche Telekom, US West might have exposed
Deutsche Telekom to billions of dollars of liability for
interfering with the original pact between US West and Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Nacchio embarked on a last-minute effort to bring
Deutsche Telekom back to the bargaining table, said executives
close to the talks. After perhaps two weeks of talking with the
German company on his own, it appeared critical that Nacchio now
bring US West into direct contact with Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, people close to Qwest said that US West executives
refused to meet with their German counterparts, though other people
close to the talks contradicted them. Either way, Nacchio's effort
failed.
</P>
<P>
   In Qwest's statement late Thursday, Nacchio said, ``We regret
that US West apparently wouldn't even consider an alternative
transaction involving a major telecommunications company and Qwest
despite the possibility of greater value for US West
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Qwest's closing share price Thursday of $57.1875, US
West's shareholders were set to receive about $51 billion in Qwest
stock for their company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said that US West realized that
Deutsche Telekom was not prepared to match that figure. Deutsche
Telekom was, however, prepared to pay more than the $39 billion
that US West was to receive before Qwest's stock spiked on reports
of the Deutsche Telekom discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued several hours before Qwest's announcement,
US West said that any deal to be acquired by a company other than
Qwest ``must also be better than or consistent with our existing
transaction with Qwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said that one of US West's
priorities was simply to close its deal with Qwest. Once that
happens later this year, perhaps the combined US West-Qwest will
re-enter talks to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom.

EXCERPTS FROM MCCAIN'S PARTING SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech in Sedona, Ariz., on
Thursday in which Sen. John McCain announced his withdrawal for the
presidential campaign, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   We knew when we began this campaign that ours was a difficult
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday that challenge became considerably more difficult
as a majority of Republican voters made clear their preference for
president is Governor Bush. I respect their decision. And I'm truly
grateful for the distinct privilege of even being considered for
the highest office in this, the greatest nation in the history of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore I announce today, on this fine Arizona morning and in
this beautiful place, that I am no longer an active candidate for
my party's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   I congratulate Governor Bush and wish him and his family well.
He may very well become the next president of the United States.
That is an honor accorded to very few and is such a great
responsibility that he deserves the best wishes of every American.
He certainly has mine.
</P>
<P>
   I'm suspending my campaign so that Cindy and I can take some
time to reflect on our recent experiences and determine how we can
best continue to serve the country and help bring about the changes
to the practices and institutions of our great democracy that are
the purpose of our campaign....
</P>
<P>
   I hoped our campaign would be a force for change in the
Republican Party, and I believe we have, indeed, set a course that
will ultimately prevail in making our party as big as the country
we serve.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans have rallied to our banner. And their
support not just honors me, but has ignited the cause of reform, a
cause far greater and more important than the ambitions of any
single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   I love my party. It is my home. Ours is the party of Lincoln,
Roosevelt and Reagan. That's good company for any American to keep.
And it is a distinct privilege to serve the same cause that those
great Americans dedicated their lives to.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm also dedicated to the necessary cause of reform. And I
will never walk away from a fight for what I know is right and just
for our country.
</P>
<P>
   As I said throughout the campaign, what is good for my country
is good for my party. Should our party ever abandon this principle,
the American people will rightly abandon us and we will surely slip
into the mists of history, deserving the allegiance of none.
</P>
<P>
   So I will take our crusade back to the United States Senate. And
I will keep fighting to save the government _ to give the
government back to the people, to keep our promises to young and
old alike by paying our debts, saving Social Security and Medicare
and reforming a tax code that benefits the powerful few at the
expense of many.
</P>
<P>
   And with your help, my fellow Americans, we will keep trying to
force open doors where there are walls to your full participation
in the great enterprises of our democracy, be they walls of
cynicism or intolerance or walls raised by self-interested elite
who would exclude your voice from the highest councils of our
government.
</P>
<P>
   I want to take a final moment to speak to all those who joined
our party to support our campaign, many of whom voted in this
election for the first time. Thank you. Thank you from the bottom
of my heart. Your support means more to me than I can ever say.
</P>
<P>
   But I ask from you one last promise: Promise me that you will
never give up, that you will continue your service in the worthy
cause of revitalizing our democracy....You served your country in
this campaign by fighting for the causes that will sustain
America's greatness. Keep fighting, my friends, keep fighting.
America needs you.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, my friends. Thank you so much for helping me remember
what it means to be a public servant in this, the most blessed and
most important nation on earth.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the greatest privilege of my life.

NEW CANDIDATE FOR IMF POST IS WELL VERSED IN POST-SOVIET TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Just four months ago, as rumors swirled about likely
candidates for the top job at the International Monetary Fund,
Horst Koehler, the German head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, decided to issue a one-line
statement that he was not in the running. How things change.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after a telephone call from Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, Koehler told his staff that if the majority of the IMF's
shareholders wanted him as managing director, ``then I would not
decline that request.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a cautious and noncommittal way of accepting an offer
that Schroeder clearly did not want him to refuse after the
withdrawal of an earlier German candidate, Caio Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with Koch-Weser's contentious candidacy, Koehler _ a
57-year-old former Finance Ministry official with an impressive
record in gluing the financial underpinnings of both German
reunification and the European single currency _ has become mired
in a trans-Atlantic debate over his credentials to head the IMF,
one of the world's most influential financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was not available for comment, his aides said Thursday.
But they insisted that he did not invite the present situation.
``He was approached,'' one aide said. ``He didn't pursue this.''
What made the difference between his statement last November and
his attitude this week, the aide said, was simple: ``He got a call
from the chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   Wishing to avoid a second embarrassment over an unpopular
candidate, Schroeder has been making quite a few calls to win an
endorsement of Koehler, and he has insisted that that support is
building.
</P>
<P>
   Even Thursday, the chancellor said he received a pledge of
backing from Britain. But the British government declined to state
its position, adding to the uncertainty surrounding Koehler's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In money terms, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development that Koehler heads is not in the same league as the
IMF. Last year, it made a modest profit of $42 million.
Significantly, though, the year before, its exposure in Russia
contributed to a $260 million loss.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler joined the organization just two weeks after Russia
defaulted on some of its debt and has overseen the bank's recovery.
``The bank didn't lose its way'' after the Russia crisis, said Mark
Milner, a British financial journalist who covers the bank. ``It
didn't lose its nerve, which it might easily have done.''
</P>
<P>
   But its scope is also narrower than the IMF's. Established in
1991 to help build market economies and democracy in the old Soviet
bloc, the bank operates in 26 countries from Russia to Albania. It
primarily invests in business-sector projects, drawing capital into
enterprises it supports. So far, it has sunk $13 billion into
projects it values in total around $47 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The European bank's image, however, is tarnished with the
excesses of its early years when its director, Jacques Attali of
France, was accused of running an institution that financed itself
more than the fledgling businesses of Eastern Europe. In excess of
$1 million was reportedly spent on replacing the marble in its
London entrance lobby, prompting some to ask if the bank was needed
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler has tried to move the bank away from those perceptions,
even though it remains a top-heavy institution with 23 directors
and an array of governors. ``He wants to get out and see what the
money is doing,'' said Barbara Clay, the bank's spokeswoman. ``He's
a very hands-on guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is the bank the only measure of his portfolio. As a
senior German official, Koehler was involved in the negotiations
leading to his country's reunification and European monetary union
in the early 1990s. In Germany, he played a central role in
privatizing the ruined economic institutions of East Germany. And
as the German ``sherpa'' to the Group of Seven industrial nations
_the nickname given the officials who prepare top-level meetings _
he has traveled widely.
</P>
<P>
   During the Asian economic crisis, he was dispatched to Indonesia
to discuss a German role in recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's association with the European bank has strengthened an
appearance of close ties with Eastern and Central Europe that go
back to his birth in Poland in 1943 and his childhood in eastern
Germany before his family fled to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a good background,'' he said in a published
interview last year. ``I have a certain understanding of the
emotions, of the psychology of the people who live in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The question raised in European capitals is whether he is
focused too narrowly on the former East bloc and on the minutiae of
the region's transition from Communism to market economics.
</P>
<P>
   Aides have sought to portray Koehler as an investment-oriented
businessman running a for-profit bank. Moreover, they say, Koehler
spent time in private business from 1993 to 1998 as president of
the German Savings Bank Association. And, his backers say, he has a
wide range of government and business contacts.
</P>
<P>
   People who work with him depict him as intense and impatient.
``He's got a passionate but logical view of the way the world ought
to work,'' a co-worker said. ``Once he has got a strategy, he likes
to see it put in place real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who have met him argue that his experience may be
perceived in Washington and elsewhere as limited. ``It's a question
of whether he could become a global player,'' a British banker
said. ``He's running an international financial institute, that's
true. But it's not the biggest one in the world.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Calling New York's Republican presidential
primary system ``absolute nonsense,'' the Republican leader of the
state Senate called Thursday for top-to-bottom reform, making
ballots easier to understand, and making it simpler for candidates
to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal by Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader,
reflected his impatience with Gov. George Pataki, a fellow
Republican who had signaled that he was in no hurry to revise the
rules, and it widened the growing rift between them.
</P>
<P>
   It also appeared that Bruno had forced the governor's hand.
Michael McKeon, Pataki's press secretary, at first said there was
no urgency to changing the rules, but Thursday evening he said that
the governor would make his own proposal. ``I would expect
something sooner rather than later,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Pataki and Bruno have skirmished over Bruno's
efforts to strike out independently on issues while the governor's
aides have insisted that Bruno defer to Pataki. Last month, Bruno
said that on ballot reform, he would do just that, waiting for the
governor to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last two months, New York's Republicans have taken a
steady drubbing from Sen. John McCain and his supporters, from
newspaper editorials and from election reform groups _ first for
the complicated rules that the party establishment used in an
unsuccessful effort to keep McCain off the ballot and then for the
equally convoluted structure of the ballot itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats in the Senate, hoping to embarrass Republicans and
pick up a few seats in November, have called for changes in the
primary system, as has the Republican minority in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was clearly concerned that the whole affair had tainted
Republican legislators, 21 of whom were on Tuesday's ballot as
delegates for George W. Bush. Bruno, who himself was elected a Bush
delegate, Thursday took the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the Senate are going to move diligently to correct a
system that we believe to be faulty,'' he said at a news conference
in the Senate majority's oak-paneled conference room in the
Capitol. ``It was absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial response from the governor's office was tepid, as
McKeon declined to comment directly on Bruno's statements, noting
that the issue need not be decided soon because it ``won't be
relevant again until 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``We fully expect to continue to embrace reform ideas
that make the process even more user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, advisers to the governor were irritated that once
again, Bruno had taken the lead.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republicans and Democrats have long had an
understanding that the lawmakers in each party can devise their own
primary rules. In other words, if the Senate and the governor
agreed on a new set of rules, then the Democrats who control the
Assembly would not stand in the way. Thus, the only obstacle to
Bruno's aims is Pataki, who will come under pressure to follow the
Senate's lead or risk being tagged an opponent of reform.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what the Democrats would do if the Senate
passes a bill that Pataki opposes. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
declined to comment on Bruno's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters complained that they had difficulty understanding
the Republican primary ballot, which showed delegates' names in
large type, with the names of the presidential candidates whom
those delegates supported listed below, in much smaller print. Some
voters said they had trouble reading the candidates' names, or did
not understand that they could vote for up to three delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was too much confusion,'' Bruno said. ``What
we want is a system where people can be confident and comfortable
that they voted the way they intended to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno declined to make his proposals specific, saying that no
bill had been drafted yet, but he said he wanted to remove
obstacles to having the names of well-known candidates placed on
the ballot. ``We're taking a look at something that will be rather
comprehensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, well-known candidates are automatically placed
on the ballot, and in others, only a filing fee is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Republican Party's rules are widely considered the
most difficult in the nation. They require the collection of
thousands of registered Republicans' signatures, with a certain
number needed in each congressional district, including districts
in New York City where Republicans are exceedingly rare. New York's
election law also gives candidates ample room to knock one another
off the ballot by challenging their opponents' signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal judge ordered all candidates placed on all
ballots, but the effort to prevent McCain from competing left a
sour taste for some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who bowed out of the presidential race Thursday, ran
strong in New York but lost. He won just four of contests in 13
states on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' presidential rules in New York are strikingly
different from the Republicans', with less onerous signature
requirements, and voters vote directly for the candidates as well
as for the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, meeting Thursday with reporters at state party
headquarters here, said, ``I'm not opposed to change,'' but
declined to take a stand on what Bruno had said.
</P>
<P>
   For politicians who ran as Bush delegates, the last month has
been harrowing. Many were recruited as delegates last year by
Pataki, with assurances that there would be no real contest, then
suddenly found themselves in a race. Some lost, a serious blow to
their prestige; others had close calls; and many said they would
welcome rules changes that would avoid a reprise.

BELFOUR SULLIES STARS' FORMERLY CLEAN IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amply polished and deftly marketed, the Dallas Stars heretofore
have been the choir boys of the local sports scene.
</P>
<P>
   From the star of Stars, Mike Modano, every local mother's
wannabe son, to the head coach, the engaging Ken Hitchcock, the
Stars' image in the area community has been Zambonied clean.
</P>
<P>
   They are not about nose rings or feather boas. Their star
receiver didn't wear a fur coat and designer shades to testify
before the grand jury. Their right fielder never pulled out of a
game because his pants were too large.
</P>
<P>
   Until the wee hours of Wednesday morning, the Stars had almost
basked in antiseptic charm. Lord Stanley himself, fans here smugly
assumed, would have been proud.
</P>
<P>
   Except that somewhere on the wrong side of midnight that night,
the star goaltender got Maced. That was before Dallas police
slapped handcuffs and leg-irons on him, but after he had caught the
hotel guy in a 15-minute headlock.
</P>
<P>
   Boys will be boys. But judging by the police report, this was an
acute case of drunken stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   We only know what the report says. Yet Ed Belfour's behavior
Wednesday morning was loutish, even for a goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The police report reads like a scene from Slapshot, Hollywood's
cult salute to goon hockey. Wall-slams and headlocks are part of
hockey's ancient mating ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was a woman involved. She told police that Belfour
scared her.
</P>
<P>
   We know. Belfour has eyes that glaze with mischief.
</P>
<P>
   The woman appears to have been only a catalyst in the early
morning saga. The more troubling scenes are the alleged ones
involving Belfour's attack on the hotel employee, his resistance
when police arrived, and his misbehavior inside the jailhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, was it the alcohol, or was it Eddie?
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars organization stepped aside Thursday, NHL
substance-abuse investigators began to dig deep. If Belfour has a
problem, whether it be alcohol or his behavior, the NHL people are
expected to identify it and deal accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour could be back playing next week. On the other hand,
Belfour could be back next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know when or how long this is going to take,''
Hitchcock said Thursday. ``The way the NHL handles it, it pretty
much takes us out of the picture right now.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are ready to welcome him back. Concern and support
for Belfour has been unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest part is going to be coming back into our group,''
Hitchcock said. ``The easiest part will be the playing of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a well-respected person who means a lot to our team and
has gone through a lot with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Stars lineup, therefore, won't be difficult for
Belfour. In a season beset with injuries, the Stars can do without
another of their top players for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the abuse that will be showered upon Belfour on the
road is something the team can deal with. As a rule, Belfour
provokes enemy ticket-buyers and sets them to chanting.
</P>
<P>
   No, that won't be the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's biggest hurdle will be the NHL's diagnosis. There
could be an after-care program. Weekly _ or even more frequent _
testing. Even if the Stars add nothing to Belfour's ``punishment,''
the NHL substance-abuse people could place him on a figurative,
well-confined leash.
</P>
<P>
   The public? Belfour figures to get more get-well cards than
tsk-tsks. Next to golden boy Modano, he could well be the most
popular member of the Stanley Cup champions. He has been an avid
supporter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Stars have earned considerable slack. It's
going to drive the arrogant Cowboys front office crazy. Where are
the three-inch headlines, they'll want to know? Where's the public
outcry, the Channel 5 reports?
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any. The Stars' reputation, unlike the Jones-era
Cowboys, is almost Disneyesque.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans' greatest fear today isn't Belfour's likely future
court date _ it's when he will return to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   For his sake, hopefully that day is soon. Soberingly soon. nn

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ For three generations, a family in Chapala, an hour's
drive from Guadalajara in western Mexico, quietly produced a hot
sauce called Cholula. They named it after the oldest inhabited city
in the country that is also famous for its 365 churches (the name
was derived from chollollan, meaning ``the place of retreat'').
Cholula hot sauce was primarily used as an ingredient in Sangrita,
a bloody red mixture of orange, tomato and lime juices, onion and
hot sauce used by traditional tequila drinkers as a chaser.
 &HT;    Executives from Jose Cuervo heard about the hot sauce and began
inquiring about it. The Mexico City-based tequila company ended up
buying the license for Cholula more than 10 years ago and began
marketing it in Mexico. In 1989, the company introduced the hot
sauce stateside, in Austin, Texas. By the early 1990s, Cholula
started finding its way into specialty food shops and on tabletops
in restaurants across the southwestern United States, from taco
stands to fine dining rooms.
 &HT;    ``It's the best out there; we buy it by the half gallon,'' says
Steve Kraft, who's been using it in recipes at his acclaimed San
Antonio burrito shop, Habanero's Grill, since it opened three years
ago (his specialty: onions grilled in Cholula). ``It's got the
right level of heat and flavor. Out of the 20 hot sauces we have in
our kitchen, it's the smoothest.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Cuervo began to really push its fiery sauce into
the United States. In the spring of 1998, Jose Cuervo hired Charlie
Watkins, a well-known Houston chef and co-owner of Sierra Grill, as
Cholula's spokesperson. The company sent him on a 12-U.S. city tour
to cook up Cholula-laced dishes for food editors and TV talk shows.
It began running advertisements in trade magazines and coupons in
newspaper circulars, calling Cholula ``the perfect complement.'' It
even offered a US$1 booklet featuring 22 recipes that use Cholula,
from ``Tequila Filet Saute'' to a drink called ``The Mexican
Standoff'' _ a mixture of one cup ice, 1 1/2 ounces of Cuervo
Especial, one teaspoon Cholula and four ounces of pink grapefruit
juice.
 &HT;    As a result of those efforts, Cholula has taken off. From
Florida to Colorado to California, the hot sauce is being shaken
over everything from tacos to eggs to pasta. Many noted chefs use
it as their secret ingredient, from Hans Rocken-wagner, who
sprinkles it on Spanish paella at his eponymous restaurant in Santa
Monica, California, to David Wooley, who folds it into his
``Wrangler's Meatloaf'' at the Antero Grill in Salida, Colorado, to
Tony Sindaco, who includes it in his mango salsa at the Sunfish
Grill in Pompano Beach, Florida.
 &HT;    With the growing presence of Mexican-Americans in the United
States, spicy food is hot. Sales of hot sauce continue to grow, to
$1.7 billion per year in both restaurant and retail sales. ``It's
gone from being a specialty item to a common supermarket item,''
says Robb Walsh, editor in chief of Fort Worth-based Chili Pepper
magazine.
 &HT;    Cholula is riding that wave. According to Information Resources
Inc., a market research firm in Chicago, Cholula is the
eighth-ranked hot sauce in the U.S. in terms of retail sales, with
2.7 percent, or $3 million, of the $111 million market in the 12
months ending July 18. While it obviously has a long way to go to
reach granddaddy Tabasco, which controls 23.2 percent of the market
with $26 million in sales, Cholula is growing fast: The brand
showed sales growth of 27.6 percent in the period, versus 8 percent
for Tabasco. (A spokesman for Tabasco, which is produced on Avery
Island, Louisiana, by the McIlhenny Co., wouldn't comment on
Cholula's inroads, noting that it is still far down the list in
terms of market share.)
 &HT;    Allison Parker, national food service sales director at Jose
Cuervo International in San Antonio, says the company has been
focusing its marketing efforts on the food service business.
Indeed, it's become the number-one hot sauce sold through
distributors in the United States. (Tabasco has its own
distribution system). As far as consumers, it's been pretty much
word of mouth. ``Our marketing is still very grass roots,'' she
says. ``We've really built the brand case by case.''
 &HT;    What's in Cholula that makes it so special? Unlike Tabasco,
which is made with Tabasco peppers, Cholula is made with piquin
peppers, which are smaller, have softer skins and exude a more
delicate flavor. Piquin peppers are also not as hot: Tabasco
peppers rank near the top of the scale in terms of spiciness_
30,000 to 50,000 heat units (HU's) on the Scoville scale, which was
developed by Wilbur Scoville in 1912 as a test to measure the
hotness of different peppers. Piquins create only 3,600 HU's.
 &HT;    Houston chef and Cholula pitchman Watkins says the difference is
also in the mix of ingredients Cholula uses. Tabasco ages mashed
peppers and salt in white oak barrels, then blends the two with
vinegar, which he thinks dominates the taste. ``Cholula is better
than Tabasco, because you taste the peppers, not the vinegar and
wood,'' he says.
 &HT;    Cholula's packaging is also appealing. It comes in tiny, clear
glass bottle with an illustration of a smiling Mexican woman on a
rustic-looking orange label. But what has fascinated most is its
wooden cap, which screws tightly into the top of the bottle. It's
become something of a totem: Members of the California Carving
Guild hold annual contests in which woodworkers carve images into
the caps.
 &HT;    Besides pointing out its distinctive packaging, promoters like
to talk up Cholula's health benefits. Studies have shown that
capsaicin, the compound that makes chilies hot, stimulates the
glands in the mouth, throat and stomach to start producing water
fluids, which flush out bacteria. Capsaicin has also been shown to
trigger the brain to release the body's natural painkillers,
endorphins, creating a sense of euphoria. Some have even found
chili peppers effective in treating ``la cruda,'' otherwise known
as a hangover, by stimulating the need to drink fluids. To play up
these uses, Cholula has developed recipes for ``Cholula Chicken
Soup'' and an orange juice, honey and Cholula drink that it's
circulating on its website (www.cholula.com).
 &HT;    Cholula has had less luck with brand extensions. Last year, it
tested a Cholula picante sauce in Denver. But the competition
proved fierce, so it pulled it from the market. It's now trying
co-branding, teaming up with Irvine, California-based Classic Foods
Inc. to market a Cholula-flavored potato chip under the Kettle
brand. The perfect complement to a shot of Jose Cuervo tequila?

Soup'' and an orange juice, honey and Cholula drink that it's
circulating on its website (www.cholula.com).
 &HT;    Cholula has had less luck with brand extensions. Last year, it
tested a Cholula picante sauce in Denver. But the competition
proved fierce, so it pulled it from the market. It's now trying
co-branding, teaming up with Irvine, California-based Classic Foods
Inc. to market a Cholula-flavored potato chip under the Kettle
brand. The perfect complement to a shot of Jose Cuervo tequila?

   WASHINGTON _ The House agreed Thursday to raise the federal
minimum wage by $1 to $6.15 an hour but coupled the measure with a
$123 billion tax-cut package sponsored by the Republicans that
President Clinton had threatened to veto, imperiling the wage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans staged separate votes on the two measures, seeking
to defuse a politically potent Democratic issue in the November
election by promoting one of their own, tax cuts, then merged the
two measures into one bill. The political effect, however, is that
the measures cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote on the wage increase was 282-143. Earlier,
lawmakers voted 246-179 to approve a Democratic amendment that
would spread the increase over two years instead of three, which
would provide low-income workers with more money, faster. On that
vote, 42 Republicans joined 203 Democrats and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the tax cuts said they would ease the impact of
the wage increase on employers and poor rural and urban
communities. But Democrats denounced the measure as a gift to the
rich.
</P>
<P>
   That measure passed, 257-169, with 41 Democrats joining 215
Republicans and one independent in favor, and 167 Democrats, one
Republican and one independent voting against.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Senate approved an overhaul of bankruptcy laws
that included a $1 increase in the minimum wage over three years
and $76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years. House and Senate
negotiators must now reconcile the competing versions before a
final bill can be sent to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But looming over those talks is Clinton's threat to veto the
overall bill because the Republican tax breaks would gobble up too
much of the projected budget surplus that could be used to shore up
Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, the Republican leadership has derailed what should
be a simple vote on the minimum wage with a maximum of political
maneuvering,'' Clinton said before the vote. ``Congress should send
me a bill I can sign, not one I have to veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the tax bill's 10-year cost comes from a gradual
reduction in the estate tax, costing $78.6 billion over the decade,
with Democrats calling the measure tax breaks to people with
incomes over $319,000.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the House's passage last month of a bill to cut
taxes for married couples by $182 billion over the next decade,
Republicans have now approved two pillars of their $792 billion,
10-year tax plan that Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republicans have adopted the strategy of breaking out
important parts of that bill and ramming them through the House,
knowing that the measure's prospects in the Senate are uncertain
and that it is doomed at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But in an election year, House Republicans are willing to pocket
the floor votes as legislative triumphs and portray the White House
as out of step with public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, Democrats are fighting tax relief, all tax
relief,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the House Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The tax package also gradually increases the 401(k) contribution
limit and makes some other pension changes, makes health insurance
premiums fully tax deductible for self-employed people sooner than
under current law, increases the amount of business meals that can
be deducted, and repeals accounting rules that require
small-business owners to pay capital gains immediately on the sale
of their businesses, even if they are paid by the buyer in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans staged the dual votes Thursday night on the minimum
wage and tax breaks to prevent Democrats from pushing through their
own minimum wage increase, which has support from moderate
Republicans from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of waging a contentious battle as they did in 1996,
the last time Congress increased the minimum wage, Republican
leaders acknowledged that a minimum wage raise was an election-year
inevitability. The only questions centered on when the increases
would take effect and how large the corresponding tax cuts would
be.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 million full-time workers paid the minimum wage now
earn about $10,700 a year. Raising their wages to $6.15 an hour
would increase their annual earnings by $2,000, enough, supporters
say, for a low-income family of four to buy groceries for seven
months or pay rent for five months.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Durante tres generaciones, una familia de Chapala, a
una hora en automovil de Guadalajara, en el oeste de Mexico,
produjo calladamente una salsa picante llamada Cholula. La llamaron
asi por la ciudad habitada mas antigua del pais, tambien famosa por
sus 365 iglesias (el nombre se deriva de chollollan, que significa
``lugar de retiro''). La salsa picante Cholula se usaba sobre todo
como ingrediente de la sangrita, una mezcla roja de jugo de
naranja, tomate y limon, cebolla y salsa picante, que se toma
despues del tequila.
 &HT;    La salsa desperto la curiosidad de los ejecutivos del famoso
productor de tequila Jose Cuervo. La empresa termino comprando la
licencia de Cholula hace mas de 10 anos y comenzo a mercadearla en
Mexico. En 1989 lanzo la salsa en Austin, Texas. A principios de
los anos 90, Cholula se abrio paso en los establecimientos de
especialidades gastronomicas y en restaurantes del suroeste de
Estados Unidos, desde los puestos de tacos hasta los restaurantes
mas elegantes.
 &HT;    ``Es lo mejor que hay; la compramos en envases de medio galon,''
dice Steve Kraft, que la usa en recetas en su celebre restaurante
de San Antonio, Habanero's Grill, desde que lo abrio hace tres anos
(su especialidad: cebollas asadas a la parrilla en Cholula).
``Tiene el nivel correcto de picante y sabor. De las 20 salsas
picantes que tenemos en nuestra cocina, es la mas suave.''
 &HT;    Hace dos anos, Cuervo arrecio la campana por popularizar la
salsa en Estados Unidos. A principios de 1998, Jose Cuervo contrato
a Charlie Watkins, conocido chef de Houston y copropietario de
Sierra Grill, como portavoz de Cholula. La compania lo envio en una
gira por 12 ciudades norteamericanas para cocinar platos aderezados
con Cholula para criticos gastronomicos y programas de entrevistas
en television. Cuervo coloco anuncios en revistas comerciales y
cupones en periodicos que aseguraban que Cholula era el
``complemento perfecto.'' Incluso ofrecio un folleto de 22 recetas
con Cholula, desde el ``Tequila Filet Saute'' hasta una bebida
llamada ``The Mexican Standoff'': una taza de hielo, onza y media
de Cuervo Especial, una cucharadita de Cholula y cuatro onzas de
zumo de toronja rosada.
 &HT;    Desde la Florida hasta Colorado y California, la gente agrega
Cholula a los tacos, a la pasta y a otros platos. Muchos chefs
famosos la usan como ingrediente secreto, entre ellos Hans
Rockenwanger, que la agrega a la paella en su restaurante de Santa
Monica, California; y David Wooley, que la usa en su plato
``Wrangler's Meatloaf'' en el Antero Grill en Salida, Colorado, y
Tony Sindaco, que la anade a su salsa de mango en el Sunfish Grill
de Pompano Beach, Florida.
 &HT;    La gran cantidad de mexicanos y sus descendientes que viven en
Estados Unidos han popularizado la salsa picante. Y las ventas de
Cholula siguen creciendo. El mercado de salsas picantes mueve
US$1.700 millones al ano, tanto en restaurantes como en el sector
minorista. ``Ha pasado de ser un producto selecto a un articulo
comun en el supermercado,'' dice Robb Walsh, director de la revista
Chili Pepper, de Fort Worth.
 &HT;    Segun Information Resources Inc., firma de investigacion de
mercado de Chicago, Cholula es la octava salsa picante en Estados
Unidos en ventas minoristas, con el 2,7 por ciento, o US$3
millones, en un mercado de US$111 millones en los 12 meses que
concluyeron el 18 de julio. Aunque obviamente aun le falta mucho
para alcanzar al establecido Tabasco, que controla el 23,2 por
ciento del mercado con US$26 millones en ventas, Cholula crecio un
27,6 por ciento en ese periodo, frente al 8 por ciento de Tabasco.
(Un portavoz de Tabasco, que produce McIlhenny Co. en Avery Island,
Louisiana, no hizo comentarios sobre los avances de Cholula y
senalo que todavia esta muy a la zaga en participacion de mercado.)
 &HT;    Allison Parker, directora de servicios nacionales de
restaurantes de Jose Cuervo International en San Antonio, dice que
la compania ha estado concentrando su estrategia de mercadeo en el
negocio del servicio a restaurantes. En efecto, se ha convertido en
la salsa picante numero uno que se vende a traves de distribuidores
en Estados Unidos. En cuanto a los consumidores, se enteran de su
existencia por boca de conocidos. ``Nuestro mercadeo es
rudimentario,'' senala Parker. ``Fomentamos la marca caja por
caja.''
 &HT;    A diferencia de Tabasco, que se hace con pimientos de Tabasco,
la Cholula se prepara con pimientos piquin, mas pequenos, de piel
mas suave, sabor mas delicado y menos picantes. Los Tabasco estan
cerca de la cota superior de la escala de picor: de 30.000 a 50.000
unidades en la escala de Scoville, que creo Wilbur Scoville en 1912
para medir el grado de picor de las distintas variedades de
pimientos. Los piquin solo generan 3.600 unidades de calor.
 &HT;    Watkins, el chef de Houston y portavoz de Cholula, dice que la
diferencia tambien esta en la mezcla de ingredientes. Tabasco cura
pimientos macerados y sal en barriles de roble blanco y luego los
mezcla con vinagre, que segun Watkins es el ingrediente que domina
el sabor. ``Cholula es mejor que Tabasco porque uno siente el sabor
de los pimientos, no del vinagre y de la madera.''
 &HT;    El envase de Cholula tambien es atractivo: un pequeno frasco de
cristal con una mexicana sonriente en una etiqueta naranja y una
tapa de madera que se enrosca hermeticamente. La tapa se ha
convertido en objeto de coleccion: los miembros del California
Carving Guild celebran concursos anuales de talla de imagenes en
las tapas.
 &HT;    Ademas de senalar su distintivo envase, a los promotores les
gusta explicar los beneficios de Cholula para la salud. Los
estudios han demostrado que la capsaicina, la sustancia que hace
picantes los pimientos, estimula las glandulas de la boca, la
garganta y el estomago y las hace producir fluidos acuosos que
expulsan las bacterias. La capsaicina tambien hace que el cerebro
libere los calmantes naturales del organismo, las endorfinas, que
dan una sensacion de euforia. Algunos consideran que el chile es
eficaz para aliviar el malestar tipico de unas copas de mas, ya que
aumenta el deseo de tomar liquidos. Para aprovechar estos usos,
Cholula ha creado retas para la ``Sopa de Pollo Cholula'' y una
bebida a base de jugo de naranja, miel y Cholula que aparece en su
pagina electronica (www.cholula.com).
 &HT;    Cholula ha tenido menos suerte con extensiones de la marca. El
ano pasado, probo una salsa picante Cholula en Denver. Pero la
competencia fue feroz y tuvo que retirarse del mercado. Ahora se
asocia con Classic Foods Inc., de Irvine, California, para
mercadear unas hojuelas de papa con sabor a Cholula bajo la marca
Kettle. Sera el complemento perfecto para un trago de tequila Jose
Cuervo?

TCU DUMPS SAN JOSE STATE; TULSA NEXT UP FOR FROGS
</HEADLINE>
 TOURNAMENT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ Hey, Horned Frogs, you've just beaten San Jose
State, 84-71, in the first round of the Western Athletic Conference
tournament, so here's Billy to tell you what you've won. Drum roll,
please.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tulsa,'' TCU coach Billy Tubbs said with his trademark dry
wit. ``That's a big prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, the Frogs also probably won an expenses-paid trip to
the National Invitation Tournament, but that parting gift is at
least a Selection Sunday away.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goody is Friday's first WAC semifinal at 8 p.m. If
the fifth-seeded Frogs (18-13) are going to reach Saturday's WAC
title game, they've got to get past a team that has beaten them by
a combined 54 points in this season's two meetings.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 seed Tulsa, 28-3 and ranked 15th nationally, appeared to
waste little energy in handling eighth-seeded Rice, 71-51,
Thursday. And though the regular-season league champion Golden
Hurricane handed TCU its two worst beatings of the season _ 33 and
21 points _ Frogs guard Estell Laster believes the pressure is on
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the underdog,'' Laster said after scoring 22 points
Thursday. ``They might come in overconfident. The third time is
usually when you get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Laster, the only Frogs player to have two solid games against
Tulsa, is banking on the experience of those setbacks to reverse
his team's fortunes Friday, even though Tulsa swallowed up TCU
quickly in both contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what they like to run, know their sets and their
mind-set is that they're going to win,'' said Laster, who averaged
18 points in the losses. ``We're going to have to match their
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said his team matches up well athletically with the Golden
Hurricane, but offensive execution and defensive discipline have
been the problem in both games. Derrick Davenport, the Frogs'
6-foot-10 shot-blocking specialist, returns to the starting lineup
Friday in place of 6-6 guard Bingo Merriex.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's frontline may also receive a boost if Tubbs summons 6-7
power forward Myron Anthony from Fort Worth. Tubbs said Anthony,
suspended before the Frogs left for Fresno, Calif., has served his
punishment and it's possible he'll be on a plane this morning.
</P>
<P>
   If the Frogs are going to have a chance against Tulsa, Tubbs
said, they would need to duplicate Thursday's second-half
performance. TCU exploded past the Spartans over the final 20
minutes on the strength of a relentless press and deadeye shooting.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State (15-15) allowed only 58.9 points per game during
the season, but TCU nearly reached that total in the second stanza
alone, outscoring the Spartans 54-33. TCU erased a 38-30 halftime
deficit with a 15-2 run to open the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of the game was too fast in the second half and
didn't allow us to set up in our half-court offense,'' San Jose
State coach Steve Barnes said. ``We got caught up in TCU's style of
play and our game broke down. Fatigue was definitely a factor in
the outcome of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Frogs guard Ryan Carroll, who scored 19 points and hit three
3-pointers, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice the full-court press all the time,'' Carroll said.
``I don't think many people are used to playing it, so I think that
is where we were able to capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   The question Friday is whether the Hurricane, relatively rested
but not extremely deep, can be worn down with the Frogs' preferred
frenetic tempo. Tulsa played Thursday's first game and, because
they built a big early lead, coasted in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we play, there's an advantage for a team that's got a
little more rest,'' Tubbs said. ``But the good thing about young
bodies, they recover quickly.'' TULSA 71, RICE 51
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Golden Hurricane jumped out to a quick 10-0 lead
and never looked back in eliminating No. 8 Rice (5-22). Reserve
forward David Shelton scored 20 points in 22 minutes, and center
Brandon Kurtz added 14 points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 10 minutes, we were ready to play,'' Tulsa coach
Bill Self said. ``When you get a big lead, sometimes you lose
energy. We didn't play with passion in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   While today's semifinalists are hoping to improve their NCAA
Tournament chances with a strong showing, Self said his squad,
already a lock for the NCAAs, has a different motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team understands that our performance here will make the
difference in seeding for the (NCAA) Tournament,'' he said. ``We
know the difference between a 6-seed and a 3-seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice ended its season 5-22.

TV SPORTS: AFTER BEING DISMISSED, ESIASON FIRES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boomer Esiason, fired from ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' on
Wednesday, Esiason vented his fury Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He fulminated about Al Michaels, his on-air partner, saying he
squelched Esiason's desire to be looser and funnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the happiest he's been for a long time because he's a
one-man booth,'' Esiason said during a phone interview. ``Al is
propped up as the star and wants to do things his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels was unavailable to comment on Esiason's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ABC did not return Esiason's fire. ``Boomer's contribution to
`Monday Night Football' is highly valued,'' said Mark Mandel, an
ABC Sports spokesman. ``He's got many close friends and admirers
here, so we understand his frustration after yesterday's
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels has worked well in previous three-man booths in
football (with Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford) and baseball (with
Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver). Any backstage tensions failed to play
out on the air or become public knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason also described himself as a victim of infighting at ABC
Sports, where a new president, Howard Katz, and a new executive
producer, John Filippelli, quarreled over the direction of the
program with Ken Wolfe, the producer, and Craig Janoff, the
director. Wolfe and Janoff were fired, after 14 and 12 years,
respectively, on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny and Craig had their own way of doing things,'' Esiason
said. ``And they were phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's hard when a new coach comes in and wants his
own team, but I'm sorry I had to be part of the purge, or the
smokescreen in front of the purge.''
</P>
<P>
   With Esiason, Wolfe and Janoff gone, Katz brought in his mentor,
Don Ohlmeyer, to elevate the show above the ``sameness'' he felt it
suffered from. Ohlmeyer produced ``Monday Night'' from 1973 to
1976. Ohlmeyer wants to revive the show's fromer penchant for
unpredictability and danger. But Howard Cosell died in 1995 and Don
Meredith isn't coming back from his retreat in Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ohlmeyer's arrival, ABC had begun talking to possible
analyst candidates like Bill Parcells, who will most likely stay as
the New York Jets' director of football operations through next
month's college draft; Steve Young, who did a fair job on ABC's
postseason studio show but has not decided to retire as a player,
and Jimmy Johnson, the former Miami Dolphins coach, who is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has also interviewed for jobs at Fox and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason is caught between his natural candor and his frustration
at the serious pothole in his new career. He didn't sign a
three-year deal in 1998 for $1.75 million annually to wind up
looking for a job after two. He went in with high hopes and little
experience, replacing Gifford as Michaels' and Dierdorf's mate.
After Dierdorf's release, Esiason worked with Michaels last season.
</P>
<P>
   Had Esiason been a true breakthrough analyst _ like Phil Simms
was in his first year at NBC _ he might have survived. Had ratings
been better, he might have stayed, too. But one senses that he
feels Michaels prevented him from being his best.
</P>
<P>
   So, feeling his talent didn't fail him, he is firing away. Doing
so after only two years may be risky if he wants to rebound with
CBS, Fox or HBO. The more experienced Dierdorf and Gifford chose
not to fire excess verbal bullets when they were let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really ambivalent about Al,'' Esiason said. ``At times his
on-air genius is so apparent, but at times his uneven nature and
meann

DANIEL YANOFSKY, 74, CANADIAN CHESS CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daniel Abraham Yanofsky, Canada's first chess grandmaster, died
on Sunday at Seven Oaks Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Hilda, said the cause was cancer and congestive heart
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Yanofsky, who was called Abe, was born in Brody, Poland, on
March 26, 1925. His family moved to Canada when he was less than a
year old.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 8 his father bought a chess set. The youngster
quickly took to the game, gaining a local reputation as a prodigy.
At age 11, he gave a simultaneous exhibition, playing 22 people at
once. He won 17 games and lost five. At 12, he was champion of
Manitoba and played in the national championship, placing fourth.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, he was picked to be Canada's No. 2 player in a chess
Olympiad in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Even though he was the
youngest participant in the event, he scored 85 percent, attracting
the notice of Alexander Alekhine, then the world champion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Yanofsky won the Canadian championship for the first of
eight times. In 1946 he defeated Mikhail Botvinnik in an individual
game. Botvinnik was crowned world champion two years later. While
studying law at Oxford University in the early 1950s, Yanofsky won
the British championship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Yanofsky was awarded the highest title in chess:
international grandmaster.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to chess, Yanofsky had a successful career as a
lawyer and politician. He was mayor of West Kildonan, a suburb of
Winnipeg, before it was incorporated into the city in 1970. After
that, he served on the city council from 1970 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   For his achievements, Yanofsky was awarded the Order of Canada
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, the former Hilda Gutnik, he is survived
by his four children, Audrey Rubin, Rochelle Yanofsky, Heather
Gordon and Andrew Wyatt, and by eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Reshevsky wrote in his book ``How Chess Games Are Won''
that Yanofsky was a tough opponent. ``His style is defensive but
quite accurate,'' he wrote. ``When given the slightest opportunity,
he is strong enough to beat the best.''

 NEWS ANALYSIS: McCAIN AS NONCANDIDATE IS STILL PROBLEM FOR BUSH  
(Eds: Adds ``without the workers' consent'' to end of 6th graf.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has not even been officially crowned the Republican
presidential nominee, but already Gov. George W. Bush finds himself
confronted with a classic predicament, one that poses a significant
test to his leadership skills: How does he win over Sen. John
McCain _ and his crucial block of independent and Democratic
loyalists _ without antagonizing the Republican establishment that
pulled Bush to victory?
</P>
<P>
   It is a ticklish spot: Bush cannot win the election in November
unless large numbers of McCain's supporters rally behind him. The
simplest way for that to happen is for the Arizona senator to rally
behind Bush first.
</P>
<P>
   Already top Bush lieutenants are quietly reaching out to
McCain's camp, sending signals that they respect him and want to
work with him.
</P>
<P>
   But many people close to McCain said he might not be inclined to
play along, at least not enthusiastically, unless Bush embraces the
centerpiece of his candidacy: his sweeping campaign-finance
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary for Bush is that his advisers say it would be
inconceivable for the Texas governor to sign on to McCain's
prescription for campaign reform, because its ban on unregulated
soft money has been scorned by crucial elements of the Republican
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Bush demonstrated the sensitivity
of the matter by not ridiculing the McCain proposal as he usually
does. Instead, he dodged a question about whether he would embrace
a ban on soft money, saying, ``We'll just see at the time.'' He
went on to press for his own proposal that would ban union dues
from being used for political campaigns without the workers'
consent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Bush drew so much support so early from
governors, members of Congress and interest groups _ and that
McCain did so poorly with those same categories _ is that he vowed
never to do anything to jeopardize the Republicans' financial
advantages. The governor is not about to risk alienating those
groups now, especially when some are planning to run independent
advertising campaigns that would benefit his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate situation because Bush is no longer the
front-runner _ he is in effect the nominee _ and he therefore has a
responsibility to lead the party,'' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican
strategist who supports Bush. ``But at the same time, the key to
victory in November is an appeal to many of the voters McCain
appealed to in February and March.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush adopted McCain's campaign-finance plan, Gillespie said,
``he would be whipsawed from the left and from the right.''
</P>
<P>
   That's only part of the problem. Bush could risk looking like a
compliant pushover if he were to fold. After all, he derided
McCain's finance plan at one of their debates by saying: ``It is
bad for Republicans and it's going to hurt the conservative
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain is not about to settle for the far less sweeping
campaign-reform plan that Bush introduced just before the South
Carolina primary, in a move to trump the senator's reform
credentials. McCain called it a ``camouflage and a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush would get into a little consistency trap,'' said Don
Sipple, a media consultant for the governor's past campaigns.
``He's staked out his position pretty well. He would look
unprincipled and opportunistic and hypocritical if he was to lurch
over on that one issue for instant gratification. Whatever you get
at the end of that process is just not worth what you gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Bush does not somehow find a way to mollify McCain, even
more trouble could lie ahead. There is a rich history in the
Republican Party of struggles between the party's establishment and
wings on one side or another. Barry Goldwater, who was nominated on
a right-wing crusade in 1964, never succeeded in reaching out to
Nelson Rockefeller or his more moderate supporters. He lost in that
November.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992, President George Bush reached out _ in hindsight
too eagerly _ to the insurgent who had tried to topple his campaign
from the right, Pat Buchanan. Buchanan's irate speech at the
nominating convention haunted the party for months, even years, to
come _ and played a part in dooming Bush's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans close to the Bush campaign said one possibility is
that the governor would put out an explicit or tacit signal to
McCain that he could take issue publicly with Bush on prized topics
like campaign finance and taxes but still be welcomed on good
terms. The important thing, they said, is that he support Bush as
the far preferable alternative to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It may be wishful thinking, but Bush advisers are also primed
with examples of other politicians who are close to McCain but take
issue with his position on campaign finance. For example, Sen.
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a top McCain adviser, did not vote for the
campaign-finance measure, and Bob Dole opposed it as well _ even
though he and McCain are close.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican official familiar with the talks between the two
camps said of McCain, ``He's going to be watching to see how Bush
talks about reform'' _ and to make sure that his ``reformer with
results'' self-description is more than a slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem for Bush is that he, of course, can only
play one side of the equation. It is not clear yet what McCain
expects _ or might demand _ from Bush or from the committee that
will draft the party platform for the convention in Philadelphia in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Few clues could be gleaned from the senator's enigmatic speech
in the mountains of Arizona on Thursday. After making clear that
the Republican Party ``is my home,'' McCain once again raised his
signature issue that so many Republicans despise. ``I'm also
dedicated to the necessary cause of reform,'' he said, ``and I will
never walk away from a fight for what I know is right and just for
our country.''

RUSSIAN JOURNALIST AND OIL EXECUTIVE DIE IN PLANE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert graf noting that Borovik also worked for `60
Minutes.')  
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A top Russian investigative journalist and a leading
petroleum executive were among nine people killed early Thursday
when a chartered jet crashed on takeoff from Moscow's main domestic
airport, Sheremetyevo One.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Artyom Borovik, and the head of the oil-trading
company Alliance Group, Ziya Bazhayev, had taken off for Kiev when
the three-engine Yak-40 passenger jet apparently tipped sideways
and slammed into the runway. Two other oil-company employees and
five crew members also died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   There was immediate speculation that the two men had been slain
in one of the violent feuds that periodically rock the top echelons
of Russian industry and politics. Moscow transportation
investigators opened a criminal inquiry into whether the flight
violated air-safety rules, and one official told the Interfax news
service that a terrorist act had not been ruled out as a cause of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Federal Security Service, the domestic
successor to the Soviet KGB, said Thursday night that Bashayev, who
is of Chechen descent, had received threats because he had refused
to supply weapons to rebels in the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way to document that accusation. Nor was there
any evidence of foul play. Witnesses said that one wing of the jet
struck the runway during takeoff, causing the aircraft to cartwheel
and break up just after it left the ground. The plane's flight-data
recorder was recovered and will be analyzed for evidence of the
cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Borovik, reported to be 38 or 39, was something of a legend in
Russian journalism. The son of a famous Soviet-era foreign
correspondent, he himself became famous for his highly critical
dispatches on the war in Afghanistan. His articles, published just
as the Soviets had begun loosening controls over freedom of
expression, caused a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, he built a small media conglomerate called
Sovershenno Sekretno Holding _ the words mean ``top secret'' _
which produced newspapers and television programs with an
investigative bent. His television program bearing that name was
bounced off Russia's state-controlled RTR network last June after
delving into political corruption. It had an eight-year run.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives said then that the program was smearing major
political figures to maintain its huge popularity. But Borovik
contended that the move signaled the Kremlin's intention to subdue
the press before the winter's parliamentary elections and the 2000
presidential campaign _ a prediction which has largely come true.
</P>
<P>
   Borovik was also a special correspondent for the CBS News
program ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bazhayev's Alliance Group was well known in petroleum-industry
circles. But unlike some Russian tycoons who have won both wealth
and notoriety in the oil business, his was not a household name.
Industry analysts said the Bazhayev company was an oil broker,
buying and reselling petroleum shipments, and an adviser to other
oil companies undergoing restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Bazhayev, who would have been 40 in July, served in the
mid-1990s as the president of Yunko, a government-controlled
enterprise created to manage Chechnya's petroleum business. He
later became head of a huge but financially troubled oil producer,
Sidanko. The company has since gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian business press, Bazhayev's company was
struggling this month with Sidanko executives over the disposition
of a Sidanko subsidiary deeply in debt to Alliance Group.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the two men were flying to Kiev. An
Alliance Group executive was quoted on Moscow television as saying
that Borovik and Bashayev were old friends and were discussing a
joint business venture. Other reports, none of them confirmed,
stated that Borovik was planning to expand distribution of his
publications in Ukraine, or that he was investigating Russian
involvement in the Ukrainian aluminum industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two men's private Yak-40 jet, which was 24 years old, was
due to be retired in July 2001, but the plane's owners said it was
in excellent mechanical condition. The pilot was said to have
logged more than 7,000 hours in the air.

   RUSSIA: SIGNING MINE BAN Russia agreed to sign the 1996 Geneva
treaty banning anti-personnel land mines, a weapon its troops have
used widely _ and to sharp criticism _ in their war against Chechen
rebels. The Kremlin said it would sign, after being persuaded that

Mary Magdalene. The book, titled ``M to the Power of N,'' was
banned in northern Greece pending a final decision on May 16 about
the rest of the country. The Greek Orthodox Church has condemned
the book as ``unscientific, filthy, and the vilest book in
Christendom.'' Judge Maria Robbi said she acted after religious
militants threatened to take action against the author and
bookstores.

JURY DELIBERATING CASE OF OFFICER WHO KILLED FUGITIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. _ While intense attention has been focused on
the trials of police officers in the death of Amadou Diallo and the
assault on Abner Louima, a jury in State Superior Court here has
been hearing the case of the first Connecticut police officer ever
charged with murder in the shooting of a suspect while on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations in the trial of the officer, Scott Smith of the
New Milford, Conn., police department, began Thursday afternoon.
Smith is charged with killing a fugitive, Franklyn Reid, by
shooting him once in the back after chasing him along a local
highway on Dec. 29, 1998. Reid, an ex-convict, was being sought for
failing to appear in court on a harassment charge. Like the New
York cases, this one has racial overtones: Smith is white; Reid was
black.
</P>
<P>
   After the closing arguments Thursday, Judge Charles D. Gill
noted ``various citizen-police incidents'' in the news lately and
admonished the jurors not to ``let those other cases interfere'' as
they considered Smith's fate. Gill, at the prosecution's request,
also instructed jurors to consider lesser charges of manslaughter
should they reach a not-guilty verdict on the murder count.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up the prosecution's case Thursday morning, State's
Attorney John A. Connelly described a cold-blooded killing. He said
that Reid was lying on the ground with Smith's foot on his back
when he was shot. The officer's 9-millimeter service weapon was
pressed against Reid's spine when it was fired, Connelly said.
``This bullet severed Franklyn Reid's spine,'' he said. ``The hole
is perfectly round.''
</P>
<P>
   Recounting testimony from several witnesses who saw Smith
standing over Reid on the shoulder of Route 202 in New Milford,
Connelly described a scene in which a suspect who had raised his
arms in the air as a sign of surrender was suddenly shot dead by an
officer out of control. ``Officer Smith let his emotions take
over,'' Connelly said. ``And because of that, Franklyn Reid is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing for the defense, Smith's lawyer, John J. Kelly,
recounted Reid's criminal record _ including a conviction for a
stabbing _ and reminded the jurors that he had been fleeing an
arrest warrant. Reid ignored Smith's orders to show his hands,
Kelly said, and after the shooting was found with a knife in his
jacket and a Pennsylvania driver's license in a fake name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show me your hands, show me your hands,'' Kelly said,
describing his client's efforts to subdue Reid. ``Despite repeated
requests to stop, despite repeated requests to show your hands,
that didn't happen.'' Holding up the pocket knife to the jury, he
said, ``Did Scott Smith have to wait until Franklyn Reid got ahold
of this knife and used it on him before defending himself?''
</P>
<P>
   He said Smith had no motive. ``The state's theory in this case
comes down to this: that Scott Smith conducted a public execution
of Franklyn Reid for no reason,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the two-week trial's most dramatic day of
testimony, Smith took the stand in his own defense. ``I couldn't
see his hands,'' he said. ``I kept yelling, `Show me your hands'
like a broken record. It didn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not listening,'' Smith said. ``He was scaring me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified that he fired once after Reid made a sudden
movement to the left. ``He turned around and gave me a
confrontational stare, like he was preparing an attack,'' Smith
said. ``It wasn't until he made that sudden movement when I thought
my life was in danger, that's why I shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   But in cross-examination, Connelly scoffed at the account. ``You
want this jury to believe that Mr. Reid, on his knees, facing up an
embankment with your hand on this shoulder,'' he said, ``was
endangering your life?''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Smith had fired without warning. ``You never
warned him verbally that you were going to shoot him, did you?''
Connelly asked. Smith replied, ``I didn't have the time, sir.''

 KC, TWA reach tentative agreement on maintenance base lease  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
c. 2000 The Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City and
Trans World Airlines tentatively have agreed to a 25-year lease
renewal of the airline's jet maintenance base, easing concern about
the future of TWA's presence in Kansas City.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiations continue on how to finance about $40 million in
improvements to the city-owned facility, but city officials are
confident a new lease would be completed before the current one
expires May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lease looks like it's well in hand,'' Russell Widmar,
director of the Kansas City Aviation Department, said Thursday.
``We're moving the process forward and hope to get it before the
City Council by the end of April.''
</P>
<P>
   A TWA spokeswoman said the airline doesn't discuss ongoing
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   However, several union and city officials confirmed an agreement
in principle has been reached to renew the lease on the 250-acre
complex at Kansas City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has about 3,500 employees in Kansas City, and the pending
lease renewal comes as a relief to the 2,300 workers at the base.
Eighteen months of negotiations and TWA's financial condition have
created doubts about the airline's commitment to the underutilized
maintenance facility.
</P>
<P>
   Although the contract TWA reached with the Machinists union last
year called for the company to seek a lease renewal, many area
employees nevertheless are worried about what TWA might do at the
Kansas City overhaul base if maintenance operations were cut back.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's top union official in Kansas City applauded the progress
the city and airline have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``All systems are go, and we're happy about that,'' said Butch
Sponaugle, president of Machinists Local 1650. ``Hopefully, they
can get that old, worn-out base upgraded for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The city and TWA are discussing about $40 million in general
improvements to the overhaul base, which opened more than 40 years
ago, Widmar said. That would include upgrading the electrical
system, heating and cooling, and possibly the roof, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A firm to be hired by both parties will conduct an engineering
study of the proposed improvements, Widmar said.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation would be financed through airport revenue bonds
issued by the aviation department. The bonds would be paid off by
TWA lease payments. The council approved such a resolution a month
ago, said Councilwoman Teresa Loar, who heads the committee that
oversees the aviation department.
</P>
<P>
   However, the aviation department will need voter approval to
issue the bonds. That item is expected to be on the city ballot in
August or November.
</P>
<P>
   City officials don't expect voter resistance because funding for
the bonds would come from user fees generated by the airport and
not through additional sales taxes or property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would be a slam dunk because it would come
from existing airport funds,'' Loar said.
</P>
<P>
   The time-lag between the lease's renewal in June and the bond
issue later this year also should not be a problem, Widmar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lease can be executed with enough controls in
place and with the best-faith efforts of both sides,'' he said.
``We think the bonds can be authorized and sold in the time frame
that TWA wants.''
</P>
<P>
   A second phase of renovations and upgrades for the overhaul base
could come later, Widmar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at there is process-type improvements,
things that would make it easier and faster for TWA to do the work
at the facility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the company has shrunk through the years, TWA's maintenance
capacity has stayed relatively the same. In addition to Kansas
City, the airline has maintenance facilities in New York, St. Louis
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   TWA also has begun acquiring new, more efficient aircraft,
replacing its older planes that required more maintenance checks.
Widebody planes, such as the Boeing 747 that exclusively were
maintained in Kansas City, have been retired.
</P>
<P>
   Those trends have led to a need for less hangar space, TWA
officials have said. Area Machinists officers have lobbied
management to seek maintenance business from other carriers, but
TWA has maintained that contract work in Kansas City is not
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a consulting firm explored what changes could be
made at the Kansas City overhaul base.
</P>
<P>
   Among those options included consolidating operations into one
building and eliminating superhangars at the base that housed
widebody planes. A second building at the complex then could be
leased to another tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Such major reconstruction to the facility, however, was
estimated to cost at least $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial renovations are not that drastic, city
officials say they think the lease renewal and the proposed
improvements are steps in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've come up with some good ideas to make this a
partnership of sorts,'' Widmar said. ``We understand the importance
of the overhaul base to the community and to TWA.''

 Kauffman Stadium improvements to help Royals' bottom line  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK and GLENN E. RICE  
c. 2000 The Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Drive along
Interstate 70 by the big Royals crown these days and you'll see
something that's becoming as much a rite of spring as a crack of
the bat: workers preparing new features for Kauffman Stadium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last four years, these additions have included an arcade
tent, advertisements ringing the field and high-dollar seats behind
home plate. This year, navy blue seats are replacing orange ones
around the upper deck, and a ``party pavilion'' for groups is being
built behind the left-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not be able to call balls and strikes from there,''
Royals marketing vice president Mike Levy said of the pavilion,
``but it'll be something unique, like having a picnic at a baseball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are making the Royals a more profitable team, but
they're hardly keeping up with the rest of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an unprecedented building boom, 20 of Major League
Baseball's 30 franchises will play by 2003 in stadiums that are
much newer than Kauffman. Five of the remaining franchises operate
in the nation's largest metropolitan areas. That leaves five teams
_ including the Royals _ competing in smaller cities with vastly
smaller stadium revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Baseball's newest stadiums, with numerous luxury
suites, averaged $47 million in gate revenues for 1998, according
to Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a sports research firm. Kauffman
Stadium's gate revenues averaged $15.5 million through the 1990s,
and all its new features by themselves could add less than $6
million to the team's coffers this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a recent study of baseball economics by Street &AMP;
Smith's SportsBusiness Journal ranked Kansas City second to last in
total projected revenues for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap is continuing to widen,'' Levy said. ``We have to
continue to upgrade our facility just to stay behind less.''
</P>
<P>
   This means the annual rite of off-season construction probably
will go on. Next year, a second deck could be added to the new
pavilion. The year after that, a pavilion could be built behind
right field. And there are plans for more substantial improvements,
such as converting the entire middle club level into suites and
adding a restaurant beyond the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, this will translate into more victories on the field
and more fans in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this will generate revenue for the team,'' said John
Bondon, a member of the Jackson County Sports Complex Authority.
``That way, you can spend more money for better players. And when
you buy better players, you will have more fans.''  &LR; brk:More suites
</P>
<P>
   The Royals reportedly turned a profit in 1999 for the first time
in years, but that had more to do with cutting expenses than adding
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   A Paul Kagan Associates analysis of the team showed it pared
$14.3 million in salaries by replacing such higher-priced veterans
as Dean Palmer with rookies or lower-paid players such as Joe
Randa. Then the players scored the most runs in its history and
produced a Rookie of the Year, but still came close to the
franchise's record for losses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an $11 million stadium improvement project added
dugout suites on the field and four rows of Crown seats behind home
plate. These were expected to push the Royals' gate receipts beyond
1998's $16 million, which was about half the major-league average,
according to Paul Kagan Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking pretty minor revenue gains,'' said Hadrian Shaw,
a sports analyst for Paul Kagan. ``Kauffman doesn't have nearly as
much to offer as the new parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 28-year-old Kauffman Stadium contains 23 suites. That's
about one-third the major-league average and about one-fourth the
average of stadiums opened since 1989, according to the Association
of Luxury Suite Directors.
</P>
<P>
   And in the baseball marketplace, Kansas City's predicament is
only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1998 season, a Forbes magazine study of professional
sports ranked Kansas City No. 20 among 28 baseball teams in terms
of stadium revenues. Since then, however, five of the eight teams
below Kansas City _ plus two expansion teams _ have either moved
into new ballparks or are building one.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, Kansas City will slip toward the bottom
of that ranking _ in line with where Street &AMP; Smith's
SportsBusiness Journal ranked Kauffman Stadium for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the stadiums from the 1960s and '70s are now all
gone,'' said Bill Dorsey, executive director of the luxury suite
association. ``There's a reason for that. The older ones don't have
the local revenue dollars, so that makes it harder to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Although economists debate whether building new stadiums with
taxes is a reasonable public investment, there's no doubt the new
palaces help their teams financially.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what a new ballpark means: Nine under construction or
being designed will raise their teams' revenues by an average of
$39 million, according to projections from Paul Kagan Associates.
By contrast, the Royals estimate Kauffman Stadium's new suites,
seats, pavilion and even ad signs generate between $5 million and
$6 million combined. Ads facing the field behind home plate are
worth $1 million alone, the Royals' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be able to compete with these other teams,
we have to provide more revenues,'' Levy said. ``We're going to
continue trying to do things every year.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:`More intimate'
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon last week at Kauffman Stadium, construction
workers stood on a scaffold and stacked concrete blocks behind left
field. From the other side of the stadium, around the upper deck,
came the ``whooop'' of air drills tightening bolts on new navy blue
seat bottoms. The work is to be finished by opening day, April 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see, especially at night, the stadium will have a
different feel to it,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   That is, he said, a little more cozy and a little more festive.
</P>
<P>
   The upper-deck seats complete a conversion to entirely one color
for the first time. Gone are the bright oranges and yellows of the
past. Levy calls the darker look ``more intimate'' because empty
seats won't stand out as much.
</P>
<P>
   The new left-field pavilion, called the Royal Pavilion, will
contain two covered, open-air suites with picnic tables and stadium
seats, plus an adjoining patio and its own concrete-block rest
rooms. Levy dubs it the ``party pavilion,'' and reservations
already exceed the team's projections. It holds 100 and costs about
$45 per person, which pays for hot dogs, barbecue and beer,
compared to $100 per person for a dugout suite.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals intend to gauge how much the fans like the pavilion
before deciding whether to expand it or add another. And it remains
to be seen whether the franchise will be able to take on much more.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City-based HOK Sport, one of the nation's leading stadium
architectural firms, created a $75 million plan for Kauffman
Stadium called Vision 2000. It includes several features of newer
stadiums, namely more suites and a sit-down restaurant. Here are
some of the ideas:
</P>
<P>
   ---- Removing the midlevel Stadium Club and moving the press box
to open up the entire level for glassed-in suites.
</P>
<P>
   ---- Building glass cylinders in the empty cores of the
corkscrew ramps and filling them with shops.
</P>
<P>
   ---- Moving the lower-level concessions farther from the seats
and widening the main concourse for more novelty and food stands.
</P>
<P>
   ---- Adding a sit-down restaurant beyond right field and
connecting the left- and right-field sides so a walkway can circle
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day at Royals stadium is a very family-oriented venture, and
what we tried to do is to enhance those features,'' said Earl
Santee, a senior vice president of HOK Sport.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable for these improvements _ if they ever happen _
remains murky.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Prentice's ill-fated bid for the Royals in 1998 requested
these improvements within five years. But it's unclear whether a
similar provision will be part of the current ownership
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is or not, the Royals and local civic leaders are
counting on the area's bistate sales tax to pay for some stadium
improvements. Yet using Union Station's bistate tax for sports
requires new legislation, and such legislation has reached a
roadblock in the Kansas House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the chances for passage don't look good,'' said
Republican Rep. David Adkins of Leawood.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce is lobbying
more in Topeka than ever before to pass the plan, probably by
adding it to another bill at the end of the session. Or another
attempt could be made next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County can't afford stadium improvements by itself, said
County Executive Katheryn Shields. And Royals surveys repeatedly
show more fans come from Johnson County than Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fortunate we're only having a discussion on improvements
instead of a new stadium,'' Levy said. ``It's because we have a
stadium that was state-of-the-art when it was built, and we just
think with some improvements we can once again make it
state-of-the-art.''

WHITE HOUSE STILL LACKS VOTES TO PASS CHINA TRADE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to insert new 16th graf re Gore and Bush) 
 (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent in `w' news file) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration conceded Thursday that
it did not yet have the votes to pass a decisive China trade
accord, as a lobbying battle was shaping up for the 130 or so
uncommitted House members who will decide the fate of the
president's most important remaining foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over whether to grant permanent normal trading
privileges to China reveals fault lines in the nation's political
and business communities that will surely grow by June, when the
House will probably vote. Odd coalitions have sprung up in
opposition, from liberal Democrats who abhor China's labor and
environmental standards to conservative Republicans who criticize
Beijing's human rights record and threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clinton formally called on lawmakers to approve the
accord, the administration's point man on the measure, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, conceded that the outcome, particularly in
the House, is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably don't have the votes right now,'' Daley told
reporters Thursday after briefing executives on the accord.
``Members are still trying to grapple with this. They're still
wondering whether it's going to happen. It's very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, especially the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers, has made defeating the accord its top legislative priority
this year, both to preserve jobs at home and to put pressure on
China to raise its labor standards. Business groups, on the other
hand, last weekend kicked off a $1.5 million advertising campaign
to expound on the benefits of expanded trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's pulled a gun on me yet, but the lobbying is
significant,'' said Rep. Bart Gordon, an uncommitted Democrat from
Tennessee whose late switch in 1993 to support the North American
Free Trade Agreement provided Clinton with a crucial vote to pass
that landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   In another complication for Clinton, some conservatives are
considering amending the bill to increase military ties between
Taiwan and the United States, a move that China and the White House
strongly oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, last
week urged Clinton to act positively on Taiwan's request for
advanced weaponry, including four warships equipped with
sophisticated radar and anti-missile systems, which are built in
Pascagoula, Miss., and Bath, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The administration last fall promised Beijing that it would work
to grant China permanent trade status as part of a larger package
to bring China into the World Trade Organization. In the bilateral
deal, China agreed to open a wide range of its markets, from
agriculture to telecommunications, a potential boon to American
farmers and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing China into the rules-based trading system is a
win-win-win for American workers, American businesses and American
values,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To close the deal, Congress is being asked to give up its annual
review of China's trade status and grant it the permanent trading
privileges that the United States gives most other countries.
Congress has always approved this status.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if Congress votes down normal trade relations
is a subject of some debate. China would probably still join the
World Trade Organization. But the administration says that American
companies would not enjoy the benefits of the agreement _ lower
tariffs on their goods and greater access to China's markets _
while Europe and Japan would be able to get those benefits.
</P>
<P>
   However, as a matter of power politics, China may decide it is
economically unwise to anger the U.S., and so might for a time
accept a continuation of the status quo, keeping the trade status
up for renewal but withholding the market-opening measures.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the votes on Capitol Hill is crucial. The
administration is pushing for votes by the Memorial Day recess to
avoid bumping up against the political parties' conventions this
summer, and to reduce the chances that new provocations by China
would undercut support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his Cabinet are meeting with lawmakers regularly to
win support. Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman plan to
take groups of wavering legislators to China next month.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has sent mixed signals on the measure,
telling labor leaders three weeks ago that he would negotiate
something better if elected president, and later reiterating
support for the deal. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed
Republican nominee, supports permanent normal trading status as a
condition of bringing China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the president believes that if he rushes this
through before members can fully understand what's in the
agreement, he can win,'' said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., who
opposes permanent trade status. ``The longer this sits, the more
probability we have of beating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the bill's passage seem good in the Senate, which
is typically more supportive of trade agreements than the House. In
a test vote last July, the Senate rejected, 87-12, a nonbinding
measure to end normal trading relations with China. No one expects
the Senate to duplicate that margin for permanent trade status, but
supporters now count at least 60 votes, the magic number needed to
end a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the administration will probably try to get the
Senate to vote first, with a vote in the pro-trade Senate Finance
Committee by late April, reversing the usual order of trade bills
starting in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be well received in the Senate,'' said Sen. Daniel
P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., who strongly supports permanent trade
relations with China and who complained two weeks ago that the
White House needed to act soon.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., the Democratic
leader, this week predicted Senate approval after a spirited
debate.

<P>
   Senate opponents concede they face an uphill struggle, but said
momentum has shifted in the past three months. ``I don't say we
have the votes to defeat this, but it's going to be a more intense
fight than people thought,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
Wellstone is among those who oppose the bill because, he says,
allowing China into the trade organization would cause the U.S.
trade deficit with China to balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the House right now is like herding cats. But
according to vote-counters on both sides, here is what the math
looks like:
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, about 150 Republicans and 110
Democrats have voted to grant China normal trading status as part
of the annual review. A bill needs 218 votes to pass the House if
all members vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republican vote-counters say they can probably produce at least
135 votes for granting permanent normal trade status, barring any
new provocations by China, although they are short of that now.
Democratic supporters say they can count on about 50 to 60 firm
``yes'' votes now, but insist that aggressive lobbying by business
groups, Clinton and his top aides will harvest dozens of
uncommitted Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   By the count of some pro-trade lobbyists, at least 60 House
Democrats are uncommitted. Some House critics say that number is
closer to 20 to 30, and that the remainder are leaning toward
``no.'' Republicans say perhaps 70 of their rank and file are also
uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said Thursday that the administration is focusing its
efforts on about 50 of those 130 uncommitted members.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in farm states and in high-tech districts in
California are under particular pressure from local interests to
approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who fought Clinton over impeachment last
year, are well aware that they would be delivering the majority of
votes needed to cement a foreign policy triumph for the president.
</P>
<P>
   So they are trying to put pressure on the Democrats, aides say.
That way, if the measure fails, Republicans can blame the White
House for not turning out its party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president gets us 100 Democrats, we'll be fine,'' Rep.
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip who supports the trade
bill, said in a brief interview. Other supporters say that figure
is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking
Democrat, said that 128 of 211 House Democrats were opposing the
measure. He added that 30 of those opponents had supported China in
annual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an early stage but the momentum is with us,'' Bonior
said in an interview Thursday. ``People are moving toward our
position.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be true in some cases. Rep. John Conyers Jr., a senior
liberal Democrat from Michigan who has voted for giving China
normal trade status on a yearly basis, said in an interview that he
would oppose permanent status because it would be a mistake to
surrender the leverage of an annual vote.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with about one-third of the 30 representatives
that Bonior said had switched to opposing permanent status, some
said they truly had not made up their minds. ``I'm undecided,''
said Rep. Martin T. Meehan, D-Mass. ``I'm willing to look at the
administration's arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., said he had heard from labor activists
who oppose the bill, as well as from orange growers, cotton farmers
and executives from technology companies like Motorola and
Honeywell in his district who support permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the fence,'' he said.

 Toddler found safe in stolen Jeep two weeks after similar
abduction  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
c. 2000 The Kansas City Star LEE'S SUMMIT, Mo. -- It would only
take a second.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Schlegel thought he could pop into the gas station's
convenience store Thursday, buy a pack of gum and hop back into his
Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   So he pulled up to the Phillips 66 gas station convenience store
on Langsford Road in Lee's Summit. With the Jeep running and his
16-month-old son strapped into the back seat, he ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   But as Schlegel handed the clerk his money, he heard the Jeep's
engine churn. And it dawned on him what had just happened: A thief
had stolen his car with his son inside.
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk called 911, touching off a frantic manhunt that
would end an hour later after a Lee's Summit couple found the
abandoned Jeep and called police.
</P>
<P>
   Schlegel's son, Collin, was unharmed. And by 10:30 a.m., an
emotional Christopher and Robin Schlegel were reunited with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy that he's back with us,'' Robin Schlegel said.
``I was so shocked and stunned when this happened. He's the most
precious thing we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The car thief remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Police are looking for a white man in his mid-20s, with dark
hair and a mustache. He is about 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighs about
140 pounds and was wearing a blue jacket, blue pants and brown
boots.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Schlegel, of Garden City, had gone to Lee's Summit
for a dental appointment Thursday morning. Collin had come along
for the ride, while his mom went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Schlegel left the dentist's office at 9:05 a.m., stopped at a
nearby bank, then went to get a pack of gum.
</P>
<P>
   When he pulled into the gas station, he noticed a man loitering
in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew he was up to something,'' Schlegel said. ``I
watched him watch me.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the man disappeared around a corner. Schlegel pulled up
to the front door of the convenience store, put his flashers on and
ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could enter and exit within 45 seconds,'' he said.
``But it's a serious mistake that no one should make.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Schlegel saw the suspicious-looking man drive off
in his Jeep. Schlegel told police he last saw the Jeep disappear
down Ridgeview Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Within 20 minutes, Lee's Summit police issued an Amber Alert, a
emergency broadcast system adopted in October to notify the public
of a child abduction.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first Amber Alert issued in Missouri since the
practice started and the second alert in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   At the police station, the Schlegels waited nervously.
</P>
<P>
   They thought of Jake Robel, the 6-year-old Independence, Mo.,
boy who was dragged to his death two weeks ago. His mother had left
him strapped into her car's back seat while she ran into a
restaurant for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   A thief stole her car, and Jake became tangled in his seat belt
when his mother tried to rescue him. Kim L. Davis of Kansas City,
Mo., has been charged with the boy's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a horrible, horrible feeling,'' Christopher
Schlegel said. ``You just never know what someone is going to do
when they know they are being hunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Just five blocks from the gas station, a Lee's Summit couple was
leaving their home to go to the supermarket. Billie Adams said she
noticed a Jeep parked up the block, on Ridgeview near Tanner's Bar
&AMP; Grill. Its flashers were on.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned, the Jeep was still there. Then they saw the
Amber Alert on television. The report gave a description of the
missing car and the license plate.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Adams rushed back outside, confirmed the license plate
number of the Jeep, then told her husband, Brent, to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   When the Adamses ran to the Jeep, they found a howling little
boy strapped into his car seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was screaming and as red as can be,'' Brent Adams said.
``But as soon as Billie took him out of the car, he calmed right
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was just happy to see a person,'' Billie Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Schlegel said he cried when he learned his son was
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether parents who leave their children unattended in a
car should be punished, Robin Schlegel said: ``I think we've been
punished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that a person who has gone through this feels
like someone has reached into their chest and just ripped their
heart out through their ribs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to now try to twist their actions into something
criminal would be a misuse of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Schlegel did nothing illegal, Beaird said. For a
parent to be charged with child endangerment, there has to be
evidence of criminal negligence.
</P>
<P>
   If the child were left in the car while a parent went shopping
in a mall or went drinking in a bar, that would be criminal
negligence, Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in cases like these, the people weren't far from their
cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlegel said he's learned his lesson, and he urged others not
to make the same mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think something terrible like this couldn't happen
to you,'' he said. ``But you just can't take that chance.''

WHITE HOUSE STILL LACKS VOTES TO PASS CHINA TRADE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert new 16th graf re Gore and Bush.)  
(DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent in `i' news file) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration conceded Thursday that
it did not yet have the votes to pass a decisive China trade
accord, as a lobbying battle was shaping up for the 130 or so
uncommitted House members who will decide the fate of the
president's most important remaining foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over whether to grant permanent normal trading
privileges to China reveals fault lines in the nation's political
and business communities that will surely grow by June, when the
House will probably vote. Odd coalitions have sprung up in
opposition, from liberal Democrats who abhor China's labor and
environmental standards to conservative Republicans who criticize
Beijing's human rights record and threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clinton formally called on lawmakers to approve the
accord, the administration's point man on the measure, Commerce
Secretary William Daley, conceded that the outcome, particularly in
the House, is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably don't have the votes right now,'' Daley told
reporters Thursday after briefing executives on the accord.
``Members are still trying to grapple with this. They're still
wondering whether it's going to happen. It's very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, especially the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers, has made defeating the accord its top legislative priority
this year, both to preserve jobs at home and to put pressure on
China to raise its labor standards. Business groups, on the other
hand, last weekend kicked off a $1.5 million advertising campaign
to expound on the benefits of expanded trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's pulled a gun on me yet, but the lobbying is
significant,'' said Rep. Bart Gordon, an uncommitted Democrat from
Tennessee whose late switch in 1993 to support the North American
Free Trade Agreement provided Clinton with a crucial vote to pass
that landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   In another complication for Clinton, some conservatives are
considering amending the bill to increase military ties between
Taiwan and the United States, a move that China and the White House
strongly oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, last
week urged Clinton to act positively on Taiwan's request for
advanced weaponry, including four warships equipped with
sophisticated radar and anti-missile systems, which are built in
Pascagoula, Miss., and Bath, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The administration last fall promised Beijing that it would work
to grant China permanent trade status as part of a larger package
to bring China into the World Trade Organization. In the bilateral
deal, China agreed to open a wide range of its markets, from
agriculture to telecommunications, a potential boon to American
farmers and companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing China into the rules-based trading system is a
win-win-win for American workers, American businesses and American
values,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   To close the deal, Congress is being asked to give up its annual
review of China's trade status and grant it the permanent trading
privileges that the United States gives most other countries.
Congress has always approved this status.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if Congress votes down normal trade relations
is a subject of some debate. China would probably still join the
World Trade Organization. But the administration says that American
companies would not enjoy the benefits of the agreement _ lower
tariffs on their goods and greater access to China's markets _
while Europe and Japan would be able to get those benefits.
</P>
<P>
   However, as a matter of power politics, China may decide it is
economically unwise to anger the U.S., and so might for a time
accept a continuation of the status quo, keeping the trade status
up for renewal but withholding the market-opening measures.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the votes on Capitol Hill is crucial. The
administration is pushing for votes by the Memorial Day recess to
avoid bumping up against the political parties' conventions this
summer, and to reduce the chances that new provocations by China
would undercut support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his Cabinet are meeting with lawmakers regularly to
win support. Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman plan to
take groups of wavering legislators to China next month.
</P>

something better if elected president, and later reiterating

COWBOYS CONSIDER SIGNING UNDERWOOD; MITCHELL CHOOSES CINCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ On the same day the Dallas Cowboys lost out on
one maligned prospective free-agent signee _ thanks to Scott
Mitchell choosing to back up Akili Smith in Cincinnati rather than
Troy Aikman _ the team turned its sights to another.
</P>
<P>
   A source said the Cowboys are seriously considering signing
troubled defensive end Dimitrius Underwood, whose rookie season in
1999 was highlighted by a string of bizarre incidents, including a
suicide attempt. He was released by both the Miami Dolphins and
Minnesota Vikings last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones was unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' interest in Underwood is not without some working
knowledge of the situation. Newly hired defensive line coach Andre
Patterson worked with Underwood during his brief stint in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood was picked in the first round by the Vikings last
season after playing in college at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could be in the market for a defensive end _
considering the free-agent loss of Kavika Pittman (Denver) and the
questionable status of Greg Ellis (fractured leg). However, the
interest in Underwood should be construed more as a chance to take
a free look at a talented player rather than solely trying to fill
a need, much like the Alonzo Spellman situation of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he chose the Bengals because he felt he had a
better chance of playing there as a backup to Smith. Mitchell
signed a one-year deal with a $200,000 signing bonus and a $600,000
base salary. The Cowboys' offer was similar.
</P>
<P>
   With Mitchell taken, few quarterbacks are left on the free-agent
market who fit the Cowboys' need for a moderately priced veteran.
One possibility is Paul Justin, who was with the St. Louis Rams
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have also expressed interest in former San Francisco
49ers linebacker Lee Woodall. Woodall, however, is leaning toward
signing with the Carolina Panthers. nn

 Disappearing act: Where tax money goes when it's deemed a
`surplus'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
c. 2000 The Kansas City Star One unreported aspect of an airport
improvements bill wending its way through Congress sheds more light
on the questionable nature of trust fund assets as a federal
financing tool.
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Investor's Business Daily editorial this week criticized a
revenue enhancer accompanying an aviation bill that would increase
the passenger tax from $3 to $4.50. It's a move that would hit
business travel budgets particularly hard because corporate road
warriors use air travel proportionately more than the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   This tax increase has been proposed even though the Airport and
Airway Trust Fund already gets about $10 billion a year from
airport user fees, the editorial said. What it didn't mention,
though, is the current status of the aviation trust fund, which
offers a telling lesson in federal finance.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Debt Bureau's year-end statement showed the trust
fund holding more than $12.5 billion in outstanding Treasury debt.
These assets are nonmarketable Treasury securities credited to the
fund when revenue from dedicated taxes and fees surpasses what has
been appropriated to finance air transit system projects.
</P>
<P>
   Any leftover tax money from these dedicated revenue sources goes
to pay for general budget outlays because Uncle Sam has no legal
mechanism to ``save'' money. In theory, the Treasury IOUs credited
to the trust funds are supposed to be redeemed as needed to finance
whatever the taxes are levied to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Redeeming these Treasury securities, however, requires a
congressional appropriation. If taxes aren't increased to fund the
appropriation, Congress must get the money elsewhere in the budget.
This helps explain why trust fund asset balances grow even as
Congress seeks tax increases to finance activities instead of
dipping into the appropriate trust fund. Taxes are real money.
Trust fund assets are debt requiring repayment from existing
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose recently when gasoline prices surged.
Suggestions that some federal gasoline taxes be temporarily
repealed were rebuffed on grounds that Uncle Sam couldn't afford
the revenue loss. With a $24 billion balance in the Highway Trust
Fund, the response raised a compelling question: If Uncle Sam needs
the revenue so badly, why has the trust fund balance soared from $9
billion to $24 billion in recent years? The increase, after all, is
due to fuel taxes going unspent.
</P>
<P>
   The same question could now be asked about the aviation fund.
The answer? Raising taxes means more revenue. Cashing in trust fund
assets requires an expenditure of tax money. As long as Americans
don't understand how the game is played, why not play it to
government's advantage and the taxpayer's disadvantage?
</P>
<P>
   These trust fund questions are critical to evaluating political
promises to make up future Social Security revenue shortfalls with
the growing trust fund ``surplus'' pledged to keep the system
viable.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Social Security's trust fund is just like the ones
used for highways and airports. Its potential as a source of real
money depends on political willingness to appropriate the money
needed to redeem the Treasury debt that constitutes all trust fund
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson? There is no real money in the trust funds. Only
IOUs.

EDITORIAL: KEEPING THE CAUSE ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 10:
</P>
<P>
   In pulling out of the presidential race Thursday, John McCain
and Bill Bradley vowed to keep fighting for reform. That promise
was to be expected as part of the ritual of politics. But because
both candidates inspired new voters and brought new vision to the
campaign this year, their ability to continue influencing the
debate is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who ``suspended'' his candidacy but did not endorse Gov.
George W. Bush for the Republican nomination, is in an especially
crucial spot. He made overhauling the campaign finance system his
central theme, and now he can refocus his energy to stop a coming
orgy of corrupt fund raising by both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Republicans and even many Democrats in Washington
were dismissing the need to clean up the system. They said it was a
minor issue for voters. But now the presidential race has proved
them wrong. In fact, it has elevated reform to a new level of
prominence and urgency.
</P>
<P>
   In January the joint pledge by McCain and Bradley to forgo
unregulated soft-money donations was quickly endorsed by Gore, who
later went further and declared that a campaign finance cleanup
would be one of his top priorities as president. Bush has defeated
McCain for the GOP nomination, but only after trying to co-opt his
message by describing himself as a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain could use several means to keep alive his reform campaign
even as a non-candidate, forcing Bush to back up his words with
action. It is not clear whether campaign legislation has much
chance for passage this year, but the senator can continue pressing
for change in Congress, around the country and at the Republican
Convention this summer. He needs to make clear that no one can
inherit the popular support that he won this year by simply
mouthing empty slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of reform is all the more urgent because, with Gore
and Bush having a clear path to their parties' nominations, fund
raising has now risen to the top of their agendas. The Bush
campaign's $70 million war chest is almost depleted, drained by the
costly fight against McCain. Amazingly, the vice president is said
actually to have more money on hand than the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needs to raise at least some money under the regular
federal limitations of $1,000 per contributor. But both candidates
will be turning their attention to raising the unregulated ``soft
money'' donations for the Republican and Democratic parties that
were the focus of the scandals of 1996. As expected, Bush has
rejected Gore's offer to forgo soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the two parties are expected to haul in more than
$500 million from corporations, unions and rich donors. That is
twice the sum they collected four years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both parties consider themselves in an arms race and feel they
cannot unilaterally disarm. That is understandable given the
pressures of an all-out campaign. Thus it is imperative that Gore
keep pressing Bush to accept a joint ban on soft money, and that
McCain and Bradley, who are still in a position to command public
and political attention, keep up the pressure on the candidates and
the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Common Cause pointed out again how the soft money
raised last year came from unions, the securities and investments
sector, the telecommunications industry and other groups with a
stake in legislation before Congress. To be fair to many of the
donors, the soft-money scam may often be less a case of businesses
trying to buy influence than of politicians trying to shake the
businesses down. Either way, the process is corrupt. It insures
that the wealthy special interests of this country will prevail, no
matter who wins in November.
</P>
<P>
   After their thoughtful but ill-fated drives for the White House,
McCain and Bradley can best fulfill the promises they made to their
supporters by keeping national attention riveted on the need for
reform. &QL;

 House subcommittee looks into fetal tissue market  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
c. 2000 The Kansas City Star WASHINGTON -- Members of U.S. House
subcommittee called Thursday for a federal criminal investigation
into whether fetal tissue was illegally extracted and marketed out
of an Overland Park, Kan., clinic where abortions are performed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The request came during a packed and emotional hearing of the
Health and Environment Subcommittee, which wants to find out if
laws restricting the methods and fees allowed for fetal tissue work
are being violated in Kansas or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing focused mostly on Lee's Summit, Mo., pathologist
Miles Jones, a key witness who failed to appear despite a subpoena.
Committee members had wanted to ask him about a contract to do
tissue extraction at Comprehensive Health, the clinic of Planned
Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Another Lee's Summit man, medical technician Lawrence Dean
Alberty Jr., did testify, but admitted making false statements in
the past about profiteering.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood issued a statement Thursday denying any
wrongdoing and called for a full inquiry into Jones or others who
may have tried to improperly profit on fetal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee voted unanimously to hold Jones in contempt. If
the full House agrees, Jones will be subject to arrest next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear he has chosen to ignore the mandate of this
committee,'' said Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., a Virginia Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has not returned repeated phone calls from The Kansas City
Star. No one answered the door at his two-story home in a Lee's
Summit subdivision Thursday afternoon. A neighbor, who asked not to
be named, said Jones is rarely seen there and that both Jones and
his wife appear to travel frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of the abortion issue denounced Jones
for statements he made during a hidden camera interview with the
ABC News show ``20//20,'' broadcast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told a program producer who posed as a potential investor
in his business that he could make $50,000 a week selling tissue.
Hearts, brains, livers and other fetal parts can bring ``what you
can sell them for,'' he said, when demand is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for this type of gross violation of the law
and sickening disrespect for human life,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, a
Michigan Republican who wrote the 1993 bill that outlawed selling
tissue at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Upton wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno calling for
an investigation. There was no indication of a federal or state
investigation in Kansas, but the Jackson County, Mo., prosecutor's
office said it has begun looking into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the committee who support a woman's right to
abortion services also denounced profiteering, but voiced fears
that abortion opponents would try to exploit the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that the charges leveled today, while serious
and troubling, are also being used by pro-life groups to inflame
the abortion debate,'' said Rep. Lois Capps, a California Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not sensationalize this process,'' said Rep. Henry
Waxman, a California Democrat. The controversy should not detract
from evidence that fetal tissue has proved valuable in research to
fight diabetes, AIDS, hepatitis B, Parkinson's and other diseases,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they appreciate the value of fetal tissue
research but they said they are concerned there will be more
abortions if fetal tissue research become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did not get any clear answers Thursday on what is
considered a ``reasonable'' fee for extracting, packaging and
transporting fetal tissue. Jones had a price lists for his company,
Opening Lines, that included $999 for a brain, $150 for skin, and
$325 for a spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had a contract with Planned Parenthood for fetal removal
for about ten weeks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brownlie, president of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and
Mid-Missouri, said Thursday that contract was terminated after
officials learned of his price list and other business practices.
Planned Parenthood also had differences with Anatomic Gift and had
terminated that relationship earlier in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Planned Parenthood employee testified of concerns about
fees Anatomic Gift paid to the clinic for space rental because of a
lack of documentation on how the fees were calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw how widely the amounts varied, I became
concerned,'' said Lynn Fredericks, who was terminated in 1997 as
director of physician services at the clinic of Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlie has said Planned Parenthood did not collect excessive
amounts. No one does that kind of work at the clinic anymore but
may in the future in compliance with the law and ethics, Brownlie
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the right of women having an abortion to choose to
donate tissue,'' Brownlie said. ``We also strongly support laws
that prohibit the sale of fetal tissue and protect women form any
coercion, pressure or incentive to donate.''
</P>
<P>
   The most graphic and criticized testimony at the hearing came
from Alberty, who worked for Anatomic Gifts and then for Jones at
the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty testified of becoming distraught after witnessing
fetuses being born alive and then cut up to get body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty said he agreed to share his experiences with a pro-life
organization called Life Dynamics, based in Denton, Tex. Alberty
admitted accepting more than $10,000 from Life Dynamics to work
under cover gathering information.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty said he also accepted $400 to make a videotape for Life
Dynamics in which he told stories of seeing viable fetuses killed.
He said donned a woman's wig to hide his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Under sharp questioning by Republicans and Democrats, Alberty
said he exaggerated to Life Dynamics about what he witnessed and
acknowledged he had no personal knowledge of excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty maintained that what he told the committee under oath on
Thursday was true. During a recess, Alberty cried beside the
witness table and said testifying was very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by one congressman why he would tell Life Dynamics false
stories, Alberty said ``It's what they wanted to hear.''

TOYOTA CELICA: A LOOK SO VERY NOW. (IS IT OLD YET?)

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12)  
 (af)  
 By DAN NEIL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any doubts I had about the design of the new Toyota Celica were
erased when I pulled into the lot of the local car wash. One look
at the red, serpent-headed sport coupe sent the rag-wielding
workers into a frenzy worthy of the early hominids in ``2001: A
Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. The Celica has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, cars with so much instant youth appeal _ call it a
high ``fly'' quotient _ don't have a long shelf life. The 2000
Celica, the seventh-generation car to wear that nameplate, revels
in the current edge-design idiom, with more bevels, corners,
creases and flares than a napkin folded like a bishop's hat.
</P>
<P>
   Its doorstop shape and menacing, trapezoidal headlights cater _
nay, pander _ to ``slammers,'' those West Coast youths who modify
imported coupes with cosmetic and performance add-ons.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Celica is the product of Toyota's intricate
demographic analysis of Generation Y; not surprisingly, the new
design plays to a young audience. The average age of the Celica
buyer has dropped to 33 years old, from 42.
</P>
<P>
   But does the look have legs? The downfall of computer design and
rapid prototyping is that as vehicle development times grow
shorter, the urge to shape a car to the moment grows stronger. With
all of its slammer-inspired surface excitement _ the wing, the hood
nostril, the plunging fenders, the glassy blisters on the
headlights _ the Celica seems somehow as ephemeral as a California
sunset.
</P>
<P>
   The Celica, like the Mercury Cougar before it, illustrates the
difference between good design and fashion. One makes a lasting
contribution to the visual world; the other shows off cool-looking
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And like trendy footwear, the Celica fails to inspire deep
attachment in those who drive it. I sampled the GT-S model powered
by a howling 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine. Developed with
Yamaha, this all-aluminum motor, bristling with variable-valve
timing and exotic fuel and ignition controls, produces peak power
between 6,000 rpm and the redline of 7,800 rpm. Consequently, to
keep the car in the horsepower zone you must stir the six-speed
shifter like Emeril Lagasse concocting a roux. At lower rpm, the
car positively falls on its nose.
</P>
<P>
   Push the throttle past six grand and the engine, with a little
gasp as the valves open up, starts to chirr like an overtaxed yard
appliance, loudly enough to swamp the cabin with noise and antsy
vibration. The first time I heard it, I could hardly believe it.
Toyota leads the industry in vanquishing noise, vibration and
harshness _ what auto engineers commonly call NVH. This car seems a
perverse celebration of NVH.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, Toyota figured that its target buyers _ the
steel-nerved teenagers who listen to Korn at runway-decibel levels
_ might enjoy the car's mechanical bombast. But again, how long can
such appeal last? Seeing as the car weighs only 2,500 pounds, I
believe its performance would not suffer unduly from an additional
50 pounds of sound-muffling material.
</P>
<P>
   The GT-S model produces 180 horsepower and 133 foot-pounds of
torque. The GT model, powered by a similar 1.8-liter motor, turns
out 140 horses and 125 foot-pounds. A five-speed manual
transmission is standard with the GT; a six-speed manual comes in
the GT-S.
</P>
<P>
   Both cars are available with four-speed automatic transmissions,
and the GT-Ss can be shifted manually with buttons on the steering
wheel, as in the Lexus GS400.
</P>
<P>
   Its youth-inspired shortcomings notwithstanding, the Celica GT-S
is an awful lot of fun to drive hard, if only you are in the mood.
Typical for Toyota products, the ride compliance is excellent over
a variety of surfaces, yet the chassis maintains surprising poise
when pushed through quick corners. An orthodox suspension of
MacPherson struts up front and double wishbones in back benefits
from the low body weight (there is less mass to control) and
excellent wheels and tires: low-profile 16-inch radials wrapped
around five-spoke alloy wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth and stout braking is provided by large disc brakes at all
four wheels. But, surprisingly, four-wheel antilock brakes _
standard on such quotidian fare as the Chevy Cavalier _ are a $550
option on both Celicas. That seems unduly flinty for Toyota,
considering that this is its mainline sports model.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from the bonds of daily commuting, the Celica comes into
its own on country roads. With a deft use of the gossamer-light
clutch, the car can be launched to 60 miles an hour in less than 7
seconds. At speed, the car bends silkily into corners, answering to
the firm and accurate steering. A lightweight, powerful sports
coupe can be a beautiful thing, as the Celica so nearly is.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Celica is a fantasia of arcing lines and swooping
dash vinyl. Among the curiosities is a center console shaped like a
snowshoe; high on the dash, in the toe of the snowshoe is a large,
lidded storage bin _ it can handle 8 compact disk cases or 10
cassettes _ in what should be prime instrument real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The GT-S has a CD-equipped stereo with eight speakers, and the
sound system's performance is adequately raucous to drown out even
the engine at full shout. Obviously, high-quality audio is a big
part of the car's mission profile.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny aluminum pedals, drilled out like a racecar's for
lightness, gleam in the foot well. Under a deep binnacle, the
lettering on the orange-on-black dials recalls the italic script in
Porsche sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   The bucket seats in front are excellent, comfortable and
supportive leather-lined sockets. The seats in back are there
primarily to hold down insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Celica is a fast, frantic and stylistically fussy little
sports coupe tuned to a higher pitch than one is accustomed to
hearing from Toyota, even counting the tightly wound Supra, now
defunct. As a product of copious market analysis, the Celica aims
at its target audience with the precision of a political attack ad.
But presidential campaigns end, and to everything there is a
season. The Celica may not be forever, but it is definitely now.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: CENSORS IN THE SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 10:
</P>
<P>
   Rush hour on New York City's subways has never been for the
faint of heart. Yet the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has
decided that its clientele would flee the subways if they were
allowed to see a new advertisement that compares a crowded subway
to an overloaded cattle car. The ad, part of a campaign for transit
improvements by the Straphangers Campaign and the Regional Plan
Association, features a picture of subway riders under the caption
``With livestock it's called animal cruelty. With people it's
called a morning commute.'' The authority rejected the advertising
last week as being ``directly adverse'' to the commercial interests
of the transit system. Or as one official explained, ``it might
drive riders away.'' The idea that New Yorkers might stampede if
subjected to the livestock comparison would be a joke if rejecting
this ad were not so clearly a serious challenge to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Straphangers Campaign and the Regional Plan Association have
filed suit in federal court charging a violation of the First
Amendment. The two advocacy groups had planned a $500,000
advertising campaign to run in more than 2,000 subway cars in April
to generate public support for a Second Avenue subway line and
other transit improvements. Their message deserves to be heard as
the state Legislature gears up to consider the MTA's
capital-spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA's rejection of the cattle ad seems clearly
unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has held that transportation
agencies, which function in part as a business, can exert some
limited control over the advertisements they run and can even ban
whole categories of advertising. But the MTA is still a public
agency that must not carry out its policies arbitrarily. The
authority has willingly sold advertising space to other advocates,
including both anti-abortion and pro-choice groups. The agency has
even taken earlier ads from the Straphangers Campaign and has
grudgingly accepted an ad for the April campaign that is tamer than
the one it rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional issues aside, common sense suggests that the MTA
as a public agency ought to allow for a broad range of civic
expression. The subways are one of the most appropriate forums to
argue transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the MTA established sweeping and self-serving
guidelines for rejecting ads, but top officials insisted they would
not be used to ban political ads critical of the agency. This page
and others were skeptical. At one public meeting to discuss the
rules in 1997, a member of the Straphangers Campaign wore a gag and
stood before the microphone silently to protest the possibility
that speech would be illegally silenced by the authority. At the
time, MTA officials dismissed the gag as a publicity stunt. It
turned out to be an accurate prediction.

SPORTS COLUMN: RADICAL REALIGNMENT IS SENSIBLE BUT OWNERS AREN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball owners have this magnanimous outlook on realignment.
Realign? Absolutely, they say. Certainly we need to do that. It
will improve the game and our revenue, and heaven knows, we need
more revenue. But what's that? You want my team to change leagues,
change divisions? Oh no, we couldn't do that. Not us. No, let the
other guy move. We have the right to say no, and by golly, we're
saying no.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario, basically, was the one that a few years ago
undermined the effort to have significant realignment. The
Milwaukee Brewers, owned at the time by the acting commissioner,
Bud Selig, were the only team that was willing (eager, some
baseball people said) to change leagues. Radical realignment had to
wait for another day.
</P>
<P>
   That day still isn't here. Selig, now the commissioner, will
present to the owners either at a meeting next month or the
following one in June a realignment plan, but it can't be
considered radical. To Jerry Colangelo, if it's the plan that has
been most discussed, it would be radical, but not to any of the
other owners. They haven't lost their selfish view of what might
be, to coin a phrase, in the best interests of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo operates the Arizona Diamondbacks, one of the two most
recent expansion teams. Before the other owners allowed the
Diamondbacks and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays into their exclusive
club, they coerced from them a higher entrance fee, at the last
minute, and the agreement that they could be moved to the other
league after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. Under the plan getting the most attention,
the Diamondbacks and the Devil Rays are the only teams that would
change leagues, the Diamondbacks moving to the American and the
Devil Rays to the National.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the commissioner Fay Vincent responded to a request
from half of the National League teams and ordered realignment of
the league's divisions to make them geographically correct. Atlanta
and Cincinnati would move to the East, the Cubs and St. Louis to
the West.
</P>
<P>
   The idea made eminent sense, to everyone but the Cubs, that is.
Their owners, Tribune Co., sued Vincent, even though owners sign an
agreement that prohibits them from suing the commissioner, and then
became co-conspirators in the move to oust Vincent. It was not,
Tribune Co. argued, in the best interests of baseball to move the
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current plan, some teams would change divisions, but
none of those teams has complained, at least not publicly. Members
of the Cardinals expressed outrage earlier this week over the
prospect of being in a division without the Cubs, their archrivals,
but their protests were based on incorrect information. A published
report had reversed the Cardinals and the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   With the National League changing to a four-division format for
the 2001 season, North East and South East divisions would be
created. The Mets would be in the North East with Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh and Montreal. The Reds and Atlanta would be in the South
East with Florida and Tampa Bay, a refugee from the AL.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs and the Cardinals would form the Central division with
Milwaukee and Houston, and the West would have Los Angeles, San
Francisco and San Diego. Tribune Co. has not threatened a lawsuit.
Come to think of it, Tribune Co. didn't sue, either, after the Cubs
were switched from the East to the Central in 1993, when the NL
went to three divisions.
</P>
<P>
   One baseball official said the difference between Vincent's
attempted move of the Cubs and Selig's is that this realignment
will lead to an unbalanced schedule and the rotation of divisions
for interleague play. But the 1992 plan made the same geographical
sense that Selig's plan does.
</P>
<P>
   The unbalanced schedule is long overdue. For too many seasons, a
team played basically the same number of games against teams in
other divisions (12 each) as it did against teams in its own
division (13 each). Under the planned format for 2001, the Mets
would play the Phillies, the Pirates and the Expos 20 times each,
then play nine games against each team in a ``sister'' division,
six games each against teams in the other two divisions and 18
interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, with a slightly different breakdown because the AL
would maintain its three divisions, would play 18 games each
against Boston, Baltimore and Toronto, nine each against the other
10 teams and 18 interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-team AL would have four teams each in the East and West
and six in the Central. That even-numbered alignment would create a
better schedule, especially for division races in September, than
the 5-5-4 format that exists now.
</P>
<P>
   The new alignment would create another imbalance. The AL would
continue with a wild-card team in its playoffs, but the NL playoffs
would have four division champions and no wild card. Only in
major-league baseball can the leagues play under different rules
(see designated hitter) and formats.
</P>
<P>
   Under any realignment plan, the Texas Rangers will leave the AL
West and join their Central time zone brethren. It's the pledge to
the Rangers that is causing the problem for the Diamondbacks. The
departure of the Rangers would leave a vacancy in the AL West, and
that's where Arizona seems to be headed.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, Colangelo keeps saying, reluctant to relinquish the
Diamondbacks' home in the NL. Colangelo said he called Selig after
seeing a newspaper report this week about the realignment plan that
had Arizona changing leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reassured me that's old, rehashed speculation,'' Colangelo
said by telephone from Phoenix. ``I'm counting on Bud. Bud said he
is looking at other options. Why should we be the team just because
they have the right to move us?''
</P>
<P>
   If Colangelo's arguments sway Selig and the commissioner decides
to leave the Diamondbacks where they are, the team then most likely
to move would be the Colorado Rockies.

WHEN COMPUTERS KNOW WHAT A STRANGER CAN'T  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To hear some Internet executives tell it, the
stranger eating a salad at the desk of her Manhattan retail shop
shouldn't have become so perturbed when I asked for her style
preference in lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   But she looked at me as if I had asked if I could rifle through
her purse for loose change. So I tried a different tack. ``Then can
I just have your Social Security number?'' I asked, polite as could
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me!?'' she said, now looking like she might pull a
rifle from her purse.
</P>
<P>
   My inquiry was precipitated by the recent debate about how much
personal information Internet companies like DoubleClick should be
allowed to gather on Web surfers. To its proponents, the concept is
that by tracking what sites people visit and what they buy online,
dot-com companies can direct advertising to people, based on their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Internet companies assert that consumers are eager
for this personalized service. But it isn't easy to accept that
perspective blindly, because one bit of data we know about the
executives is that they get more money from advertisers if they can
direct ads to people based on their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I wondered, how willing are people to part with
personal information if they are asked in person _ truly confronted
with a choice about whether to confide _ rather than being tracked
invisibly and automatically over the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   The salad-eating woman, the proprietor of a lingerie shop, made
it clear that she preferred to disclose nothing except her strong
desire for me to leave the store.
</P>
<P>
   But for every person like her, I found at least five people as
loquacious as Milton C. Schlein. I wandered into . Schlein on a
sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan while he was standing outside his
office smoking a Marlboro and reading The Wall Street Journal.
Schlein, 67, a securities analyst who regularly uses the Internet,
appeared to be from the old school. Describing his taste in music,
Schlein said he liked ``both kinds: show music (italics)and(end
italics) classical.''
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation (and after I'd disclosed myself to be a
reporter and shown him identification) Schlein easily shared the
above information and more: he drives but doesn't own a car, reads
history books, has smoked for 50 years and often visits Yahoo.com
and Amazon.com. He even seemed on the verge of confiding his Social
Security number and perhaps would have if I had been able to
produce, in exchange, a tape of the New York Philharmonic playing
``Annie Get Your Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't he worry about giving such information to me, or having
it tracked online? ``It's nothing someone couldn't find out in five
minutes,'' he said, explaining that he has succumbed to a world in
which personal information is widely accessible. That said, he
wasn't too keen on disclosing whether he had ever visited an adult
Web site. ``That I wouldn't answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the woman at the lingerie shop wasn't the only person
I approached and asked for personal information who looked at me as
if I was in serious need of a Thorazine drip. But perhaps many New
Yorkers, accustomed to living in tight spaces, are more willing to
share than their brethren nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some people shared Schlein's sense that there was no point in
trying to keep most things private. One woman let me watch her shop
at a Duane Reade drugstore for Tums and nail polish, saying, while
perusing the suppository section, that she and her husband own
``dirty movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, within minutes of meeting me, confided that she
suffered severe depression, recently lost her mother to pneumonia
and was having financial trouble with her condominium. As I walked
off, the woman proudly showed me a picture of her with Maury
Povich, whose talk show she said she frequents.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in a roundabout way, gets to a point raised by Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, an advocacy group. ``People go on `The Jerry Springer Show'
too,'' Rotenberg said. ``The larger question is whether they should
have the right (italicsnot(end italics) to go on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Rotenberg believes that Web sites should make clear
what information they are capturing and give users a clear option
to decline to participate. In other words, the Web sites should
have to ask for information as clearly as I asked the woman at the
lingerie shop _ perhaps not face to face, but in no uncertain
terms.
</P>
<P>
   When I pressed that woman about why she was so reluctant to
share information, I asked whether she might be more willing to
give information online, in an anonymous setting, rather than being
confronted in person, in such a relatively intimate setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone were on the Internet or on the phone,'' she said,
``I wouldn't have been so nice when I told them to go to hell.''

198 NEW APTS. $2 MILLION AND UP. VIEWS OF ALL OCEANS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TERRY TRUCCO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday night, the owners of 47 luxury apartments in a new
$260 million complex are invited to a lavish cocktail party in
London to toast their future homes and to meet the interior
designers who will decorate them.
</P>
<P>
   Though they come from several different countries, including the
United States, Britain, Germany, Norway and France, the new
neighbors have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having a minimum net worth of at least $5
million, they have agreed to pay $2 million to $6.84 million in
cash for furnished apartments they have never seen in a structure
that will not be completed until December 2001. Their dwellings do
not even have a permanent address, but every apartment is
guaranteed an ocean view.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the World, the first cruise ship conceived as a
residential community. Under construction since September at the
Fosen Mekaniske Verksteder A/S shipyard in Rissa, Norway, the
644-foot-long, 40,000-ton vessel is about midsize for a cruise
ship. It will house 110 privately owned apartments and 88 guest
suites available for rent to the owners' friends or staff as well
as a limited number of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Owners can sell or rent their apartments whenever they wish. But
with less than half the lodgings sold on a ship that is about half
the size of the one originally planned, the investment potential of
these apartments is at best unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they raise the question, we tell them they are buying a
lifestyle experience, not an investment,'' said Fredy Dellis, chief
executive officer of ResidenSea Ltd., the privately held company,
incorporated in the Bahamas, that owns the ship.
</P>
<P>
   A glossy, sea-blue promotional book, about the size and shape of
a coffee-table art book, boasts that the ship will have the
amenities of the world's most sybaritic resorts _ a full-size
tennis court, two swimming pools, a jogging track, putting greens,
driving ranges, boutiques, a health spa, a nightclub, a casino and
a theater offering movies and classical concerts by visiting
artists.
</P>
<P>
   A crew of 252 will care for residents as the ship follows the
warm weather to places like the Italian and French Rivieras, the
Greek islands, the Caribbean, the Baltic States, the Chilean fjords
and the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The ship will dock at length for events like Carnival in Rio de
Janeiro, the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Grand Prix in
Monaco. After the first two years, the ship's equivalent of a co-op
board will choose the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has two- and three-bedroom apartments, ranging from
1,106 square feet, a typical two-bedroom apartment on land, to
3,252 square feet, the equivalent of a sprawling Park Avenue co-op.
All come with fully equipped kitchens, walk-in closets and
terraces; hot tubs are optional.
</P>
<P>
   ResidenSea's marketers take pains to distance their ship from
the big, glitzy andmore mass-market vessels associated with the
cruise industry. With plans to spend 250 days a year in port, and
small enough to enter some ports off the usual tourist path, the
ResidenSea ship is being marketed as an apartment complex that
travels rather than as a cruise ship with condos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship allows you to travel around the world without leaving
home,'' Dellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Beckwith, a property developer from London with homes in
France and Colorado, bought a space on the ship even though he has
never taken a cruise. One reason for buying, he said, was the
opportunity to stay in his own apartment, instead of hotels, while
he traveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I will fly in and use the ship as a hotel home in
the cities or resorts we want to visit, but I don't plan to spend a
lot of time cruising,'' Beckwith said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buyers, who prefer to remain anonymous, have a
greater affinity for the sea. But as a first-generation
entrepreneur in his 50s, Beckwith fits the profile of his fellow
apartment owners, Dellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Dellis said full-scale mock-ups of four apartments would be
shown starting in May in Baden, Austria. ResidenSea expects about
half the owners to be North Americans and 40 percent Europeans. And
the company hopes to build more residential ships. ``We've always
believed this ship was not a one-off,'' Dellis said.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the cruise and real estate industries is as
optimistic. ``It's a fascinating concept, absolutely unique, but
the question is whether there are enough people who want to sink
money into a cruise ship that goes around the world,'' said David
Seaman, a real estate analyst with Pricewaterhouse-Coopers.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a shipboard apartment is not cheap; the annual fee
is about 5 percent of the purchase price, or $100,000 on a $2
million apartment. Industry experts say that figure is high, but
not out of line with similar luxury properties on land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're sort of a bargain in a way, depending on how
much you plan to use it,'' said Mike Thiel, president of Hideaways
International, an upmarket travel agency and club in Portsmouth,
N.H. He said expenses on high-end cruise ships were about $700 a
day per person.
</P>
<P>
   But Thiel expressed doubts about a long-term investment in a
ship. ``Ships deteriorate and require a lot of maintenance,'' he
said. ( Dellis said the ship would have what accountants, if not
seamen, call a sinking fund to cover all maintenance.)
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, a New York
real estate firm specializing in high-end properties, said the
purchase cost and annual fees were comparable to those of an
unfurnished suite at the Pierre Hotel in New York, which comes with
daily maid service and costs $84,000 a year to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you say you have a suite at the Pierre, the entire
world knows you've arrived,'' Corcoran said. ``I'm not sure you
have such an association with an apartment on a luxury cruise
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the ship has not been easy. It is only half the
size of the 1,000-foot-long, 80,000-ton megaship with 260
apartments and 180 guest suites _ larger than the Queen Elizabeth
II _ envisioned in 1997 by Knut U. Kloster Jr., the former chairman
of Royal Viking Line and a member of the Norwegian family that
developed the modern cruise industry in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in oil prices, which hurt the Norwegian investors, and
the dip in the Asian financial markets made it impossible to raise
the $190 million needed to start building.
</P>
<P>
   The scaled-down plan requires an initial investment only half as
large. In addition to Kloster, ResidenSea's backers include
Silversea Cruises, which will oversee the ship's day-to-day
management; CNA, the American insurer; and several Norwegians in
the cruise, shipping and hospitality industries.
</P>
<P>
   The apartments come furnished, and the cost includes the work of
a choice of four very different designers: Nina Campbell, the
London-based designer known for a traditional English look; Juan
Pablo Molyneux of New York, known for opulent, antique-filled
interiors; Luciano Di Pilla of Rome, who creates contemporary,
European-style designs; and Yran &AMP; Storbraaten, the ship's
architects, who devise fashionable yacht interiors. Owners can
provide original antiques to replace reproductions, or hang their
own art.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and Molyneux said their designs differed only in small
details from what they would devise for apartments in Mayfair or on
Park Avenue. Shelves will have raised edges to prevent objects from
falling when seas are choppy. ``And I didn't use metals or bronzes
that might corrode,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Molyneux said fabrics had to meet fire safety standards, but his
usual choices from Clarence House and Brunschwig &AMP; Fils fit the
bill. ``The experience should be like magic,'' he said. ``One
minute you're walking on an ocean liner. But when you turn your
key, you've come back home.''

PEE WEE KING, `TENNESSEE WALTZ' WRITER, DIES AT 86  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pee Wee King, an eclectic and innovative country music
entertainer who was a writer of the pop classic ``Tennessee
Waltz,'' died on Tuesday at Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Ky. He
was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Born Julius Frank Anthony Kuczynski in Abrams, Wis., he began
his musical career in the least country way imaginable: playing
accordion and concertina in his father's polka band. In the early
1930s he performed with Gene Autry before Autry became a star in
Hollywood westerns.
</P>
<P>
   After working with Autry, he changed his name to Pee Wee King
and settled in Louisville. He formed a band, the Golden West
Cowboys, which joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   At the Opry he developed a reputation as an entertainer and an
innovator, the two often going hand in hand. Instead of pretending
to be hillbillies, the members of his band dressed in flamboyant
outfits designed by Nudie the Rodeo Tailor. King was also unafraid
of using nontraditional instrumentation in the band, including
trumpet, drums and electric guitar. In addition, the band added
polkas and waltzes to the more traditional country fare.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s performers like Eddy Arnold, Cowboy Copas, Ernest
Tubb and even Minnie Pearl appeared with King's band, but one of
its most important members was the vocalist Redd Stewart. King
wrote at least four songs celebrating Tennessee, including
``Tennessee Polka,'' ``Tennessee Tears'' (with Ernie Lee) and
``Tennessee Tango'' (with Stewart). Then, inspired in part by Bill
Monroe's ``Kentucky Waltz,'' King and Stewart wrote ``Tennessee
Waltz'' in 1946 and recorded it two years later for RCA Victor.
Patti Page's 1950 recording of the song for the Mercury label sold
some three million copies, becoming one of the best-selling singles
of its time. Fifteen years later ``Tennessee Waltz'' became an
official song of the State of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951 King recorded his only personal No. 1 hit, the novelty
song ``Slow Poke,'' written with Redd Stewart and Chilton Price. It
became a million-record seller for RCA Victor. The trio also wrote
the 1952 hit ``You Belong to Me,'' which was recorded for Columbia
by Jo Stafford and sold two million copies. It was successfully
revived 10 years later by the doo-wop group the Duprees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 King was host of his own musical variety show for ABC
television, ``The Pee Wee King Show.'' He also appeared in several
Westerns. Over the course of his career, he wrote or co-wrote more
than 400 songs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he left the Golden West Cowboys to become a director for
the Country Music Foundation. He also worked at other jobs in the
country music business. In 1974 King was inducted into the Country
Music Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Lydia Frank, of
Louisville; a daughter, Marietta Wuchterl; three sons, Frank Jr.,
Gene C. and Larry L. King; a brother, Ervin Kuczynski; a sister,
Irene Cetnarowski; six grandchildren; and eight
great-grandchildren.

ON THE ROAD AND ON THE WEB _ AND IN DANGER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When car phones first became popular, some people
asked whether motorists could talk and drive safely at the same
time. A decade later, that question seems naive; many new cell
phones can connect a laptop computer to the Internet, or the phones
themselves have screens that can be used to browse the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential distractions now popular in cars are navigation
systems with maps to point the way to a destination, or maybe just
to the nearest florist. Some high-end vehicles have video-screen
controls for trip computers, built-in phones, air conditioners or
stereo systems.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure just how much distraction a driver can stand, but
there are indications that the answer is less than the ones that
already exist, not to mention all those that automakers and
electronics companies are promising to deliver. For example, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists three fatal
crashes in the last few years attributed to in-car fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be the distraction of manipulating the
dials, switches or keypads of electronics gear in the car, but even
voice-activated systems have safety officials worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voice activation on cell phones mitigates the problem at the
beginning of the call and the end of the call,'' said H. Keith
Brewer, director of the Office of Human-Centered Research at the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, referring to phones
that respond to oral commands like ``call home'' or ``hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you have in between is they're deeply engrossed in
the conversation,'' Brewer said. ``You can have cognitive overload;
your hands may be on the wheel, but is your mind on the road? We
really worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more to worry about. Sirius Satellite Radio, which
plans to use satellites to broadcast to cars, and ATX Technologies
recently announced that they would develop products to let drivers
buy the music they heard on the radio, ordering it as they drove.
</P>
<P>
   And Ford Motor Co. said it would offer Internet features,
including e-mail, calendars, news, weather and traffic reports,
through the cellular phones of Lincoln models. Ford's system would
work by speaking and listening, rather than displaying data on a
screen. Jacques A. Nasser, the company's chief executive, said:
``Henry Ford put the world on wheels in the 20th century. In the
new century, Ford Motor Co. will put the Internet on wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, however, would not drive the car.
</P>
<P>
   Even before electronic gadgets began to appear in cars, driving
was what psychologists call a divided-attention task, because
drivers have to watch the road and the speedometer at the same
time, while reading street signs and working the controls _ perhaps
having a conversation with a passenger or threatening to discipline
unruly children in the back seat. And psychologists agree that
attention may now be divided in too many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question you are asking is `Can you walk and chew gum at
the same time?''' said Barry S. Anton, a psychology professor at
the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash. ``The answer is:
`Yes, but ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say people can divide their attention _ or,
perhaps more accurately, alternate it _ if tasks use different
senses, like vision and hearing. ``You can talk on the phone and
drive a car because driving the car involves visual and motor
skills more than auditory skills,'' Anton said. And driving is
routine for experienced drivers. ``But as demand for one modality
increases, divided attention weakens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Janet L. Shucard, an assistant professor of neurology at the
University of Buffalo, studied subjects' ability to push a button
when they heard a certain syllable in a soundtrack. People were
also given the task while listening to ``a very engaging story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do the task equally as accurately as without the
stories,'' Shucard said, ``but the timing of the decision-making
process is slowed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Shucard said, people can divide their attention if
one of the tasks is automatic, as much of driving is. But at the
point that driving ceases to be automatic, performance may suffer.

<P>
   Government researchers have always tried to measure distraction
through accident statistics, but with limited success. In fatal
accidents, the person who may have been distracted cannot say so,
because he or she died. In minor collisions, there is no police
report; if there is one, it often does not indicate the reason for
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   But experts suspect that at least a quarter of the crashes in
which a vehicle is towed away occur because of inattention _ more
than 1.5 million crashes a year.
</P>
<P>
   Field testing would tell researchers about performance and
divided attention, but it would create an ``ethical problem,''
Brewer said; they cannot send drivers out to cruise the highways
and browse the Web.
</P>
<P>
   By June, however, the highway traffic agency will have finished
developing a driving simulator that will allow it to do the
equivalent. The $50 million device has a computer that will
translate signals from the steering wheel, accelerator and brake
pedals into changing scenery on video screens that surround the
car, and a system to push, pull and tilt the simulator to make the
motion feel realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers can introduce a variety of actions, including
vehicles that cut off the driver, animals or pedestrians that dart
into the road, and other stimuli beyond the moment-to-moment
challenges of driving.
</P>
<P>
   The scenarios can be repeated, with the same driver or with
different drivers, and with various distractions added. Researchers
also plan to give test drivers doses of drugs and alcohol, to
measure the effect on performance.

ABC'S KATZ UNLEASHES HIS CLAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ABC's version of ``March Madness,'' even those
without a straitjacket have trouble keeping the pairings straight.
</P>
<P>
   Network sports chief Howard Katz, who hasn't been in the big
chair a year, has detonated the foundation of ``Monday Night
Football'' louder and quicker than a Dick Vitale cliche. Katz'
scheme isn't to go in a new direction but to dig up an old one;
build it not with lightweight fiber but old mud and clay. He's
bringing out of retirement the legendary producer-director Don
Ohlmeyer to help a show he left more than 20 years ago, a man whose
most recent public decision - that Norm Macdonald wasn't funny at
NBC - ironically actually helped ABC's prime-time lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way, Katz also dumped analyst Boomer Esiason, eating
a reported $1.3 million contract in a move needed since his hiring
two years ago but one that at least diverts attention from the
mayhem created by the Ohlmeyer decision.
</P>
<P>
   And thankfully - somehow - Al Michaels avoids the debris and
remains the play-by-play pillar of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Sifting through the rubble, what does this mean? Katz isn't all
bark, for what that's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we have to make the show special again,'' he said
Wednesday night. ``It has to be a big event again. I'm looking for
a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   So fired were Ken Wolfe and Craig Janoff, who have produced and
directed ``MNF'' together the last 12 years and kept it a
consistent top 10-rated prime-time show. They created something
that Katz characterized as having too much ``sameness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sameness in that it was the third-ranked prime-time show last
fall and the network's top-rated show until the Philbin-phenomenon
``Millionaire'' lust caught on. And sameness like ... ESPN's
``Sunday Night Football''? Whose fault is that?
</P>
<P>
   A year after ABC bounced Dan Dierdorf and two after easing out
Frank Gifford, sacking Esiason and bringing in one or two people
with some personality would have solved 99 percent of that
``sameness'' problem two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overly surprised (by Katz's decision), knowing the
tension that was growing within ABC Sports,'' Esiason decided to
say to the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   But in an equally bizarre move, Katz, who started his TV career
as an assistant on ``MNF'' back in 1971, has brought back mentor
Ohlmeyer, who produced the show from 1971 to '77 and has since been
golfing after a run as NBC's West Coast entertainment president.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Katz talked Keith Jackson out of retirement to
return to a reduced play-by-play workload on college football
games. That made sense. But with Ohlmeyer, you get the feeling that
if Howard Cosell were alive, Katz would have stopped his Social
Security payments, too, and shown Michaels the exit.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer says he wants to bring back the element of surprise and
danger to the ``MNF'' telecast. If so, start by bringing back your
old pal, O.J. Simpson. Or Frank (begin ital)and(end ital) Kathie
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Katz already has set off the nitro with these brash decisions,
for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fertile field to plow,'' Ohlmeyer said of his new
job, ``and to do it in an interesting, innovative way that will
keep people tuned in.''
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say Norm Macdonald?
</P>
<P>
   You rule: The idea behind ESPN's special ``NHL Rules!'' telecast
isn't so much to dumb things down as it is to ... well, maybe it
(begin ital)really is(end ital) to dumb things down.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's first instructional live telecast of the Jan. 9 Colorado-
Chicago contest - using no play-by-play guy, two analysts, having
an NHL referee sit in to interpret rules and taking e-mail from
viewers - drew positive reviews from those who matter most, the
folks at home. The second try will be with Tuesday's exclusive
Ducks-Avalanche game from Denver (ESPN, 5 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (that telecast) exceeded expectations,'' said Darren
Pang, one of two analysts (with Bill Clement) who worked that game
and will be there Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for the viewers and don't want to
appear condescending. We try to explain it as if we're coaching a
kid's hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   That Jan. 9 show marked a few firsts for Internet-TV sports live
coverage: It was the first time visitors to a Web site interacted
with on-air analysts during a game telecast, and it was the first
time that athletes participated in an Internet chat during a game.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,300 questions were submitted to chat-room hosts
Steve Levy and Barry Melrose in the three-hour telecast, and 17,000
unique users popped into the ESPN.com chat room set up specifically
for the telecast. Levy and Melrose typed in some of the answers and
passed questions on to Pang and Clement, who responded on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Before the second and third periods, ESPN.com users participated
in audio format chats with players Tony Amonte and Joe Sakic, who
were picked in ESPN.com user polls before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Both elements are expected to be used Tuesday, with e-mail also
accepted from NHL.com. And for a game this late in the season, Pang
said there will be more explanation on what a team like Anaheim,
desperate to get into the playoffs, might do tactically at certain
situations to avoid taking a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Borgen, the Kings' game producer on Fox Sports Net, likes
the idea of the ``Rules!'' telecast but doesn't see doing that for
one of the local telecasts. With NHL expansion into so many new
cities lately, a national telecast like this works. In L.A., it
needs more balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jim Fox, I think we are always half educational with our
replays,'' said Borgen, ``but we're more subtle about it. You have
to know your audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's like opera - people who watch it, watch it; people
who don't, don't. It's too bad that 30 years later, we still need
to have offsides explained. But then, how many baseball fans really
know the infield-fly rule?''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Pang: ``It's no different with the Toronto Raptors and
Vince Carter I promise you they'll do a similar thing in Canada
with a basketball telecast. I just hope Americans don't say, `Those
dumb Canadians.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, we won't.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -Nike's inspired ``Bracketville'' TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   -ESPN Classic's 23-hours-long ``March Madness Marathon'' starts
Sunday at 4 p.m. with the 1983 Western Regional first-round game
between North Carolina State and Pepperdine, as the Waves, coached
by Jim Harrick, take the eventual national champions, coached by
Jim Valvano, into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   -The acceptance speech by NBC's Bob Costas after he was named
Favorite Sportscaster of the Year at the TV Guide Awards in L.A. on
Monday: ``I'd like to thank the viewers for being so kind and the
editors of TV Guide for apparently misplacing all the ballots that
were cast for Al Michaels.''
</P>
<P>
   -Sport magazine has a golfer on its cover - Tiger Woods, of
course - marking the first time a PGA Tour player has made its
cover since Johnny Miller 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -The NBA's bumbling attempt to make coaches wear mikes on the
bench during nationally televised games. Two league-wide memos have
reportedly been sent out, requiring coaches to comply if they are
approached by NBC or TNT. The latest memo threatens them with a
$100,000 fine if they balk, which is what the Lakers' Phil Jackson,
Miami's Pat Riley and Indiana's Larry Bird have already done. Now,
there's also talk of a memo reportedly informing teams that cameras
in the locker room (to see what?) are being considered on a
voluntary basis, which has already caused players to start
squirming and union boss Billy Hunter to threaten legal action.
Maybe NBA officials should focus on the positives that have come
out of this, such as a recent game when Philadelphia coach Larry
Brown wore a mike for NBC and it was used on tape, then remind the
players and union who (begin ital)really(end ital) pay the salaries
and that more people watch at home than in person because that's
all they can afford. At least then there might not be such a
resistance to a little bit of technological progress that's already
become a bigger deal than it needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   -TNT giving Charles Barkley a two-year deal to be a studio
analyst. (begin ital)This(end ital) is a reason to fret about
having someone miked.

 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1946 the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired its
first painting by Picasso, his portrait of Gertrude Stein, painted
in 1906 when he was 24 and she was 32. (When told that Stein did
not resemble his image of her, Picasso famously predicted, ``She
will.'') Unexpectedly, Stein bequeathed the portrait to the Met;
she wanted it hung in a museum whose stature was equal to her own.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it the first Picasso to enter the Met, which was at
that time scarcely interested in pursuing 20th-century European
art, but it was also the museum's first acquisition by a living
artist of the School of Paris. And it provided a cornerstone on
which a modern collection could be built.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has added much to that foundation, particularly during
the last 20 years, and the additions are celebrated in a huge show
assembled by its department of 20th-century art, ``Painters in
Paris: 1895-1950.''
</P>
<P>
   On display are more than 100 works from the department's
collection by prominent artists of the School of Paris. (This
rather loose term refers not to any particular style, but to the
many innovative artists working in Paris from the turn of the
century to just after World War II.)
</P>
<P>
   The premises of the exhibition are a little complicated. For one
thing, it is the third in a series of acquisition shows mounted by
the Met's individual curatorial departments _ the two others were
by the medieval department and the American Wing (whose notable
acquisitions from 1980 to 1999 are on view through Nov. 12). But
this show is slightly different: It concentrates on a single aspect
_ the School of Paris _ of a much larger 20th-century collection.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the exhibition is not confined to recent
acquisitions but goes all the way back to 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Works acquired between 1979 and 1999 are marked by a small blue
symbol denoting recent acquisitions, and their presence is a
tribute to the grand acquisitorship of the department's chairman
and the show's organizer, William S. Lieberman. He joined the Met
in 1979 after a long curatorship at the Museum of Modern Art and
stepped up the department's acquisitions considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Lieberman's gift for collecting significant
collectors, the museum has snagged not only individual works but
also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects
bequeathed by Florene M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and
Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces bequeathed in 1998. (Only
10 paintings from the Gelman donation are on view here; the group
will soon be shown in its entirety.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 67 School of Paris acquisitions over the last 20 years
were gifts; the Met had to dip into the till for only four.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show fills eight galleries of the Lila Acheson
Wallace Wing with work by some of the 20th century's greatest _
Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse,
Miro, Modigliani, Monet and Picasso among them _ Lieberman points
out that what is on view is by no means a complete survey. There
are important gaps, including works by Giacometti, Duchamp and
Masson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the parade of treasures, while admittedly a distance from
the awesome trove held by the Museum of Modern Art, is enough to
bedazzle the most jaded Met-goer. Many of these works have been
shown individually or in various theme exhibitions. But to view
them laid out as a half-century of masterpieces _ a period that
spawned the vital movements of fauvism, cubism, futurism and
surrealism _ is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   Influences, correspondences, relationships of form and color
(Lieberman is good at installing works to point up these themes)
are apparent in ways they would not be were the objects not
gathered together. The roughly chronological arrangement sometimes
pauses to take account of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The show begins with early works by Bonnard, Maurice Denis and
Edouard Vuillard, at that time members of the Nabis, a small group
of painters and poets who took the name from the word ``prophet''
in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   They were influenced by Gauguin's expressive (as opposed to
realistic) use of bright color and flat decorative patterning. Six
of the nine Bonnards in the show are in this gallery, along with
four Vuillards and one painting by Denis, a stylized, brightly
lighted mythoreligious scene titled ``Springtime'' (circa 1897),
which is a study for a larger decoration.
</P>
<P>
   The two earliest Bonnards, from 1895 and 1899, are unexciting,
hardly predictive of the sensuous fusion of color and light in his
later works. Of those accompanying them, ``The Green Blouse''
(1919) stands out, a soft melange of figures and still life in rich
colors with a window view of a fine sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   The show's best Bonnard, the very large ``Terrace at Vernonnet''
(1939), hung in another gallery, is a masterpiece glowing with warm
peach-orange tones, in which the figures of women are deftly melded
with a dreamy, summery landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A surprise is the huge, tapestrylike painting by Vuillard,
``Place Vintimille, Paris'' (1916), a pleasant urban landscape that
is a far cry from the busy, patterned interiors with which the
artist is associated. His lovely summer mood piece ``Morning in the
Garden at Vaucresson'' (1923 and 1937), hung nearby, is a more
typical intimist view.
</P>
<P>
   A little out of sync here, but far more radical than the other
paintings, is one of Monet's numerous waterlily paintings. Titled
``Reflections, the Waterlily Pond at Giverny'' (circa 1920), it is
an intense, richly brushed almost abstract close-up of leaves,
blossoms and water that throws off scintillating light reflections
while drawing the eye into its dark, liquescent depths.
</P>
<P>
   From the fauve period, Matisse's well-known masterwork ``The
Young Sailor II'' (1906) stands out. More decorative than
realistic, it is a vividly colored study of a burly tough with
masklike features who stares boldly at the viewer, the curves of
his body played off against a straight-backed chair.
</P>
<P>
   The artist most heavily represented in the show is _ would you
believe _ Picasso, with no fewer than 22 works. An important group
of his pre-cubist paintings includes a wistful Blue Period
``Harlequin'' (1901) and ``The Actor'' (1904-05), a large,
mannerist-style painting of an emotive figure that is transitional
between his blue and rose periods.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the display of important cubist works, Picasso's ``Still
Life With a Bottle of Rum'' and Braque's ``Still Life With a Pair
of Banderillas'' (both 1911) are paired. The two, composed of
fractured planes, lines, invented shapes and shadings, inflected by
letters, were painted at the same time at Ceret, a Pyrenees town
where the artists, who together invented analytic cubism,
collaborated.
</P>
<P>
   In a surrealist mode, Picasso is well represented with ``Nude
Standing by the Sea'' (1929), a grotesque view of the female body
as quirky architecture, with a tiny ball for a head perched atop a
pyramidal tower.
</P>
<P>
   Other surrealist notables are Miro's ``Dutch Interior III''
(1928), the only Miro in the show; it is a playful canvas with a
freewheeling calligraphy of black and brightly colored biomorphic
forms, linear scratchings, a hint of a foot, and ebullient bird
shapes. Yves Tanguy's ``Hostages'' (1934), with its blobby
humanoids massed against a distant horizon, is a classic surrealist
dreamscape.
</P>
<P>
   Even though de Chirico's ``Jewish Angel'' (1916) precedes
surrealism by almost a decade, it is an important precursor, with
its odd assemblage of draftsman's tools topped by a left triangle
and presided over by an enormous eye, painted on a piece of paper
folded over in one corner. No angel, Jewish or otherwise, can be
discerned in it.
</P>
<P>
   Of three arresting Legers, the star is ``Woman With a Cat''
(1921). A monumental, highly stylized rendering of the seated
woman, all puffy curves set off by linearities with bold color
areas, it is vintage Leger, down to its four-fingered hand, a
notable Leger idiosyncrasy.
</P>
<P>
   The only still-living artist whose work is in the show is
Balthus, now 92, whose four paintings go back to the 1930s. The
biggest, and most remarkable, is ``The Mountain'' (1937), a
dreamlike, semi-surrealist tableau of figures in an Alpine summer
landscape, which owes a visible debt to the rocky terrains of
Courbet.
</P>
<P>
   World War II and the years immediately following are brilliantly
represented by Jean Dubuffet, whose three early paintings comment
on wartime Paris. ``Woman Grinding Coffee'' (1945), a highly
textured, playfully primitive rendering of a squat woman
manipulating a coffee grinder, was a Christmas gift to his wife
when real coffee was difficult to come by in Paris. His unusually
bright-colored ``View of Paris With Furtive Pedestrians'' (1944)
shows male and female walkers, the women wearing wooden clogs
because of the scarcity of leather.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much, much more here to show the growing strength
of the Met's once-limited School of Paris holdings. And not to
worry, the museum's hand will always be extended, palm up. As
Lieberman says in the catalog, ``A growing collection can never be
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Painters in Paris: 1895-1950'' is at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, New York, (212) 535-7710,
through Dec. 31.

EDITORIAL: A GOOD TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 10:
</P>
<P>
   Congress should quickly approve legislation needed to smooth
China's admission to the World Trade Organization. By helping China
into the WTO, lawmakers would not be endorsing Beijing's policies
in other areas, like human rights and Taiwan. They would be
speeding the opening and reform of China's economy and
subordinating Beijing's arbitrary authority in trade matters to the
rule of international law.
</P>
<P>
   What President Clinton seeks from Congress is a change in
China's trade status under American law. Currently, China's access
to normal trading privileges in the American market is subject to
annual congressional review. Under the bill submitted this week,
China, as a prospective member of the WTO, would be granted normal
trading status on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, some members of Congress used the annual debates
over China's trade privileges to challenge Beijing's human rights
record and other offensive behavior. But linking these issues to
trade made no obvious sense and produced scant results.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Clinton administration has wisely separated
its efforts to open Chinese markets from other aspects of
Washington's relations with Beijing. That has allowed the
administration to support trade policies that serve American
interests, while opposing Chinese actions that conflict with
American values or threaten regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   Last November the White House negotiated a highly favorable deal
with China on WTO admission terms. Beijing committed itself to end
export subsidies and open its markets more fully to American
farmers, telecommunications companies and financial institutions.
By joining the trade organization, China will invite international
scrutiny of its performance in keeping those pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Senate approval of the needed changes in trade law seems likely.
But the outlook in the House is less promising. At this point, only
50 to 60 House Democrats are willing to break ranks with organized
labor, which strongly opposes the legislation because it wants
continued annual review of China's harsh labor practices and denial
of political freedoms. These are legitimate concerns, but best
addressed outside the trade status legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 more Democratic votes are needed, since many
Republicans who might otherwise have voted yes have been alienated
by Beijing's recent noisy threats against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress approves the China trade legislation by the end
of this spring, the issue is likely to get caught up in campaign
politics and delayed until next year. By then, China might back off
from some of the market-opening concessions it is now offering.
Neither the Taiwan issue nor labor's misplaced opposition should
hold up an early, positive vote. The China trade bill serves broad
American interests and deserves strong bipartisan support.

   NEW YORK _ It is by a remarkable coincidence that the Jewish
Museum should have just opened an exhibition whose subject is
largely identical to that of ``Painters in Paris: 1895-1950'' at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The subject is the same, the time
span is the same and quite a few of the artists are the same. But
the Jewish Museum show is ``Paris in New York: French Jewish
Artists in Private Collections.''
</P>
<P>
   This is somewhat misleading in that the show includes artists
who were no more French, by birth, than I am. But it was in France
that they found freedom and stimulation on a scale not to be found
elsewhere. They identified with Paris and Paris supported them, no
matter how precariously, in times of trouble. And New York
collectors have done well by them.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the exhibition, for instance, there is a
painting by Max Weber, who was born in Russia in 1881, came to the
United States in 1891 and went to France in 1905. Once in Paris he
made his mark with Gertrude Stein, Robert Delaunay, Henri Rousseau
and others. He also attended the school that Henri Matisse opened
in 1908. The first painting in the Jewish Museum is, in fact, a
Weber work that shows the interior of Matisse's Academy with the
cast of Apollo that students were encouraged to copy. As such it is
a historical document.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Jewish artists of the time, Elie Nadelman is not
included in the Met exhibition, but at the Jewish Museum he stands
out. His 10 years in Paris were invaluable to him, and his three
bronzes in the show have the dandified elegance that persuaded
Helena Rubinstein to act as his patron and sponsor when he returned
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Lipchitz, though not everyone's favorite sculptor, was a
solid, well-established figure in Paris. (The catalog for the
Jewish Museum show illustrates the house that Le Corbusier built
for him in 1924.) In midlife he did not have the lightest of hands,
but the Jewish Museum scores very well with his ``Detachable
Figure: Seated Musician'' (1915). This is a figure of a cellist in
painted wood. It manages to be exact, funny and debonair. Even the
stiff white collar of the cellist is straight from the laundry. The
image is not pedantic. Nor is it flippant. It is just right, and a
tiny masterwork.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing discreditable about the exclusion of these
artists from the Met exhibition. No show of this kind is a
dictionary answerable from A to Z. The spaces of the Jewish Museum
have a certain privacy that give luster to little paintings like
the ``Carpenters and Fish'' of 1912 by Marc Chagall. Chagall's
involvement in everyday life in his native Russia may well have
been all the more intense while he lived in Paris from 1910 to
1914.
</P>
<P>
   As to what these artists and many others found in Paris, the
catalog has much to say with archival photographs and a lively text
by Romy Golan. Paris was genuinely a second and often an uproarious
home to many artists from other countries. Whether or not they
succeeded in any lasting way, there was a camaraderie in
Montparnasse that was the stuff of genuine legend. Simply to be
there, and to hang around, was to be part of a multinational buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists who are also prominent in the Met show,
Modigliani comes out well here with his limestone head of 1911-12,
his portrait of Leon Lindenbaum and his portrait of the English
poet Beatrice Hastings, with whom he lived in 1914-15. If there is
such a thing as a specifically English face, Beatrice Hastings had
it in spades with her tall, narrow, slightly judgmental look, and
Modigliani got it down on canvas. The portrait is completely unlike
what people expect of Modigliani.
</P>
<P>
   Soutine comes out very well at the Met, and at the Jewish Museum
there are four very good examples of his work. ``Hanging Turkey''
(circa 1925) has the particular gash and bite of the brush that
only Soutine had.
</P>
<P>
   A notable absentee from the Met is Sonia Delaunay. Her ``Rythme
No. 5'' of 1939 at the Jewish Museum is only a little gouache on
paper, but it has the gaiety that she kept for the rest of her long
life (1885-1979).
</P>
<P>
   The relevant rooms in the Jewish Museum still have the character
of a rather grand private house. The paintings have room to
breathe, and the portrait sculptures by Chana Orloff, in
particular, look as if they were completely at home instead of
being on loan for a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   As for the catalog, it has almost the character of a family
album, thanks to the fullness of its biographical material and its
highly evocative group photographs. Golan's long text is a treasure
box of relevant quotations from publications that not all of us
have on hand. This show is, in its way, an understated triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris in New York: French Jewish Artists in Private
Collections'' is at the Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street,
(212) 423-3200, through June 25.

HULL GETTING CHANCE TO REST HIS AILING HIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Brett
Hull's nagging hip flexor continues to rob him of the ability to
accelerate, and that it's time to allow the injury a chance to heal
before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will hold Hull out of games and practice for three or
four days, including Friday night's game against the New York
Islanders, Hitchcock said. Hitchcock said Hull will be evaluated
Saturday and might play Sunday against his former team, the Western
Conference-leading St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to get better,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's not able to
push off with any acceleration. It's just too weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who is on a strenuous exercise program off the ice, scored
his 20th goal of the season and the 606th of his career on
Wednesday. The goal marked the 13th consecutive season that Hull
has scored at least 20 goals, although he is on pace to have his
lowest-scoring season since he was a rookie in 1986-87. HATCHER
DOUBTFUL
</P>
<P>
   Nine games into his return from a lacerated calf muscle, captain
Derian Hatcher is doubtful for Friday night's game with a sore
Achilles' tendon. He played Wednesday with the flu, but left the
game in the third period with the injury.
</P>
<P>
   He had a magnetic-resonance-imaging exam Thursday, and the Stars
expect the results Friday. Hatcher missed nine weeks before
returning Feb. 18. SYDOR UP FRONT
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Darryl Sydor played on the wing Wednesday because so
many forwards were injured. After Derian Hatcher left the game,
Sydor moved back to defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said Sydor will play up front Friday on the power
play and might see time as a winger depending on Hatcher's status.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Jon Sim, recalled from the Michigan K-Wings on Tuesday, scored
his fourth goal of the season for the Stars on Wednesday in his
third stint with the team. Sim was recalled Feb. 25 and was in
uniform for four games, but did not play before being sent back to
Kalamazoo, Mich. ``I'm just waiting for my chance to play,'' Sim
said. ``I want to make the most of it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ken Hitchcock will not visit the White House on March 16 with
the rest of the team to celebrate their Stanley Cup championship
because of a scheduling conflict. Hitchcock plays host to the
Family Gateway Golf Tournament, a charity event, on that day. nn

TV SPORTS: AFTER BEING DISMISSED, ESIASON FIRES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to all needing) (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boomer Esiason, fired from ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' on
Wednesday, Esiason vented his fury Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He fulminated about Al Michaels, his on-air partner, saying he
squelched Esiason's desire to be looser and funnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the happiest he's been for a long time because he's a
one-man booth,'' Esiason said during a phone interview. ``Al is
propped up as the star and wants to do things his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels was unavailable to comment on Esiason's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ABC did not return Esiason's fire. ``Boomer's contribution to
`Monday Night Football' is highly valued,'' said Mark Mandel, an
ABC Sports spokesman. ``He's got many close friends and admirers
here, so we understand his frustration after yesterday's
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels has worked well in previous three-man booths in
football (with Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford) and baseball (with
Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver). Any backstage tensions failed to play
out on the air or become public knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason also described himself as a victim of infighting at ABC
Sports, where a new president, Howard Katz, and a new executive
producer, John Filippelli, quarreled over the direction of the
program with Ken Wolfe, the producer, and Craig Janoff, the
director. Wolfe and Janoff were fired, after 14 and 12 years,
respectively, on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny and Craig had their own way of doing things,'' Esiason
said. ``And they were phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's hard when a new coach comes in and wants his
own team, but I'm sorry I had to be part of the purge, or the
smokescreen in front of the purge.''
</P>
<P>
   With Esiason, Wolfe and Janoff gone, Katz brought in his mentor,
Don Ohlmeyer, to elevate the show above the ``sameness'' he felt it
suffered from. Ohlmeyer produced ``Monday Night'' from 1973 to
1976. Ohlmeyer wants to revive the show's fromer penchant for
unpredictability and danger. But Howard Cosell died in 1995 and Don
Meredith isn't coming back from his retreat in Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ohlmeyer's arrival, ABC had begun talking to possible
analyst candidates like Bill Parcells, who will most likely stay as
the New York Jets' director of football operations through next
month's college draft; Steve Young, who did a fair job on ABC's
postseason studio show but has not decided to retire as a player,
and Jimmy Johnson, the former Miami Dolphins coach, who is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has also interviewed for jobs at Fox and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason is caught between his natural candor and his frustration
at the serious pothole in his new career. He didn't sign a
three-year deal in 1998 for $1.75 million annually to wind up
looking for a job after two. He went in with high hopes and little
experience, replacing Gifford as Michaels' and Dierdorf's mate.
After Dierdorf's release, Esiason worked with Michaels last season.
</P>
<P>
   Had Esiason been a true breakthrough analyst _ like Phil Simms
was in his first year at NBC _ he might have survived. Had ratings
been better, he might have stayed, too. But one senses that he
feels Michaels prevented him from being his best.
</P>
<P>
   So, feeling his talent didn't fail him, he is firing away. Doing
so after only two years may be risky if he wants to rebound with
CBS, Fox or HBO. The more experienced Dierdorf and Gifford chose
not to fire excess verbal bullets when they were let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really ambivalent about Al,'' Esiason said. ``At times his
on-air genius is so apparent, but at times his uneven nature and
meanness, not just toward me, but toward other people, is
disappointing. He has such a great job that he shouldn't worry
about what other people say.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason said he worked well with Wolfe and Janoff, getting more
in sync as their second season together concluded with the Super
Bowl and the Pro Bowl. Even Michaels has said, ``We really hit our
stride this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Esiason never felt Michaels gave him a chance to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do your job when you're trying to offer humor and
be provocative and the guy next to you isn't trying to bring it out
in you,'' he said. ``Al could have been better for me, and I tried
with him, but it never clicked with me because he never wanted it
to click.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason is again in risky territory. While Michaels is a
demanding perfectionist, he is the best play-by-play announcer in
football. He is much more loquacious than Pat Summerall or Dick
Stockton or Greg Gumbel. But Esiason said Michaels overplayed his
role and stifled his analysis.
</P>
<P>
   He notes how Dierdorf is a more relaxed analyst at CBS, working
with Verne Lundquist. ``Dan has a guy in Lundquist who sets him,''
Esiason said. ``This is Al's show, man. This is what he lives for;
he gives a lot of good information, but he's not the normal TV
announcer.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason said it was odd that some observers thought he didn't
get along with Dierdorf in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got along tremendously,'' he said. ``Whoever said we didn't
get along had to be someone who didn't want us to get along.''
