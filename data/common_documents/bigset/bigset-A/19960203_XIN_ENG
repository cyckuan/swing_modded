<HEADLINE> Iraq to Exempt Customs Duties for Ships Carrying Foodstuff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has decided to exempt
customs duties for the ships that reach it ports carrying
foodstuff, a senior Iraqi official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Khalil, Minister of Transport and Communications, said
that the foodstuff-laden ships will be also exempted from all
other tolls.
</P>
<P>
Umm Qasr port, a port in southern Iraq overlooking the Gulf,
will render free services to such ships with the aim of boosting
the national economy and meeting the basic needs of the Iraqi
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 48 mercantile ships carrying
with foodstuffs and farm machinery have reached Iraqi ports since
1993 with the consent of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The ships that reached Iraqi ports last year numbered 12 only
because more restrictions were imposed by certain parties to the
anti-Iraqi coalition formed following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The other factor was that maritime insurance for the
Iraq-bound ships became higher.
</P>
<P>
The minister's announcement came on the eve of the Iraq-U.N.
negotiations, slated to start next Tuesday, on implementation of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 986, which allows Iraq to export
two-billion-dollar-worth of oil for a span of six months so as to
enable Iraq to meet the humanitarian needs of its people.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's ANAP Leader Gets Mandate to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today gave the mandate for forming a government to Mesut
Yilmaz, leader of the Motherland Party (ANAP).
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister and True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman
Tansu Ciller this afternoon returned to Demirel the mandate she
received from him 15 days ago for the formation of a government.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's move came after she failed in her attempts to convince
Yilmaz to enter a coalition partnership with her DYP.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz and ANAP executives Friday categorically rejected
Ciller's proposals for a coalition between the two parties in
which each party leader shares the premiership on a rotating
basis.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's proposal had floundered on her insistence that she
become prime minister first under this formula.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told reporters after her meeting with
Demirel that she had tried the best to form the coalition
government, but failed.
</P>
<P>
She said that Yilmaz rejected all her proposals for the
formation of the government, adding Yilmaz had shut the door for
all the cooperation with the DYP.
</P>
<P>
The General Executive Board (GIK) of the DYP decided in the
meeting earlier today that Ciller should return the mandate to
form a government back to Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The GIK lambasted Yilmaz for refusing proposals brought to him
by Ciller "without any reasonable cause."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, after a meeting with Ciller Friday, had said that his
investigations had shown that up to two thirds of deputies in his
party were against any cooperation with the DYP, and almost
everyone was against a coalition government having Tansu Ciller as
prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHUKET, Thailand, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has stated that as long as Taiwan
does not try to become independent and foreign forces do not back
such dangerous efforts, problems between both sides of the Taiwan
Straits can be solved in the spirit of "One Country, Two Systems"
and through peaceful ways to achieve unification.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks here today during a bilateral meeting
with Japanese Foreign Minister Ikeda Yukihiko.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the hope that Japan would cautiously handle its
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister reiterated that his country will
maintain only unofficial and business ties with Taiwan,
</P>
<P>
Referring to the chemical weapons left behind by Japan in
China, Qian said those weapons are in a great number and have long
been abandoned. They pose a great hazard to the life of the people
in related areas and environment there.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his hope that Japan would take active and
effective measures to solve the problem as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister said his country will treat the issue
sincerely and will carry out its due duties in accordance with the
international convention on the ban of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Japan is a close neighbor of China's, and the Chinese
government has always attached great importance to Sino-Japanese
relations of friendship.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his confidence that even though there are
problems in the past in Sino-Japanese relations, the relations
would have excellent prospects if both sides correctly treat past
events and look forward.
</P>
<P>
Qian is here to attend an informal meeting of foreign ministers
of 10 Asian countries in preparation of the first Asia-Europe
meeting of leaders, scheduled for March 1-2 in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived in Thailand on February 1, and will leave for home

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- An American soldier was
killed in a land mine explosion in northern Bosnia earlier
Saturday, the U.S. army said.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Bill Donavan told reporters that the soldier
was manning a checkpoint at Gradacc, some 40 kilometers from
the U.S. peace implementation force's headquarters in Tuzla
when the explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
Further details of the explosion was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to tell the name of the killed
American soldier.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-strong American ground forces are entering into
Bosnia to enforce the U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace agreement to end
the 43-month bloody conflict in the Balkan country. As of Friday
nearly 15,000 U.S. soldiers have reportedly been deployed in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has repeatedly said that millions of land mines
are the biggest threat facing the U.S. peacekeeping troops in
Bosnia. Several American soldiers have been killed or injured in
the land mine accidents.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton on Saturday expressed regret over the
death of the soldier and said efforts would be intensified to
protect ground troops there.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Inflation Control Priority in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China will make
inflation control an economic priority in 1996, keeping the
inflation rate below 10 percent, said a senior Chinese official
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Controlling inflation will continue to dominate the macro
economic policy of 1996," said Chen Qingtai, Vice Chairman of
State Economic and Trade Commission of China, at the 1996 meeting
of World Economic Forum (WEF) that opened here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to keep inflation rate below 10 percent while
achieving a growth rate of 8 percent," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach the goal, "A moderately tight fiscal and
monetary policy will be adopted," Chen told more than 150 figures
from business at a symposium on China's economy organized by the
WEF.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the investment focus, Chen said that China will
increase input in agriculture, infrastructure and industries of
energy, transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
The economic development objective in the next five years for
China, Chen said, is to maintain a general balance of reform,
development and stability, quadruple its 1980 GNP by the year
2000, basically eliminate poverty and further integrate its
economy with the world one.
</P>
<P>
For this, Chen continued, China will realize two fundamental
conversions which have overall significance -- the conversion of
the planning economy into a market economy, and that of the
extensive growth mode into an intensive one.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Fair Parliament Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today warned the powerful Guardian Council to be neutral
in screening thousands of candidates for the parliamentary
elections slated for March 8.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with members of the Guardian Council, Khamenei
urged the 12-member council not to take sides with any factions
in a bid to attract more people in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from a total of 196 constituencies say
that 2,659 candidates have so far registered for the past three
days. About 5,000 candidates are expected to run for 270 seats
in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here noted that Khamenei's statement could
be interpreted as a criticism against the Guardian Council for
taking sides with the conservative camp headed by hardliner
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri is fighting hard against the moderate camp headed
by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in a bid to win a majority
in the parliamentary elections this year and win presidential
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament controlled by Nateq-Nouri even threatened to
impeach Rafsanjani and his cabinet members for intervention in
the legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei noted that those who love money and those who
work for the feudal and criminal should not be allowed to
enter the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, there should not be unnecessary analyses
or narrow-minded mess in screening the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Jannati, Secretary-General of the Guardian Council,
warned Friday the candidates against trying to buy people's votes
during the parliamentary polls, a move seen as an effort to keep
the moderates away from the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Raeesi, head of the State Inspector Organization,
said government organizations are banned from using state
facilities for election campaigns to the benefit of certain
candidates during the election process.
</P>
<P>
He said the minimum penalty for an offender is dismissal and
other penalties will also be given in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
According to reports in local press today, some people
were arrested by the law enforcement forces for carrying out
early publicity campaign for the elections.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Resigns, FM to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Sharif
Zeid Ben Shaker today resigned to pave way for Foreign Minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti, who is reported to have begun consultations
for forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that Kabariti began consultations with
various blocs in parliament, whose approval is essential for
forming the new government.
</P>
<P>
Speculations have been rampant on the government reshuffle
since last November, when king Hussein began to criticize the
government, particularly those ministers who were reluctant to
normalize ties with Israel and distance Jordan from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that last Tuesday the king accepted Shaker's
resignation and asked Kabariti to form the new government.
</P>
<P>
The move is widely seen as a major effort by King Hussein
to enable the new generation of politicians to take over
administrative power from the old guard.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, 46, has made great achievements in Jordan's
diplomacy since he took the post in January, 1995.

ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua)-- Turkish True Path Party (DYP)
chairwoman and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller today
returned her mandate to form a coalition to President Suleyman
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told reporters after her 25-minute meeting with Demirel
that she had tried his best to form the coalition government with
Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz, but failed.
</P>
<P>
She said that Yilmaz rejected all her proposals for the
formation of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ciller had proposed to Yilmaz that they rotate the premiership
in a coalition, but was turned down because she insisted that she
take first shot at the post.
</P>
<P>
"The DYP has shut the door to Yilmaz for all the cooperation
between the two parties," adding that it is necessary for the ANAP
to start the process of forming the government in order not to
waste time in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ciller received the mandate after pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP) leader Necmettin Arbakan failed to form a coalition
government on January 19.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, Yilmaz is expected to be
assigned this evening by President Suleyman Demirel to form a new
coalition government.
</P>

The ANAP has 133 deputies in the parliament.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong soccer team's top
goalkeeper Chung Ho-yin is widely expected to compete in the vital
final match of the Asian Cup Group Two qualifying tournament here
Sunday afternoon, against China.
</P>
<P>
Chung just escaped from a harsh punishment after he agreed
Friday morning to a charge at the Eastern Magistracy, of fighting
in a public place.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old keeper of the first division team of ulhsport
Rangers was charged to be involved in a fight with a South China
fan at the end of the First Division match three weeks ago at the
Hong Kong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Chung gave him up, together with another ulhsport Rangers staff
who had also joined in the brawl, to a nearby police station.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong team's first choice keeper was bound over by the
court for 12 months for 100 HK dollars (12.8 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although it was Cheung's first offense, he became the first
local player charged with such a conviction.
</P>
<P>
He had already been banned by the Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) for six months, but that will only involve
local competitions, not the ones like the op-going Asian Cup

<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua)-- Turkish Motherland Party (ANAP)
leader Mesut Yilmaz is expected to be assigned this evening by
President Suleyman Demirel to form a new coalition government,
reliable sources here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Demirel would meet Yilmaz at the
presidential palace at 16:30 GMT and give him the mandate to form
the government.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after True Path Party (DYP) chairwoman and
caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller returned her mandate to form
the government to Demirel.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Ciller decided to abandon her efforts to form the
coalition with the ANAP as her rival Yilmaz turned down Ciller's
proposal that they rotate premiership in the coalition, citing
Ciller's offer that she take first shot at the top job.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Pakistan State Shop Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The sale of the Utility
Stores Corporation (USC), the state-run chain stores in Pakistan,
has increase three times during the current holy month of fasting,
said a USC spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told local reporters that the main reason of the
increase was the reasonable prices of daily items offered by the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
The USC purchases consumer goods directly from the
manufacturers and sells them about 10 percent cheaper than those
in open markets.
</P>
<P>
Some kitchen items like cooking oil and sugar are 25 to 30
percent cheaper than the market, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The USC took measures to ensure that consumer goods are going
to the kitchen of the people and not to the shops in the market to
benefit hoarders and black marketers.
</P>
<P>
Items like sugar and cooking oil are only given to buyers who
purchase other items as well.
</P>
<P>
The sales of the USC's 900 outlets over the country last year
went up to 8 billion rupees (233 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the sales will cross the 10 billion rupees
(291 million dollars) mark in the current year.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Remains Quiet But Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Guinean capital, Conakry
remains quiet but tense on Saturday after rioting soldiers on
Friday fired cannons into the presidential palace setting the
west wing of the building on fire.
</P>
<P>
"Damage was considerable but Guinean President Lansana Conte
was on the east wing of the building when the incident
occurred," a foreign journalist reached by telephone from
neighboring Sierra Leone said.
</P>
<P>
Other soldiers roamed the streets of the Guinean capital,
ransacking government buildings and looted a number of stores,
one local journalist told the correspodent.
</P>
<P>
He said heavily armed troops loyal to the government were
patrolling the main streets of the capital with tanks.
</P>
<P>
Major of the markets in Conakry remained closed with few shops
opened on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government, apparently demonstrating it is still in
control, ordered Mig jet fighters of the Guinean airforce to fly
at intermittent intervals over Conakry. There have been no
reports of clashes in the interior of the country, the journalist
added.
</P>
<P>
Radio Guinea monitored from here is carrying repeated
broadcast of President Conte's appeal to troops to return to
barracks as "their grievances are being investigated." It is
not known whether the appeal was heeded.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the dusk to dawn curfew imposed on Friday
"passed off without incident" but added that "the curfew will
still remain for the time being."
</P>
<P>
Conte, responding to one of the striking soldiers' demands,
sacked his defense minister and ordered finance ministry
officials to pay up back wages due to the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The airport of Conakry still remains closed but overland
traffic from Sierra Leone continues to cross the Guinean border
where security has been re-enforced, border control guards told
the correspondent by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Guinean Embassy officials in Freetown said they suspected that
some of the soldiers had "wanted to topple" the administration
and were "using the poor conditions of service as a smokescreen."
</P>
<P>
They also confirmed that 12 people died in the affray but
independent sources in both Conakry and Freetown put the death
toll at 25.
</P>
<P>
They said that the main hospitals in the Guinean capital "are
full of people including some soldiers, reporting to be treated
from gunshot wounds and teargas ailments."
</P>
<P>
President Conte seized power in 1984 after the death of Sekou
Toure.

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlord Looses Senior Officers In Car Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and
three senior officers of General Mohamed Farah Aideed's
government are still missing after their vehicle was ambushed by
unknown gunmen last night.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place near Lego Village 15 kilometers
southwest of Mogadishu. The gunmen opened fire at their
Japan-made Corona car, killing their bodyguard on the spot,
according to the driver who later on died of his wounds.
</P>
<P>
Jama Farah Daqarre, the chief protocol of Aideed's South
Mogadishu presidential office and Mohamed Abdi Omar, a senior
officer of the only said to be bank sponsored by Aideed in South
Mogadishu and Abdi Jiir are the three missing ones.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the government of Aideed indicate that the
perpetrators are believed to be stranded guerrilla fighters of
the defeated Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA). However, other
unconfirmed sources dispute the allegations, mentioning that the
gunmen were supporters of Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the main rival of
Aideed.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Aideed's armed wagons were sent to the scene of the
ambush this morning for a possible rescue mission. However it's
widely believed the missing officers will be executed by the
angry RRA gunmen. The missing officers who were on their way to
Mogadishu from Baidoa were reportedly equipped with documents.
</P>
<P>
The RRA spokesman in North Mogadishu, Mohamed Nur Jiley,
accused Aideed for illegally holding two of their well respected
clan elders in Baidoa after they refused to bring their clan
militiamen to Aideed's government in Huddur of Bakol region where
he occupied more than two weeks ago. But Jiley declined to
comment whether his militiamen were involved in the ambush.
</P>
<P>
The RRA and Aideed have been fighting in Baidoa and Huddur
since Aideed's invasion of baidoa last September. The invasion
has seriously annoyed the factions opposing Aideed. Ali Mahdi
Mohamed has characterized the action as a wild territorial
expansionism policy.

budget as a tit-for-tat measure to fight back the United States.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said earlier at a press conference: "The budget
endorsed by the Iranian Parliament is to neutralize the plots and
conspiracies by the U.S., CIA and other organizations which are
related to the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
In today's report, he claimed, "Iran is not interested in
resumptions of ties with the United States. But we are not
interested in adding to the tension either."
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted that the blame for these tensions rests with
the Americans who make the provocations, Iran is not responsible
for the tension, nor for its intensification.
</P>
<P>
But as for the U.S. threat against Iran, he added, "we have to
say that the U.S. is not a threat to our revolution because the
revolution is much more serious to get harmed by such threats."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted "these threats do put pressure on the
country. Of course, this is not a one-way issue."
</P>
<P>
He said that after the success of the Islamic revolution,
Iran, too, has put a lot of pressure on the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spends its efforts against Iran and Iran, too, acts in
self-defense, they think that if Iran becomes successful in its
ideals, it will serve as a model to the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
In effect, he said, they consider Iran a potential threat for
their illegal interests. Of course the Americans should change
their views so that they can have more realistic policies, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pearl River Delta in
south China has witnessed a speedy development in heavy industry
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the region achieved fruitful results in exporting food,
house-hold appliances, garments, and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
In order to restructure the industrial mix, local authorities
of cities and counties in the region have invested a total of 30
billion yuan in heavy industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Two projects to produce 115,000 tons and 300,000 tons of
ethylene are under busy construction in this capital city of
Guangdong Province and Maoming, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A chemical industry base was set up in Zhongshan City. In the
coming five years, the base will use one billion yuan more to lift
its annual output value to five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Huizhou City will join hands with Holland's Shell Group to set
up a petroleum refining enterprise to process 450,000 tons of
ethylene as well as other products annually.
</P>
<P>
An iron and steel production base and a steel tube base have
been formed in Guangzhou and Zhongshan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A steel plate production base in Sanshui produced 102,000 tons
of galvanized sheet last year, which occupied 75 percent of the
country's market, with sales income to hit 780 million
yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Salim Zanoun, Acting Speaker
of the Palestine National Council, today criticized Israel for
making continuous difficulties for PNC members to enter
Palestinian territories, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Zanoun said, the Palestinian Authority (PA)
presented Israel with a list of the names of 160 PNC members who
wish to return.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far the return has not been approved.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security authorities told the radio that no list of
whatsoever has been handed over to them by the PA.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Palestinian elections on January 20, the
Israeli government declared that all members of the PNC will be
allowed to come back for a special session of the Palestinian
parliament-in-exile to discuss the change of the Palestinian
Covenant which calls for the destruction of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Leaders and members of both the Damascus-based Popular Front
for Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Democratic Front for
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) have submitted their requests for
entry into the autonomous areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Denies It Underestimates Asian Winter Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, Northeast China, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan on Saturday
denied the charge the Asian winter sports powerhouse had
underestimated the Third Asian Winter Games by allegedly fielding the
second-string athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese athletes here are not of the second class as
rumored," said Yoshiya Yamazaki, Chief de Mission of the 108-member
Japanese delegation. "Many of them will take part in the Winter
Olympic Games in Nagona of Japan in 1998."
</P>
<P>
Japan, who had topped the medal tally of the previous two games,
faces a tougher job to keep its number one position with a team mainly
comprised of high school and univeristy students as host China aims to
topple Japan with middle Asian winter sports giant Kazakhstan all
ready for a glorious debut at the games.
</P>
<P>
Most of the best Japanese speed skaters have been competing at the
World Cup series in Europe. Yamazaki didn't explain the absence of
the well known Japanese skiers.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki declined to speculate on the possible medal haul by the
Japanese, saying they "came here for friendship".
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation chief added that they regarded the
week-long games as a selection process or warm-up for the 1998 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
For the Nagona Games, the Japanese sports officials have persuaded
world known coach Mokihito Kashiwabaro out of retirement to train the
Japanese short-track speed skating team.
</P>
<P>
Kashiwabaro, who had produced bunches of world-class skaters in
1980s, said here on Saturday the Asian Winter Games would give his
students more international exposure and he expected them to pull off
the best ever performance in the 1998 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Former Japanese men's ice hockey star Shunji Tanaka, who led a
women's ice hockey team here to vie for the title with Kazakhstan and
China, said his priority job was to lead the squad into the top three
in the Winter Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Pins Great Hope on National Rural Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
recently wrote a letter to the All-China Federation of Supply and
Marketing Cooperatives (ACFSMC), urging it to make greater efforts
to guide the farmers into the market.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's letter was made public at the national conference of
the ACFSMC, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The cooperatives nationwide involve 75 percent or 160 million
of the country's rural households.
</P>
<P>
In the letter Jiang called upon the ACFSMC to adhere to the aim
of serving the farmers, provide them better services and play an
important role in the service system of the rural community.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past decades and especially since the
policy of reform and opening-up was initiated in 1978, the
cooperatives across the country have played a significant role in
boosting the rural agricultural production, enlivening the rural
economy, increasing farmers' income and building a socialist
country with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Chen Junsheng, state councilor and general director of the
ACFSMC, delivered a report on the theme of turning the
cooperatives into authentic co-operative economic entities of
farmers at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the cooperatives to take in more farmers and
encouraged them to participate in the decision-making and
management processes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng, Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun and member
of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Wen Jiabao have
also made important instructions concerning the work of the
nation's rural cooperatives on various occasions.

</P>
<P>
In the four heaviest-hit townships in Zado and Zhido counties

<HEADLINE> Experts Propose Cooperation Between Macao, Zhuhai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Experts from Macao and
neighboring Zhuhai Special Economic Region of China's mainland
have proposed a wide-range cooperation projects between the two
areas so that they can help each other in promoting economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The proposals cover the cooperation in such fields as airport,
industrial production, tourism and joint development of an island
development zone, according to the experts attending a two-day
seminar, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Lei Yi, manager of the Investment Promotion Department of the
Zhuhai Airport Group Company, said that the Macao International
Airport and the Zhuhai Airport can cooperate in a series of issues
to benefit each other.
</P>
<P>
They can, for instance, cooperate in the running of air
routes. Chinese passengers can go to Zhuhai first and then to
foreign countries via Macao at a lower price compared with direct
flight to Macao, while foreign passengers to Macao can go further
to China's inland via Zhuhai at a cheaper cost.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Air Macao is running international routes while the
Zhuhai air company runs domestic lines. If a proper channel is
established, both sides can benefit from it, Lei said.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will help improve their competitiveness among
the densely-located airports in the Pearl River Delta, which now
boasts airports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Foshan
cities. More passengers are expected to travel via this route
because of its cheaper price.
</P>
<P>
Following the expected surge in passengers, tourism cooperation
also has a bright prospect, said Zhang Qianling, deputy director
of the Zhuhai Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
She said that both Zhuhai and Macao have rich tourism resources
including ancient temples, celebrities' homestead, seaside
sceneries, and other entertainment facilities. They can cooperate
well to attract more sightseers.
</P>
<P>
About eight million people travel to Macao a year and some
three million to Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
"The growth of tourism industry in the two sites rely on the
joint market promotion work of the two sides," she said at the
seminar, adding that "We should publicize the advantages of both
sides to attract more tourists."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some Macao scholars have proposed
cooperation in industrial production to boost economy.
</P>
<P>
Cheong Wai Chi, president of the Macao-Portugal-Taiwan Chamber
of Commerce, said that Macao needs skilled laborers and new
technology from Zhuhai to help upturn its economy from slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts should be made to establish a special development
zone, he said. In such a zone, skilled laborers from China's
inland and new technology will add new blood to Macao's economy.
</P>
<P>
Macao's economic growth over the past two years has slowed
down, as a result of lack of capital, skilled laborers, and new
technology, plus a higher cost of salary, he said, adding that all
these problems might be solved with help from Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Zhuhai echoed him and said that a special zone
should be established between Hengqin island of Zhuhai and Coloane
island of Macao so that the two sides can well perform its
cooperation.

</P>
<P>
The main land supply routes to Kabul have been cut by rival

<HEADLINE> Happiness Project Benefits Poor Mothers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Because of natural disasters and
moving to new homes, Zhang Donghua, a rural mother living in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, owed a debt of 11,000 yuan and
4,500 kg of grain last year.
</P>
<P>
Yet Zhang is expected to pay off all her debt and achieve
prosperity in three years, with the assistance from the organizing
committee of the Happiness Project.
</P>
<P>
The project, jointly sponsored by the China Population Welfare
Foundation, the Family Planning Association of China and "China
Population News," is designed to help mothers in China's
poverty-stricken areas get rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Since its launching a year ago, the project has provided
production materials worth 1,000 to 2,000 yuan to each of the 430
poor mothers in Anhui, Guizhou, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. The
mothers will also be trained in production techniques.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a resident in Yu'an Village, Lu'an Township, Dali
County, got a cow worth 2,500 yuan. She is expected to escape
poverty in three years.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyuan, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge
of the State Family Planning Commission, said that the Happiness
Project is in accordance with the guideline of the UN conference
on population and development.
</P>
<P>
She added that the project is also intended to advance the
status of women and protect their legitimate rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
China currently has some 70 million people of 20 million
families living under the poverty line, according to a report
released by the Happiness Project Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
For instance, of the 10 million poor people in southwest
China's Guizhou Province, 3.92 million earn less than 200 yuan a
year.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the women in poor families in underdeveloped
areas are illiterate. For instance, 70 percent of the illiterate
in Guizhou Province are women.
</P>
<P>
A recent medical check in Dangchang County, Gansu Province,
shows that of the 405 women checked, 87 percent suffer from
various kinds of gynecological diseases.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, the Happiness Project was launched to
mobilize various social sectors in China and abroad to help poor
mothers participate in social and economic development and improve
their educational and health standards, according to Yu Dehui,
deputy secretary general of the China Population Welfare
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation issued an open letter last November, urging more
enterprises, institutes and individuals to join in the compaign
for aiding and changing the life of millions of poor mothers
across China.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Happiness Project Organizing Committee has provided
50,000 yuan, respectively, to Qianshan County in Anhui Province,
Puding County in Guizhou, Dali in Shaanxi and Lixian in Gansu
Province. The counties each have allocated 50,000 to supplement
the money provided by the committee to aid local poor mothers.
</P>
<P>
The funds are used to buy sheep, cattle and pigs for the poor
mothers, finance the upgrading of tea plantations for them and
treat sick mothers.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare workers predicted that average earnings of the
poor mothers who have received assistance are expected to rise to
1,000 yuan this year and become prosperous in three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Development
Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) recovered 6.83 billion rupees (199 million
US dollars) in January under its loan recovery drive, registering
an increase of 35 percent over the corresponding month of last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to an ADBP announcement here today, the bank only
recovered 5.06 billion rupees (163 million dollars) in January
1995.
</P>
<P>
The bank's board of directors has approved a cash award system

<HEADLINE> Syria Looks forward to Christopher's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian media today called on
the United States to bring pressure on Israel to get it comply
with the objective prerequisites of peace on top of which is the
withdrawal of the Israeli troops to the border lines of June 4,
1967.
</P>
<P>
Israel should also accept the principle of equitability of any
security arrangement between Syria and Israel, Syrian mass media
underlined.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's
new tour in the Middle East, the Syria media said the recent
Maryland talks between Syria and Israel have stumbled due to the
gap between the positions of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Syria accused Israel of uncompliance with the principles of the
security arrangements along the Syrian-Israeli borders after the
proposed withdrawal of the Israel troops to the June 4, 1967
borderlines.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreement seven months earlier in
Washington under which Israel is to pull out its troops from the
Syrian Golan Heights and return to the original border lines
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The recent statements of the Israeli officials led Christopher
to stress the importance of peace between Israel on the one hand
and Syria, Lebanon and the Arabs in general on the other.
</P>
<P>
Considering Syria the key to the establishment of comprehensive
peace in the Middle East, Christopher has pledged to multiply
efforts to reach an agreement between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian media hailed the remarks of U.S. President Bill Clinton
in a joint press briefing yesterday with his French counterpart
Jacques Chirac in which Clinton said that he believed that Syria
was serious and true in its pursuit for peace.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative for comprehensive peace in the Middle
East," Clinton pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration should prove its determination to
establish comprehensive peace on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
during 1996 which Washington considered one of its priorities,
Syrian media highlighted.

<HEADLINE> Bachelor in Jinan Cares for Run-Away Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A boy had been wandering about
streets in freezing weather in January in Jinan, capital of east
China's Shandong Province, for four days before being taken home
by Zheng Chengzhen, a 47-year-old bachelor.
</P>
<P>
"The boy hasn't eaten anything for four days," Zheng said,
while bringing a bowl of hot rice to the boy in his early teens
who ran away from his home about 200 k m away from the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is the 85th child Zheng has taken care of since he met a
boy in rugs, who was begging for food at the local railway station
in the summer of 1987.
</P>
<P>
Zheng took the boy back to his home and had cared for him for
three months before he finally confessed that he ran away from
home for fear of being beaten by his parents for his poor
performance in school.
</P>
<P>
Later, Zheng returned the boy to his parents.
</P>
<P>
"If these wandering children are left in the streets for a long
time, they will meet scoundrels and be led astray," he said. "I
won't let them follow my example."
</P>
<P>
Zheng, who lost his parents when he was a small boy, had been
in jail for four years for stealing money.
</P>
<P>
"If you save a wandering child, you save his family as well,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Though a bachelor, he never feels lonely as he always has
several children at his home.
</P>
<P>
But, Zheng, who earns 300 yuan (about 36 US dollars) a month as
a guard for a company, can hardly make both ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes he has to sell his blood in order to buy foods, coats
for run-away children and even tickets for their journeys home.
</P>
<P>
Zheng also buys newspapers and books for the children, helps
them brush up their lessons and reads newspapers for them at night.
</P>
<P>
The children stay at his home for a few weeks or even longer
before he gets in touch with their parents and sends them back to
home. They run away for different reasons -- some play truant and
others are maltreated in their families.
</P>
<P>
Zheng usually personally sends these children back to their
parents in the neighboring provinces such as Anhui, Henan, Hebei
and Shanxi, even in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
"It is my happiest time when I see these children united with
their families or when I receive letters from them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng hates those making money from children. Once he helped
police officers save 16 kidnaped children from gangsters forcing
them to sell their blood every week.
</P>
<P>
Today, many children cared for by Zheng have grown up and
become college students, soldiers or workers. Yet they have not
forgotten Zheng.
</P>
<P>
Three children from Yantai, a coastal city in Shandong
Province, come to visit Zheng on holidays, bringing him rice wine
and other food.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baofeng, of Shanxi, sent him her picture taken before the
tomb of Lai Ning, a national young hero who was killed in fighting
a forest fire.
</P>
<P>
"I will learn from Lai Ning," she said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Although he is 47, he looks at least ten year older. But he
does not regret what he has done for the children over the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the welfare department will help me set up a home for
orphans and roaming children so that they will no longer wander
about the streets," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Outlines Targets for Copyright Protection This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Copyright
Administration announced here two days ago that it will continue
to be tough on copyright violators this year.
</P>
<P>
Shen Ren'gan, deputy director of the administration, said that
law enforcers will focus on the piracy of laser discs (LDs) and
compact discs (CDs).
</P>
<P>
They will also intensify the fight against copyright
infringement on high-technological products, including computer
software and CD-ROMs, the official added.
</P>
<P>
"No matter the violators are publishing houses or individuals,
if they are identified to have infringed copyrights, they will be
punished seriously according to law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the government's administrative
functions for the protection of copyrights will be strengthened in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In China, government departments play a big role in fighting
against copyright piracy, in addition to courts and public
agencies.
</P>
<P>
More work will be done to improve the copyright contract
registration system, draw up regulations for artistic performance
rights, revise publication remuneration regulations, and improve
the identification system for overseas copyright owners, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The country will also set up a national copyright protection
center, draw up regulations for the management of overseas-related
copyright agencies, and revise its five-year-old Copyright Law, he
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Training courses will be opened nationwide to enable workers
and executives from the industries of computer, film and
recordings to become familiar with copyright issues, according to
Shen.
</P>
<P>
The official added that his administration will expand
exchanges and cooperation with copyright organizations in foreign
countries and in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the Provincial Administration of Commerce

<HEADLINE> Israel Expells Spy to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Official sources have confirmed
that a Palestinian who allegedly spied for Iran was expelled from
Israel to Jordan and would be questioned by Jordanian authorities,
the daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Raja Salem Mohammad, 44, was arrested by Israeli
authorities last November after arriving in Bethlehem from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He was brought to the King Hussein Bridge across the River
Jordan and deported to Jordan, which could not turn him away
because he holds a Jordanian passport, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion was seen as a convenient way for Israel to
dispose of the case after having questioned the man for nearly
three months, it reported.
</P>
<P>
The man reportedly confessed in Israel that he was recruited
by a staff member of the Iranian embassy in Amman more than one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Reports in Israeli press said Mohammad was also asked by his
"handlers" to spy on Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, last November, declared an Iranian diplomat, Saed
Batni, persona non grata and asked him to leave the country after
he was found to have been "inciting" Jordanians to stage attacks
on Israeli visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry, in retaliation, expelled a
Jordanian official who was working at the Kingdom's embassy in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Jordan sought to play down the diplomatic
flare-up over the expulsion of Batni. Jordan sent its first
ambassador to Tehran this month after a hiatus of more than 15
years.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Said to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti is reportedly to form a new government by next Monday,
the English-language daily Jordan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The move is widely described by local press as a major new
effort by King Hussein to enable the new generation of
politicians to take over from old guard.
</P>
<P>
The forward-looking and energetic foreign minister, 46, has
made great achievements on Jordan's foreign front since he
assumed the post in January, 1995.
</P>
<P>
His phenomenal rise in politics has impressed even his own
detractors, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
Some sources were quoted by the daily as saying that the King
accepted Prime Minister Sharif Zeid Ben Shaker's resignation last
Tuesday and asked Kabariti to form a new government at that time.
</P>
<P>
But the official media here did not disclose the resignation
of Sharif Zeid and the appointment of Kabariti, although the fate
of Sharif Zeid's government has been the major topics of the local
press and diplomatic circles in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The letter of appointment of Kabariti as new prime minister is
expected to be announced officially today, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Rumors ran high recently that Sharif Zeid will reshuffle his
government until at least after the end of Ramadan. It is not
immediately known why the King, who the local Arabic media
described as "the first and the last one who makes decision,"
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
The Kingdom usually chooses its prime minister in a so-called
"prime ministers" small circle which has four to five members. The
member of the circle was appointed as prime minister

<HEADLINE> Demirel Cancels Trip to World Economic Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has canceled his plan to attend the meetings of
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, due to the Turkish
government problem.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the press office of the Presidential Palace
said today that Demirel had decided not to participate in the
Davos meetings as Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller
declared Friday to abandon her attempts to form a coalition
government with the Motherland Party (ANAP).
</P>
<P>
Ciller is expected to return the mandate to form the
government (given to her on January 19) to Demirel after holding
consultations with her party's authorized bodies today.
</P>
<P>
Demirel disclosed Friday that he would give the mandate to the
ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz after Ciller, like Welfare Party (RP)
Chairman Necmettin Erbakan, informs him she has failed to
establish a government.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that as the leader of the third biggest party in
parliament, it was now Yilmaz's turn. "This is a nation of laws and
there is no other way," said he, adding that Yilmaz should also try
to form a government, but it was not easy to reach a compromise in
politics.

Ulan Bator, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia and France have
reached an agreement in principle on reopening the French embassy
in Ulan Bator, a Mongolian newspaper Friday quoted diplomatic
sources as saying today.
</P>
<P>
France was among the first western countries to establish
diplomatic relations with Mongolia, with its embassy in Ulan Bator
opened in the 1970's. The Embassy was later closed because of
little bilateral contact and the function was taken over by the
French embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
France's decision to reopen the embassy and establish a
French culture center in Ulan Bator is the result of continuous
development of bilateral relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be formally announced when Mongolian
President Punsalmaagiyu Ochirbat visits France in April.
</P>
<P>
At present, major western countries including the United
States, Britain, Japan and Germany have their diplomatic
representation in the Mongolian capital.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Fire at Nuclear Research Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian nuclear expert today
denied reports by French magazine Le Point that there was a fire
at a nuclear research facility in Isfahan 400 kilometers south of
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Akhbar quoted the Chief of Isfahan's Atomic
Technology Center as saying that there has never been a fire at
the center since 1979.
</P>
<P>
"After the Islamic Revolution of 1979 we have never had any
fire at our center," Mohammad Kazem Rasouli said.
</P>
<P>
Akhbar reported that Tel Aviv Radio, quoting Le Point, had
said last week that the smoke from the fire engulfed Isfahan sky,
leading the authorities to shut down the airport.
</P>
<P>
An informed source in Isfahan told Xinhua that the nuclear
research facility did not have a reactor and was involved in
atomic research in different fields such as agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He added that the airport was shut down for a few days in early
January as the result of the extreme cold that caused a breakdown
in the aviation equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The temperature reached 18 degrees below zero, which led to
the malfunctioning of the aviation equipment at the airport," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the reports that there was a fire at the center,
saying that even if there was a fire it could not affect the
airport because it was outside of the city.
</P>
<P>
"There was no fire to begin with. But even if there was a fire
it could not affect the flights because our airport is outside of
the city," he said.
</P>
<P>
"How could a fire affect the flights at an airport 20 kms away?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected other reports that the airport's closure was
caused by the pollution, saying that pollution never forces
"airport officials anywhere to shut down an airport."
</P>
<P>
"I admit we did have terrible pollution during those
times. Actually the pollution occurred at the same time as the
visitation of the cold front upon Isfahan," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Increase Import of Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to import
at least 88,000 tons of non-fat power milk this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Farmers Bank Research Center, the Thai
government also has approved an import quota of 2,272 tons of raw
milk at a 20 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
The import quota for instant milk is set at 26.16 tons with a
20 percent tariff, while imports exceeding the quota will be
subject to a 91.20 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives also said
that the current demand for raw milk is 800,000 to 1,000,000 tons
a year in Thailand, but it predicted that local raw milk
production will be 700,000 tons per year in the next two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local newspapers said today that prices of dairy
products will rise by 4-11.5 percent in the country beginning
February 5 due to the government's scheme to promote milk drinking
this year.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to Rank Second with 10 Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Host China is aiming to defend
its runner-up at the Third Asian Winter Games slated for February
4-11, by winning at least 10 gold medals, said a top official of
the Chinese delegation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to win more than 10 gold medals to sesure the second
place we got in the last games in 1990 in Sapporo," Zhu Chengyi,
deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, told the press here.
</P>
<P>
"We know it will be very difficult to realize the goal because
of Kazakhstan's participation#," Zhu said. "But we will do our
best."
</P>
<P>
China, which won the runner-up with nine gold medals, second
only to Japan's 18, in the last games, has sent the biggest number
of athletes to compete in all the 43 events of eight sports. The
Chinese competitors have more chances in the short-track
speedskating, speed skating, women's figure skating, women's ice
hockey, biathlon and cross-country skiing, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also said that it would not be surprising if China topped
the gold medal tally, because the situation had been complicated
with Kazakhstan's participation and Japan's second-string line-up
in such sports as speed skating and alpine skiing and
cross-country. "We have one percent chance to win the first
place," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"However," he said,"no matter who gets the top place the
margin will be very narrow -- perhaps between one and two, or two
and three.
</P>
<P>
"And one more gold may be enough to change the rankings
of the first three or four major delegations," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Again Denies Involvement in Bahrain's Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran today once again denied
involvement in Bahrain's unrest by publishing editorials in the
press and official statement by the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Javad Larijani, Vice-Chairman of Foreign Commission of
the Parliament, criticized Bahrain for blaming outside parties to
justify a crackdown on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Manama had asked the third secretary at the Iranian Embassy to
leave Bahrain last week, and Iran gave the second secretary of the
Bahraini Embassy here one week to leave Tehran.
</P>
<P>
English language daily Iran News said in its editorial that
Bahrain's action was quite predictable in light of the fact that
throughout the world, and particularly in the Middle East region,
all the domestic ills are attributed to foreign elements.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times noted in its editorial: "What this means is that
Bahrain holds other countries responsible for its unrest, a ploy
by undemocratic countries in time of serious trouble at home."
</P>
<P>
Larijani urged Bahrain not to ruin its ties with its neighbors
on suspicions and underlined that Tehran can never be implicated
in the unrest among Bahrain's Shiite population.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Egypt and the United States of launching a
"propaganda campaign" against the Islamic Republic, he stressed:
"they want to make our Arab brothers in Bahrain frightened of us
so they could step in, squander Bahrain's money and gain
influence there."
</P>
<P>
Larijani urged the leaders in the Arab Kingdom to use
"political adroitness" to solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Japan Faces More Challengers at Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, Northeast China, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Asian winter sports
powerhouse Japan faces a tough job to retain its number one spot at
the Third Asian Winter Games with a second-string lineup fielded to
the week-long games which opens on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese team is weak on the ice because of the absence of its
best speed skaters who are now competing in Europe for the World Cup
series, but remains strong on the snow where its arch rival is
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Japan, who won 18 gold medals in the last games in 1990 in Sapporo
of Japan, regarded the Harbin games as a preparation for the 1998
Winter Olympics in Nagano and therefore sent a delegation mainly
comprised of young athletes.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, which is to make a debut at the games, aims to walk
away with seven golds with its men's ice hockey team believed a sure
bet for the title.
</P>
<P>
"Most of its players had played for the former Soviet Union's
national division one league and it is a serious contender for the
title," said Chinese ice hockey team manager Hu Chunfang.
</P>
<P>
Asian Games champion China fell to the fifth place at the world
championship Group C last year while the local teams in China have
been cut to four from 14 because of the finacial problem."
</P>
<P>
Hu said that host team would settle for a place after Japan, which
remains at Group B at the world championship and could beat
China with a five goals margin.
</P>
<P>
"We will be satisfied with a bronze medal by beating South
Korea," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh women are also expected to challenge Asian champion
China in the women's ice hockey, the sport to make its first appearance
in the games.
</P>
<P>
"We have never met Kazakhstan, but it's no doubt a very good team
to my knowledge," said Chinese coach Yao Naifeng, who led the Chinese
to finish fourth at the world championship in Sweden last summer.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is also considered a tough rival for China, South Korea
and Japan on the ice.
</P>
<P>
Stekolnikova Elizaveta and Kazarlyga Dmitri, who won the ice
dancing in the Asian championships last year, are expected to win
their specialty events here.
</P>
<P>
Asian pairs champions Khaltourina Marina and Krioukov Andrei are
favored to land a gold but they have to beat the Chinese skaters Shen
Xue and Zhao Hongbo, and Liu Binyang and Sun Bao.
</P>
<P>
In the speed skating rink, Prokacheva Lioumila, women's overall
runner-up of the world championships, and Chakchakbaev Vadim, eighth
place finisher at the world cup men's 500 meters standings this
season, are believed to add golds for Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has fielded its best athletes to the games with gold
hope pinned on the short-track speedskating and speed skating events.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can take seven golds," said South Korean delegation
chief Park Kap-Chul.
</P>
<P>
Women's world record holders Kim Yun-mi (500 meters), Chun
Lee-kyung (1,000 and 3,000) and Kim So-Hee (1,500) top the South
Korean big names list while men's 3,000 meters world record holder and
Olympic gold medalist Chae Ji-Hoon are expected to grab most golds at
stake in the men's short-track speed skating.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yoon-Man is South Korea's hope in the men's speed skating.
</P>
<P>
The world overall champion for the sprint speed skating is expected
to take two or three golds in the games. However, he will face a
strong challenge from his teammates and Chinese Liu Hongbo, who placed
fourth at 500-meter in the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.
</P>
<P>
China will defend its runners-up place this time, aiming for a
collection of at least 10 gold medals from all the 43 events in the
eight sports.
</P>
<P>
China's world figure skating champion Chen Lu is a sure bet for the
title while Wang Chunlu, who won two golds in the world championships
in March last year, and Sun Dan, Yang Yang and her namesake all have a
chance for the medals.
</P>
<P>
Wang Manli and Xue Ruihong, 500 meters fourth finisher at the 1994
Olympics, are predicted to bring one or two golds for China in the
sprint events of the women's speed skating.
</P>
<P>
At the snow competitions to be held in Yabuli, some 200 kilometers
to Harbin, Kazakhstan can take a lion's share of gold medals in the
men's events and might leave some women's medals to Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
"We will try our best to win the events in the biathlon and
freestyle jumping," said Zhu Chengyi, deputy chief of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Japan won 11 golds in the snow events in 1990, with China only two
from the men's biathlon races.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Export Earnings Up In 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's export
earnings rose by 5.5 percent in 1995, but the country's trade
balance continued to register a deficit but lower than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to a Bank of Tanzania (BOT) monthly economic review,
which was issued here on Friday, the country's total export
earnings in 1995 were 548.07 million US dollars compared to 519.36
million US dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The monthly economic report said that non-traditional exports
rose by 20.6 percent offsetting a 2.4 percent decline in
traditional exports from 336.8 million US dollars in 1994 to
328.8 million US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional exports earned 220.1 million US dollars in
1995 compared to 182.5 million US dollars realized during 1994.
The non-traditional exports included petroleum products,
minerals, manufactured and other goods.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decline in traditional exports to a
fall of cotton, tea and sisal prices which fell by 6.6, 27.8 and
13.5 percent respectively. Coffee and tobacco earnings, however,
rose by 5 and 2.6 percent respectively, while cashewnuts prices
rose by 5.9 percent, but their export value declined from 51.2
million US dollars in 1994 to 49.6 million US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It said that the country's imports increased by 1.9 percent to
1,532.9 million US dollars from 1,505 million US dollars in 1994.
While there was sharp increase in intermediate goods from 290.4
million US dollars in 1994 to 585.1 milliion US dollars in 1995,
capital goods imports declined by 16.6 percent. The report also
noted an increase in consumer goods imports from 359.5 million US
dollars in 1994 to 400.4 million US dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Calls for Closer GCC Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah has underscored
the importance of forging closer cooperation among Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states to deter foreign threats against
any of them.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic-language weekly Al-Hawadeth
magazine published Friday, the Crown Prince said "states of the
Council will be able to face any dangers, God willing, if they
press ahead with vigor and sincerity towards the path of
integration."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, in the interview conducted by the magazine's
Editor-in-Chief Melhem Karam, indicated that the GCC states have
been dealing with such dangers as a reality that exists in many
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We see on a wide scale that many regions in the world are not
immune from dangers," Sheikh Saad said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been a member of the six-state GCC which was
founded in 1981 in the shadow of the Iran-Iraq war to take joint
action to beef up security of these countries and seek closer
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Touching on sanctions-hit Iraqi people, Sheikh Saad said that
Kuwait did not cause their hardships. They were a victim of the
Iraqi regime's aggression.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad asserted that lifting the sanctions on Iraq was in
the hands of the international community instead of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"If the regime really wants to end the hardships of its people
it should speedily implement all United Nations resolutions,"
Sheikh Saad said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 2 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The 89th Millrose Games,
an annual indoor sports event was held here Friday with lackluster
performances for virtually all the events.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Bubka of Ukraine, the world pole vault record holder,
snatched the gold by clearing 5.85 meters, far lower than the
6.15-meter world indoor record which he set in his home country in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Jean Galfione of France and Maksim Tarasov of Russia, came as
the second and third, both clearing the 5.80 meters.
</P>
<P>
Other events were dominated by American athletes in the one-day
event, in which Ohio State University clocked three minutes 18.73
seconds to break the American indoor record in the men's 4x400
meter relay.
</P>
<P>
Lance Deal, the American who set the new world indoor weight
throw record of 25.86 meters in Atlanta last March, hurled the
weight to 24.25 meters on Friday to snatch the crown.
</P>
<P>
Gwen Torrence, who also competed for the United States in the
Atlanta event, became the champion of the women's 60 meter dash,
breasting the line in 7.02 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The games' venue, the Madison Square Garden, was packed by some
15,000 enthusiastic spectators, who were somewhat disappointed by
the results despite seeing a number of Olympic gold medalists.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iva Majoli of Croatia shrugged
off her injury to win her final berth by defeating Swiss budding
star Martina Hingis on Saturday in the Pan Pacific Open tennis
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Majoli, 18, who toppled top seed Monica Seles on Friday, was
treated at court side to her left thigh in the second set before
scoring 3-6, 6-3, 6-0 against the 15-year-old Hingis.
</P>
<P>
In the final on Sunday, the eighth-ranked Croatian will vie for
the title against former world number one Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
who defeated 1994 Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez 6-4, 5-7,
6-4 in an all-Spanish affair.
</P>
<P>
Hingis who ranked 17th, reeled off the competitions with five
aces in the first set, broke Majoli in the opening game of the
second set and went ahead 2-1 and 40-love.
</P>
<P>
However, the Croatian who was treated courtside after the
seventh game, rallied back to break the sixth and eighth games to
level the match.
</P>
<P>
In the decider, Hingis, warned for throwing her racket, netted
her backhand to lose the first game, and never recovered again to
unleash her powerful hits.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye said in Dodoma, Central Tanzania, on Friday that
the government would not allow Zanzibar to slide into bloodshed
and violent political hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that Sumaye told the National
Assembly session in Dodoma that the present problems in the isles
would end if the Civic United Front (CUF) accepted the results of
the presidential elections held in Zanzibar on October 22, last
year, in which Salmin Amour won.
</P>
<P>
Winding up the debate on President Benjamin Mkapa's speech
delivered while inaugurating Parliament on November 30, last
year, Sumaye said that everything was under control and warned
that the government would not hesitate to flex its muscle against
any trouble maker.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania must strive to avoid tragic mistakes done by
some countries in Africa, which resulted into bloodbath due to
post-electoral misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Giving examples of Angola and Mozambique, he said, after
chasing away the colonial power, the countries held elections but
those who lost refused to accept the results and opted for armed
violence.
</P>
<P>
He said now that elections were over, CUF and the isles
government should chart out ways of serving Tanzanians. "After
all the next general elections are only four years away - why all
this fuss?" he queried.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister reiterated that the Third Phase
Government was committed to fight corruption, reduce the levels
of poverty and move the nation towards self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the anti-corruption crusade was an uphill
task since the evil practice had take root in the society.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that corruption could significantly be
reduced if everybody joined in the war against the practice.
</P>
<P>
The national Assembly passed a resolution adopting the
President's speech as a guideline in the House and commended
President Mkapa for a good and highly inspiring beginning.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government For Reasonable Solution To Pay Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government spokesman
Amusaa Mwanamwambwa has called for reasonable solution to the pay
dispute between the public service workers and Finance Minister
Ronald Penza.
</P>
<P>
Mwanamwambwa, also Information Minister, said on Friday, "The
government is calling on all concerned to put their cool heads
together to amicably and reasonably arrive at common and correct
interpretation of the salary award."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against being led by hotheads because "the
on-going hardening of attitudes or engagement in polemics over
this matter will not help the nation."
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to all parties concerned to ensure that the
matter was resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka-based public service workers thronged the headquarters
of the Ministry of Finance yesterday demanding dismissal of the
Finance Minister for his refusing to pay them 45 percent pay
increase. They also threatened to paralyze the government
operations if their demand was not met.
</P>
<P>
Penza said on Wednesday that the industrial relations court's
clarification on the 45 percent pay increase to civil servants
was irresponsible and the government had no money to pay them.
</P>
<P>
The court clarified on Monday that its ruling on the 45
percent salary increase to the public service workers last
november was separated from the 30 percent pay increment which
the government had awarded to them early last year.
</P>
<P>
It means that the government has to increase salary of the
public service workers by 75 percent since last January.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior American source

between Syria and Israel, but one which will stand up over time,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The source said that, while Israel and Syria are determined to
continue their negotiations and make progress, they are not in a
hurry.
</P>
<P>

for Israeli journalists in Washington.
</P>

that the negotiations will continue and that there will be at
least one more series of talks in the framework of discussions in

level on the way to moving the process forward," Savir said.

was not reflected in the press and what was reflected was not what

<HEADLINE> Majority of Indians Back Action on Hawala: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Indians (63.4
percent) believe corruption will be the most important issue in
the coming general elections in view of the hawala scandal, a
countrywide survey carried out by the Indian Express has revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey published today, an overwhelming
majority (93.6 percent) support the action taken against the
politicians, though a large number of respondents (67.4 percent)
believe its timing was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried through a questionnaire published in the
Indian Express, was aimed at assessing the readers' response to
the issues that the scandal has thrown up.
</P>
<P>
The survey essentially covered urban and semi-urban areas and
does not reflect the mind of the rural voters. Moreover, it was
undertaken before Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao came under a
cloud.
</P>
<P>
Asked who they thought would benefit the most from the action
taken in the case, 43.1 percent felt it would be the Bharatiya
Janata Party, 29.6 percent indicated the ruling Congress Party and
22.9 percent the National Front. Only four percent felt it would
benefit no one.

Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development indicated that 85
percent of the GCC trade was carried on land.
</P>

The study said GCC countries had witnessed major progress in
the recent past. New seaports and airports have been established,
modern roads constructed and telecommunications upgraded.
</P>
<P>
GCC citizens, of 25 million by the end of 1995, and local firms
in an area of 2.5 million square kilometers own over 100,000
lorries of various types. The six GCC countries have constructed
roads liking them.
</P>

cost less, the study said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysia's crude palm
oil(CPO), tin and rubber markets ended the week mixed with CPO and
tin prices higher and rubber price lower.
</P>
<P>
The crude palm oil physical market closed higher this week
following better export figures for January. However, the market
was lacking directions with price hovering around 1,200 Malaysian
Ringgit (about 480 US dollars) to 1,210 Ringgit (about 484
dollars) per ton because of the news that Indonesia was trying to
export its palm oil.
</P>
<P>
The market was improved by India's purchase of palm oil, and on
Friday the market staged a rebound.
</P>
<P>
The price for February South ended at 1,210 Ringgit (about 484
dollars) per ton on Friday compared with January South at 1,180
Ringgit (about 472 dollars) the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tin price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed one sen
higher to 15.85 Ringgit (about 6.34 dollars) per kg this week.
</P>
<P>
Trading this week was on a mixed note with prices dropping on
Monday and Wednesday but rebounded on Tuesday and Friday. On
Thursday, the market took a break for a public holiday
</P>
<P>
The return of buyers from Europe and the entry of the Japanese
on Friday allowed the market to make its biggest gains of ten sen
for this week.
</P>
<P>
For the week, trade volume decreased to 464 tons from 471 tons
last week and the premium between the KLTM and the London Metal
Exchange (LME) widened to 70 dollars per ton from 35 dollars the
previously Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Malaysian rubber market closed the week lower in
quiet trading, influenced by the weak regional market and lack of
buying interest from consumers.
</P>
<P>
March RSS1 eased 1.5 sen to 384 sen (about 1.536 dollars) per
kg from 385.5 sen (about 1.54 dollars) the previous Friday and SMR
20 was down four sen to 382.5 sen (about 1.53 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said the prices were affected by weak regional
markets and also a relatively small number of inquiries this week.
They said the prices would go up next week because most suppliers
would be closed and rubber tappers would take a break.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange rebounded this week as they shrugged off
Monday's worries about firming interest rates and anticipation of
more monetary measures to be introduced by the state bank.
</P>

The Composite Index closed at its highest level this year,
reaching 1,073.18 points, up 21.78 points from last week. The all

Some dealers here said share prices managed to stage a firmer
tone this week aided by selective buying of bluechips by large
local institutions followed by bargain-hunting for rotational play
of index-linked counters by foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
But the volume transacted was generally lower as most investors
opted to remain sidelined since the overall sentiment remained
discouraging.
</P>
<P>
Total market turnover declined, and the ready turnover on the
main board dropped to 1.021 billion shares valued at 5.418 billion
Malaysian Ringgit (about 2.167 billion US dollars) as against

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Overseas Direct Investments Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's overseas direct
investments last year totaled 4.91 billion U.S. dollars on an
approval basis, up 37.2 percent over the 3.58 billion U.S. dollars
registered in the previous year, according to the Finance and
Economy Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
Although the total investments rose, the number of projects
posted a fall of 19.9 percent from 1,947 cases in 1994 to 1,560
cases in 1995, indicating that individual outbound investments
have become larger, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The average overseas project was valued at 3.1 million U.S.
dollars last year, up 72.2 percent from the 1.8 million U.S. dollars
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's small-and medium-sized enterprises obtained
investment permits worth 1.05 billion U.S. dollars, or 21.4
percent of the total overseas direct investments.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing firms topped the list of overseas direct investments
with the combined investments amounting to 2.93 billion U.S. dollars,
or 59.7 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
By region, Asia was the most favorite investment destination
for South Korean companies. Nearly 79 percent of South Korea's
total overseas investments were made in Asian countries, mainly
in China, followed by North America with 10.3 percent and Europe
with 5.2 percent, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last year, South Korea's cumulative overseas
direct investments amounted to 14 billion U.S. dollars in 6,298
cases in terms of investment permits.

<HEADLINE> No Records Set in Millrose Games in Shot Put, Weight Throw  (Updated with corrected mark of 16.99 meters in 6th para) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The 89th Millrose Games was
held here on Friday with new records set neither in shot put nor
in weight throw.
</P>
<P>
The two events for both the men and women athletes were held in
the Draddy Gymnasium of the Manhattan College. The all-american
entries represented different clubs, companies, universities and
the army.
</P>
<P>
Although achievements were recorded in the games, there were no
record-breakings either in shot put or in weight throw even at the
presence of some traditional record setters.
</P>
<P>
In the men's shot put, C.J. Hunter marked the longest distance
of 20.40 meters, namely 2.26 meters shorter than the world record
set by compatriot Randy Barnes in 1989, while Ramona Pagel pushed
the ball away to 17.77 meters compared with her 1987 American
indoor record of 19.83 meters.
</P>
<P>
America's Lance Deal, both the world indoor and the Millrose
Games records setter, gained the best mark of 24.25 meters in his
fifth throw. Yet, he neither rewrote his 1995 world record of
25.86 meters nor the 1993 Millrose Games record of 24.82 meters.
</P>
<P>
The best mark in the women's weight throw was set by Liz
Legault from Boston with 16.99 meters. Thus, her compatriot Sonja
Fitts kept both her 1992 world record of 19.15 meters and 1995
Millrose Games record of 18.89 meters.
</P>
<P>
There were around 30 events in the indoor games of the day.
The rest of the competitions will be held Friday evening at the
Madison Square Garden in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Develop Former MTA-Controlled Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Provisional Plans for
development of regions formerly controlled by the Mong Tai Army
(MTA) members led by former drug warlord Khun Sa will be made and
efforts are being made to stabilize the social life of those
regions, the official paper "the New Light of Myanmar" today
quoted a Myanmar leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Second Secretary of Myanmar State Law
and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) Lt-General Tin Oo at a
meeting on the development of border areas held here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lt-Gen Tin Oo also said that the returning to the legal fold of
over 10,000 members of MTA under Khun Sa together with large
caches of arms and ammunition is a mile-stone in Myanmar
government's endeavors for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Lt-Gen Tin Oo stressed the need to lay down systematic plans to
look into the requirements of those who had returned to the legal
fold.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has been implementing the policy of
national reconciliation since 1988 and up to now, excluding the
MTA group, 15 armed ethnic groups in border areas have returned to
the legal fold.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop the border areas, the government has spent
a total of 3.35 billion kyats (0.56 billion US dollars) since
1989.

<HEADLINE> Radio Nepal to Sell Air Time to Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's state-run radio will
sell most of the air time of its newly launched FM channel to
local private companies in line with its policy to provide maximum
broadcasting service.
</P>
<P>
According to agreements reached recently between Radio Nepal
and different private companies, air time on the FM channel from

FM channel, which began its regular broadcasting service late last
 year.

<HEADLINE> China Succeeds in Breeding Polar Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Zoo has succeeded
in breeding two polar bears for the first time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
Ten-year old "Yang Yang" gave birth to a female cub, and
20-year old "You Bai", a male cub. Both cubs are living healthily.
</P>
<P>
The polar bear is under the first-class state protection in
China. There are now 20,000-40,000 such bears around the world,
spreading in the Untied States, Canada, Russia and North Europe.
</P>
<P>
There are two pairs of polar bears in the Beijing Zoo, which,
however, have failed to bring up young bears since 1976 owing to
the noisy environment and lack of necessary monitoring facilities.
</P>
<P>
The zoo authorities built quiet "delivery rooms" for the bears
last winter, where remote control monitors were fixed. "Yang Yang"
and "You Bai" smoothly delivered the cubs at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The young bears are expected to be weaned from their mothers at
the age of four months and to meet the public this summer,

<P>
GENEVA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense Secretary
William Perry Friday expressed the hope that Switzerland would
join NATO's partnership for peace program, according to local
press reports.
</P>
<P>
Perry made the statement in Bern at a meeting with Adolf Ogi,
chief of the Federal Military Department of Switzerland. Perry is
on his way to Munich, Germany, where a forum on the security in
Europe is to be held this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Perry hoped that Switzerland would consider taking part in the
NATO program, and stressed that the country's neutral status forms
no barrier as the program is devised for the stability in Europe
and not directed specifically against any country.
</P>
<P>
Ogi said the issue will also depend on the bilateral talks with
the European Union and that his government still wants to have a
more precise idea about the program.

GENEVA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- UEFA, the soccer's European
governing body, confirmed on Friday that it will not allow
over-age stars to play in the Atlanta Olympics this summer.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Roberto Baggio, Juergen Klinsmann and other big names in
Europe are surely to miss the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both the International Olympic Committee and FIFA
decided to make the changes for the Atlanta Olympics, allowing
teams to field in three big-name players over the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
At previous Olympics, only players aged 23 and under were
eligible.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA opted to stick to its rule that only the players age
21 and under can take part in the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Urges Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to Work Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin urged the
supply and marketing cooperatives across the country to work
better as a guide for Chinese farmers to enter the market and
as a link between the farmers and the fast-changing market.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, made these remarks in a
letter addressed to a national conference of the cooperatives
which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The president described the tasks of the cooperatives, which
are incorporated on the basis of shares invested by farmers, as
"of historical significance".
</P>
<P>
Chen Junsheng, a State councillor and Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing
Cooperatives, asked the cooperatives at all levels to run as a
"real organization of the farmers" in his work report delivered to
the conference.
</P>
<P>
"To attain this goal, the cooperatives should update the
concept, deepen the reforms, improve the service and efficiency,
and enhance strength", Chen said.
</P>
<P>
On concrete measures, Chen asked the cooperatives to draw more
farmers to buy shares and to improve the standardization of the
management of the equities.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the cooperatives, which have become a major
source for commodity distribution, to expand the development of
specialized cooperatives and other economic organizations, and
introduce new forms of operations such as chain stores and agent
system.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, commodity purchase of the
cooperatives, which have some 160 million rural households as
share-holders and total payroll of 5.8 million, reached 598.6
billion yuan (72.12 billion US dollars) and the sales amounted to
632.7 billion yuan in 1995, a 35.1 percent and 27 percent rise
respectively over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Apart from playing a leading role in meeting the demand and in
curbing inflation, the cooperatives also made new headways in
market building, running of industries and joint ventures,
agricultural and poverty-relief programs, cooperation and trade
with overseas partners, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Snowfall Won't Hurt Asian Winter Games: Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, Northeast China, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Two months of
futile waiting for a heavy snowfall pushed the Asian Winter Games
organizers to their last resort -- carrying the snow uphill.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have paid 200,000 Chinese Yuan (25,000 U.S. dollars)
to the local farmers who have been carrying bags of snow to cover the
alpine skiing and cross-country skiing courses in Yabuli, a skiing
resort some 200 kilometers north to Harbin where the Third Winter
Asian Games will kick off on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken some emergency measures to deal with the lack of
snow," Liu Haiyun, general secretary of the organizing committee, told
a press conference on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This problem will be solved soon and it won't hurt the games,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no snowfall for two months in Harbin, Heilongjiang's
provincial capital where all the ice sports competitions will be held.
In Yabuli which hosts all snow events, the organizers have been
anxiously waiting for more snow but only to see several slight
snowfalls just enough to cover the dust on the months or years old
snow.
</P>
<P>
The organizers had to use artificial snow on the freestyle skiing
and ski jumping grounds and they have hired hundreds of local farmers
to carry the snow uphill to the alpine skiing and cross-country skiing
courses.
</P>
<P>
Dong Linmo, deputy director of the Yabuli skiing resort, said on
Friday that they had only one kilometer long stretch of the cross
country course uncovered and it would be ready late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the games' top press official Sun Qingchao said in the
conference that Helongjiang would not bid for the Winter Olympic Games
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Speculations abound that China will likely bid for the 2006 Winter
Olympics after Beijing lost to Sydney in the two-way race for the 2000
Summer Olympics in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had enough facilities for an Olympics," he said. "If
time is mature, we will submit our bid."

<HEADLINE> Christopher Urges Croatia to Stick to Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher on Friday urged Croatia to stay on "the path of peace"
and faithfully carry out the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing following his talks with Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman Friday night, Christopher said that the Dayton
agreement, reached in November of 1995, inaugurated a
"partnership" between Croatia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The foundation of the new relationship is commitment to peace,
Christopher said, adding that "Croatia must do its part by staying
on the path of peace and faithfully implementing the provisions of
the agreements".
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that the United States would continue to
support the peaceful return of eastern Slavonia to Croatia. He
also stressed the necessity of carrying out the negotiated
solution to the problem with respects for the rights of all people
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs still control eastern Slavonia, the scene of some
of the most bloody fightings since the breakup of
Yugoslavia. Although an agreement on the integration of the area
into Croatia was reached between warring sides, there are concerns
that the agreement might not be truly carried out.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman said at the same briefing that Croatia will do
everything on its part to settle the issue peacefully, provided
that Serbs also comply with the provisions of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
During their one-hour talks, Tudjman and Christopher also
discussed how to strengthen the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia
and Croatian cooperation with the international tribunal on the
war crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman said that his government is preparing the legislation
which would allow the extradition of war crime suspects to the
Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who arrived here this afternoon, will also visit
Sarajevo and Belgrade before going to the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Germany Foresees Slow Growth in Energy Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany will spend only 1 percent
more energy in the year 2010 than in 1995 to power an economy 50
percent larger than it was last year.
</P>
<P>
A German oil company estimates that energy consumption in the
country in 2010 will be equivalent to 489 million tons of
anthracite, which is 1 percent more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
This is because energy consumption will be 33 percent more
efficient by then, said the company in a report.
</P>
<P>
However, while energy consumption will decline in the western

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tourism Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's tourism business has
become the pillar of its service industry after a rapid growth in
the past five years, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the city's overseas tourism revenue climbed to more
than two billion US dollars, keeping abreast of its foreign trade
income. Total tourism income reached 53.8 billion yuan (6.48
billion US dollars) and accounted for more than 40 percent of
total revenue of Beijing's tertiary service industry.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-95 period, the total number of overseas tourists
amounted to 9.195 million, a rise of 87.1 percent over the 1986-90
period, the "China Daily" quoted Wen Ziji, vice-director of the
Beijing Tourism Administration, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the total number of domestic tourists rose from 1994's
67.1 million to 73.2 million, which made the city's domestic
tourism income exceed overseas tourism in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
So far, Beijing has 247 hotels fro overseas tourists, a rise of
34 percent over the 184 in 1990. As the largest tourism city in
China, there are 15 five-star, 24 four-star and 37 three-star
hotels in the city.
</P>
<P>
Almost 400,000 Beijingers were employed in the industry, making
up 8.3 percent of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, Beijing will continue to maintain the
leading role of tourism industry in China and is expected to be a
tourism center of the Asian and Pacific region by the year 2010,
Wen said.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Delta to Pipe in Liquid Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China will use liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) from the Gulf to fuel the booming economy in
the Yangtze River Delta, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As the core of the project, a 30-million-US dollar LPG storage
facility will be built in Taicang, east China's Jiangsu Province,
which will distribute 500,000 tons of LPG a year in the region,
through pipelines and by ship.
</P>
<P>
Jointly funded by the Huaneng Comprehensive Utilization
Development Corp, a subsidiary of the China Huaneng Group, Amoco
Oil Holding Corp of the United States and the Jiangsu Yangtze
Petrochemical Co Ltd, the project's first phase includes two
31,000-cubic-meter tanks to store frozen LPG.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project started on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Huaneng holds 51 percent of the stake, Amoco 45 percent and
Jiangsu Yangtze four percent. It will be operational by April,
1997, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Huaneng officials as saying that LPG will be supplied
for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes in Shanghai and
Jiangsu where energy is in severely short supply because of the
fast-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Burning LPG will also reduce pollution, they said.
</P>
<P>
The project was designed by the Fluor Daniel of the United
States and the China Offshore Oil Development &AMP; Engineering
Corporation, and is being built by the Nippon Steel Corporation of
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Former Albanian President Alia Re-arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Albanian President Ramiz
Alia was re-arrested here today on charges of murder and massive
deportation of Albanians when he was in power.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was made under a law on "genocide crimes" that was
approved last September by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Albanian prosecutors' office said in a
statement that Alia should be held responsible for the massive
deportation of Albanians, the shooting deaths of Albanians who
tried to cross the border illegally and some other bloodsheds
occurred in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Under the new penal code, those convicted of genocide and
"communist crimes" will face at least 15 years in prison or death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Alia, 70, was arrested in September 1992 and sentenced in July
1994 to nine years in jail for abuse of power and human rights
violations. He was released in July 1995 after the sentence was
later shortened in accordance with an amnesty law passed by
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Alia, head of the former People's Assembly, succeeded Enver
Hoxha as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor
Party of Albania in 1985. He became the country's first elected
president in April 1991 and remained in office until he was forced
to resign and put under house arrest in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Some other former leaders who worked with Alia also have been
arrested recently under the same law.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Improving People's Political Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China has made great progress
in improving people's political rights, an article carried in
today's "China Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of political rights enjoyed by the Chinese
people, Chen Zhishang, a professor of law at Beijing University,
stressed that two facts merit special attention. The first is that
93.58 percent of the country's population can take part in
political elections. The people exercise their rights via the
people's congresses at all levels.
</P>
<P>
There are now 3.65 million deputies to people's congresses. All
of them are democratically elected. Deputies fo the county- and
township-level people's congresses are elected directly by the
voters. Deputies to the provincial and national people's
congresses are elected by their counterparts at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
"In China, candidates do not have to collect large sums of
money for their campaigns," he said. "In some Western countries,
however, only those who are millionaires or their representatives
can be involved in electoral politics, because ordinary people
cannot afford the expense of a campaign."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the right to vote, Chinese citizens also have
the right to supervise and dismiss unqualified deputies to
people's congress. "This guarantees that elected officials truly
represent the 1.2 billion Chinese people, not just those of a
special class," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 and 1994, two laws on administrative proceeding and
State restitution, went into effect. They have been hailed as
"laws through which civilians can sue officials."
</P>
<P>
"Differences between countries' human rights situations often
reflect differences in systems of values," he said, adding that a
comprehensive check of a country's human rights includes the
following factors:
</P>
<P>
-- Whether the rights of the State belong to its people, and
whether the government is shaped through democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
-- Whether the government's foreign and domestic policies are
made on behalf of all the people or just for those with special
status.
</P>
<P>
-- Whether the people and their representatives can effectively
supervise the government and whether they can dismiss unqualified
officials.
</P>
<P>
-- Whether all ethnic groups are equal and racial
discrimination is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
-- Whether the government guarantees citizens' freedom of
religious beliefs, speech, publication, assembly and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
-- Whether the government can safeguard the country's
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and can
maintain the stability of the social order.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's human rights record has been good when
measured by these standards. He pointed out that during the
"Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), democracy was oppressed and
citizens' human rights were infringed upon, a situation that has
since been corrected.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that the Chinese people's political rights are
more clearly delineated and enforceable now than at any previous
time in the country's several thousand years' history, and are in
line with internationally respected principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some Western governments, especially that of the United
States, have continuously attacked China's human rights record,"
he said. "They have disseminated lies to the effect that the
Chinese government oppresses human rights and that the Chinese
people have no political rights."
</P>
<P>
"These lies are based on their intention to isolate China in
the international community and to hamper China's development. It
is a typical example of hegemonic manipulation." he
concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand remains the world
leader in black tiger shrimp farming despite encountering problems
with the yellowhead and whitespot diseases, according to the
Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Exports remain at 50-60 billion baht (2-2.4 billion US dollars)
per year.
</P>
<P>
Plodprasop Suraswadi, director-general of the Fisheries
Department said prospects for the industry remain good due to
Thailand's advanced farming technologies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has also taken steps to solve the
environmental problems caused by shrimp farming, while spending
more money on marine irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
Encroachment on mangrove forest areas has lessened because the
newer technology allows farmers to locate shrimp farms in inner
land areas.
</P>
<P>
Tiger shrimp prices increased this year due to low supplies
because of disease at Thai and Indonesian farms.

<HEADLINE> Colonial Era Streets Unearthed in Panama City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of archeologists
have discovered old cobbled streets of the colonial era in Panama
City.
</P>
<P>
Archeologist Beatriz Rovira said today that the diggings show
the original layout of the streets and avenues in the old city,
built by the Spaniards in 1519 but destroyed during an invasion
led by English pirate Henry Morgan in 1671.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the streets and houses are covered with more
than a foot deep earth and dirt.
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the cobbled streets will be done through an
archeological project being carried out by the Old Panama Patrons,
said Rovira.
</P>
<P>
The long-term project aims at giving Panamanians and foreign
tourists a true panoramic view of Panama City before its
destruction by pirates.
</P>
<P>
The archeologist said that fragments of ceramic pieces dating
from 1500 to 1600 were discovered during the diggings.
</P>
<P>
The Panama City was founded in 1519 and had an urban layout
following the Roman tradition.
</P>
<P>
It was destroyed by a fire during the invasion of pirate
Morgan in 1671 and rebuilt in 1673 over the old site.
</P>
<P>
Old Panama is one of the most important historical sites in
America because of its early foundation.

<P>
LIMA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Peru's mining production is
expected to increase by 7 to 8 percent in 1996 if international
metal prices are stable, Peruvian mining industry sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Peru's copper output in 1995 was 480,000 tons and its copper
export earned 800 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold production in 1995 stood at between 53 and 55 tons, and
gold export amounted to 600 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The sources forecast that gold output in Peru, which is rich in
mineral resources, will be more than 65 tons in 1996 due to an
investment of 26 million dollars in gold projects in the San Jose
de Yanacocha and Retamas zones.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Charge Former Defense Minister With Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution is
to sue former Defense Minister Chung Ho-yong, one of Chun
Doo-hwan's henchmen, for bribery and rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul District Prosecutor's Office said on Friday that
Chung received 17 billion won (21.7 million U.S. dollars) in
bribes from defense-related businesses while in office between
July 1987 and February 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of taking money from arms producers and dealers
in return for fixing contracts.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution plans to add bribery to Chung's indictment when
he is brought to the Seoul District Court for rebellion charges
next week.
</P>
<P>
The former defense minister was arrested on Wednesday for
participating in the December 12, 1979 military coup which brought
Chun to power and in the May 18, 1980 Kwangju military crackdown.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to investigate the bribery charges and have
already confirmed a considerable portion of the alleged bribery by
investigating Chung's bank accounts and those of his relatives," a
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, both former presidents of the
country, were arrested on November 16 and December 3 respectively
last year and have been indicted for graft, insurrection and
treason charges.

<HEADLINE> Commission Investigating President Gets Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of an
accusation commission of Colombia's House of Representatives have
received threats to lives as the commission prepares to reopen
investigation into alleged links of drug money with electoral
campaign of President Ernesto Samper, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said a sect of the opposition Conservative Party
headed by Sen. Jaime Arias were seeking to substitute all the
members of the commission with representatives of all political
tendencies in the Congress instead of only liberals and
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
At the same time two members of the congress, Ingrid Betancur
and Guillermo Martinez-Guerra, are on a hunger strike to press
their demand for regrouping the accusation commission.
</P>
<P>
The two congressmen and Sen. Arias insist that the present
members of the commission are morally unable to try President
Samper, since they already gave a verdict on the same charges made
against the president in December last year, and acquitted him.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, said the politicians, they could do the same thing
with the new evidence being presented.
</P>
<P>
These reasonings were rejected by Rodrigo Rivera, president of
the House of Representatives, and the commission's President Heyne
Mogollon.
</P>
<P>
Mogollon said he and his colleagues were appointed for a
four-year period which has not run out yet.
</P>
<P>
Ruling party Liberal Party Representative Martha Catalina
Daniela, a member of the commission, said today her life had been
threatened and that the same risk is run by her colleagues,
according to a Radio Caracol network report.

<HEADLINE> EU Sees Reduced Trade Surplus with Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU)
trade surplus with Canada fell by more than a half to 300 million
ECUs (390 million U.S. dollars) in 1994 from 700 million ECUs (910
million dollars) in 1993, the EUROSTAT said today.
</P>
<P>
The EUROSTAT, the EU's statistical office based in Luxembourg,
said the cut in surplus was due to increased import from Canada,
which jumped 16.5 percent to 9.2 billion ECUs (11.96 billion
dollars) in 1994 from 7.9 billion ECUs (10.27 billion dollars) in
1993.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the EU's export to Canada climbed 10.2
percent to 9.5 billion ECUs (12.35 billion dollars) from 8.6
billion ECUs (11.18 billion dollars) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the EU's import of manufactured goods from
Canada rose by 11.3 percent to 4.8 billion ECUs (6.24 billion
dollars) in 1994, accounting for more than 52 percent of the total
import.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the EU's export of manufactured goods to the
North American country increased 14.8 percent over 1993 to 7.8
billion ECUs (10.14 billion dollars), accounting for more than 82
percent of the total export.
</P>
<P>
During the period from 1990 to 1994, the EU's imports from
Canada shrank 2.1 percent while its export to that country
swelled by 2.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Outstanding in Patent Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 23,477 applications
for patent rights have been filed in east China's Zhejiang
Province, and 12,540 of them have been granted, of which 35
percent have been put into practical use.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that these patents include inventions, new
types of products and articles with new exterior designs. Among
them, new types of articles account for 60 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
China's Patent Law, adopted at the closing session of the
Fourth Session of the Sixth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, became effective on April 1, 1985.
</P>
<P>
Since then, great progress has been achieved in the
province. Statistics show that Zhejiang witnessed an additional
6.5 billion yuan (about 800 million US dollars)-worth of output
value in 1995 thanks to its patented products, with increased
taxes and profits amounting to 1.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has spared no efforts to turn patents into profits. At
a national patent fair in 1994 the province displayed some 100
patented items, more than 30 of which were sold, involving over
100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's efforts in patent work have played a positive role
in bringing forth new products and strengthening the competitive
edge of its products.
</P>
<P>
One electrical machinery plant in the province has applied for
15 patents over the past couple of years, ten of which have been
put into use, increasing its output value by ten million yuan.
</P>
<P>
More and more enterprises are attaching importance to the use
of new products and new inventions. Moreover, they have begun to
safeguard their own interests in commercial competition and
overseas transactions by utilizing the legal means of patent.

SAN JOSE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will likely take
its dispute with the United States over textile trade to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) for arbitration, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
This stand was expressed by sources from the Ministry of
Foreign Trade in a press communique published after a new round of
negotiations with U.S. government representatives in San Jose
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica will wait until February 20, the deadline for
bilateral conversations, to request the formation of a panel of
WTO experts, the top world authority for the solution of commerce
conflicts, Francisco Chacon, deputy minister of foreign trade,
said at the end of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The United States complains that Costa Rican textile exports
have already caused serious damage to U.S. textile industry and
thus it wants to impose a quota on underwear exports from the
central American country. But Costa Rica says it "cannot accept
any export quota."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two countries have held two rounds of
negotiations in the past two months but failed to find a
solution.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Overseas Workers' Remittances up, Deployment Down  (by Ding Zhaolin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exchange remittances
of Filipino overseas contract workers (OCW) soared by 56 percent
to a record 4.7 billion US dollars in 1995 while the deployment
of workers abroad went down.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration
(POEA), the year-on-year surge in the OCWs foreign exchange
remittances reached 1.7 billion US dollars while the deployment of
workers abroad dropped 9.1 percent compared with the figures of
1994.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine National Economic Development Authority has
announced that the country's 5.7 percent growth last year in gross
national product was largely due to the OCWs' remittances.
</P>
<P>
Susan Cabrero of the POEA's marketing division said remittances
rose because the current crop of OCWs had higher skills and
consequently earned more.
</P>
<P>
The statistics of the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration show that a total of 654,022 workers were deployed
overseas last year compared to 719,062 workers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ernesto Herrera, in a statement issued yesterday,
attributed the decline in taking up overseas employment on
increased public awareness of the frequent worker abuse and on
increasing competition from labor-exporting countries such as
Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"This drop in deployment is most welcome and should augur well
for the government's move to gradually phase out the export of
labor, especially the unskilled ones who are more vulnerable to
abuse," said Herrera, who is also an official of a major labor
federation.
</P>
<P>
Overseas workers became a major issue in the Philippines last
year due to the hanging of Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion for
murder in Singapore in March.
</P>
<P>
Many Filipinos insisted that she was innocent and criticized
the government for not doing enough to save her. The issue soured
the diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has since said the government will work
to phase-out deployment of unskilled workers and will try to
provide alternative jobs at home.
</P>
<P>
The remittances of overseas workers have long been one of the
Philippines' top five sources of foreign exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 2 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Both world champion
Xie Jun of China and challenger Zsuzsa Polgar of Hungary were
fined 25,000 U.S. dollars each for their quick draws at the world
chess championship here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Luis Reutero Suarez, chief of the
championship's technical committee after Xie drew anew with Polgar
in the third game after 19 moves.
</P>
<P>
The two drew the second game after 17 moves with Xie winning
the opener in 60 moves.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to both players, Suarez said his committee was
"disappointed " with the latest two games and warned that they
would be fined further unless they unleash fierce attacks for
prolonged marathon games in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Suarez also issued an ultimatum to both Xie and Polgar to
either play the games or back to their own countries, complaining
that both players seemed as if they had the holiday in Jaen.
</P>
<P>
Depicted it as "ridiculous", Polgar said the decision was an
unprecedented "scandal" that she had never heard in the chess
circle.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides were ready to play their fourth game on
Saturday despite the shocking decision.
</P>
<P>
To sponsor the championship, the municipal authorities of Jaen
has a budget of 40 million pesetas (some 300,000 U.S. dollars),
with two thirds as bonus for the players.

SOFIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria decided today not to

disagreement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Georgi Pirinski said after a special cabinet
meeting that though Bulgaria agreed to contribute a battalion of
engineers and nonmilitary personnel to the NATO-led multinational
peace implementation force (IFOR) in Bosnia, the country cannot
afford an extra expenditure of as much as millions of U.S. dollars
to bankroll their operations.
</P>
<P>
Pirinski said that Bulgaria can only provide the IFOR with a
Bulgarian-staffed 50-bed field hospital and necessary medicines.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added that in the coming weeks Bulgaria
will continue to negotiate with the IFOR for the material supplies
as well as technical and logistic guarantees for the country's
peace mission in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> SADC Annual Consultative Conference Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) ended its 1996 annual Consultative
Conference on Trade and Investment here today, with a focal point
on economic integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, SADC
Secretary-General Kaire Mbuende said Southern Africa, being a
region of immense opportunities for trade and investment, was
well on its way to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
"There is an unquestioning political commitment to
integration," said Mbuende, adding a SADC trade protocol with
guidelines for free trade among the 12-member states would be
completed by August this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony, SADC conference chairman and
Botswanan Vice-President Festus Mogae said the conference had
achieved its primary objective of facilitating dialogue,
promoting goodwill and understanding among the SADC governments,
the regional business sector, foreign investors and international
cooperating partners.
</P>
<P>
"We have laid down firm foundations for ensuring our collective
survival and self-reliance through a regional development community,"
said Mogae.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, under the theme of "towards enhanced
trade and investment in the SADC", provided a forum for frank
exchange of views, experiences and lessons between SADC and the
regional and international enterprises, said a communique
released after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the conference marked the
beginning of a process of partnership between SADC and the
private sector, well into the future.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and officials from the SADC's 12-member states,
representatives from the international cooperating partners and
the regional and international business community attended the
conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the host South Africa had been accused of ignoring
its partners in the SADC and of denying them adequate contact
with President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who opened the conference yesterday, was whisked away by
his security aids before he could be thanked for his speech, said
Mogae.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said not one South African cabinet minister had bothered to
attend the final session of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism of South Africa, its membership of SADC
since August 1994 had revitalised the organisation and made possible
a joint electricity pool in Southern Africa, said Mogae.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things have happened through the membership of South
Africa," he added.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

1995, who gave up it under the Bosnia peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The takeover was accomplished without incident in the presence
of the NATO-led international peace implementation force (IFOR)
before the deadline of D plus 45 which expires on Saturday.

Bocac is one of the three hydroelectric power plants on the
Vrbas -- the other two are Jajce I and II -- and has a rated
capacity of 110 mw, though it operates mostly at between 25 and 70
mw, depending on the water level.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the bridge on the Una river, the only
link between Republika Srpska and Croatia, was inaugurated on
Friday. The bridge will initially be used by IFOR and humanitarian
organizations, and civilian traffic will be restored later.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was damaged when Krajina Serb refugees, fleeing
across it to neighboring Republika Srpska following Croatia's
attack on the Republic of Serb Krajina in August of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Serb Krajina was set up by local Serbs in
Croatia in 1991, in response to Croatia's secession from former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Krajina Serbs were displaced during and in the
aftermath of Croatia's August offensive against the Serb-held area
in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
British IFOR engineers rebuilt the bridge, which links Novi
Grad in the Republika Srpska and Dvor in Croatia, in just about 40
hours. Its piers are intact.

<HEADLINE> Serb Police to Remain in Sarajevo until March 19 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb police will
remain in four Serb-populated Sarajevo suburbs until March 19
instead of February 3, as originally envisaged under the Bosnia
peace accord, an official of the international community in Bosnia
said today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Steiner, deputy international civilian chief in Bosnia,
said that Serb police would stay on in Grbavica, Ilidza, Ilijas
and Vogosca suburbs until March 19, when these districts should be
placed under the authority of the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said in Sarajevo that this was necessary in order to
pave the way for the next stage in the implementation of the
Bosnian peace accord signed in Paris in December of 1995,
according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord envisages for placing the entire Sarajevo
under the administration of the Muslim-Croat federation, which the
Serbs oppose, fearing possible retaliation.
</P>
<P>
According to Serb figures, there are 120,000 Serbs in these
affected suburbs, but international Red Cross estimate the
population stands at 70,000.
</P>
<P>
Latest U.N. reports indicate that between 10,000 and 12,000
serbs have already left and some more are ready to go before March
19 comes.

<HEADLINE> US Contributes 2 Million Dollars to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
here today that it has decided to contribute 2 million dollars to
help alleviate famine in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The contribution would be in the form of a grant from the U.S.
Agency for International Development to the United Nations World
Food Program to buy food for the DPRK, State Department
spokesman Glen Davies said.
</P>
<P>
Davies told reporters there is no question that there has been
flooding in the DPRK which has led to food shortages.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came hours after U.S. National Security
Adviser Anthony Lake left here for South Korea and Japan to
continue discussions on whether food aid should be dispatched to
the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials held a trilateral
meeting in Honolulu on January 24 to coordinate policies toward
the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
But the two-day meeting ended without any agreement on whether
food aid should be sent to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Davies admitted there had been "different perspectives" at the
Honolulu meeting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said South Korea and Japan had been informed of
the U.S. decision which was a "unilateral action" that did not
depend on approval by other countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Campaigns in New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday started his opponent-free primary campaign in New
Hampshire, the first state to hold primary.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will spend two days in New Hampshire, with events
scheduled in Concord, Nashua, Salem, Manchester and Merrimack,
according to wire services.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned to discuss education, his school-to-work job
training initiatives, community policing and small business
investment before returning home late Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At his first stop, Clinton visited the Walker Elementary School
in Concord, where fifth and sixth graders are exposed to both
traditional news writing and the use of the computer.
</P>
<P>
Later, Clinton shook hands about a block away from the school
in what was his first opportunity of the campaign season to press
flesh and even hold a baby in his arms.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met a crowd of several hundred at a rally at the
Capital Center for the Arts in Concord.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated most of the key elements of his
January 23 State of the Union address during his first political
speech in a state where his Republican rivals, vying for their
party nomination, have been campaigning for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton began his campaigning in good financial shape.
</P>
<P>
The latest fund-raising reports indicated Clinton raised more
than 40 million dollars last year, including federal matching
money. Clinton can spend up to 36 million dollars during the
primary season, but, because he is unopposed, may not have to
empty his campaign chest.
</P>
<P>
Next weekend, Clinton is expected to head for Iowa to touch
base with his supporters.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Police Put List of Possible Victims of OST </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Swiss police provided France
last month with a list of people who they fear might join the next
mass suicide of the Order of Solar Temple (OST), if there would be
one, local press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Swiss police chief Urs Rechsteiner, at an annual press
conference, which was held Thursday, confirmed in effect the
submission to French police of such a list, by saying that they
did this by request.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Swiss police simply provided the French
police a list of people close to the religious sect, which is
active in Switzerland, and held responsible for 69 deaths so far.
</P>
<P>
The religious sect has led to two incidences of mass suicide,
the first occurring in October, 1994, involving 48 deaths in
Switzerland and five deaths in Canada; the second in last
December, in which 16 people, eight Swiss and eight Frenchmen,
were found dead in a French town near Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss police chief told the press conference that there are
not yet signs showing if there would be the third case and when it
would come. he said that the police had asked the people who they
thought might know something about the OTS activities, but they
said they don't know if it is being prepared or not.
</P>
<P>
These people used to attend the seances held at a clinic run by
a female psychiatrist in Geneva, who was among the dead in last
December.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that Swiss investigation into the 1994 mass
suicide is still continuing and the report can be released in the
end of February or in March.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Peace Process Unclear Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from
Northern Ireland and the British government, though eager to remove
barriers to an agreement in the peace process, continued their
differences on how to reach it.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering Friday here during the 1996 meeting of the World
Economic Forum (WEF), Irish political leaders and the British
government representatives all expressed their confidence of reaching
an agreement, but remained divided on the holding of an elections as a
step toward peace.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland MP John Hume said he has "very strong
reservations" about holding an election, adding that elections have
led to two disasters in the past. Instead, he supports party talks.
</P>
<P>
British Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew stressed that talks
could only take place on a democratic level which enabled an
"electoral test'.
</P>
<P>
That, he added, was not possible when arms were still being held
illegally. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has said it is unrealistic to
expect the IRA to hand in their huge caches of weapons before peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein National Chairperson Mitchel Mclaughlin also spoke at the
session."We are here with a common purpose", he said and cited their
collective responsibility to create a stable future for Northern
Ireland through encouraging economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said before the opening of the session today that his party is
not opposed to an "interim, transitional government arrangement" as
had happened earlier in South Africa, among other possibilities but
stressed that the structural arrangements would be the outcome of
negotiations and could not be decided in advance.
</P>
<P>
Mclaughlin said in a distributed statement that British Prime
Minister John Major's proposals for elections "would be viewed by many
as yet another precondition to dialogue. It is clear that Ian
Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party would run in such an election
seeking a mandate not engage in all-party talks."
</P>
<P>
He suggested Major call a general election to renew all mandates or
withdraw the Northern Ireland election proposal.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and British
MP, said at the session that the movement to peace should involve
the "leaving behind of guns". If that doesn't occur, he said there
would be little ground for confidence.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 meeting of the WEF opened here Thursday and is attended by
some 1,000 people including leaders from business government and
academia. It is held annually and was recently awarded a
non-governmental organization (NGO) status.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A chartered bus carrying
college students to a ski resort flipped over an embankment on a
mountain road in West Virginia today, injuring at least 44 people
on board.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Hillsboro, West Virginia, said most of the injured
students had facial cuts, bruises and broken bones. One of the
three students who were trapped under the wreckage had two broken
legs.
</P>
<P>
The bus, taking 47 students from University of Florida in
Florida to Snowshoe Mountain Resort in West Virginia, was making a
blind turn on the winding mountain road when it crashed into a
ditch and came to rest against four small trees over a steep
embarkment.
</P>
<P>
Students on the bus and a motorist in a car behind the bus said
the bus driver was taking turns too fast for road conditions.
</P>
<P>
A student told rescue crews that he had asked the driver to
slow down because "we'd rather be late and get there safe than not
get there at all." But the driver apparently did not heed his
advice.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous area just had two inches of fresh snow Thursday
night.

WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said today that the U.S.-led NATO peace
implementation force (IFOR) in Bosnia might be reorganized by
April in accordance with the progress of the implementation of the
Bosnian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Perry told CNN in an interview enroute to Switzerland that by
April the task of ensuring the realignment of internal boundary
lines between the Bosnian Muslim-Croatia federation and Serb
republic should be completed.
</P>
<P>
"We will need at that time also to look, reassess the size of
the force we put in there," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
As of today about 14,500 of the planned 20,000-strong American
IFOR have been deployed in the former Yugoslav republic as part of
the multinational 60,000 NATO peace implementation force.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy Adm. Leighton Smith, commander of the NATO force in
Bosnia, today told reporters here that NATO might begin withdraw
troops from Bosnia as soon as late summer if the peace mission
stays on track.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that some Navy and Air force forces in the region
already are being relieved because they are unneeded.

<HEADLINE> Peres: To Convert Mideast Talks to Include Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Mideast Arab
countries have agreed that the current talks between Israel, Syria
and Lebanon will include other states in the region with a view to
reach a comprehensive agreement for peace and development, Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators had already agreed on one question -- "the most
important", said Peres, "and that is to convert the negotiations
with Syria and Lebanon into a negotiation with the rest of the
Arab countries, to make it comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
The prime Minister made the statement at the 1996 meeting of
the World Economic Forum (WEF) which opened here Thursday and was
attended by some 1,000 people including leaders from business,
governments and academia.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he could not predict when the negotiations
would be completed but he believed they will end positively and
"before too long we shall reach agreement."
</P>
<P>
"If we can conclude our negotiations with the Syrians and the
Lebanese, it will be the end of war in the Middle East", he added.
</P>
<P>
Peres highlighted water and education issues as major social
problems to settle as the region seeks ways to develop. In the two
aspects, Israel is leading among countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also noted that several steps to improve the
economic situation in the Middle East has already been taken,
particularly a Middle East economic conference arranged with the
WEF in Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Peres said, "I am very pleased that in three
short years we were able to revolutionize an impossible situation
and to introduce a spirit that will enable hundreds of millions of
people...to enter the 21st century as a young enterprise where
children will wake up in the morning and will not worry about
(whether they face) peace or war."

<HEADLINE> US Removes DPRK From List of "Pariah States" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
quietly dropped the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
from the list of countries it calls "pariah states" in an effort
to ease relations with it, a U.S. newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials confirmed this week that a speech recently
delivered by Secretary of State Warren Christopher contained a
change in U.S. rhetoric, the Journal of Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Christopher for the first time separated the
DPRK from the alleged pariah countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States has previously labeled the DPRK together with
some other countries as pariah states which are objects of the
harshest treatment in U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the shift in U.S. official rhetoric has
become necessary due to the October 1994 framework agreement with
the DPRK to freeze its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
"You set yourself up for embarrassment when on Monday you
consider them a pariah and Tuesday you're dealing with them," said
a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
While the change is still only rhetorical, it may mark a
milestone in U.S. policy, the newspaper believed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said the United States has embarked on an
initiative to influence and eventually open the DPRK, building on
the nuclear agreement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Involvement in Muslim Arms Shipments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has denied
a press report alleging that Saudi Arabia funded a 300 million
U.S. dollars covert operation to channel weapons to the Muslim-led
Bosnian government over the past three years with the U.S.
knowledge and tacit cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We deny these allegations that we were in any way involved in
that Saudi program," said a senior U.S. official speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The report of the arms shipments was published in today's
Washington Post as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was
leaving for the Balkans to promote the peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the shipments were disclosed by an
official with firsthand knowledge of the operation.
</P>
<P>
The alleged program would have been in direct violation of a
United Nations arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia that the
Clinton administration had pledged to observe for the peaceful
settlement of the 43-month bloody conflict in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"There was no U.S. cooperation or consultation with any other
government that may have chosen to supply arms to the Bosnians,"
the U.S. official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Johnson told a press briefing that
the United States has been abiding by the arms embargo resolution
"in all aspects."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the previous claims that the
United States had cooperated in supplying arms to the Bosnian
Muslims had been proved unfounded.

Christopher also told reporters in Sarajevo that meeting the
deadline set in the peace agreement "is a very important landmark"
in the final restoration of peace.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in Sarajevo today from the northeastern
town of Tuzla where he paid tribute to the U.S. soldiers based
there on Friday. In Sarajevo he held a meeting with Bosnian
President Aliya Izetbegovic and also planted a tree in honor of
three U.S. diplomats killed on a peace mission in August, 1995.
