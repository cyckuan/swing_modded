<HEADLINE> S. Korean Parliament Still Deadlocked Over Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean parliament
today decided to go into recess until Monday to let the ruling
and opposition parties work out a compromise over the choice
of parliamentary speaker and deputy speakers.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly has been deadlocked over the issue since
its opening session on June 5 following the April 11 general
election.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation was sparked when the ruling New Korea Party
led by President Kim Young-sam named the speaker, Kim Soo-han and
one deputy Oh Se-eung without the customary consultation with the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, including the National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP) and the United Liberal Democrats, blocked the
selection on June 5 and again yesterday as a protest against the
NKP.
</P>
<P>
They are angered at the way the NKP, which lost its majority in
the April general election, secured a new majority by recruiting
independent and opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The opposition is demanding an apology from the president for
engineering a "false" majority in the 299-member parliament and
say they will continue to block the selection of speakers until
the NKP apologizes.
</P>
<P>
The NKP fell 11 seats short of a simple majority of 150 in the
assembly. But it later lured into its fold 11 independent and
opposition lawmakers, giving it the majority it needed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that despite their promise to try to strike
a compromise, the rival parties are unlikely to agree a political
deal on the issue in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Rescuers Continue Search of Plane Wreckage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese rescue workers were this
evening continuing their search of the wreckage of an Indonesian
DC-10 jetliner which crashed on take-off and burst into flames
today.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and 108 others injured in the disaster
at Fukuoka airport in southwestern Japan, TV reports said, quoting
the Japanese Transport Ministry office. Twelve passengers are
missing.
</P>
<P>
"The whereabouts of the 12 passengers have not been confirmed,"
Government Spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said rescue
workers have so far been unable to enter the back of the charred
fuselage and the 12 missing people may be trapped inside the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
There were 260 passengers, including an baby, and 15 crew
members on board of the Garuda International Airline plane bound
for the Indonesian island resort of Bali and Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The plane overran the runway and crashed into a nearby rice
field soon after take-off around noon. Television footage showed
a column of dense black smoke and flames rising from the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto voiced sympathy for
the victims of the disaster, the first fatal passenger plane
accident in Japan since the April 1994 China Airlines airbus crash
at Nagoya Airport in central Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I express my condolences to the deceased. I also hope that
the injured will undergo sufficient treatment and recover as soon
as possible," he was reported as saying.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Civil Servants Strike for More Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 teachers
and civil servants in Swaziland went on strike today, in demand
for pay rise.
</P>
<P>
The massive strike came after months of deadlocked
negotiations with the Swazi government. The teachers and civil
servants said they have not had a rise since a 13.5 percent hike
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government has called the strike illegal on the basis a
new industrial relations bill that prohibits workers to strike if
they provide essential services, the South African Press
Association reported from Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
The teachers and government workers have said they will meet
later tomorrow to discuss what other actions to take.

<HEADLINE> Somali Refugees Intend To Cross Into Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,500 Somali refugees are
stranded between Liboi and Doble, the Kenya and Somali border
points, Kenyan North Eastern Province Commissioner (PC) Maurice
Makhanu has said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya News Agency quoted Maurice Makhanu as disclosing
that by Wednesday, 13 of the refugees were feared dead due to
lack of essential medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
He was briefing Minister of State in the Office of the
President Kipkalya Kones who is touring the area on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PC told Kipkalya Kones that the current refugee influx
started over the weekend when the Bantu Somalis camped at the
No-Mans-Land with intentions of crossing into Kenya, fleeing
from an upsurge conflicts in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He appealed the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) to intervene immediately before the situation
goes out of control.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is currently hosting 170,000 refugees from neighbouring
countries. The number has been largely reduced from the peck of
450,000 in 1993, mostly from Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Atmospheric Research Program Launched in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A pioneer research program
studying the changes in the composition of the atmosphere in
Greece has been in process since the end of may and is to be
completed on June 20, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
The program, known as the international experiment PAUR --
photochemical activity and solar ultraviolet radiation -- was
initiated and coordinated by the country's Salonika Aristotelion
University and co-financed by the European Union and the ministry
of the environment, town planning and public works.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the aim of the experiment is to
obtain a "cat scan" of the atmosphere in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The experiment also aims to investigate the repercussions of
ozone depletion and increased penetration of ultraviolet rays in
the atmosphere -- which result in changes in the components of the
atmosphere -- and the effects on the biosphere.
</P>
<P>
It will attempt to prove, for the first time, the theory that
the anticipated increase in ultraviolate radiation will aggravate
urban smog and substantially increase photochemical pollution.
</P>
<P>
The areas in which the readings are taking place have been
carefully selected, while a series of high-precision analyses are
being conducted in each of the selected regions.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven scientists positioned throughout Greece are
monitoring the atmosphere with sophisticated instruments, while a
specially equipped falcon-type dirigible balloon is carrying out
flight over the Aegean and Athens at altitudes ranging from 30 to
12,000 metres for atmospheric readings at all the levels.
</P>
<P>
Processing of the immense volume of readings is expected to be
completed in 1997.

<HEADLINE> ECE Calls for More Wood Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The UN Economic Commission for
Europe (ECE) on Thursday called for more wood consumption in its
member states, arguing that using wood does not necessarily damage
the environment, but can actually promote forest conservation.
</P>
<P>
"To support all the benefits of forests, they must be properly
maintained, and that maintenance has a cost. Overall in Europe,
only by maintaining and developing the timber trade can forest
management costs be covered," said Ed Pepke, a forest products
marketing specialist with the ECE.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made amid growing concern among Europe's wood
producers over the loss of market share during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest ECE timber trends study, Europe's
forest removals diminished from 366 million cubic metres in 1990
to 323 million cubic metres in 1993, a decline of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
While 1994 showed a six percent increase from the low 1993
level, the predictions by the ECE Timber Committee for 1995 were
an increase of only 2.5 percent and another increase of 0.5
percent in 1996, just restoring the level of the year 1990. The
same trends were also registered in the United States, the ECE
said.
</P>
<P>
According to its analysis, the reduction in forest removals is
due partly to an 18 percent drop in demand in Europe for sawnwood
from 1990 to 1993, and a 4.6 percent drop in the United States
over the same period.
</P>
<P>
While part of the decreased consumption can be attributed to
the economic recession in many countries, there are also
structural change, the ECE said, referring primarily to the fact

that wood is increasingly be replaced by plastic, steel and

The ECE argued that the alienation of consumers is largely due
to a lack of information on the positive environmental qualities
of using wood in construction, especially its benefits in terms of
health.
</P>
<P>
Life cycle analyses have also shown wood to be environmentally
advantageous to other construction materials because of its
renewability and recyclability, according to the ECE.

<HEADLINE> Clerides: US Has No Solution Plan for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has said he believes that at the present stage the U.S. will not
put forward any specific solution plan for Cyprus as it does not
consider the time right for such a move.
</P>
<P>
The President was speaking upon his arrival in New York
Wednesday to meet with the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, according to Cyprus news agency today.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides is currently on a four-nation tour which
will take him to Switzerland, Britain and Italy in addition to the
United States. In Geneva, he had a meeting with
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, focusing on the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting on June 17 with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington, Clerides expressed the view that "at
present the U.S. has not decided to put forward any specific plan
concerning the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
"We have been repeatedly assured of this," he said, adding
that he believes the U.S. would not consider the time right for
such a move.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides cited two reasons, namely the pre-election
period in the U.S. and the government instability in Turkey, to
support his assumption that the American initiative on Cyprus is
not expected to be launched at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
He said he is not expecting any pressure from his
U.S. counterpart toward a solution of the Cyprus problem. He noted
that the meeting was proposed after the Cyprus government had
asked the U.S. to exercise pressure against Turkey and especially
the Turkish military to abandon its intransigent position on the
basic issues of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that Europe could play an important part in efforts
for a solution to the Cyprus problem. He noted, however, that it
is the U.S. and not Europe that has the power to exercise
pressure in this direction. "Co-ordinated efforts by the U.S. and
Europe in this direction would be the ultimate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting with U.N. chief Boutros-Ghali in
Geneva Tuesday, President Clerides said they reached the
conclusion that there could be no direct talks between the Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides since there was no common
ground on the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
There have been no direct talks between the two community
leaders since a series of informal talks between Clerides and
Rauf Denktash in Nicosia in October 1994, under the
U.N. auspices.

"It is not easy for China to make such a decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador called for attentions to the fact that China
conducted the least number of nuclear tests among the five nuclear
powers, and that its nuclear arsenal is of no match to those of
nuclear superpowers in terms of quantity and quality.
</P>
<P>
China conducted the June 8 nuclear test and will do another
before September to ensure the safety of its nuclear weapons, Sha
quoted an earlier Chinese Government statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
China understands the concern voiced by some non-nuclear-weapon
states, the Chinese diplomat asserted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, certain nuclear superpower and its military
allies under its nuclear protection have made some unwarranted
remarks on China's extremely limited number of nuclear tests
irrespective of China's legitimate security concerns."
</P>
<P>
"This is totally unacceptable," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ambassador urged these countries to concentrate
on the negotiations and show necessary flexibility the same as
China did in order to conclude the CTBT talks by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
In response to some criticism at the meeting on China's
position on peaceful nuclear explosion (PNE), Sha said: "PNE is
not a Chinese invention."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, it was legalized by the 1970 nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was last year indefinitely
extended.
</P>
<P>
"If someone wants to use CTBT to perpetually ban PNE," Sha
questioned, "then why did they not call for an amendment to NPT at
its extension and review conference held in May last year as well
as at many NPT review sessions held before?"
</P>
<P>
He stressed that despite its longstanding position on PNE,
China has exercised maximum flexibility in agreeing upon a
temporary ban on it so as to bring an early conclusion to CTBT.
</P>
<P>
China expects the same flexibility from some other countries in
order to find a solution acceptable to all parties, Sha said,
adding: "If everyone just sticks to its own national position, it
will only bring to the negotiations negative influences which our
(Chinese) delegation is not willing to see."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Get Record Wheat Output This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Winter wheat production in
Zimbabwe is this year expected to treble because of the good
rainy season, producers said today.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Cereals Producers Association
Peter Wells said about 47,000 hectares will be put to wheat,
producing up to 250,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Last year the area under wheat was reduced by about 70 percent
to 14,000 hectares which gave a harvest of 70,000 tonnes because
of inadequate irrigation water supplies.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean wheat is grown during the winter months using

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Stay out of NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Two senior Swedish officials
today ruled out membership of the NATO military alliance despite
growing domestic pressure for the traditionally neutral country to
sign up.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried by the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, Foreign
Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen and Defense Minister Thage G. Peterson
wrote that there is no foreign threat forcing Sweden to abandon
its 200-year-old policy of nonalignment and military neutrality.
</P>
<P>
The planned eastward expansion of NATO has forced Sweden to ask
itself whether membership would strengthen its security, the two
ministers said. The answer is a clear 'no'.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Sweden joined NATO's Partnership for Peace -- a
cooperation program with former eastern bloc countries and other
European non-NATO members on regional defense issues.
</P>
<P>
Though a neutral country in the Baltic since the early 19th
century, Sweden has strengthened cooperation with the western
military alliance over the last two years, particularly in Bosnian
peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
There have been growing calls for Stockholm to have a seat
within NATO, after the U.S.-led alliance agreed last week to boost
Europe's role within the organization and give the Western
European Union defense body more power.
</P>
<P>
NATO agreed in Berlin in early June to form a European wing of
the trans-Atlantic alliance which will be given more independence
and the chance to undertake its own peacekeeping or relief
missions through the setting up of a Combined Joint Task Forces
(CJTF), using borrowed U.S. hardware but not ground troops.

<HEADLINE> EC Announces Action Plan to Improve Airline Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today announced a new strategy to improve airline safety over the
15 European Union (EU) nations.
</P>
<P>
The strategy called for more systematic methods for assessing
the safety of foreign carriers; sharing that information among EU
nations; and enforcing safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
It proposed that legislative act be taken to oblige EU member
nations to ground foreign aircraft found or suspected to be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
It will build on existing networks and is reinforced by a
program of financial and technical assistance to enable foreign
aviation safety authorities to improve their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The strategy also called for the future establishment of a
European Aviation Safety Authority to oversee all aspects of
aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
"Since the responsibility for overseeing air safety is divided
between the Commission, member nations, and other aviation bodies,
implementation of the strategy will be jointly shared," an EC
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This action plan will be presented to the Council of Transport
Ministers of the EU Member States on Monday, June 17.
</P>
<P>
European air travelers already enjoy very high standards of
safety. However, the EC is anxious to ensure that the highest
possible safety standards prevail.
</P>
<P>
Europe accounts for a third of all world air traffic, but only
10 percent of accidents.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hotels in the Cambodian capital
have become bases for drug dealers, child traffickers and other
criminals, often protected by corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh's authorities and police are often powerless to act,

The official's claims come as the government struggles to

Co-Interior Minister of Cambodia Sar Kheng admitted Tuesday
that abductions, murders, organized crime, drug trafficking and

<HEADLINE> Election of S. Korean Parliamentary Speaker Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean parliament today
failed again to select its speaker and deputy speakers because of
confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, protesting at the way the ruling New Korea
Party secured its majority in parliament after the April 11
general election, said they will continue to block the selection
until the NKP apologizes to the South Korean people.
</P>
<P>
Kim Huh-nam of the opposition United Liberal Democrats, took on
the role of acting speaker in the opening session of the new
parliament on June 5, as he is the oldest lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
But during today's afternoon session, when 24 lawmakers queued
up to speak, he called a recess on health grounds and later
resigned.
</P>
<P>
His replacement, Kim Myong-noon, tried to open an evening
session, but was prevented from taking the rostrum by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The ruling NKP favors Kim Soo-han as speaker and Oh Se-eung as
deputy speaker. Both men were nominated by the NKP's leader
president Kim Young-sam on June 4.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, including the National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP) and the ULD, are angered at the way the NKP, which
lost its majority after the April election, secured a majority by
recruiting independent and opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The NKP fell 11 seats short of a simple majority of 150 in the
299-seat National Assembly. But it later lured into its fold 11
lawmakers, mainly independents, giving it the majority it needed.

</P>
<P>
 a team of 53 un inspectors are currently in baghdad to inv

weaponry expert told reporters that they are operating under the
instruction of rolf ekeus, chairman of un special commission (unscom)
on disarming iraq and will stay outside the camp as long as he direct
s them to do.
</P>
<P>
 answering a question on what the inspectors expect to find at th
e particular site, he said, 'the security council has mandated us to
look after prescribed items and documents, and we are carrying out ou
r mandate.'
</P>
<P>
 he declined to comment on whether the sites in abu ghraib, 30 k
ilometers west of baghdad, to which they were denied entrance two
days ago, are being mornitored by inspectors following their pullout.
</P>
<P>
 asked whether he has had contacts with the iraqi officials to fi
nd ways of solving the present standoff, he only said, 'the iraqi
officials are standing there, and yuou can asked them.'
</P>
<P>
 on e of the iraqi officials said that the un inspectors have bee
n insisting on entering what he called as the 'sensitive site'to
create problems ofr them. more than 140 un inspection team have so fa

 un operation is no more than a provocation, he noted.

BONN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A government plan to build
anti-aircraft and anti-submarine cruisers to replace a fleet of
destroyers built more than 30 years ago was endorsed by the
defense committee of Germany's Federal Assembly today.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed to build three F124 cruisers, at an
estimated cost of one billion German marks (650 million
U.S. dollars) each, before deciding whether the fourth should be
built. The first cruiser is to be delivered in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Though supported by the government and the main opposition
Social Democratic Party, the committee's decision was sharply
criticized by the Green Party and the Democratic Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, 143 meters long and 17 meters high, will be able
to travel at 28 nautical miles (32 kilometers) per hour.
</P>
<P>
Designed as an anti-aircraft and anti-submarine vessel, the
cruiser can take 195 men and stay on sea for 21 days without
re-fueling.

<P>
Brussels, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) had a
revised unemployment rate of 10.9 percent in April, the same as in
March and February, according to an official report today.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, the EU unemployment rate stood at 10.8
percent, Eurostat, the Statistical office of the European
Communities, said while reporting the latest figure.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics showed that Spain's unemployment has been
falling, from 22.5 percent in January to 22.1 in April. However,
the rate was still the highest among the 15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the jobless rate was going up in two EU
nations: from January's 7.3 percent to April's 7.6 percent in
Portugal, and from 9.3 percent to 10.1 percent in Sweden.

<P>
Eurostat noted that the rises are particularly apparent among
those aged 25 or less. In Sweden, their jobless rate in April
stood at 22.4 percent; in Portugal, 16.9 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Announces Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
announced that it would provide the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) with 6.2 million U.S. dollars in emergency food
aid to alleviate a food shortage caused by floods in 1995.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press
briefing here that the decision was made "in response to a
consolidated appeal from the various United Nations agencies,
including the World Food Program, and after consultation with the
governments" of Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We're convinced that the food situation, based on the reports
that have been given to us by the United Nations, is actually
quite severe and that there is a possibility that the situation
could deteriorate further absent a response from the international
community," Burns said in explaining the U.S. government's
decision.
</P>
<P>
This would be the second food aid to the DPRK by the United
States since the country suffered severe floods during the 1995
harvest. In February, the U.S. gave the DPRK 2 million U.S.
dollars worth of aid food.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that Washington "has chosen the World Food Program
as the channel for this assistance," which includes 3,500 tons of
corn/soy blend as well as 6,600 tons of rice and 3,000 tons of
corn meal for the flood victims.

KIEV, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Leonid Kuchma said today
that Ukraine is ready to "create conditions" for Russia's fleet in
the Black Sea but will never surrender the whole city of
Sevastopol, headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia will get "the part it deserves rather than all of the
infrastructure" for the Black Sea Fleet, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who was speaking to students in the Ukraine Institute
of Management, expected that the presidential elections in Russia
will affect relations between the two countries and a further
settlement of the Black Sea Fleet Dispute.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Ukraine will not give up Sevastopol because
it is home to a significant number of industrial and trading
companies and 13,000 Ukrainian naval troops.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet has been a longstanding dispute between the
two Slav neighbors since the Soviet Union fell apart in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has delayed his visit to Kiev
six times because of his discontent over the division of the fleet
and its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said Ukraine will continue to cooperate with Russia
after the presidential elections because Russia is "a strategic
partner" of Ukraine.

</P>
<P>
"The whereabouts of 12 of the passengers have not been

Fukuoka police said the 12 people may be survivors who were

Kajiyama said the rescue team had not been able to reach a
burnt part of the plane, which was carrying 261 passengers and 14
crew members bound for Indonesian resort island Bali and Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Fire swept through the passenger cabin of the DC-10 airliner,
which skidded off the runaway and crashed into a nearby rice field.

A Fukuoka police spokesman said the plane appeared to have
caught fire from the port side engine.

Firefighters said all the people on board were evacuated before
the passenger fuselage was completely gutted by the fire.

<P>
Three were killed and nearly 100 were injured in the accident

<HEADLINE> Study: US Teen-Age Pregnancy Cost $ 7 Billion This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. scholars has
estimated that u.s. taxpayers this year will spend nearly 7
billion u.s. dollars to deal with social problems resulting from
recent births by girls under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
This calculation is contained in what was described the most
comprehensive study to date on the effect of teen-age pregnancy.
The study, sponsored by the Robin Hood Foundation, a New York City
Charity is to be made public on Thursday at White House, where
President Clinton is expected to cite it in highlighting a 30
million u.s. dollars program in his 1997 budget for prevention of
teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The study found that teen-age child bearing cost the country
additional 2.2 billion u.s. dollars annually in welfare and food
stamp benefits, 1.5 billion in medical care costs, 900 million in
increased foster care expenses and 1 billion for additional prison
construction.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists who conducted the study say that its calculations
are conservative since they only looked at the result of
childbirth for girls under 18.
</P>
<P>
As a group, they give birth to 175,000 children each year. All
told, about 500,000 children a year are born to girls 15 to 19, 72
percent of them, unmarried, the sociologists noted.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Send 35 Athletes to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will send 22 men and 13
women athletes to the Atlanta Olympic Games, Thailand Olympic
Committee vice president Chairat Khamnuan announcd here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These athletes will take part in seven events, namely, track
and field, badminton, boxing, swimming (diving), shooting, tennis
and weightlifting, Khamnuan said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said Thailand had yet to decide to send
athletes to the windsurfing and yatching events in the Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
Khamnuan noted that it was unrealistic for the Thai athletes to
win gold medal in Atlanta. "But that doesn't mean they will come
home empty-handed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which is to stage the 13th Asian Games in 1998, will
gain experience as a host of the sporting gala from Atlanta,
Khamnuan added.

<HEADLINE> EC to Assist Andalusia in Gas Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
today it has approved 99.01 million ECUs (about 128.7 million
U.S. dollars) mainly for a gas pipeline project in Andalusia.
</P>
<P>
The project, known as "Straits of Gibraltar-Cordova," will be
financed by the European Regional Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
It involves the construction of 297 kilometers of gas pipeline
to establish a connection with the existing section on the African
side of the "Straits of Gibraltar-Cordova" link.
</P>
<P>
Part of the planned pipeline, 23 kilometers in length, will be
built underwater.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, it will be able to transport 18.1 billion cubic
meters of gas a year, and allow the interconnection of the
Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline with the natural gas grids of Spain
and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
As one of the priority energy projects approved at the European
Union's Essen summit in December 1994, the project forms part of
the development of trans-European energy networks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's National Party Sets Precondition to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jatiya (national) Party (JP),
the third largest party after Bangladesh's just-ended seventh
parliamentary elections, said here today that it will go for
alliance to form a coalition government with the party that will
release its jailed chairman and ex-president H.M. Ershad.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by JP's acting chairman Mizanur Rahman
Choedhury at a news briefing tonight.
</P>
<P>
The main demand of his party is the release of Ershad, he said,
adding that "we will not support any party which will not be
liberal on the question of Ershad's release."
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who took power in 1982 and was forced to step down at
the end of 1990, has been serving prison terms on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitutional rules, he was allowed to
contest in 5 of the 300 constituencies in the poll held Wednesday,
but he was prohibited to make campaign speeches over radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results announced by the Election Commission (EC)
showed that the Awami (people's) League (AL) has 133 seats against
ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party's 104 seats.
</P>
<P>
Although the JP has won 29 seats so far, either the AL or BNP
has to join forces with the JP to form a coalition government
since either of them can not win a simple majority needed to form
the government alone.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Exchange Views on Human Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- World leaders in the past two
days stressed the importance of international cooperation in
translating their political will and commitments into concrete
results when they addressed the high-level segment of the Second
U.N. Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
"Let Istanbul be the clarion call for a new beginning, a new
beginning to come together as a global community to define our
future," declared Benazir Bhutto, prime minister of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Excessive urbanization is full of untold horrors, she said,
adding that "it is time the world said 'enough'. There is a
solution."
</P>
<P>
Daniel Moi, president of Kenya, urged the international
community to help Africa and other developing countries realize
economic growth and improve their human settlements.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Ion Iliescu noted that a new social system
is taking shape in his country and the redefinition of the
sustainable development of human settlements is taking place.
</P>
<P>
He said Romania would welcome any international help in its
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Aleksander Kwasniewski, president of Poland, believes that the
problems of urbanization are global and cannot be solved by
isolated initiatives.
</P>
<P>
World leaders "must above all act with all vigor in our own
countries" to meet the housing needs of their citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ezer Weizman, president of Israel, said his country is
addressing the challenge of redirecting its budgets from the
procurement of weapons to welfare programs and investments in
education in a bid to achieve regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha told the "City Summit" that
his country has succeeded in achieving considerable macro-economic
stability within a short time of about four years, but that
Albania is still facing difficulties in providing adequate
shelter.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to support Albania in
providing housing for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, vice-premier of China, said that favorable
external conditions for developing countries' economic and social
development should be created.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that it is imperative to respect all states'
independence and sovereignty and give due regard to their
policies, strategies and planning for human settlements
development.
</P>
<P>
The two-week HABITAT II was opened by U.N. chief Boutros
Boutros-Ghali on June 3. Some 19 heads of state or government
attended the high-level segment and would endorse on Friday the
final document of HABITAT II.

<HEADLINE> Tighter Measures to Target Foreign Taxpayers in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Stricter measures, including
suspending business operations in Vietnam, will be taken against
foreign representative offices who fail to report their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Doan Thi Kia, chief of Hanoi's Foreign Investment Taxation
Office, said that some foreigners are taking advantage of loose
management to "forget" to register their real income.
</P>
<P>
The official, who was covered by the latest issue of the
Vietnam Investment Review, listed over 100 foreign representative
offices that failed to register income taxes.
</P>
<P>
The representative offices, she was quoted as saying, "are
confusing tax office efforts to track them down."
</P>
<P>
"We will take stricter measures," vowed the official, who has
the authority to notify other agencies to suspend foreign
businesses' licenses for non-compliance with Vietnam's tax laws.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there have been over 450 foreign representative
offices in the capital city of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The magazine report also said that officials are now compiling
a list of foreign individuals employed in Vietnam who have not paid
their taxes.
</P>
<P>
The list will be handed over to the city's Bureau of Foreign
Economic Relations, which could bar those on the list from
obtaining an exit visa.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Finance Ministry stipulated that all foreigners
living and working in Vietnam for over 183 days must pay tax.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's performance against its
main competitors in world markets continue to improve, Michael
Heseltine, the British Prime Minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the third competitiveness White Paper
"Creating the Enterprise Centre of Europe", Heseltine said:
"Improving competitiveness means providing a stable economy;
improving education and training; encouraging innovation; and
continually improving management."
</P>
<P>
"The competitiveness approach is an over arching culture change
which will give us higher living standards and a better quality of
life. Competitiveness will put us in pole position," he added.
</P>
<P>
The White paper, the biggest and most comprehensive review ever
undertaken in Britain, contains analysis of important aspects of
the UK's competitiveness, including the first ever government-led
audit of education and training, comparing the UK's performance
with that of other countries. It also includes further analysis of
the performance of UK firms in both manufacturing and services and
- for the first time - analysis of competitiveness at regional
level, including comparisons of regional manufacturing
productivity, education attainment, progress toward investors in
people and the creation of small firms.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also details a number of new government
measures to improve competitiveness, in particular by further
improving education and training performance, simplifying
government support for business and better helping small firms.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Ex-ruling Party Alleges Poll Rigging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) today reacted strongly over what it called massive
irregularities in the polling of 111 constituencies, saying that
it is a pre-planned, conspiratorial and unprecedented type of
rigging in the country's election history.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary results declared by the Election
Commission (EC), the Awami (people's) League (AL), the former
largest opposition party in the country, has won in 133 of 271
constituencies while the BNP won 104 seats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a post-election press conference here tonight, BNP
Secretary General Abdus Salam Talukdar alleged that the
administration had helped in doing the large-scale irregularities
in the 111 constituencies only to propel one particular party into
power.
</P>
<P>
The EC has been making unnecessary delay in announcing the
results of the constituencies where the BNP won from the very
beginning, he said, adding that despite repeated complaints to the
EC, no step was taken.
</P>
<P>
"There is no transparency in declaring the election results at
the EC. Why have they stopped declaration of results and suspended
polls of one center after another without giving any
clarification," another BNP leader asked.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the radio and television quoting the same EC
sources were airing and telecasting different types of results, he
said, "One was saying the BNP won 112 seats while the TV was
saying 104 seats so far."

<HEADLINE> International Mediator Critical of Bosnian Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's former warring factions
have yet to embark on the reconciliation process as envisaged in a
peace agreement they signed last year, the office of High
Representative said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the implementation of the peace accord draws to its
half-year mark, "Bosnia is still a society coming apart -- not a
society starting to come back together," said Colum Murphy,
spokesman for High Representative Carl Bildt, who is the
co-oridinator of the efforts to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Murphy, speaking hours before an international meeting in
Florence, Italy, to review the implementation in the past half
year, said that the three ethnic groups have all contributed to
the failure of efforts to stick the country together.
</P>
<P>
He said that the federation between Muslims and Croats is
moving in the direction of "confederation" and on the local level
of the federation, "tensions and distrust are strong".
</P>
<P>
"We do not see any coming together of communities, rather the
contrary," Murphy said of the U.S.-brokered federation which was
supposed to form the basis for reintegration of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Mulsims are "increasingly questioning the legality of the
RS(Serb Republic) and the long term validity of the political
structures of the peace agreement", Murphy said, adding that "this
is not the peace agreement".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Serb side wants to transform the boundaries
between the entities into "a tightly controlled state
border...making the RS as much of a completely independent entity
as possible".
</P>
<P>
Serbs "want a partitioned Bosnia -- which most definitely is
not the peace agreement," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
For both the federation and the Serb republic, Murphy said,
"peace is still the continuation of war by other means -- not the
reconciliation that would be the true spirit of Dayton and paris"
where the peace accord was initialled and finally signed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called for augmented support from the
international community to the peace process in the next half
year.
</P>
<P>
"At the half-way point, Dayton is half successful," he said,
"but the period ahead will not survive a half-hearted effort of
political will--from either the parties or the international
community."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Encourage Growth of Domestic Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will amend
the country's investment law to help achieve a faster growth of
domestic investment, said an official report today.
</P>
<P>
The goal, according to the report in Vietnam News, an English
newspaper, is to bring the growth of domestic investment up to
that of foreign capital input in the country.
</P>
<P>
"While encouraging foreign investment," Nguyen Nhac, Deputy
Minister of Planning and Investment, was quoted as saying,
"domestic production should also be promoted in an effort to reach
the capital investment goal of 40-50 billion U.S. dollars by the
year 2000."
</P>
<P>
There have been many drastic conflicts between foreign and
domestic investors in the manufacturing of detergent and soft
drinks, Nhac noted.
</P>
<P>
In future, he said, priority will be given to domestic
investors if they can prove their ability to produce the goods.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, calling for foreign capital investment will be
defined according to the need of each sector, the location, and
the project scale," he added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year, Vietnam had granted licenses to
1,826 projects with a combined legal capital estimated at 20.932
billion dollars from more than 700 foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 227 projects were cancelled and 16 others ended their
operations, leaving 1,573 projects with a total legal capital of
19.353 billion dollars still operating.

BELGRADE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and visiting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe held
talks here today over "all aspects of mutual relations and
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two leaders discussed overall cooperation,
"primarily in the area of economy, for which there were
comparative advantages on both sides," Tanjug news agency quoted a
Serbian presidential statment as saying.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic specified that Yugoslavia highly appreciated the
political support which Zimbabwe and President Mugabe himself had
provided during the entire period of the Yugoslav crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, the leaders agreed that political dialogue was an
irreplaceable method of settling disputes worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"It is the dialogue which excludes the use of force or such
threats, as well as any form of pressure detrimental to objective
approaches," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Milosevic and Mugabe also agreed that
positive results could be achieved through successful promotion of
political ties, dialogue and bilateral cooperation, as practiced
by Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe, and through principled stands in
international organizations and in other forms of multilateral
cooperation.

environmental performance effectively are more competitive.
</P>
<P>
They can reduce their costs, gain an edge in the marketplace,
and access new markets, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The third competitiveness White Paper, "Creating the Enterprise
Centre of Europe", published today, identifies environmental
issues as an important factor affecting business competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
It outlines some of the challenges and opportunities
environmental issues offer firms, and gives examples of firms
where an improvement in performance has brought commercial
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also sets out ways in which the government is
helping businesses, particularly small firms, to become more
competitive by managing their environmental performance.
</P>
<P>
The British Environment Secretary John Gummer said at a press
conference here this afternoon: "Green business is good business.
The White Paper puts environmental issues in the business
mainstream. It recognises that companies which manage their impact
on the environment effectively will be more competitive. Firms
can respond to the environmental challenge as they would to any
other -through positive management, innovation, good design,
developing  new products, and moving into new markets,
particularly overseas."
</P>
<P>
"Good environmental management is good business sense... many
companies have recognised this and started to improve their
environmental performance voluntarily," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary hoped that all firms would take advantage of
these opportunities and become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
In order to allow business to use their innovative skills to
address environmental problems efficiently, Gummer said the
government was therefore committed to creating a flexible,
regulatory frame work which stimulates innovation and allows
business to develop and imaginative and cost effective response.

<HEADLINE> Radical Changes in Britain's Support For Its Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) - Proposals to give business
partnerships a much greater say in the design and delivery of
government business support schemes were announced here today by
British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine proposed a radical shake up a business support
schemes and invited views from industry, commerce and business
support organisations. The proposals include:
</P>
<P>
- government support for small and medium sized business to be
brought together into a 200 million pounds (300 million US
dollars) local competitiveness budget. Most of this would be used
by TECs (Training Enterprise Centre) and Business Links to provide
tailored support for local business, with up to 25 % to be made
available on a challenge basis;
</P>
<P>
- sectoral support across government to be combined as a new
sector challenge budget building up to 40 million pounds (60
million US dollars). The government proposes to ask Trade
Associations and other business-led sector bodies to design
programmes to improve the competitiveness of their industry;
</P>
<P>
-simplification of other areas of government business support
by cutting red tape, shortening response times and significantly
reducing the number of separate schemes for business.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister said: +These proposals mark a
sea-change in the way government helps business. We want to get
away from the idea of centrally designed schemes which businesses
have told us can be too distant from their own needs. Instead we
want to give business people the money and the tools they need to
improve their performance.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine expressed hope that business and business support
organisations will respond with enthusiasm and vision to this
challenge and today's proposals will bring the same innovative
spirit to business support.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hosts Moslem Women's Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran today hosted the second
gathering of the founding members of the International Union of
Moslem Women's Non-Governmental Organizations.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 11 Moslem countries, including Sudan,
Libya, Egypt, Morocco, Kuwait and Bangladesh, discussed the
procedures for membership and gathering of the union and the
articles of association proposed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Fatemeh Hashemi, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's
daughter and head of the Iranian Women's Solidarity Society, said
that strengthening the role of Moslem women in the development of
Islamic societies is one of the main goals of formation of the
union.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that the International Union of Moslem
Women's Non-Governmental Organizations could bring about great
success in strengthening Moslem women's role in society by
relying on Islamic teachings which attach great importance to
women.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the background of the formation of the union,
she said, "The issue was first raised during the Fourth World
Women Conference held in Beijing last year."
</P>
<P>
"We felt it necessary to have a platform to coordinate our
activities with our counterparts in the world as a whole," she
added.
</P>
<P>
The first of such gathering was held in Bonn, Germany, on
February 2 last year, which was attended by delegates from

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes US State Department's Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry today
refuted allegations by U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas
Burns who called Iran as a "factor of instability" in the Persian
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, said
that the recent allegations of the U.S. State Department against
Iran were "futile efforts" to explain the defeat of the American
policy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said the main factors of tension in the Persian Gulf were
Washington's measures to strengthen U.S. military bases and sell
advanced weapons to states in the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the U.S. accusations against Iran were
aimed at justifying increased American military presence in the
sensitive and strategic Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"These baseless charges against Iran cannot be a justification
for the defeat of U.S. policies in the Middle East, particularly
in Lebanon and occupied Palestine," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Moslem people regard the United States as the
principal supporter of Israel's terrorism and the suppressor of
freedom-lovers and independence-seekers in the world."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Republican's  Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate approved today
a budget-balancing plan produced by Republican-controlled U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the plan with a vote of 53-46 following a
narrow approval of 216-211 in the House of Representatives last
night.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan does not require President Clinton's signature
but it sets the guidelines for government spending and tax bills
the Congress is supposed to send to the White House between now
and the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
It would provide 1.62 trillion dollars in spending for U.S.
fiscal year of 1997 and map the way to a 5 billion federal surplus
by 2002. However it would permit a temporary increase in the
deficit in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The plan would chop savings out of Medicare, Medicaid and other
domestic programs over the next six years, while making room for a
new 500 dollars per child tax credit and letting defense spending
rise slightly.
</P>
<P>
As calculated by the Congressional Budget Office, the
Republican plan envisions 158 billion dollars in savings from
Medicare through 2002, compared with Clinton's 118 billion; 72
billion from Medicaid, compared with Clinton's 54 billion; and
about 70 billion from welfare and the earned income tax credit for
the poor, as opposed to Clinton's 41 billion.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has proposed a six-year budget-balancing
package of his own. But Republicans in the Congress say it
contains savings that will never occur and avoids the dramatic
changes in expensive benefit programs like Medicare necessary to
cut federal deficits.
</P>
<P>
The fight over the budget plan of 1996 between the U.S.
government and the Congress resulted in two partial government
shutdowns totalling 27 days.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Take Kodak-Fuji Market Dispute to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) --The U.S. government announced on
Thursday it will ask the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to rule in
a U.S. Kodak-Japanese Fuji film dispute over whether Japan
discriminates against imported film.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Trade Representative's office (USTR) asked
the Eastman Kodak Co. to go to Japan's Fair Trade Commission with
its complaint about anti-competitive practices in the Japanese
photographic film and paper markets.
</P>
<P>
"Our comprehensive investigation of the Japanese film market
has shown that the Government of Japan built, supported and
tolerated a market structure that thwarts foreign competition, and
in which exclusionary business practices are common place," acting
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
"We see in this sector the same market barriers that are
present in sector after sector in Japan," Barshefsky said. "These
are systemic structural barriers, such as closed distribution
systems and excessive regulation, that we have been discussing
with Japan for years."
</P>
<P>
However, the Fujifilm Co. have denied Kodak's allegations and
say many of the firm's problems were of its own making, asserting
the USTR's finding that the Japanese market is somehow closed is
"totally unjustified." The Japanese repeatedly rebuffed U.S.
efforts to negotiate a government-to-government settlement.
</P>
<P>
By going to the world body in Geneva the United States will
avoid the use of potentially damaging unilateral trade sanctions
that have been widely criticised by other countries. Under the WTO
case the United States will make a formal request for
consultations with the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Japan's film and photographic paper market is valued at around
2.8 billion U.S. dollars a year. Kodak has estimated that Japan's
market barriers have cost it at least 5.6 billion dollars in lost
revenue in the last decade.

<HEADLINE> ECE Calls for More Wood Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The UN Economic Commission for
Europe (ECE) on Thursday called for more wood consumption in its
member states, arguing that using wood does not necessarily damage
the environment, but can actually promote forest conservation.
</P>
<P>
"To support all the benefits of forests, they must be properly
maintained, and that maintenance has a cost. Overall in Europe,
only by maintaining and developing the timber trade can forest
management costs be covered," said Ed Pepke, a forest products
marketing specialist with the ECE.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made amid growing concern among Europe's wood
producers over the loss of market share during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest ECE timber trends study, Europe's
forest removals diminished from 366 million cubic metres in 1990
to 323 million cubic metres in 1993, a decline of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
While 1994 showed a six percent increase from the low 1993
level, the predictions by the ECE Timber Committee for 1995 were
an increase of only 2.5 percent and another increase of 0.5
percent in 1996, just restoring the level of the year 1990. The
same trends were also registered in the United States, the ECE
said.
</P>
<P>
According to its analysis, the reduction in forest removals is
due partly to an 18 percent drop in demand in Europe for sawnwood
from 1990 to 1993, and a 4.6 percent drop in the United States
over the same period.
</P>
<P>
While part of the decreased consumption can be attributed to
the economic recession in many countries, there are also
structural change, the ECE said, referring primarily to the fact
that wood is increasingly be replaced by plastic, steel and
aluminum in the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The ECE argued that the alienation of consumers is largely due
to a lack of information on the positive environmental qualities
of using wood in construction, especially its benefits in terms of
health.
</P>
<P>
Life cycle analyses have also shown wood to be environmentally
advantageous to other construction materials because of its
renewability and recyclability, according to the ECE.
</P>
<P>
It called on the timber industry and governments to better
inform the public of the advantages of wood use.

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from the 16
NATO member countries met at the NATO headquarters here today,
with France attending the meeting for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The meeting dealt with such issues as NATO's internal reform
and the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) mission in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and other member countries
praised French Defense Minister Charles Millon's presence as
"another important step forward" after France's reprochement to
NATO announced last December.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, defense ministers gave specific directions for
implementing political decisions made by NATO foreign ministers
last week in Berlin, especially for the work of making the
Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF) Concept to reality, including the
location, size, number and structure of CJTF headquarters elements
and their operating procedure.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers decided to hold a CJTF exercise to test
the new military structures as soon as they are in place.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the work should start quickly on the defense
aspects to develop the European security and defense identity.
</P>
<P>
They launched the review of the defense planning system to
ensure that NATO be fully capable of supporting not only
collective defense but also crisis management and peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
The French defense minister announced France will resume its
participation in NATO's international military staff and send
officers for preparations for the CJTF.
</P>
<P>
On the IFOR mission in Bosnia, the ministers confirmed that the
IFOR will be maintained at approximately its current force levels
of 60,000 men through September, when the elections in Bosnia are
due to take place, and that the IFOR's overall capability will be
retained until the end of its mandate in December.
</P>
<P>
But the ministers did not discuss at the meeting what might
happen after the expiration of the Dayton mandate, which was for a
year.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the defense ministers meeting, 15 ministers, without
France, met briefly this morning within the Defense Planning
Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sends Team to Investigate Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has sent a team to Japan
to investigate the crash of a Garuda airliner in Fukuoka which
killed three people and injured 100.
</P>
<P>
Garuda President Soepandi has reportedly also gone there.
</P>
<P>
The DC-10 jet plane, which carried 260 passengers and 15 crew
members, caught fire after an aborted take-off. At least three
people were killed, 100 others were injured and a dozen were
missing.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were mainly Japanese on group tours to
Indonesia's tropical island of Bali.
</P>
<P>
Soepandi said the ill-fated aircraft, which joined Garuda in
1979, was in good condition when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
"Every procedure (check) needed has been fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are still waiting for more information about the
nationalities of the victims," he said.
</P>
<P>
Garuda has a fleet of 60 aircraft, including three Boeing
b-747-200s and 10 A300-600s, six DC-11s and six DC-10s.
</P>
<P>
Soepandi said that he believed the crash in Japan was the first
serious accident involving the airline's wide-bodied aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The last accident involving a Garuda airliner was in January
1995, when a Boeingb-737 aircraft skidded off the runway on
landing at Yogyakarta airport. Nine of the 104 passengers were
hurt.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, an A300 with 145 people on board caught fire before
take-off in South Sulawesi province, but there were no casualties.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Coordinate Town Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has set up
a coordination committee on town development following a recent
decision to develop small towns around Kathmandu to relieve the
urbanization pressure on the capital city, the official news
agency RSS said today.
</P>
<P>
The central level committee, chaired by Minister of Housing and
Physical Planning Balaram Gharitimagar, would maintain
coordination with different ministries, government agencies, local
authorities and the private sector, according to RSS.
</P>
<P>
The 34-member committee would also serve as a coordinator
between the government and local town and village development
committees to maintain uniformity in the activities in town
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government last month announced a policy for planned
development of Kathmandu and its suburbs by furthering its
decentralization program introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that they would develop small towns around the
capital by selecting potential villages and improve infrastructure
facilities of the existing towns in the area.
</P>
<P>
Nepal needs some 2.5 million new houses to meet the growing
housing demand in the country over the next 15 years, and around
17 percent of the demand would come from urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Precious Painting to Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A 500-year-old painting once
listed among the top 100 relics collected by the Palace Museum
will be auctioned here next week.
</P>
<P>
The painting, made by Shen Zhou, a famous painter from the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), will go on the auction block at the Spring
Auction held by the Beijing Hanhai Art Auction Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Qin Gong, manager of the corporation, says that both the
National Museum of Chinese History and the Palace Museum showed
interest in bidding for the painting.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum set a world record by spending 18 million
yuan to buy a Chinese painting dated during the Song Dynasty
(907-1279) at Hanhai's Autumn Auction last year.
</P>
<P>
The painting to be auctioned was modeled after a piece of Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368) landscape. Shen once owned the original, but
lost it when he asked a friend to critique the scroll. The
friend's son stole the scroll and his offspring later sold it.
</P>
<P>
Shen, then 60, cold not afford to buy it back. He loved the
scroll so much that he tried to copy it from memory.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Shen's copy, 855 cm long, is structured
similarly to the original, but is different in style.
</P>
<P>
"It is better than the original and is the best of Shen's
works," experts say.
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Shen's copy was seized from a private collector and
placed in storage at the Palace Museum. The painting had not been
returned until the end of the so-called "Cultural Revolution"
(1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the original landscape, made by Huang Gongwang, a
famous painter in the Yuan Dynasty, is now part of a collection in
Taiwan, while the remaining one third, which was damaged in fire,
is in east China's Zhejiang Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China is tightening the reins on
its civil-use coal market to ensure the nation's coal supply.
</P>
<P>
Five governmental departments, including the Internal Trade
Ministry and the State Planning Commission, recently issued a
joint notice requiring the strengthening of coal market management
and ensuring the coal supply for civil use, especially in winter.
</P>
<P>
Sources said China consumes more than 200 million tons of
civil-use coal each year, accounting for 80 percent of the energy
required for civil use.
</P>
<P>
The notice asked all provinces, regions and cities to give full
play to the state-owned coal sales networks and re-register those
companies which are engaged in coal sales.
</P>
<P>
It also urged strengthening measures to supervise and control
the coal's quality, measurement and prices, and to fight against
any extra charges, counterfeit and cheating practices related to
coal or coal prices.
</P>
<P>
The notice asked that a civil-use coal deposit and pricing
foundation be formed in an effort to provide reasonable coal
storage and to readjust coal prices.
</P>
<P>
It required the coal mines, railway and communications
departments to strengthen cooperation to ensure the state plan for
the coal supply.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A strategic partnership between
Russia and China is the only way to safeguard the national
interests of the two countries, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Aleksandr Panov, a deputy foreign minister, said such a
partnership was born of reality and necessity and was not mere
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
Panov, speaking at the opening session of a two-day
Sino-Russian seminar on international issues, criticized those in
the Russian media who said confrontation between the two countries
is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
Those who spread such views have never bothered to study China
and Asia closely and know little about relations between Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hopes an objective and accurate analysis and
assessment on the development and future of Sino-Russian relations
will emerge from the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Russia Li Fenglin said at the opening
session the whole world is paying great attention to the
development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li described the current state of Sino-Russian relations as the
best and most healthy in the history of their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
At a time when international relations are undergoing profound
and complicated changes and multi-polarization is emerging, China
and Russia will contribute greatly to peace and stability in the
world if they cooperate over anti-hegemonism and power politics,
the Chinese ambassador said.

WASHINGTON, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production in the
United States rose 0.7 percent in May for the second straight
month, the U.S. Federal Reserve reported today.
</P>
<P>
The advance was the third so far in 1996 in the manufacturing
sector after dropping twice, in January and March, because of the
severe weather and a strike by General Motors Corp. workers.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve, or Fed, which serves as the country's
central bank, said production at U.S. utilities shot up 3.1
percent in May, more than erasing a 1.8 percent loss in April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent, slower than
the 1.1 percent advance in April, which reflected a rebound from
the losses during the General Motors strike in March.
</P>
<P>
Fed also said that the nation's industries were operating at
83.2 percent of capacity in April, up from 82.9 percent a month
ago.

<HEADLINE> Overseas PC Makers Adjust Chinese Market Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Digital Equipment Co.(DEC),
one of the major personal computer suppliers of USA, announced its
decision last week to retreat from China's household-use PC market
and shift its focus to more expensive and sophisticated commercial
PCs.
</P>
<P>
This trend in readjusting market tactics began early this year
with a price war launched by Acer, a computer company
headquartered in Taiwan. Acer reduced the price of its
Pentium-based PC to less than 10,000 yuan, roughly equal to the
cost of a large-screen color television.
</P>
<P>
Acer's pricing strategy, soon copied by domestic PC companies
such as Legend, Great Wall and Tontru, resulted in heavy
competition, as well as foreign companies' re-dividing of market
shares.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Chan, president of DEC's PC division, said that though
its sales rank fourth in China's PC market, the
technically-advanced DEC PCs are more suitable for commercial
users than for those who prefer standard PCs for home use.
</P>
<P>
The revised market strategies will help the company recruit
more customers from China's booming commercial sector, according
to Chan.
</P>
<P>
An unexpected price-cut was issued June 7 by IBM -- always
guided by its "high quality, high price" doctrine -- when it
introduced its new PCs at bargain prices in eight Chinese
cities. Peter Shen, China division president of IBM PC, said that
these IBM computers, based on Pentium 75 word processors, will be
priced lower than rival products made by Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
Driven by increasing pressure from foreign and Chinese
competitors, Hewlett-Packard, which took the lead when it
established a joint venture in China 10 years ago, announced it
will raise the number of its service centers to 60. The additional
centers will cover service needs in nearly 35 cities.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said that all of the global PC makers had
established themselves in China by the end of 1995, and the market
will see more rigorous competition as long as China's PC business
maintains its high growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Also, the widespread use of Intel processors and chip boards
closes technical gaps between different PC brands.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Teachers' Working Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Teachers Union (ZITU)
today said Zimbabwe had some of the lowest paid and poorest
working conditions for its teachers in Africa, contrary to a
report from an international education forum.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a recent statement by the International
Consultative Forum for Education for All, ZITU National President
Felix Mafa said it was not a secret that Zimbabwe's education
system had deteriorated to the lowest ebb.
</P>
<P>
The forum, set up in 1990 in Thailand as a watchdog to promote
and monitor progress towards attaining the goal of "education for
all", had said Zimbabwe was one of the few developing countries
that had managed to improve working conditions for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that unlike other developing countries
with economic problems, Zimbabwe had managed to increase the
number of teachers employed and also raise their salaries.
</P>
<P>
"ZITU and the entire teaching fraternity are not amused by the
International Consultative Forum for Education for All statement
that teachers' working conditions in Zimbabwe are second to none
in some parts of Africa, and that information is upside-down and
misleading," said Mafa.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the problems being faced by teachers in
Zimbabwe were the teacher-pupil ratio and acute shortage of
classrooms particularly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The education system and working conditions of teachers had
deteriorated drastically in Zimbabwe, like in other developing
countries implementing economic reforms, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Implement Rules on Recruiting Chinese Employees by Foreign Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Municipal government's
regulation for foreign (overseas) ventures' hiring of Chinese
employees goes into effect June 15.
</P>
<P>
The local regulation is aimed at protecting the legitimate
rights and interests of Beijing offices of overseas ventures and
their Chinese employees.
</P>
<P>
The regulation has 24 articles which require the foreign
agencies to entrust the city's foreign affairs service units to
recruit Chinese employees and ban the invitation of Chinese
employees through other invalid units and individuals, according
to an official with the Beijing Foreign Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
Beijing municipal government approved five Beijing companies as
valid units for recommending Chinese citizens to work for foreign
agencies.
</P>
<P>
They include the Beijing Service Company for Foreign Ventures,
the China International Human Resources Development, the China
International Enterprise Cooperation Company, the China International
Intelligence and Technology Cooperation Company and the China Sida
International Economic and Technological Cooperation Company.
</P>
<P>
The regulation says foreign agencies are required to sign labor
contracts with their Chinese employees and pay social insurance
fees for them.
</P>
<P>
The foreign agencies are also asked to apply for employees
certificates for their employees.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened to the outside world in the late 1970s, more
overseas ventures have opened permanent offices in the capital.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, overseas ventures from over 86 countries and
regions had opened 5,047 agencies in Beijing and hired more than
15,000 Chinese employees.
</P>
<P>
However, some foreign agencies did not employ Chinese staff
through proper channels which has caused losses to the foreign
ventures, and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese
employees also could not be guaranteed.

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China's largest bank, the

country's cash-strapped state-owned industries and lean especially
more towards large and medium-sized enterprises, a senior official

leaning more towards the infrastructural sectors of power, post
and telecommunications, and transportation," the official said of
the bank's loan priorities in the future.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Steps to Curb Teen Pregnancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday urged crackdowns on statutory rape while meeting with the
authors of a report on teenage pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Saying government alone cannot do the job, Clinton called for
greater efforts by federal and state lawmakers and by law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad fact that half of all the underage mothers in this
country were made pregnant by a man who was in his 20s or even
older -- someone who has no business taking advantage of an
underage girl," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Statutory rape is still a crime in this country. The young
women are victims," Clinton said. "Yet these laws are almost
never enforced, even in the most egregious of circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke during a White House briefing to publicize the
release of a report by the Robin Hood Foundation of New York that
found teenagers who have babies cost U.S. taxpayers 6.9 billion
dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
The children of such young mothers also are far more likely to
have health problems, do poorly in school and suffer abuse and
neglect, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the White House briefing, Clinton also said that the
Department of Health and Human Service would release a five-point
set of guidelines for local communities to develop programs to
reduce rates of teenage pregnancy, and announced that 30 million
dollars in proposed federal funding would be reserved for programs
that follow them.
</P>
<P>
The recommended guidelines consist of promoting parental and
adult involvement, sexual abstinence, strategies to help teens
prepare for the future, community involvement and long-term
commitment.

JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today said that his government's macro-economic
strategy has established the foundation for speeding up the
implementation of the reconstruction and development program.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will serve as government's basic economic policy
until the next century, said the president in a statement issued
in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's long-awaited macro-economic policy framework,
entitled "Growth, Employment and Redistribution", was unveiled on
Friday morning by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.
</P>
<P>
The framework, drafted by the Department of Finance, is the
government's final say on where economic policy is heading.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the government does not expect everyone to agree
with everything contained in its macro-economic strategy and
there are instances where people will have to make minimal
sacrifices for the common good and greater social benefit.
</P>
<P>
He also said the rapid economic growth envisaged by the
framework is critical to address, with even better results, the
poverty afflicting millions of South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is convinced that by creating the
necessary conditions for the rapid implementation of
socio-economic program, and the environment for increased private
and public investment, the strategy will redound to the benefit
of society as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Eight Cities in Liaoning to Invite Outside Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Eight cities in northeast China,
one of the country's oldest industrial bases, will jointly invite
overseas investment from June 29 to July 3 in Shenzhen, China's
first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) located in south China's
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province and Anshan, Fushun,
Benxi, Dandong, Yingkou, Liaoyang, and Tieling cities from the
central area of the province, formed an economic zone within the
city group. The move was designed to attract more investors to
this key industrial base, which produces coal, steel, electricity,
oil, and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the eight cities have jointly invited
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
"A group of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are
centralized in the city group," said Sun Jianxiang, vice-mayor of
Shenyang here today, adding that there are 180,000 enterprises in
the city group, which is considered to be the country's primary
base of raw materials and heavy-duty industry.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the eight cities will focus on promoting
renovation of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The city group would bring to Shenzhen 459 projects that cover
fields of industry, agriculture, business, science and technology,
energy, transportation and city infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Property rights owned by some of these enterprises will be sold
to re-organize assets.
</P>
<P>
The eight cities will lease the right to use state-owned land
for overall development. Overseas investors will be invited to
take part in construction of city infrastructure and housing.
</P>
<P>
The cities will also make public each other's comprehensive
plans on development zones and their preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors would also be invited to enter the
consumption market of central Liaoning and the northeastern part
of China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Anti-government Group Surrenders After 81-Day FBI Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- An anti-government group,
called Freemen, in a Montana ranch surrendered to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Thursday after their compound was
encircled by FBI agents for 81 days.
</P>
<P>
The 16 members of the group remaining in the compound in rural
eastern Montana were carried by two vans and one sedan to a
church, from which they will be sent to Billings, about 175 miles
(280 kilometers) southwest of the ranch.
</P>
<P>
In Billings, 12 of the extremist group members will face
criminal charges, including circulating millions of dollars in
bogus checks and threatening to kill a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Sherry Scheel Matteucci and FBI Agent Thomas T.
Kubic announced that all the members of the group still on the
property had voluntarily turned themselves over to authorities
without incident.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton Thursday night hailed the peaceful
solution of the standoff and Attorney General Janet Reno said that
"from the first day of the standoff in Montana, the Justice
Department and the FBI have worked with steadfast determination to
reach today's result."
</P>
<P>
The standoff began March 25, but FBI agents have since stayed
well away from the compound patiently to wait for a peaceful
solution and avoid another bloodshed of Waco or Ruby Ridge.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the 51-day standoff at Waco, Texas, ended in a fire
that killed more than 80 cult members. In 1992, white separatist
Randy Weaver held federal agents at bay at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, for
11 days in a siege that began with the killing of his son and a
federal marshal. Weaver's wife also was killed during the
standoff.
</P>
<P>
Since the Montana standoff, negotiators have tried to talk the
Freemen out, and the FBI cut off the compound's power on June 3 to
give the group some pressure. Some people in the compound have
left there earlier in batches.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, two group members lowered the upside-down
U.S. flag, a traditional sign of distress, on "sentry hill," their
outpost on a hilltop overlooking the compound and replaced it with
a Confederate battle flag. They then apparently abandoned the
sentry post.
</P>
<P>
The Freemen at the ranch, named as Justus Township, include
hard-luck farmers and some fast-talkers hawking cure-alls for
financial woes. They spread pseudo-legalistic documents
purportedly showing that they can renounce governmental authority,
start their own government and issue their own checks.
</P>
<P>
They formed their own "courts," appointed themselves officers
and declared elected officials criminals subject to arrest and
execution.

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China is regulating its
flourishing sex shops by issuing special business certificates to
them.
</P>
<P>
The China Sexology Association recently issued certificates of
qualification to 20 shops that specialize in contraceptives and
products relating to sexual hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The association, founded in Beijing in May 1994, is under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Health and composed of
dozens of the country's sexology scholars and experts.
</P>
<P>
With tighter regulations, the association aims to advocate
advanced sex ideology and behaviors and prevent such shops from
selling pornographic items.
</P>
<P>
It will also serve to play an important role in sexual
healthcare and family planning, experts said.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has 517 sex shops and 3,778 shops that offer
over-the-counter sexual hygiene products. Gross sales of these
products reached 1.1 billion yuan (about 132.5 million US dollars)
last year.

<HEADLINE> Man Selling Endangered Species Jailed in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A court in Hong Kong today
sentenced a 47-year-old man to 15 months' imprisonment for selling
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
This is the first immediate prison term handed down to a
defendant convicted under the Animals and Plants Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD)
said since the hefty increase in penalties under the ordinance
became effective early last year, the courts had been delivering
much heavier penalties on offenders lately.
</P>
<P>
AFD field officers raided a shop in Mong Kok at the end of last
year, seizing two Asiatic black bear paws, three live giant
salamanders and two pangolin carcasses. Both Asiatic black bear
and giant salamander are classified as highly endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The defendant pleaded not guilty this morning to the offense
but was convicted by North Kowloon Magistracy after a trial.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, endangered species include live
specimens, their parts derivatives and medicines containing or
claiming to contain tiger or rhino ingredients.
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, he said, any person found guilty of
possessing, importing or exporting highly endangered species for
commercial purpose is liable to a maximum fine of 5 million HK
dollars (645,000 US dollars) and two years' imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> HK Continues to Be Business-Friendly Place: Indian Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to be a
very business-friendly place, perhaps the most convenient place in
Asia to do business from, said Raj Sital, chairman of the Indian
Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua this week, Sital said
that the chamber's perception is that Hong Kong will gain in
importance as an international business services and financial
center in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"As regards Indian businessmen, most of us look upon Hong Kong
as our home and we hope to continue to contribute to and share in
Hong Kong's prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
India has had a long history of trade relations with southern
China going back to more than a century and a half, he
said. During the many years that followed there was a gradual
increase in the strength of the Indian community's presence in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Sital was born and raised in Hong Kong. His father came to Hong
Kong in 1952 and since then the family has been doing
international trade businesses here.
</P>
<P>
"We are rooted in Hong Kong very deeply and we consider
ourselves as Hong Kong people," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present the Indian community in Hong Kong has a population
of about 22,000, and the number of companies owned or run by
ethnic Indians in Hong Kong is well over 2,000, most of which are
involved in international trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Indian traders account for around 10
percent of Hong Kong's external trade.
</P>
<P>
"We are one of the pioneers who have introduced Hong Kong and
Chinese products into the developing world such as the Middle East
and Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian business community has not only been active in
trade but also has contributed to the enrichment of life in Hong
Kong in all fields," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the Hong Kong University was the result
of the determined efforts and substantial contribution by an
Indian businessman; business enterprises like the Star Ferry, a
vital transport facility across the Victoria Harbor, were
pioneered by Indian businessmen; and an Indian was among the
founder-directors of the HongkongBank," he said.
</P>
<P>
For businessmen, Hong Kong offers a lot of advantages, he
said. It has a low tax level, minimal governmental interference in
the private sector, excellent communication and infrastructural
support and, above all, the availability of talented manpower.
</P>
<P>
Indian businessmen are increasingly aware of the advantages
that Hong Kong offers. Five years ago there were very few
companies from India, but now many large Indian companies have set
up representative offices in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, Sital
said that there should not be too much change in the way that the
community does business in Hong Kong. "You can see that the number
of Indians in Hong Kong has been very steady, because they know
that political and economic stability will continue," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese chain store giant,
Yaohan International Group, is to switch its world-business
headquarters to Shanghai from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The group has vowed to have a bigger share of the China market.
</P>
<P>
Kazuo Wada, the group's chairman, said that Yaohan has chosen
Shanghai, China's largest commercial center, to play host to its
headquarters in order to explore the Chinese market and its global
business.
</P>
<P>
According to Wada, China will be influential in the 21st
century. With the decision the group will have more space for
development when it explores the vast China market.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the group has put the China market top of its
agenda for the forthcoming century and plans to run, in a
joint-venture form, 1,000 chain supermarkets in cities surrounding
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Managers in the 1,000 chain supermarkets will be Chinese and a
training course will be set up in Shanghai within this year.
</P>
<P>
The group is also preparing to invest 300 million US dollars in
the next five years on producing over 100 kinds of Yaohan-branded
food, daily necessities and clothing in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
So far the group has set up more than 480 branches and
wholesale centers in 16 countries and regions, including Japan,
the US, Britain, Canada and Hong Kong, and cherished a business
income of 4.5 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It started to run business in China in 1992 and operates 23
chain stores and nine fast food stores in Shanghai and its
neighbors. Last year its business income in China reached 300
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in South Korea Up a Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in South
Korea rose 26 percent to 961 million U.S. dollars in the first
five months of this year boosted by an almost 100 percent rise in
investment from Europe to 359 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Capital inflow from the the United States rose a third to 307
million dollars, but investment from Japan fell by half to 113
million dollars, statistics from the Finance and Economy Ministry
show.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in foreign investment was attributed to the
government's support for foreign investment in high-tech
industries and the easing of regulations in almost all sectors,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector claimed the lion's share of investment
with 507 million dollars, up 47.8 percent in the first five months
of 1996 over the same period in 1995, while the non-manufacturing
sector saw an nine percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in South Korea has recovered
sharply over the last three years after a slump from 1.3 billion
to 890 million dollars in 1992. Last year, FDI soared 48 percent
to 1.94 billion dollars, up from 1.31 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of May this year, total foreign direct investment
in South Korea had reached 15.36 billion dollars.

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China's police cracked a dozen
major drug smuggling cases in April and confiscated nearly a ton
of heroin in the process, a record high for a single month since
1949, according to a narcotics control official.
</P>
<P>
Zhuo Feng, deputy secretary-general of the National Narcotics
Control Commission, made the remark this morning at an
anti-narcotics conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the national police force solved 11,832 drug cases

<P>
From these drug busts, police seized a total of 575 kg of
heroin and 234 kg of opium, increases of 73 percent and 10
percent, respectively, over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhuo noted that although police have scored successes in the
local fight against narcotics, the current drug problem is still
serious and difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
The government is scheduled to strike hard against illicit drug
use and improve Chinese citizens' sense of anti-narcotics laws,
Zhuo said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's New Budget Growth Oriented: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Minister of State for
Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin today described the government's new
budget for the fiscal year 1996-97 as growth oriented.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Shahabuddin said
that the new budget would help reduce inflationary pressure,
encourage industrial sector, improve revenue collection, boost
exports and develop social sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the budget sought to enhance the economic
stability through structural adjustment as the government planned
to trim the fiscal deficit to 4 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) from 5 percent of GDP during the current financial
year.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating his points, Shahabuddin said that a fiscal deficit
of 5 percent would mean an additional debt of 125 billion rupees
(3.57 billion US dollars) while 4 percent would indicate 100
billion rupees (2.86 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the budget presented Thursday, the government
allocated 44 billion rupees (1.26 billion dollars) for public
sector development program and 62 billion rupees (1.77 billion
dollars) for the Social Action Program.
</P>
<P>
Shahabuddin said that the budget reaffirmed the strong
commitment of the current government led by Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto to improve the quality of life of the people through rapid
development in industrial and social sectors.
</P>
<P>
V.A. Jaferay, advisor to the prime minister on the economics,
said at the press conference that the budget is growth-oriented as
no tax has been imposed on fertilizers, food items, agriculture
produce, machinery and some raw material.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, he stressed that no industry in the
country was closed.
</P>
<P>
However, due to administrative or other reasons, some
industries were not operating for which the government had taken
measures to facilitate them by restructuring their loans, he
added.

was told recently.
</P>
<P>
And the growing problem of dog biting may dampen enthusiasm
among the well-off for owning a dog.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the numbers of people who were bitten by
rabid dogs or caught rabies surged by 8.88 percent and 81.3
percent respectively in the first four months of this year,
compared with the figures in the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Although the municipal government has set up a system of
registration and quarantine certificates, 100,000 dogs have been
found without certificates.
</P>
<P>
A major campaign will be carried out by the municipal
government to strengthen the work in dog-raising, pet shops and
pet hospitals and tighten the controls on un-registered dogs in
downtown areas as well as countryside.

<HEADLINE> Inflation: Biggest Problem in Zimbabwe's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa has said inflation remained the biggest problem
in Zimbabwe's economy and the private sector should make
suggestions on ways to tackle it.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce Congress on Thursday at Victoria Falls town in north
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said fiscal and monetary policies adopted by the government
had failed to stem inflation, now estimated at around 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Zimbabwean economy as overheated, Murerwa said
it had failed to create meaningful wealth, jobs and perpetuated
poverty for the common people.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that monthly wages can no longer, on average,
adequately feed, clothe and give shelter to an average family for
that period of time.
</P>
<P>
"This is the reality on the ground and must be addressed
quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, many remained convinced that the problem is the
perceived profligacy of the government and no suggestions came
from the floor on other ways of tackling the problems despite the
appeals by Murerwa.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Joint Venture Goes Into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German joint venture to
produce engine management systems went into operation today in
Changchun, the capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Costing a total investment of 20 million US dollars, the
Siemens Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd., was jointly established
in 1995 by the Automotive Systems Group of Siemens AG and the
Changchun North Electronics Factory. Siemens funded 70 percent of
the investment.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture produces engine management systems and
supplies necessary production expertise for China.
</P>
<P>
It now produces 4,000 electronic control units (ECU) every
month. The ECU's production capacity is expected to rise to 10,000
monthly by the end of this year, and to 20,000 during the next two
years. In the foreseeable future, all ECUs will be exported to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture plans to add new products during the next few
years, such as airbag electronic systems and automobile body
electronic systems.
</P>
<P>
To help China develop its automobile industry, the Siemens
Automotive Systems Group funded another 14 million US dollars last
year to form a second joint venture in Shanghai, which produces
small electric motors. It is called Siemens Automotive Electric
Motor Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The Siemens Automotive Systems Group is expected to earn nearly
100 million US dollars in China in annual sales by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The group said it will help China complete the transition from
carburetor to fuel injection technology within a short period of
time.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets GM President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said China
and the United States should work together to eliminate
disturbances in order to promote the smooth development of trade
and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said this during a meeting here this afternoon with John
Smith Jr., president of U.S General Motors Corporation (GM).
</P>
<P>
Li said the U.S is abundant in capital and advanced in
technology, while China is the world's largest developing country
and has found a successful road to development -- a path which has
led to a remarkable economic growth rate that is expected to
continue in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, China and the U.S complement each
other economically, taking market, capital and technology into
consideration, and should therefore become partners. However, he
noted, due to certain political problems, it is often difficult
for them to reach the goal.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation for Smith's advocacy that China
should unconditionally be given a permanent Most Favored Nation
status, saying that this "would be beneficial to both sides."
</P>
<P>
Smith said China has sustained a rapid economic growth for the
past ten years and has effectively kept inflation under control,
and called this "the greatest miracle of the current world".
</P>
<P>
According to the GM head, China, with its large market and
well-educated labor force, is a cooperative partner. "We wish to
further enhance our cooperation with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Motors is one of the world's largest automobile
companies. Since 1992, it has set up 10 joint ventures in
China.

<HEADLINE> Castro Blasts West at UN Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
today lashed out at the West which he said have destroyed the
world's environment and now shows little interest in improving
human settlements.
</P>
<P>
Castro arrived here on Thursday with a last minute decision to
address the high-level segment of the Second U.N. Conference on
Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader said centuries of colonialism, slavery,
economic exploitation and the so-called consumption societies have
created a unfair world.
</P>
<P>
"Some had it all, others had nothing," Castro told today's
session.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have almost destroyed the planet and poisoned the
air, the seas, the rivers and the soils are presently showing
little concern over saving mankind," Castro pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He was laudly applaused when questioning "How many heads of
state and government from the developed countries are attending
this meeting today ?"
</P>
<P>
Developed countries, such as the United States, Britain,
France, Germany have sent no officials to the U.N. conference
higher than their ministers in charge of housing.
</P>
<P>
"There is much talks today about global economy and
technological progress," the Cuban leader continued. "But, what
can be the use of all that if it does not solve man's problems,
if the rich countries are richer and the poor are poorer?"
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to the U.S. embargo against Cuba, Castro
declared that human beings are entitled to live and to do so with
honor, and "unjust and criminal economic blockades" should not be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
"We are the world and the world does not yield to masters nor
to suicidal policies; the world does not accept that a minority
of selfish, insane and irresponsible people lead it to
annihilation," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
In a rare reaction during the two-week meetings, the audience
in the end greeted Castro with more than one minute of warm
applause.
</P>
<P>
President Castro has become the focus of attention since he
arrived in Istanbul. He was greeted by some 300 local people
waving red carnations and posters with his portrait.
</P>
<P>
But the representative for the United States, its Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros, was quoted as saying "in Mr. Castro's
Cuba, for too many people, his housing policy has meant a prison
cell because they disagreed with him".

<P>
LUANDA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Angola's former rebel movement
UNITA destroyed more than 2,000 mines in Quibala, Kwanza-Sul
Province, on Thursday, the local "Angola Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the former rebel group has
mass-distroyed its mines in the past week. On Wednesday, UNITA
also ignited 1,000 mines in central Bei Province.
</P>
<P>
Philip Sibanda, chief of the United Nations peacekeeping
troops based in Angola, told the mines destruction ceremony that
the demining process, which started in May, "is another important
milestone in the Angolan peace process".
</P>
<P>
A large number of mines were buried during Angola's nearly
30-year-long anticolonial and civil wars. The mines have hindered
the process of rehabilitation of production and roads and become
a big block in the country's peace process.

<HEADLINE> HK Objects to New US Import Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong government spokesman
said here today that the new measures to be taken by the US
government will be disruptive to Hong Kong's trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, on June 13, the US Customs
announced its decision to impose such import measures with effect
from June 17 on five types of products from Hong Kong, including
skirts, suits, nightwear, underwear and dresses.
</P>
<P>
Under the new US requirements, importers of these products from
Hong Kong are required to submit, for each consignment,
declarations completed and signed by all manufacturers and
subcontractors involved in the production of the consignment.
</P>
<P>
The products need also to certify that the declarations are
accurate and to pay higher entry bonds.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "We are disappointed that despite the
established cooperative relationship between the two governments
in our common efforts against illegal transshipment, the US
government should impose such discriminatory measures against Hong
Kong without any prior consultations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Secretary for Trade and Industry Denise
Yue today wrote to the United States government to raise
objections to the US unilateral decision to impose additional
import document requirements on a number of textiles and clothing
products from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Yue requests the United States to defer the
implementation of these measures and to start early consultations
with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong's export of the five specific types of
products to the United States amounted to 3.5 billion HK dollars
(452 million US dollars), representing 9.6 percent of its total
textiles and clothing exports to the US, or about four percent of
its total textiles and clothing exports.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready for Closer Ties With NATO: Grachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready for deeper and
closer relations with NATO, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev
said today after talks with the western military alliance's 16
defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
The "16 plus 1" meeting was the second high level contact
between NATO and Russia this month -- Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov met NATO ministers in Germany last week.
</P>
<P>
Grachev told reporters that "from our meeting, I have come to
the conclusion that there was aspiration for deeper and closer
relations between Russia and NATO, and Russia is ready for that."
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, secretary general of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization), said that the meeting was "very friendly, positive
and constructive."
</P>
<P>
"We have a new NATO, we have a new Russia, we need new
relations and we have one aim which is the stability and security
of the (European) continent and the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still deep differences between the two sides
over NATO's plans to expand into central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes the plan, which seeks to bring many of
Moscow's former communist allies into the alliance's fold. And
Grachev said ahead of today's meeting that Russia's objections to
the idea of NATO troops and weapons moving closer to its borders
have not changed.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the meeting has been welcomed by NATO diplomatic
circles, raising hopes that Moscow may be prepared to show more
flexibility in its dealings with the military body.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that it is taking place two days before the
presidential elections in Russia no doubt means that Boris Yeltsin
wants to show the public his ability to have a dialogue with
NATO," an alliance official said.

<HEADLINE> Reconstruction Remains Policy Anchor, Says Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The broader framework of the
Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) remained the
policy anchor on which all government programmes had been and
would continue to be based, South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
In a forework to Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's delivery of
the government's macro-economic policy framework in the National
Assembly, Mbeki said the RDP was not a conglomeration of
particular projects, but rather an integrated and sustainable
vision for creating post-apartheid society.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the public's impatience for the government to
pronounce itself on many economic questions, Mbeki said the
framework had sought to make certain that what is said would be
scientifically substantiated, based on concrete reality and
therefore realisable.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government had "within the confines of
reason and our natioal capabilities" chosen to make haste slowly
rather than hasten to earn ephemeral accolades.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited macro-economic policy framework, presented to
the National Assembly by Manuel on Friday, was the government's
final say on where economic policy was heading.
</P>
<P>
The framework, entitled "growth, employment and
redistribution", was drawn up by the Department of Finance.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Reserves Hit 100 Billion Dollar Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total official
reserves topped the 100 billion US dollars mark for the first time
in April this year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said
today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the reserves were up 12 percent in April from a
year ago. But experts here estimated that Singapore's unofficial
foreign reserves, which include the funds handled by the
Government Investment Corporation, have already crossed the 200
billion dollars mark.
</P>
<P>
According to a local television report, economists said the
rise in Singapore's foreign reserves reflected the MAS' buying of
US dollars although the country wants a strong Singapore dollar to
combat imported inflation.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- There was sufficient food
grown for Tanzanians last year and there are strong signs that
same food situation can be expected this year despite problems in
the supply of fertilizers and improved seeds at farm level.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed in the latest Tanzania Food Security Bulletin

self-sufficient except for wheat whose gap will have to be filled
by commercial imports of about 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The total cereal production is tentatively forecast at
4,436,000 tons, about 23 percent above last year's, while maize,
the major staple, is forecast to reach 2,630,000 tons, 2.3 percent

<HEADLINE> Macao Civil Servants to Have Higher Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Macao Government has decided to
increase the salary of its civil servants by 6.82 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of pay increase has been submitted for discussion
at the Macao Legislative Assembly (LA), and is expected to become
effective from July 1.
</P>
<P>
After the increase, the starting point of salary of 4,400
Patacas (about 556.9 U.S. dollars) will be raised to 4,700 Patacas
(about 595 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government says that the salary rise is a result of high
inflation rate, which hits 7.7 percent in April. Previously,
organizations of civil servants have complained that the increase is
too low.
</P>
<P>
According to current laws, the salary of Macao governor,
undersecretaries of the government, chairman (chairwoman) and
members of the LA, and other high officials will also be raised
along with the salary rise of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Macao Civil Servants perhaps enjoy one of the world's highest
salary. The average salary of civil servants reached 11,188 Patacas
(about 1,416.2 US dollars) in 1994 and the salary still rise each
year.

<HEADLINE> Summer Grain to See Good Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A good harvest for China's summer
grain is in sight if there are no abnormal weather changes in the
coming days, according to an official with the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He forecasts that the summer grain output will be same as last
year, or up a little, adding that the exact output still depends
on the weather conditions in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
China produced 106.55 billion kilograms of summer grain last
year.
</P>
<P>
The southern parts of China have finished reaping, while the
northern parts is are fully occupied with gathering in crops.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that wheat suffered lodging or began to
sprout in some parts of the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze river, which experienced cloudy and drizzly days over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Bureau of Meteorology, North China will
enjoy sunny and cloudy days during June 12-16, which will be good
for harvest.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that a dry-hot wind did not occur this
year, which otherwise would have caused shrivelled wheat heads.
</P>
<P>
"The drought and low temperatures in the early days did not
cause a big loss to wheat growth, either," the official added.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the output of oil-bearing crops is likely to be
the second highest in history but that of cotton will somewhat
decrease.
</P>
<P>
In most years summer grain accounts for some 20 percent of the
year's total.
</P>
<P>
China plans to produce 465 million tons of grain this year, the
same as last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou Customs Office has
strengthened its campaign against illegal publications,
confiscating more than 130,000 illegal audio and video publishing
materials since last November.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that criminals usually smuggle the illegal
publications into the country by land or maritime transportation,
through the mail, or by secretly carrying the materials on
themselves, the Guangzhou Custom Office, located in the capital city
of south China's Guangdong Province, has drafted new regulations
for protecting intellectual property rights, and held training
classes and tests for all the custom's officers. Modern
examination facilities have been also built to improve the
efficiency of the examinations.
</P>
<P>
Priority goes to the examination of small-sized shipments and
mail. The Lianhuashan Customs Office captured 35,000 pirated LDs
and VCDs in one mission, Dachan custom office intercepted 19,000
VCDs in April, and the Baiyun Airport, the city's largest airport,
captured more than 200 sets of LD.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Office has also cooperated closely with the local
copyright bureau to learn the latest developments in overseas'
copyrights and to improve the task of identification.
</P>
<P>
Groups have been formed to conduct surveys on illegal
publications both inside and outside the border, and to analyze
the smuggling channels.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned have expressed their desire to strengthen
cooperation with the overseas' copyright organizations to get the
lastest information on intellectual property rights, in order to
effectively crack down on illegal publications and protect the
entry of legal audio and video products.

the alternatives for local economic development to help promote
the economic growth and create more job opportunities, the Macao
Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the founding members are local young entrepreneurs and
businessmen, who said they would do their best to revive Macao's
economy, a top executive of the association said at the inaugural
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Macao's economy experienced its fastest growth in the 1980s,
resulting in the forming of four pillar industries -- tourism and
entertainment, export and processing, finance and real estate.
</P>
<P>
The growth has been slowing down since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the new association said they were optimistic
about Macao's growth potentials with the good cooperation between
China and Portugal and the improving infrastructure thanks to the
new international airport.
</P>
<P>
They said the association would offer policy proposals and help
 to potential investors from neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
Vitor Pessoa, undersecretary for Economic Coordination of the
Macao government, said the new association has added more vigor to
 Macao and would help to boost its development.

<HEADLINE> Blue Flags Fly Over Cyprus Beaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Most of Cyprus beaches, which
attract tens of thousands of foreign tourists, have received
their Blue Flags denoting the cleanliness and comprehensive
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Eleven out of 17 beaches in Cyprus were among 1,558 beaches
in 18 countries all over Europe to be honored with the
European Union's Blue Flag, which certifies they are clean,
safe, user friendly, and fulfil environmental guidelines, according
to Cyprus Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
Michalis Lerides, general director of the Cyprus Marine
Environment Protection Association, was quoted as saying that
the Blue Flag is awarded to beaches that fulfil a total of
26 criteria in four main sectors and is valid for one year.
</P>
<P>
Those sectors are quality of water, organization and correct
management, safety of the public and environmental measures.
This is Cyprus' first bid for inclusion in the certification
and all 11 applications were granted with the flag.
</P>
<P>
Lerides said the total number of municipalities and
communities who applied were 17, but his association cut six
of them because they were not ready and did not fulfil all
the criteria. "Hopefully those six will be ready by next
year," he added.
</P>
<P>
The list of criteria included the absence of industrial or
sewage-related discharges in the water, the absence of visible
or otherwise pollution, the presence of a life guard in
populated beaches, the existence of telephones, toilets, showers,
first aid stations information stations and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
Lerides said that two European representatives visited the
island to verify the information that was sent to them and they
are expected to conduct surprise visits in the future.
</P>
<P>
"If beaches fail to keep up with certain standards, they
will lose the flag and will then have to apply again," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the certification for Cyprus,
Lerides said "tourists are more and more concerned with
environmental issues nowadays and the quality of the beaches
they will spend their vacation on."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, this East Mediterranean island attracted more than
2.1 million foreign tourists, earning the country about 1.7
billion U.S. dollars.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (xinhua) -- Tanzania's economy
maintained a modest growth last year at 3.9 percent with
transport, communication and agricultural sectors leading others
in their contribution to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the economy grew at three percent.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "Gurdian" qouted Deputy Minister for Finance
Kilontsi Mporogomyi as saying today that all sectors of the
economy, except construction, power and water, recorded positive
growth in 1955.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister made the statements while addressing at
the opening meeting of a four-day seminar on "Securities market
development" beginning from June 4, in Arusha, northen Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mporogomyi said the communication and transport sector grew by 9.3
percent, while agriculture recorded an encouraging 7 percent
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He said the mining sector registered an impressive performance
last year, following the on-going rehabilitation of the
Williamson Diamond Limited (WDL) in Shinyanga and the growing
interest of foreign investors in the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the rate of inflation
declined from 37 percent in December 1994, to 27 percent as of
December 1995. And inflation dropped to 25 in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The deceleration in inflation can be attributed to good supply
of food and the slowdown in money supply following the on-going
tight control of government expenditure and credit squeeze, the
paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government has proposed to
raise the salary of its civil servants by 6.82 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, submitted to the Macao Legislative Assembly (LA),
is expected to become effective on July 1 if approved.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the salary floor will be raised from 4,400
patacas a month (about 556.9 US dollars) to 4,700 patacas (about
595 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government said the pay rise was necessitated by a high
inflation rate, which hit 7.7 percent in April and caused
complaints among local organizations of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The salary of the Macao governor, undersecretaries of the
government, chairman (chairwoman) and members of the LA, and other
high officials will also be raised under the current law.
</P>
<P>
Macao's civil servants probably enjoy one of the world's

dollars) in 1994 and on the rise every year.

<HEADLINE> Old Earthquake 1604 Leaves Its Mark in Hainan Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake that hit China in
1604 has left its mark - a mini mountain of marine shells.
</P>
<P>
The rarely seen ancient marine shell heap has been discovered
by scientists in Luodou Farm of Wenchang City in South China's
Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Spotted by a group of scientists from Hainan and Guangdong
provinces who were carrying out seismological research in the
area, the shell hill is located on a piece of land three
kilometers from the shoreline in northeast Hainan, which was the
epicenter of a major earthquake in 1605.
</P>
<P>
The shell hill is about nine meters high, 30 meters wide and 50
meters long. The shells are piled up in good order. The upper part
of the hill is losely arranged while the lower part is cemented.
</P>
<P>
According to a research fellow with the group, such large-scale
ancient shell deposits are rarely seen in China's southeast
coastal areas and very seldom seen in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies suggest that the shell heap is possibly
sub-marine deposits brought up by the crustal movements of the
earthquake of 7.5 magnitude in 1605 at that place.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the discovery is of great importance to the
study of ancient oceans, geography, temperature, geological
structure and earthquakes.

calls for raising a 700 billion yen fund with money from the
financial industry so that investment returns from the pooled
money will be funneled to the national coffers.
</P>
<P>
In the face of strong criticism of the scheme, the government
is seeking additional contributions from the founder banks and
other creditor institutions to help ease taxpayers' burden in the
scheme.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Development Zone Appealing to Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Fushan New and Hi-tech
Development Zone in Yantai City of east China's Shandong Province
has attracted an increasing number of overseas investors since it
was initiated just over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 projects launched by a dozen countries, including
the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have so
far settled in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The provincial-level development zone has already completed the
construction of infrastructure facilities to offer all the
necessary conditions for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Last month an ROK business group visited the zone and conducted
negotiations on 20 investment projects.
</P>
<P>
Construction is now under way on an ROK-funded cold-storage
container project, costing 20 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project will produce 4,000 such containers upon completion
in October.
</P>
<P>
Yu Dong, director of the development zone, said that a dozen
projects in such fields as biological medicine and new-type
building materials have been put into operation.
</P>
<P>
Construction on another dozen projects is under way.

<HEADLINE> German Benckiser Bubbles into China's last Detergent Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The bubble has finally burst on
China's soap and detergent's industry.
</P>
<P>
A German company has made a clean sweep by signing a joint
venture contract with the Power 28 (Group) Company, one of China's
biggest detergent producers.
</P>
<P>
Based in central Hubei Province, Power 28 has singed up with
Germany's Benckiser to create a joint venture, mainly producing
Power 28 products.
</P>
<P>
The move marked the knockdown of the last stronghold in China's
domestic detergent sector by foreign investors, indicating that by
now all of the country's detergent brands have gone into joint
ventures with overseas producers.
</P>
<P>
The German-controlled joint venture involves 28 million US
dollars in total investment. And Benckiser, with annual sales of
3.3 billion dollars, finally won the three-year-long marathon
talks, and was granted the right to use Power 28 trademark in the
venture for half a decade.
</P>
<P>
Power 28, which has a one billion yuan-worth's trademark that
is a household name among Chinese consumers, was the last to give
the OK to foreign investors among its colleagues.
</P>
<P>
This also triggered the "Waterloo" for China's national
detergents industry, with the entire sector now totally open to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the washing powder output of
China's foreign-funded ventures in detergent and cosmetics
industry accounted for 40 percent of the country's total, and the
figure will rise to 70 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Most of the overseas detergent giants have established joint
ventures in China, including the Japanese Kao, the Germany-based
Henkel Kgaa, and the British Unilever. The annual sales of these
three company's joint ventures in China have surpassed four
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said that foreign investment has contributed
to facelifting and upgrading China's detergent sector, bringing in
cash, management expertise and high-tech.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists also pointed to the fact that many
well-known Chinese brands have been overwhelmed, in the course of
allying with overseas firms.
</P>
<P>
"This brought to the agenda how to protect and develop national
industries, while continuing with an opening-up policy," an
industry expert observed.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources told Xinhua that most of the joint ventures
spend on average 100 to 200 million yuan in advertisements for
their products every year.
</P>
<P>
However Power 28, mired in debts and cash-starved, could only
afford one tenth of the budget, -- a common phenomenon in
state-owned detergent enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The detergent industry is not the only one in the country's
economic sectors, in which foreign investors have played an
increasingly significant role. The same applies to China's power,
automobile and electronics industries.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Mufti: Rise up Against Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian religious
leader has called on Palestinians to rise up against the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper "Jerusalem Post" quoted today Jerusalem's
mufti, an Islamic religious leader, Akram Sabri, as saying "We
must rise up against the occupation with all our might to achieve
what we want."
</P>
<P>
Sabri told a Friday prayers session at Al-Aksa Mosque in
Jerusalem that "it is forbidden for us to sit quietly, and it is
the obligation of all Moslems to stand by the Palestinians for
the sake of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
"The Likud has already promised to take Jerusalem off the
negotiating agenda, as if the city is only theirs," Sabri
said in his sermon, adding "for us there is really no difference
between the Likud and Labor. They are both heretics."
</P>
<P>
Sabri was appointed to his post two years ago by PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat to replace the Jordanian-appointed mufti of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army took over the eastern part of Jerusalem
from the Jordanian authorities during the 1967 War, and since
then Israel has declared the city as its "eternal and
undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jerusalem, a holy place for Jews as well as
for Moslems and Christians, has also been claimed by the
Palestinians as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Following the victory by right-wing Likud Chairman Binyamin
Netanyahu in the May 29 prime ministerial elections, Sabri
also said that he would not stand in the way of suicide
bombers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Palestinian newspaper published ealier
last week, he said that he had never issue a religious
ruling against carrying out suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Sabri's statements have raised concern among Israel officials,
and a senior security source said the statements and those
of other Palestinian officials contain threats of renewal of
Intifada, or Arab uprising.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police are reportedly considering summoning Sabri for
questioning, on grounds the sermon was inciting, and the
police spokesman confirmed that an investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert included
Sabri's office on a list he presented to the government for
close-down because of their links with the Palestinian National
Authority in the city.
</P>
<P>
Olmert, a Likud member, said their activity was forbidden
according to Israeli law and the Oslo peace accords between
Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Lovers Leap Couple Plan Wedding In The Clouds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- When Wang Yongli and Sheng Jun
marry their heads will really be in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
The reason for their sky-high elation? The happy couple will be
joining hands in matrimony as they parachute to earth from a
height of 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
Wang, the 33-year-old bridegroom, and Sheng, the 26-year-old
bride, are believed the first couple in Beijing to hold wedding
ceremony in the air.
</P>
<P>
Their special service in the sky is scheduled at 11:00 am,
tomorrow, over the Aviation Museum of Beijing in northern Beijing.
</P>
<P>
When they reach a height of 1000 meters the newly weds will
give each other a parting kiss - before their chutes ensure they
land with their feet firmly on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The couple, both world champion parachutists with the Beijing
parachute team, plan to jump out of plane at a height of 1,500 m,
accompanied by the best man and bridesmaids, played by their team
mates, and a cameraman will also join the lovers' leap to capture
the event on film.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our wedding ceremony will attract more attention to
our career, and we hope more people will love and support China's
parachuting activities," said the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
On the day of jubilation, various kinds of parachuting
performances will be held to congratulate the couple on their
"high-level" wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The bridegroom has won world champion titles three times in the
1980s, and the bride also has won domestic and international
championship titles, and she set a world record in individual
precision parachuting. They have parachuted more than 11,000 times
in their careers.

<HEADLINE> IFP Business Plans To Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
jJOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) is considering to launch business plans aimed at boosting
economic activities in the IFP-controlled Kwazulu/Natal local
communities, a local daily ''Business Day'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an election rally in Tongaat near Durban on
Thursday, IFP Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the proposed
business plans are aimed to promote the interests of small and
medium-sized businesses which are the ''real engine'' for local
growth and development.
</P>
<P>
He said the IFP is ''deeply wedded to the idea that government
exists to help and encourage business, not tie it up in red
tape''.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, sites should be secured for emerging small
businesses at low or deferred charges to give them the leg-up
required to flourish, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IFP election campaign Deputy Manager Anthony
Grinker said the business plans, which will be drafted by
councillors along with businessmen and stakeholders, will
identify the area's economic potential.
</P>
<P>
A campaign will therefore be initiated to woo domestic and
foreign investors with the aim of creating jobs, said Grinker.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Intervention May Be Staged From Uganda, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
kampala, june 14(Xinhua)-- Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire are
being considered as possible launching pads in the event of
Burundi intervention, reported the local newspaper the Monitor
today.
</P>
<P>
Growing concern that conflict in Burundi may degenerate into a
Rwanda-style genocide in 1994 is forcing the international
community to seriously consider the possibility of an armed
intervention to halt the carnage in the central african country,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A well placed government source here was quoted as saying that
the idea of using Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire as staging points
was recently mooted by United States' Assistant Secretary of
State in charge of African affairs Geroge Moose who visited
Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Moose held talks with a number of heads of state in the
region, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He then requested them for permission for the use of
"facilities in those countries in the event of a need for
international intervention in Burundi".
</P>
<P>
The latest information the paper gained indicates that the
possibility of using regional troops is being raised.
</P>
<P>
Though details are scanty, the paper said, talks between
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni in Mwanza, Tanzania on June 7, was follow-up on the
Moose talks.

<HEADLINE> Top Academy to Wipe Out Computer Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) has urged its staff aged under 45 to become
computer literate within three years.
</P>
<P>
A training program will soon be launched for all its
researchers and administrative officials, a senior executive said
today.
</P>
<P>
CASS has never been regarded as trendy in the global
information revolution, though it is the top seat for the
country's liberal and social sciences research.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of money and lack of modern sense among elder
scholars are blamed for creating a large number of computer
illiterates among its thousands of staff members.
</P>
<P>
But over recent years more scholars have visited overseas
universities and institutes, stunned by the popularity of computer
technology in the western world.
</P>
<P>
The new plan is aimed at training not only ordinary users but
also a group of system operators and other computer experts, who
will help to modernize the "ivory tower".
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2000, a network will be set up to connect its 40
institutes, centers and other agencies, and will even be linked to
the Internet. Foreign affairs sectors will be the first to enjoy
the achievement, according to the executive.
</P>
<P>
The academy's Party committee will also adopt a computer system
to improve its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The academy, established in 1955, has been regarded as a think
tank for the top decision-makers in recent years. The central
government has been increasing its investment in the academy year
after year.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear how the computer technology will affect the
academy's research subjects and contents. But some researchers
have said that one expected benefit would be learning more
suitable and useful things from abroad by taking advantage of
high-tech means.

<HEADLINE> ABN AMRO Bank Arranges Big-Sum Loans for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Netherlands-based ABN AMRO Bank
has enhanced its presence in China by signing a series of
agreements, including three loans worth 600 million US dollars, to
support the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Michael Drabbe, vice-chairman of the bank's Managing Board,
told a press conference here today that the ABN AMRO Bank had
signed an export credit agreement worth 60 million US dollars with
the Agricultural Bank of China, to facilitate the financing of
exports from the Netherlands under the Netherlands government's
mixed credit program.
</P>
<P>
The exports will include equipment and technology for the
processing of fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products. In
addition several projects are also under consideration for the
purchase of equipment for the development of China's dairy
industry, as well as equipment and technology for environmental
protection, the Vice Chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Kok said last year that his government had
reserved a total of 500 million Netherlands Guilder (300 million
US dollars) in subsidiaries for Chinese importers to purchase
advanced Dutch equipment, technology and service.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Drabbe, the bank has also arranged 269.7
million US dollars worth of syndicated loans for the China Yunnan
Airlines to buy three large airplanes overseas.
</P>
<P>
Of the loans, 90 million US dollars will be structured as a
long-term loan facility guaranteed by the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The ABN AMRO Bank has in the past couple of years actively
participated in the Chinese aviation market, and has successfully
closed several long-term finance transactions for airlines such as
China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines and China Xinhua
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
In another agreement with the Nanjing-based Hua Fei Color
Display Systems Company, the bank, together with the CCIC Finance,
has taken the lead mandate of arranging a 265 million US dollars
in a loan package to finance the joint venture's upgrade and
expansion of production facilities.
</P>
<P>
The package will comprise a 200 million US dollars syndicated
loan with a maturity of five years, for which the Standard
Chartered Bank and the Bank of America will act as co-arranger and
underwriter, as well as 65 million US dollars of domestic
short-term working capital facilities in both Renminbi and US
dollars, said Michael Drabbe.
</P>
<P>
ABN AMRO Bank has two branches in Shanghai and Shenzhen and
three representative offices in Beijing, Tianjin and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
It has so far arranged loans totalling more than 400 million US
dollars for over 70 Chinese financial institutions and projects
covering petrochemicals, metallurgy, aviation, trade,
telecommunications, building materials, textiles, hotels, mining
and high technologies.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's 20 largest banks, ABN AMRO Bank has launched
more than 2,000 affiliates in 66 countries and regions around the
world. Earlier this year, it was awarded the "Bank of the Year
1995" title by the prestigious International Finance Review in
London.

<HEADLINE> China Orders New Control on Book Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China is to tighten control on
book distribution agencies, according to a national meeting on
publishing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reached an agreement that the numbers of book
distribution and wholesale agencies should be decreased because of
misdeeds by some traders.
</P>
<P>
Crimes related to copyright piracy and pornographic
publications have been discovered, the meeting revealed, and some
sellers even traded book codes for illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
The Press and Publications Administration ordered that book
dealers should re-register at local administrative departments by
the end of this September.
</P>
<P>
New licenses will be given to book dealers who always obey
government publishing regulations. Meanwhile, a number of agencies
will face punishment.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the market economy has revived the book
market, putting 90,000 new titles a year on the shelves of China's
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of private book stores and stalls have also sprung up
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However the government is worried that the industry could
become a mere money-making machine rather than something serving
to improve the moral standards of people.

<HEADLINE> Hezbolllah Guerrillas Attack Israeli Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched an attack at
an Israeli position in the so-called "security zone" in
southern Lebanon this morning, and one guerrilla was killed in
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one group of its fighters carried out the
attack at the Israeli position at Tomat Niha, Jezzine, at
6:30 a.m. (03:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It said that the guerrillas used machine guns and anti-tank
rockets in the fighting, "causing real damages and casualties."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops fired back at the attackers, killing one
guerrilla identified as Hassan Shamas, the Islamic Resistance
noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed the hit-and-run attack by Hezbollah
guerrillas, but denied any casualty on its troops.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the attack, the Israeli forces bombarded
Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a maintain area often used
by Hezbollah guerrillas to launch attacks at the
850-square-kilometer buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in southern Lebanon said that more than 15
artillery shells fired by the Israeli forces at their position of
Abou Kamha hit Jebal Thahr and Burkat Jabour in two hours after
the morning attack.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also shelled the villages of Telal
Jabour, Ain Al-Tiney, Jebal Abu Rashid and Meidoun in Western
Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were caused in the bombardments, the security
sources stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also flew reconnaissance flights over
south Lebanese areas, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Five Israeli soldiers were killed and eight others wounded in
an Hezbollah attack on Monday, bringing to nine killed and 23
injured the number of the Israeli casualties in southern Lebanon
since a cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and the
Jewish state on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding does not ban Hezbollah guerrillas
from attacking the Israeli-policed buffer zone on condition
that the attack is not launched at or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army Chief Amnon Shehak has announced that the
Israeli forces "will operate against Hezbollah terrorist wherever
they are, including the villages."
</P>
<P>
He accused Hezbollah guerrillas of violating the April
understanding because "they came from a civilian area and
returned to a civilian area."

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is to invest 25 billion
yuan in fixed assets and technical renovations in
telecommunications sector over the next five years, bring a more
inviting market potential for the city's telecom facility business.
</P>
<P>
According to "People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily",
Shanghai's telephone capacity will reach 6.3 million lines by the
year 2000, compared with 3.4 million lines in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the capacity of mobile phones will climb from
230,000 channels to one million channels, and the number of pager
users will go up from 700,000 to one million.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, user interfaces of the Digital and Data Network (DDN)

4,500 to as many as 80,000, and the number of VAST stations will
hit 2,000 in the city.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the demand for SDH (Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy) will rocket, because of the large-scale upgrading of
old networks in the city, and a number of broad-band network
projects to be launched soon.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the city will open a series of new
telecom services, including the video on demand (VOD), conference
television and high-speed data communication, on a web supported
by six ATM (asynchronous transport model) switches.

<TEXT>
<P>
Every member of the coalition, including Gowda, is fully aware
that the government will immediately fall without the support of
Rao's Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Playing the sensitive issue with a very careful hand in
parliament Thursday, Gowda refused to connect Rao and his son to
the multi-crore urea scam, saying that such accusations should not
be made while the probe was still in progress.
</P>
<P>
On top of all this, the coalition government has to go all out
to carry out an ambitious economic program with but limited
resources.
</P>
<P>
The minimum common program, announced on June 5, included plans
to expand economic reforms and enhance social welfare for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
It planned to draw foreign investments of 10 billion US dollars
a year (more than double the current level) and to resume the
stalled financial sector reforms, lower import duties and open up
the insurance sector to both private and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government promised populist measures to
cut prices, offer education to the poor, increase employment of
young people and allot 60 percent of the budget to agriculture and
rural development.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said the coalition government would have a
tough time living up to its ambition and face a daunting challenge
of juggling its welfare promises and a commitment to fiscal
austerity.

HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Community
(SADC) states have produced a draft protocol which seeks to
abolish controls on the movement of citizens among the SADC
states.
</P>
<P>
Ministers responsible for immigration and security from the
SADC states will meet in Botswana on June 27 to hammer out a
final protocol on free movement of people in SADC countries, the
" Daily Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, if approved, will allow people to enter freely
and without visas the territory of another member state, and to
establish themselves and work in member countries.
</P>
<P>
The draft protocol was produced yesterday in Kadoma, Zimbabwe
by officials from SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the various migration forms will be abolished
and replaced by a uniform SADC migration form. A SADC passport
will also be introduced within the five years from the date the
protocol comes into force for travel within the community.

The sources said the Botswana meeting is expected to be
difficult given the various concerns on the free movement of
people. But they said it is likely that the ministers will agree

YANTAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Yantai, the coastal city in east
China's Shandong Province has greatly benefited from the country's
opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
With the gross domestic product (GDP) soaring to 6.85 billion
US dollars last year, Mayor Ren Haishen said that Yantai,
occupying a leading position in northern China's economy, earned
1.41 billion US dollars from exports last year.

Yantai, one of the 14 coastal open cities, approved by the
State Council in 1984, has so far approved the establishment of
more than 4,300 foreign-funded projects, involving a total
investment of five billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to foreign funds, the city has succeeded in retooling 60
percent of its enterprises scattered in traditional industries,
the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns Arab Leaders Against Harsh Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) --Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Binyamin Netanyahu has warned Arab leaders against making what he
called counterproductive "inflammatory rhetoric", the Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office late Thursday, Netanyahu
broke a weeklong silence on the recent tough statements by the
Arab leaders, saying they would only have an adverse effect.
</P>
<P>
"We are not affected by various declarations from certain
quarters. Threatening rhetoric will produce exactly the opposite
effect. We will continue the quest to reach a genuine peace,
which means peace with security," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu initially believed that it was better not to
respond, lest there be an escalation of rhetoric. However, he felt
there was a need to react, the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The election victory by Netanyahu, the hardline Likud leader,
has alarmed the Arab world, which fears that the peace process
would be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders have held several summit meetings to discuss
the possible implications of Israeli elections, trying to form a
united front in dealing with the Israeli new government.
</P>
<P>
On June 6, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Jordanian King
Hussein and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
held a summit in Akaba, Jordan, urging Netanyahu to continue the
Israeli-Arab peace process.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, President Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez Assad
and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah held talks in Damascus, voicing
concern that a stalemate on the peace process could lead to
"tension and violence".
</P>
<P>
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe has warned against the possible
revival of intifada, or Arab uprising, if Israeli troops do not
redeploy from most of the volatile city as specified in the Oslo
2 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the tough policy guidelines put forward by the

war".

On Thursday, Israel Radio reported that the Palestinian
security authority had sent a message to Netanyhau, threatening
to halt crackdown on terrorists unless he lifts the closure on
the Palestinian territories. But the Palestinian side has denied
the report.
</P>
<P>
"We are not impressed by the various declarations and threats
that have been issued by Arab leaders," Netanyhu said earlier
Thursday, after visiting the family of victims killed in Sunday
night's drive-by shootings by suspected Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate test of any agreement with the Palestinians is
the security issue, and there will be no compromises in this
area," vowed the incoming Prime Minister.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indian Coalition Faces Problems (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- India's United Front (UF)
coalition government headed by Deve Gowda faces tough problems
ahead although it won the trust vote in the Lok Sabha (lower house
of parliament) this week.
</P>
<P>
The unity within the heterogeneous 13-party coalition and its
relations with its lukewarm supporter the Congress Party will come
under severe tests now that their common rival Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) has been tucked safely away in the opposition, for a
while at least.
</P>
<P>
Discord began to show among coalition partners right from the
start when the government was formed on June 1, delaying the
finalization of its common program.
</P>
<P>
Some partners had refused to join the government while others
had asked for more cabinet portfolios. And some left-wing parties
had tried to redefine the six-year-old economic reforms pursued by
P.V. Narasimha Rao that Prime Minister Gowda wanted to continue.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party led by Rao has time and again said that its
support for the UF government did not mean that it would not
criticize its policies. Rao even went so far as to say that the
UF government would not stay long.
</P>
<P>
The corruption issue, seen as the Waterloo of the Rao
administration, apparently put Gowda in a difficult position.
</P>
<P>
The UF had declared in both its election campaign promises and
its minimum common program that it would investigate the
corruption cases during the last administration.
</P>
<P>
Rao, his son and some other relatives are allegedly involved in
the two most noted scandals -- that of the urea import amounting
to 388 million US dollars and the bribery of MPs in 1993.

<HEADLINE> China Popularizes Icefish-breeding Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in raising
Icefish (Salangidae), a rare and nourishing fish, in reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reservoir and Fishery Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences in Hubei province, Icefish is a small
translucent food fish, which breeds in lakes in the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The fish is sold at a price of more than 40 yuan per kilogram,
at least three times that of the ordinary fish, and has a strong
reproductive capacity.
</P>
<P>
A few reservoirs, which have raised the fish on trial basis,
have gained great benefits.
</P>
<P>
Four reservoirs in Henan, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces and
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been designated as
Icefish breeding centers, collecting at least 300 million Icefish
roes so far this year, accounting for one half of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
China has 85,000 reservoirs with water surface totalling two
million hectares.

<HEADLINE> Tension Remains High In South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The tense situation in south
Lebanon, stemming from Monday's deadly Hezbollah ambush in the
Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" shows no signs to subside.
</P>
<P>
A huge explosive device was detonated in Huleh village in the
eastern sector of the zone Thursday, without inflicting any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In a related incident, an Israeli army officer was moderately
wounded during a training exercise, which also took place in the
eastern part of the zone. He was hit by shrapnel from a grenade,
and evacuated by helicopter to Haifa's Rambam Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the roadside bomb attack
in Huleh, saying it was aimed at a South Lebanon Army security
official. Reports said that the device was detonated as some
residents of the zone were passing in a civilian car. They escaped
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The attack was viewed by Israel as a blatant breach of the
agreement of understandings reached at the end of Operation Grapes
of Wrath In late April.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, however, maintains it is adhering to the
understandings and, for that reason, has been forced to change
its methods of operation. A senior Hezbollah official told the
organization's radio station earlier this week that it was now
operating "deeper inside enemy territory" as a result of the
understandings.
</P>
<P>
He said Hezbollah was no longer firing from villages north of
the zone and was unable to give covering fire to assist the
withdrawal of units from operations.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Amiram Levine, Head of Israeli army Northern
Command, said Thursday that at least two of Hezbollah gunmen
involved in the ambush of Nahal Brigade troops were killed by the
soldiers, despite very difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed charges that the troops sustained so heavy
casualties possibly because the soldiers failed to act properly.
</P>
<P>
"We did not find any faults and we won't change the
regulations. We have to hit Hezbollah and we will find the way to
do so," he added.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprises in Guangzhou Have Fewer Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of state-employed
workers is decreasing in Guangzhou, while the general employment
continues to surge in the booming capital of south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1995 the number of workers
in Guangzhou reached 2.376 million, 373,000 more than in
1990. Among them 1.329 million work for state-owned enterprises,
dropping by 36,000 compared with 1990.
</P>
<P>
But employment has greatly expanded in overseas-funded and
private enterprises. By the end of 1995 some 308,000 people had
been hired by overseas-funded enterprises, up 139 percent from
1990, while private enterprises recruited 293,000 people, 170
percent more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Guangzhou Labor Bureau attributed the
change of employment to China's shift from a planned economy to a
socialist market economy, which he said has changed people's minds
and promoted the flow of skilled personnel in society.
</P>
<P>
"People are more concerned about bringing their specialities
into full play and getting real benefits, than the ownership of
their work units," he pointed out, adding that a large number of
state-employed workers, especially young people, have quit their
jobs to work for overseas-funded and private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that with the continuous efforts of
industrial restructuring, conspicuous changes have also taken
place in the city's employment structure.
</P>
<P>
The employment of the agricultural sector had shrunk from
963,000 in 1990 to 915,000 in 1995, and that of the industrial
sector stayed more or less the same, he noted, while that of the
service trades had gone up by 30.2 percent over 1990 to reach
1.571 million at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"This employment structure is more reasonable and much better
than the previous one," he commented.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he said, Guangzhou saw an unemployment rate of 2.64
percent, one of the lowest among the major cities across the
country. The city is expecting to keep the rate under 3.5 percent
in the next five years.

NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi

active role in the search for a solution to his country's crisis.

<HEADLINE> India Decides to Extend Ban on LTTE for 2 More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The government of India has
decided to continue the ban on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) for another two years. The ban expires on July 14.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the LTTE was imposed following the assassination of
Indian former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in May 1991. There has
since been ample evidence of the organization's hand in the
assassination of Rajiv Gandhi who was the signatory to the
Indo-Sri Lanka accord to send the Indian peace keeping force to
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Official sources today attached greater importance to the
timing in view of the impending visit of Sri Lankan Foreign
Minister Kadirgamar. He will be the first foreign dignitary, from
a neighboring country to come here since the advent of the Deve
Gowda government.
</P>
<P>
Doubts have been expressed in some Sri Lankan quarters after
the exit of the Narasimha Rao government and due to the Tamil Nadu
party joining the Gowda government at the center. The Tamil Nadu
party has been accused of having harbored the LTTE in the past.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister of the Gowda government I.K. Gujral has made
it clear that the new government would do everything in its power
to support the legitimate constitutional authority in Sri Lanka.

</P>
<P>
Competent sources disclosed that Sheikh Hasina, president of

Jatiya (National) Party (JP), the third largest party in the
polls, on the latter's support in forming the government.
</P>
<P>
However, no details were given, but Chowdhury has confirmed
that "we shall discuss again. We are yet to discuss in details,"
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the AL chief approached the JP for support

</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary announcement by the Election

the JP.
</P>
<P>
The AL is also leading in 12 out of the rest 29 constituencies,
27 of them will need repolling to be held on June 19.
</P>
<P>
The JP presidium is expected to meet in a couple of days to
discuss the post-election scenario and the party strategy, a JP
source said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the JP acting chairman said at a press conference that
the support of his party in forming the government depended
largely on the release of its jailed chairman H.M. Ershad who has
been serving terms imprisonment for the last 6 years for
corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official sources indicated that the process of the
formation of the new government is expected to begin in the last
week of this month and President Abdur Rahman Biswas will have to
wait for completion of the June 19 repolling in the 27
constituencies where the polling was closed Wednesday due to
disturbances.

<HEADLINE> Passports Disappear From Sri Lanka's Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 14 (Xinhua)-- Over 500 blank passports were
missing from Sri Lanka's Immigration Office and police
investigating the matter arrested five high officials of the
department in this connection Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Immigration sources today, Police have
interrogated several officers of the department including the
controller of immigration. Among the arrested officers is a deputy
controller who was in charge of the passports.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the investigations, the police were able to
unearth about 250 of the missing passports which were hidden in a
toilet in the premises, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the missing passports have connection with
the Tamil rebels who have been waging an ethnic war in Northeast
Sri Lanka for the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The rebels badly need the passports for their various
international operations including the smuggling of drugs and
arms, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are internationally known for using forged passports
 hitherto and are now finding it more difficult to travel around
the world on forged passports as international airports are on the
guard for them.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that this is the reason they would have wanted
to acquire genuine passports, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Five Tamil Suspects Arrested for Blast Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Police arrested five Tamil rebels
suspected of attempting to blast the Kelanitissa thermal power
plant in Colombo at midnight Thursday, police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The police said they got the information on the plot and the
whereabouts of the five suspects when interrogating another
suspect arrested earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had allegedly planned to tie bombs to the turbines
at the power plant and then storm the power station in a suicide
attack.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Colombo police are continuing the
investigations as other Tamil rebels have reportedly escaped from
their hideouts after secretly storing up an armory in Colombo for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting against the government
since 1983 for a separate state of minority Tamils in the
northeast of the island country.
</P>
<P>
The latest massive bomb blast in Colombo killed over 90 people
and injured some 1,400 when rebel suicide bombers detonated a
vehicle bomb at the Central Bank on January 31 this year.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Polls Crucial for Peace: Dayton Review Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The future of Bosnia and the success
of the Dayton peace accords depend on elections in Bosnia set for
September, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today.
</P>
<P>
Dini, chairing an international meeting to review compliance
with the Dayton accords which ended 43 months of war in Bosnia,
called the elections "the crucial point of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Dini, whose country is currently occupying the rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU), said failure to hold the
polls would be "a big step backwards."
</P>
<P>
"Everything would be delayed with serious consequences" if the
elections were not held, he told ministers from 45 countries and
delegates from 14 international organizations meeting in the
northern Italian city of Florence.
</P>
<P>
The cessation of hostilities and a return to normality are
necessary preconditions for the reconstruction of the war-ravaged
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
On compliance with the Dayton pact, Dini said that the
international community and the former warring parties in Bosnia
have made some progress.
</P>
<P>
But they must work hard to resolve many problems, such as
building mutual confidence, repatriating and resettling refugees
and bringing war criminals to trial, he added.
</P>
<P>
International envoy in Bosnia Carl Bildt expressed his
appreciation for the efforts made by the former warring parties to
implement the Dayton pact.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, the international community's High Representative in
Bosnia, told ministers that the minimum requirements for a free
and fair election in Bosnia, such as secrecy of the vote and
ballot count, could be met by September.
</P>
<P>
But he added that a major problem would be holding an election
in a country where more than half the electorate have been
displaced.
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know how many on the (electoral) list no longer
exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European powers want the two-day
conference to confirm the date for the Bosnian elections, although
they acknowledge that many conditions for a free and fair election
are yet to be fulfilled.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Have Higher Current Account Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will have a higher
current account deficit in fiscal year 1996/1997, according to an
annual report released here Thursday by Bank Indonesia, the
country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The high level of the current account deficit continues
because imports are still high, parallel to the realization of
investment projects which have been approved by the government,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit in fiscal year 1995/1996 increased
drastically by almost two fold from 3.5 billion US dollars to 6.9
billion US dollars, and its ratio against the gross domestic
product (GDP) increased from two percent to 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase was caused by a fall of 1.8 billion US dollars in
the balance of trade surplus and by the growing balance of
services deficit, particularly the rising transportation cost and
insurance of non-oil imports as well as payments of offshore loan
interests, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economic, Financial and Development
Supervision Saleh Afiff said earlier this month that the current
account deficit for this fiscal year, which ends in March 1997,
would reach 8.7 billion US dollars, rather than the 6.9 billion US
dollars previously forecast.

Honduran Foreign Minister Delmer Urbizo Panting said today his

"The gulf is dying and we have presented Nicaragua and El
Salvador a plan of integral development to make fishing more
effective and establish an ecological control to promote the

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombo Port and at least three
vessels suffered damages when a gale hit Sri Lanka's western
coastal areas Friday, according to port sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the heavy gale, with a velocity of nearly 100
kilometers per hour, lashed the western coast and many other parts
of the country for several hours.
</P>
<P>
Colombo Port was perhaps the worst affected as the damage to
the port and the ships could reach over 200 million rupees (over
3.7 million US dollars), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 31 ships outside the port Friday, three foreign vessels
suffered heavy damages.
</P>
<P>
Vessel movements to and from Colombo Port have been suspended
since Thursday when the port authorities prepared for more winds
from a low pressure area developing over the ocean off Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The suspension is expected to cause heavy loss as well, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
A container carrier on her way to India from Colombo got
beached off the north of the harbor when it lost control in the
unexpected heavy winds.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said about a dozen fishing trawlers
anchored off the Trincoalee naval base in the east of the country
were also damaged.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Develop Commercial Corridor In Yangtze River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is to build dozens of
chain stores and distribution centers with a total area of one
million square meters along the Yangtze River in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to invest five billion yuan in establishing a
commercial corridor in the Yangtze River delta, in cooperation
with other cities in the area.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the corridor will create more commercial
opportunities for cities in the area to promote common prosperity
in the Yangtze River delta, said Jiang Yiren, Shanghai's vice
mayor.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1990s, cities in the Yangtze River delta
have had increasing economic links and trade with Shanghai, the
economic center in the area, to develop local commerce.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years Shanghai has established hundreds of
commercial businesses in the area. Last year, the total sales for
the businesses reached 2.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Economic Development Group Company, a joint
stock company founded in 1994, is playing an important role in
establishing the corridor. The company has built department stores
with a total area of 50,000 square meters in cities such as Ningbo
and Suzhou, and all the stores became profitable the same year as
their establishment, thanks to the wide variety of stocked items
and good service.
</P>
<P>
The group company aims to set up 20 large and medium-size
stores in the delta by 1997. With a total are of 200,000 square
meters, the stores will achieve an annual sales of five billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
By 2000 the company will have set up stores with an area of
500,000 square meters and with annual sales of 20 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Cities in the Yangtze River delta will also have more
cooperation in transport, international trade, investment
consultation and non-banking financial service.
</P>
<P>
Economists say the establishment of a commercial corridor in
the Yangtze River delta will be a model for the development of the
whole Yangtze River economic belt.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Designates New Pillar Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's focus will zoom in on
the development of multi-media technology industries by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
This largest city of China will also concentrate on
bio-technology, new materials, micro-electronics, intelligence
machinery, ship-building and oceanic projects.
</P>
<P>
The industries have been recommended as pillars of the future
by experts from the Institute of Economy under the Shanghai
Municipal Planning Commission and in line with the city's industrial
size, development speed, market needs, economic efficiency and
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the industries will produce an output value
totalling 40 billion yuan in 1997 and at least 90 billion yuan in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai began to pay attention to the development of
automobile, telecommunications equipment, petro-chemicals,
household electric appliances, iron and steel and power equipment
in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Their proportion of the city's total industries rose from 31
percent in 1990 to 45 percent at present, becoming the city's
industrial growth points.
</P>
<P>
"Further development of those industries will be limited by
production scale, technology and marketing, and the city has to
choose new pillar industries," explained a municipal official.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Boosts Indonesia's Balance of Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Progress in Indonesia's tourism
sector has had a favorable effect on the country's balance of
payments, an official of the Bank Indonesia said at a national
seminar on tourist economic statistics here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange earnings from the tourism sector, whose market
share grew by 74 percent in fiscal year 1994/1995, ranked first in
the export of services, said Mulyanto, deputy chief of the bank's
division of balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, tourism ranked third after textile and wood
in the country's total exports of non-oil goods and services with
a market share of 13 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, this sector has become the country's third
biggest foreign exchange earner after textile and plywood, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The growing foreign exchange earnings from the tourism sector
may help reduce the burden of Indonesia's balance of payments,
including payment of offshore loans and relevant interest, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Indonesia's tourism sector can be further
developed as it has a huge potential, probably even bigger than
those of the other member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Widens Intervention Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central bank
of the country, widened the rupiah-dollar intervention band
Thursday to 118 rupiah (five percent) from 66 rupiah (three
percent) in a move to curb speculation on the money market.
</P>
<P>
Sudradjad Djiwandono, governor of the central bank, said the
new move was aimed at improving the effectiveness of monetary
control and the stability of the rupiah exchange rate to
anticipate increasing capital flow.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah can now move between 2,315 and 2,433 against the US
dollar without triggering the central bank's intervention, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The previous band was between 2,313 and 2,379 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"With this new measure, we hope short-term offshore funds will
stay here a bit longer," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had changed several times the exchange rate of
the rupiah against the dollar and other foreign currencies since
December 1992.
</P>
<P>
The widening spread was expected to increase the flow of
foreign capital to Indonesia not only in the short term but also
in the long term, he said.

MEXICO CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- El Salvador will take a
commercial textile dispute with the United States to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), news from San Salvador received here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Milian, commercial advisor to El Salvador in the
textile industry, said that if no agreement is reached by the two
countries, El Salvador will take the case to the WTO for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is negotiating with the United States on the
elimination of quota restrictions on its textile exports, declared
unilaterally by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Milian said trade representatives of El Salvador and the
U.S. last week opened talks over the quotas on the Salvadoran
exports of cotton and synthetic fiber skirts to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has decided to restrict the import of 209,000
skirts made in El Salvador, which will cause 14 million
U.S. dollars in losses, said Milian.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. decision will affect 31 Salvadoran
textile enterprises and about 4,000 workers in the textile sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, El Salvador won a case in a similar dispute with the
United States over U.S. limits of the Central American country's
shirt exports.

<HEADLINE> Western Banks Urge Bulgaria to Repay Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Western banks
threatened Wednesday to suspend loans to the Bulgarian government
if it fails to repay millions of dollars in arrears owed by a
Bulgarian bank.
</P>
<P>
The multi-million dollar debt was owed by the Bulgarian Mineral
Bank, which sold 5 billion yen (4.7 million U.S. dollars) worth of
shares to a Japanese investment bank in Europe seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government has declared the Mineral Bank bankrupt
recently, but neither the Bulgarian central bank nor the
government have made an explicit commitment to repay the debt.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Japanese investment bank in Sofia
warned that Bulgaria would be isolated in the international
financial community if failed to clear the debt.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government had expected to win billion-dollar
standby loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after it
declared some debt-ridden banks insolvent last month to save its
ailing banking system as demanded by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
To meet another IMF condition, the government also announced
drastic tax hikes earlier this month, triggering nationwide
protests and prompting the opposition to call a parliamentary vote
of no-confidence today.

<HEADLINE> EU-MERCOSUR Integration Moving Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Intense diplomatic activity
in Brussels this week marked the first concrete steps in the
process to integrate two regional economic blocs: the South
American Common Market (MERCOSUR) with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Carlos Menem, president of Argentina and executive
president of the Council of Mercosur (comprising Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay) for the first quarter of this year, paid an
official visit to the EU head offices and several of its member
countries to give impetus to the integration process.
</P>
<P>
EU and MERCOSUR foreign ministers held the first meeting of
their joint commission to draw up a detailed timetable for free
trade between the two regions before the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
They signed agreements on economic and parliamentary
cooperation, as well as an agreement that will facilitate the
entry of agricultural and animal products into the EU market.
</P>
<P>
Leading businessmen from EU and MERCOSUR countries held a
seminar to discuss multilateral cooperation and investment with a
view toward market expansion, trade diversification and mutual
benefits from economic integration.
</P>
<P>
These were the most important steps taken since the two
regional blocs signed a framework agreement in Madrid last
December to form a free trade zone in the next century.
</P>
<P>
If it becomes a reality, it would be the biggest economic bloc
in the world, with more than 600 million consumers and gross
national product from 19 countries -- 15 EU and four MERCOSUR --
exceeding 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The meetings in Brussels took place shortly before the
expansion of the MERCOSUR, with the entry of Chile and Bolivia at
the end of this month. Negotiations will then begin to incorporate
other South American countries, a move that will undoubtedly
strengthen a future MERCOSUR-EU free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The steady progress of the integration process comes as trade,
investment and the transfer of technology between the two regions
has surged.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the MERCOSUR and the EU totalled more than 10
billion dollars in 1995, an increase of 227 percent over the 1990,
and one-fourth of the MERCOSUR's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Up to last year, 70 percent of EU investment in Latin America
was in the MERCOSUR countries, mainly Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the main supplier of capital goods and advanced
technologies to the MERCOSUR countries.
</P>
<P>
For the EU, integration with MERCOSUR will mean consolidating
its market in South America and gaining a competitive edge over
other regional economic blocs. For the MERCOSUR, integration with
the EU will attract more direct investment from Europe and give
the South American countries greater access to technology.

<P>
BRASILIA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian authorities today gave
the final tally of 37 dead and 472 injured in Tuesday's lunchtime
explosion at a suburban shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
The explosion at the mall in Osasco, 16 kilometers west of Sao
Paolo, was caused by cooking gas that leaked into a space beneath
the floor of the single-storey building, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Officials had warned last week about a possible gas leak in the
shopping center, which opened in April last year, but nothing was
done about it.
</P>
<P>
The mall, which has 200 stores, three movie theaters and
20,000 square meters of floor space, receives an average of
40,000-50,000 shoppers a day.

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- American Danny Harris, silver
medalist of 400-meter hurdles event at the 1984 Olympics, is
facing a lifetime ban from the sport after testing positive for
cocaine for the second time in four years, athletics officials
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Harris, 30, said in a statement he had failed a doping test
after the Rio de Janeiro grand prix meeting on May 4 and was
withdrawing from this week's U.S. Olympic trials, where he is a
favourite to win the 400-meter hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Harris was also tested positive for the drug in 1992 and served
a two-year suspension before being reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Harris, best know for ending former world record holder Edwin
Moses' 122-race winning streak, said he hoped to continue
competing. But USA Track and Field spokesman Pete Cava said Harris
faced a lifetime ban unless he successfully appealed the positive
test.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province Expanding Int'l Agricultural Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province, a major grain
producer in north China, has received 60 million yuan in
assistance for nine agricultural research projects undertaken with
foreign research institutes.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Provincial Science and Technology
Commission said that the projects have been undertaken by research
institutes in Hebei and their counterparts in Australia, Britain,
Canada, France, Japan, Romania and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Projects include studies of dry farming, the breeding
capability of seeds, and the breeding of quality wheat strains,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hebei plans to increase its annual grain production to 30
million tons by the turn of the century, five million tons more
than in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Expanding international cooperation is one of the measures
taken by Hebei to attain the grain production goal, he added.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 300 researchers in Hebei have been sent to
study abroad, he said, adding that 125 foreign agricultural
researchers are working in Hebei.
</P>
<P>
"Importing agricultural techniques and fine crop strains is a
major part of cooperation in agricultural production between Hebei
and other parts of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has imported 70 agricultural techniques over the past few
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the use of new agricultural techniques developed
through cooperation with foreign research institutes has resulted
in an extra production value of 1.5 billion yuan, he said.

<HEADLINE> Engine Trouble Causes Crash of Indonesian Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- President and Director of
Indonesian Garuda Airline Soepandi said an engine trouble had
caused the crash of a DC-10 airliner at Fukuoka Airport in
southern Japan Thursday, the Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Soepandi said the plane's third engine -- a CF6-50 made by the
General Electric company -- caught fire shortly before the
aircraft skidded off the runway on take-off.
</P>
<P>
Four people were confirmed dead and about 80 others injured in
the accident, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Garuda plane was carrying 260 people, mostly
Japanese holiday-makers bound for the Indonesian resort island of
Bali.
</P>
<P>
Soepandi said the aircraft's 15-member crew were among the
survivors although Captain Pilot Ronald R. Longdong had to be
taken to a local hospital for a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts from Garuda and a leading official of the
Indonesian Transportation Ministry left here for Fukuoka Thursday
evening to join investigations into the causes of the accident.
</P>

<P>
GUIYANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The remote Guizhou province in
southwest China is cooperating successfully with coastal provinces
and cities to develop its economy.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the province has established cooperation
ties with coastal Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan
provinces, Shanghai and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous province had absorbed funds totalling 1.657
billion yuan and materials worth of 5.7 billion yuan from other
parts of the country in the 1991-95 period. It had completed 970
cooperative projects and imported 673 items of technology during
this period.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Yuanhai, a provincial official in charge of
overseas cooperation, more and more people in Guizhou have seen
the importance of cooperating with economically-developed
provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou is rich in mineral resources, but lacks funds and

<HEADLINE> Law on Anti-Earthquake Put into Force in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first anti-earthquake
law has been put into force in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The regulations governing safety evaluation of earthquakes,
adopted by the local people's congress, aims to provide counter
earthquake measures and diminish the loss caused by disastrous
quakes.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to formulate a law to secure the safety of
people's lives and property when unexpected earthquakes occur,"
said Yang Guobao, deputy director of the provincial seismic
department.
</P>
<P>
Based on relevant national laws and regulations, the rules lay
due stress on earthquake safety evaluation, management of
antishock standards and reasonable utilization of resources and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Yang said Hebei is one of the country's densely populated
provinces. About 44 percent of its population live in the area
with a potential earthquake intensity above seven degrees, he said.
</P>
<P>
A latest seismic study shows that there is a clear-cut
earthquake belt across the province and the possibility of
destructive quakes within the region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that out of 149 earthquakes above five
magnitude in North China since 1815, 68 occurred in Hebei.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, there have been 13
disastrous earthquakes in the province, leaving 272,500 people
dead. The most grievous were strong quakes in Xingtai in 1966 and
Tangshan in 1976. The latter caused 242,700 deaths and left
164,800 seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Yang said Hebei has entered a key period for economic
development. It is of great significance to strengthen seismic
safety evaluation to improve the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Over two decades local seismic departments have conducted
evaluations of hundreds of large and medium-sized cities and
enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the newly-enacted regulations are expected to promote
the local economic development and social stability.

ROME, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Italian athletics federation

The high jumper tested positive for the banned substance
ephedrine at a Milan meeting on May 4, when she cleared one of the

Italian athletic sources said the quantity of ephedrine found
in her urine matched the amount in the over-the-counter medicine,
which had the offending ingredient Ma-Huang (Chinese ephedra)

FIDAL believes she should not be punished, in accordance with
an International Olympic Committee ruling that allows for good

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Netherlands March in Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Both Bulgaria and the Netherlands
enjoyed smooth sailing earlier today by defeating their opponents
Romania and Switzerland respectively in group clashes of the
European Soccer Championship in England.
</P>
<P>
In a group B match between Bulgaria and another East European
country Romania held this afternoon at St. James Park, Newcastle,
Bulgarian international star Hristo Stoitchkov single-handedly
sank the hopes of Romania in Euro 96 by scoring a superb goal at
the 3rd minute of the match.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov, the European player of the year in 1994, raced
through the center of the ground and sent the ball into the net by
his left-foot.
</P>
<P>
Romania, led by its magic player Gheorghe Hagi, launched fierce
counterattacks and Dorinel Munteaunu of Romania actually hit a
equalizer at the 31st minute by rocking the bar and later bounced
down over the goal-line, but unfortunately the Danish referee
Peter Mikkelsen overrulled the excellent scoring by waving to play
on.
</P>
<P>
At the second half of the game, Romania became more and more
tired and gradually lost its normal attacking pace, but Bulgaria,
encouraged by Stoichkov's early goal, displayed wonderful
performance and made people feel the World Cup semi-finalist will
certainly qualify for the Euro 96 last eight.
</P>
<P>
In a group A match between the Netherlands and Swtitzerland at
Villa Park Stadium of Birmingham this evening, Netherlands, which
was forced into a 0-0 draw by Scotland earlier this week, made a
very disappointing start of the game.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland nearly dominated the first half and the early ten
minutes of the second half, but unfortunately Swill players failed
to hit any points.
</P>
<P>
The turning point came at the 65th minute when Jordi Cruyff,
son of the Dutch soccer legend Johan Cruyff, hit a opener for the
Dutch squad in the Euro 96 with a left-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
The goal of young Cruyff pulled the sitting-duck Dutch players
back into the match and Dennis Bergkamp collected the goal-kicking
from the Dutch goalkeeper at the 78 minute and darted straight
into the penalty area of Swiss side and coolly fired home a
wonderful goal after his first shot was blocked by the Swiss
goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the coming Netherland-England clash, Bergkamp said,
"Wembley is a very special place for every Dutch player and we are
looking forward to it and I have very good memories myself of
scoring there in the World Cup."
</P>
<P>
Dutch coach Guss Hiddink said, "we will not be sitting in our
ease chairs when we play England. We will play as we normally do
in a bid to win."

</P>
<P>
The ticket packages include tickets for the children and their

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Full Support for Irish Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today pledged his administration's full support for the on-going
all-party talks aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the
long-standing dispute over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"I pledge we will do all we can to help the peace that is the
birthright of all the people of Ireland, north and south," Clinton
told reporters after a welcoming ceremony for visiting Irish
President Mary Robinson.
</P>
<P>
The all-party peace talks began earlier this week in Belfast.
The Sinn fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), was not allowed to participate in the talks presided over
by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell because of its refusal to
resume cease-fire in the region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed the hope that a cease-fire will be restored
by the IRA so its representatives can participate in the all-party
talks.
</P>
<P>
"I think every voice that represents the people of Ireland need
to be heard, but you can't have the talks with a gun at your
head," Clinton stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the political strife in Northern Ireland at the
welcoming ceremony, Robinson said she believes the all-party talks
provide an opportunity "to build a sustainable peace, to build
friendship and reconciliation that we can look to the future with
hope."
</P>
<P>
She praised Clinton for his support for the peace talks in
Northern Ireland.

we support cooperation, we support partnership," Clinton said at a

Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he has "a very good positive relationship
with President Yeltsin," but that would not mean he would take
side in the Russian elections.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said that no one should underestimate the
importance of the fact that the Russians are holding elections.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the elections would create "a
chance for reform...to succeed and endure" in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Space Technology Helps Doctors in Reconstruction Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Space technology is making it
possible for doctors to plan complex surgical procedures and
visualize the results of reconstruction surgery in a virtual
environment, NASA said in a report.
</P>
<P>
NASA's Ames Research Center, in collaboration with the Stanford
University Medical Center, developed a virtual workbench for
planning complex craniofacial reconstructive surgery and for
training new doctors, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Using software originally developed for space research to
integrate laser images with computer tomography (CT) scans of a
patient's head, the technology enables the creation of highly
precise, three-dimensional images of the patient's face and skull.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to allow surgeons to see the face with the skull
and enable them to use the same tools in a virtual environment
that they would use in the actual surgery," Dr. Muriel Ross,
director of Ames' Biocomputation Center, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the technique, the report said, doctors could
practise a surgery several different ways to see which outcome is
the best; patients could see what the result would be before the
surgery was even started.
</P>
<P>
The technique also allowed doctors at different places to
cooperate in the planning of a surgery by sharing 3-d patient
data via high-speed networking lines, the report said, and it
would make it possible to train craniofacial doctors without
their having to do actual surgery.

<HEADLINE> Big US Investment to Create 1,500 Jobs in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland peace process
received a big economic boost Wednesday with the announcement of
one of the province's largest-ever foreign investments, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
F.G. Wilson, the Ulster-based U.S. engineering group, is to set
up a 113 million U.S. dollar joint venture with Caterpillar, the
U.S. construction machinery group, to make diesel generating sets
for the power industry.
</P>
<P>
The move will more than double production at F.G. Wilson,
bringing the workforce close to 2,800 and turning the company into
Northern Ireland's largest employer after Northern Ireland
Electricity.
</P>
<P>
The investment will be spread between Wilson's existing plant
at Larne, a predominantly Protestant area in County Antrim, a new
plant at Monkstown near Larne, and a new factory on the Springvale
industrial estate, a republican area of west Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The project will create 1,533 jobs, 400 of which will be at the
Springvale plant, where long-term unemployment is as high as 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Baroness Denton, the Northern Ireland economy minister, said it
was "the clearest indication since the peace process started of
how positively U.S. companies now regard Northern Ireland as an
investment location."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is Northern Ireland's largest investment partner, with
investment of more than 465 million pounds (698 million U.S.
dollars) since 1990 in 51 companies employing over 14,000 people.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Declines Sharply in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturers cut back
production in April as they struggled with huge stock levels and
weak export demand from Europe, and manufacturing has shown no
growth since January.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office for National Statistics, manufacturing
output dropped by 0.3 percent in April, the biggest decline for
five months. Output now stands below the average for the first
three months of the year, suggesting that industry may be on the
course of a third successive quarterly decline.
</P>
<P>
In the three months to April, compared with the previous three,
a more accurate guide, output was the same.
</P>
<P>
Output fell in five of the seven sectors within manufacturing
in April. Output rose among food, drink and tobacco companies, as
well as for textiles, leather and clothing manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, which includes oil and energy output and
accounts for a little under 30 percent of total economic activity,
posted an even bigger decline than factory output in April,
dropping by 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trend for manufacturing and total production is for zero
growth. Many economists believe that the summer can see a renewed
and steep decline in production as companies try to get rid of
excess stocks.
</P>
<P>
They regard the output figures as vindication for Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's decision to cut interest rates by a
quarter point to 5.75 percent last week.
