<HEADLINE> Eight Hurt in Bomb Blast on Dal Lake Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An explosive device, planted in a handcart parked near a hotel
along the bank of world famous Dal Lake, went off at around 16:45
hours when an army convoy was passing by.
</P>
<P>
Three armymen, including a junior commissioned officer were
slightly injured in the blast which was apparently aimed at their
convoy, police said, adding that five civilians, including two
women, passing by were seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, this is for the first
time in recent months that militants have targeted an area

on one side and the Dal Lake on the other.
</P>

there was no loss of life or damage to the property as the devices
exploded in open area.

No militant groups has claimed responsibility for the attacks
so far.

<HEADLINE> S. African Environmentalists Decide to Evacuate Penguins From Polluted Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Western Cape Nature
Conservation Board decided on Saturday evening to begin evacuating
the entire colony of 55,000 penguins from Dassen Island on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The penguins will be taken by boat to Yzerfontein about 60
kilometers from Cape Town on the Cape west coast, spokeswoman for
the South African National Foundation for the Conservation of
Coastal Birds Christina Pretorius said.
</P>
<P>
Some penguins affected by last Friday's oil spill from the bulk
oil carrier, Treasure, were already being evacuated on Saturday,
Western Cape deputy-director of disaster management Schalk
Carstens said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining penguins had been fenced in to prevent them
leaving the island and entering the sea after oil from the sunken
Treasure encircled the island.
</P>
<P>
An aerial picture taken in the vicinity of the island on Friday
showed that strong sea currents and the wind appeared to be
causing the oil slick to drift past the island.
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than 1,200 penguins have so far been taken off
Dassen Island and were being rehabilitated in Salt River.
</P>
<P>
Pretorius said 400 penguin chicks were being cared for at a
private sanctuary in Melkbosstrand on the Cape West coast where
they would be hand- fed and reared. Another 94 chicks were being
cared for in a separate facility in Milnerton.
</P>
<P>
A third batch of 160 penguins was trucked overnight on
Thursday to Port Elizabeth and released into the sea in Algoa Bay
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to environmentalists, the birds made straight for
the sea to begin their long swim back to Robben Island, expected
to take about 10 days, by which time authorities have to clear the
coastline, Robben Island and Dassen Island beaches of the heavy
fuel oil.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Recognition of Palestinian State Serves Its Interests, PNA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian National
Council (PNA) Salim Za'noon said here Sunday that Israel's
recognition of the Palestinian state would serve Israel's own
interests.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration of statehood is an absolute right of the
Palestinian people and emanates from the Palestinians' right to
self-determination," Za'noon told the opening meeting of the
Palestinian Central Committee (PCC) session.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in the Oslo accords that goes against the
statehood declaration," he noted, quoting the Berlin Statement of
the European Union as saying that "No body has the right to veto
the Palestinian statehood declaration even Israel itself."
</P>
<P>
"We try every means to remove the obstacles placed by Israel on
the road to the Palestinian statehood. Thereby, we will choose the
proper time for statehood declaration in line with the
international efforts and local convenience," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Xinhua on the Israeli military threats against the
statehood declaration, Za'noon said "Our people is accustomed to
such threats. We no longer fear such threats even if they are
serious."
</P>
<P>
"We do not offend any body. We urge the international community
to support us in the issue of statehood declaration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Za'noon dismissed media reports on the Palestinian intention to
leave the self-rule areas in case of failure of talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"How could we leave Palestine?" he wondered, adding "We
will stay and defend our towns and villages. We will defend
ourselves against any attacks."
</P>
<P>
"If Israel recognizes the Palestinian state, this will
contribute positively to many things and will serve the interests
of Israel itself. The mainstream in Israel calls on Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak not to oppose the declaration of the future
Palestinian independent state," he underscored.
</P>
<P>
Last week Barak sent verbal message to Chairman of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat through U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, warning that Israel would
reoccupy the Palestinian self-rule areas if the Palestinian state
was unilaterally declared.
</P>
<P>
Barak is not against the the Palestinian statehood but he
prefers that it be declared under an agreement with Israel in the
framework of a permanent peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Za'noon who chaired the PCC session said that the statehood
declaration in the coming weeks is the absolute right of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
About 108 out of the 127 PCC members attended Sunday meeting
together with 50 representatives of Palestinian factions and
organizations, Za'noon pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The PCC session will discuss the date of the statehood
declaration,
the latest developments of the talks with Israel, and the ways of
activating the organs of the PLO.

<HEADLINE> Oman GDP Up 10.4 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Oman's GDP witnessed a 10.4
percent in 1999 against 10.2 percent in 1998, said an annual report
issued by the Central Bank of Oman on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rise in GDP was attributed to the increase in earnings from
the energy, crude and natural gas sectors, which accounted for 38.7

percent of the GDP in 1999, while non-oil sectors, agriculture and
services, dropped by 2.2 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the actual deficit in the state budget rose
from 375.3 million rials (975.78 million U.S. dollars) in 1998 to
465.8 million rials (1.21 billion dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the public expenditure rose by 1.9
percent to 2,264.1 million rials (5.89 billion dollars) in 1999
from 2,221.6 million rials (5.78 billion dollars) in 1998, because
of a 2.5 percent increase in current expenses, while investment
expenses fell by four percent.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Leaves For Geneva to Attend Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Sunday afternoon left here for Geneva to attend the third round of
U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus, due to start on July 5.
</P>
<P>
On their way to Geneva, Clerides and his company will stop in
Athens to meet with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and members
of the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, Clerides will have a meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Geneva on July 5.
</P>
<P>
Then the talks will be continued with the Secretary-General's
Special Adviser for Cyprus Alvaro de Soto.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriots-controlled north
and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of proximity talks under the U.N. auspices between
President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have
already been held to prepare the ground for substantive
negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement for the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure at Larnaca airport, Cyprus'
southern coast, Clerides repeated the position that the Greek
Cypriot side "does not accept the confederation" as a solution to
the Cyprus issue, but would "negotiate within the framework set out
by the U.N. resolution."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots are seeking a confederation of two "
states", although their breakaway republic, unilaterally declared
in 1983, is not recognized internationally.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Renews Support for Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
Khatib said here on Sunday his kingdom will recognize an
independent Palestinian state with other Arab countries anytime it
is proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a time when a meeting of the Central
Committee of Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was convened
earlier in the day in Palestinian self-rule areas to decide on a
date to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Khatib stressed Jordan
actually has already recognized the Palestinian state after the
Palestinians first proclaimed independence in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The palestinian side has sent an ambassador to Jordan and Jordan
also has a diplomatic envoy in the Palestinian self-rule areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan believes a solution to the Palestinian issue is the
corner stone of the Middle East peace process, without which there
will be no just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Khatib told Xinhua that Jordan is committed to promoting peace
in the region, which it believes to be the top priority and only
option for all states and peoples, including Israel, to achieve
economic development and prosperity, and to pave the way for a
better life for the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Arab rights and interests must be protected,
restored and guaranteed during the peace process, including the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state on its own soil
and the rights of Arab countries to recover their lands occupied by
Israel in successive Middle East wars.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also called for regional cooperation to deal
with the water shortages, another potential source of tension in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"We should take collective efforts to deal with water shortages,
a common challenge facing every country in the region, by way of
consultations instead of force and war," he said.

<HEADLINE> GCC States Called to Revise Investment Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Some existing Gulf laws which
hinder residents from investing in the six Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries need to be revised, according to a latest study
released by the United Arab Emirates' Industry Bank.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities must be created to attract back part of the Gulf
investments abroad to help diversify investments and contribute to
GCC economic and social development, the study stressed.
</P>
<P>
It said that channels in which expatriate residents are allowed
to invest are extremely limited and a revision of the laws will
help them retain their savings in the region.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the traditional and services sectors in which GCC
national capital is preferred, the industrial and IT segments can
be opened to Gulf expatriates for investment, the study suggested.
</P>
<P>
Moves taken to benefit from remittances of GCC-based expatriates
and investments in the local private sectors remain limited,
although the GCC states are working hard to attract foreign
investments, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The study said foreign investments in the Gulf, excluding the
oil sector, were estimated at 15 billion U.S. dollars, and
remittances by expatriates at 18 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Several GCC countries introduced measures recently to encourage
foreign investments, it noted. In Bahrain, crucial amendments were
made in the Companies Law for 100 percent foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Saudi Arabia introduced a system allowing full
foreign ownership of firms, property ownership, and trading in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.

<HEADLINE> No Security Threat to U.S. Targets in Jordan: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
Khatib said here on Sunday that he saw no security threats to
American targets in the kingdom although the U.S. embassy in Amman
cancelled its Independence day celebrations slated for July 4.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see any logic behind the cancellation," Khatib said
in an interview with Xinhua, adding the government has confidence
in the security and intelligence services of the kingdom to protect
all foreign missions in the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that it was up to the U.S. embassy to
decide whether to hold the national day reception or not, and the
mission had informed his ministry of the cancellation in advance.
</P>
<P>
The celebration is held each year at the U.S. ambassador's
residence in Amman, and is attended by hundreds of Jordanian
dignitaries and representatives from other diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy decided last Thursday to cancel the event
because of what it called a "terrorist targeting" of the embassy
and other possible American targets in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It also warned American citizens travelling in the kingdom to
keep a low profile and to take extra prudence.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials had played down the U.S. warning and
described it as "routine alerts" issued by U.S. embassies in most
regions of the world, and there was nothing new in terms of threats
to justify such a statement in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Similar warnings were issued by the U.S. embassy in Amman last
December, when Jordanian police rounded up 14 suspected terrorists
who allegedly sneaked into the kingdom on forged travel documents
to sabotage new millenium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian authorities said the suspects, believed to be linked
to Afghanistan-based Saudi-expelled billionaire Osma bin Laden, had
planned to attack American and Israeli targets during the new year
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden is one of the most wanted suspects by Washington,
which has accused him of masterminding the 1998 bombings of the U.
S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing over 200 people.
</P>
<P>
However, no serious attacks on American targets were reported in
Jordan in recent memory.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh said here Sunday that Jerusalem is part of the
Israel-occupied territories, and that India supports the
Palestinians in their struggle to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Singh made the remarks during his talks with Faisal al-Husseini,

a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) executive
committee who is in charge of the dossier of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Al-Husseini briefed Singh on the situation of Jerusalem under
the Israeli occupation, and noted that the peace process between
Israel and the Palestinians urges the Israeli full withdrawal from
the occupied Palestinian territories including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Al-Husseini held Israel responsible for potential reactions in
case of its refusal to to withdraw, making it certain that the
Palestinians are strong enough to notch up their national legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
He added, "Peace is our strategic option but it is not our sole
option if Israel insists on sealing off the peace road."
</P>
<P>
The Indian official, who arrived in the region on June 30 in a
historic visit to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, has
signed a mechanism for bilateral cooperation for combatting
terrorism with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.

<HEADLINE> Two Men Arrested for Manslaughter in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian police have arrested two
people from a company that has imported a radioactive object
fatally poisoning a father and a son, and charged them with
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
The two people are identified as Salim Sayyed Ahmed, 47, the
owner of a pipe welding firm and a 36-year-old engineer working for
him, Rifaat Mohammed Ali, the Middle East News Agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutors in the town of Qalyub, north of Cairo, near
the village of Mit Halfa where the deaths occurred, announced the
charges on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The firm had imported the radioactive object, which Mohammed
Abdelrahman Salama, president of Egypt's Atomic Security Authority,
said was iridium 192, from the United States and used it to check
the fastness of gas pipe joints.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors accused the two men of neglect for leaving the
object at their worksite and failure to inform authorities that it
had gone missing, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Fadl Hassan Fadl, a 61-year-old farmer, found the radioactive
object and took it home. He and his nine-year-old son died in June
from exposure to the object while five more family members have
been treated in hospital.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt's Atomic Energy Authority said in a report issued on
Thursday that it suspected the object had been dumped illegally to
avoid paying 5,000 Egyptian pounds (about 1,500 U.S. dollars), the
fees charged to dispose of radioactive waste at its site.

<HEADLINE> Saudi FM Welcomes Sea Border Agreement With Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, July 2 ( Xinhua ) -- Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-
Faisal on Sunday welcomed the signing of an agreement on
demarcation of sea borders between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was inked here on Sunday by al-Faisal and Kuwaiti
First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-
Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah on the second day of an ongoing visit by
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference following the signing of the agreement,
Faisal said it is natural for both countries to seek to resolve any
outstanding issues between them.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have demarcated their land borders and
also agreed to share the stupendous oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, both countries sought to reach an agreement
on demarcating al-Garf al-Qarry area as al-Dorah oilfield exists at
al-Mothalath region between Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which is
a point of contention with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The issue of demarcation of borders with Iran will be solved
amicably and peacefully, al-Faisal added.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit had been slated for last June 12 but it was
delayed due to a visit paid by Yemeni President Abdullah Saleh to
Saudi Arabia and postponed for the second time owing to the demise
of Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's agreement between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait came two
weeks after a treaty on demarcation of borders between Yemen and
Saudi Arabia was hammered out.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges Zimbabweans To Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Sunday urged Zimbabweans to jealously guard the national unity.
</P>
<P>
Such unity was achieved in 1987 following the signing of an
accord between the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
(Zanu-pf) led by Mugabe and the Zimbabwe African People's Union
(Zapu) headed by the late Vice-President Joshua Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the memorial service of Nkomo who died on July 1
last year, Mugabe said there were some people and organizations
bent on dividing the nation, by referring to the pre-unity civil
conflict in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces in west Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"There are those who want to continue using the quarrel as a
basis for organizing, if not disorganizing the people. What is
the purpose that we fight again? That we divide the people?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
The president, whose party lost most of the seats in
Matabeleland during last week's parliamentary election, recently
accused the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and
some church leaders of fanning division in the region, resulting
in the loss.
</P>
<P>
"Let's look at our past and try to see why the unity accord
came about," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a difference, a quarrel, we engaged ourselves in a
 reckless and unprincipled fight," he said, on the fighting that
took place in Matabeleland between 1983 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he and Nkomo looked at the situation at that time
and saw that the "quarrel" had caused untold suffering to the
people, hence the signing of the unity accord.
</P>
<P>
"It was an act of madness, we killed each other and destroyed
each other' s property. It was wrong and both sides were to
blame," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Facilitation Team to Meet Mandela on Peace Protocols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The facilitation team on
Burundi peace talks is to meet the mediator, former South African
President Nelson Mandela on July 10 in Johannesburg to brief him
on peace protocols.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mark Bomani, head of the team, told journalists in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha on Saturday that they will
also discuss with the facilitator subsequent programs for various
activities in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The team, he said, has been revising the draft peace proposals,
 " updating them to take into account response of various parties
during the last few weeks".
</P>
<P>
"We're in advanced stages in the negotiations and we're
positively on course," said Bomani.
</P>
<P>
All 19 parties participating the talks have submitted their
inputs on the draft peace deal text, including a breakaway armed
rebel group CNDD-FDD (the National Defense Council of
Democracy-the Defense Force of Democracy), which submitted its
ideas last week.
</P>
<P>
However, Bomani declined to disclose the contents of FDD's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
He said his team is still waiting for draft proposals from
another rebel group FLN (the National Liberation Force), a
splinter group of PALIPEHUTU (the Hutu People's Liberation
Party), to complete all protocols.
</P>
<P>
Although not yet formalized, an agreement aimed at ending the
violence that has resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000
people, centers on the creation of a transitional government, the
integration of Hutu rebels into the Tutsi-dominated army and an
electoral system that will ensure power- sharing between the
minority Tutsis and majority Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of violence in Burundi was set off in October
1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, a
Hutu who had won the country's first democratic elections four
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha negotiations began in July 1998. Last year, Mandela
replaced the late Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere as mediator
and invited all the Hutu rebel groups that had been previously
excluded to take part in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Namibian President Urges African Countries to Support Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma
Sunday urged African governments to support the development of
private sector by creating conductive environment.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 24th annual Dar es Salaam International Trade fair,
the visiting Namibian president said the small and medium
enterprises must be promoted because they create employment
opportunities for the majority of people and subsequently improve
their living standard.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma also called on African leaders to promote trade among
themselves and share experiences on ways to improve their
economies.
</P>
<P>
African countries are faced with the challenge of laying
strategies to utilize the abundant unexploited wealth to improve
their economies and ensure that they do no lag behind other
countries in the race of science and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is the richest of all continent, with vast unexploited
minerals and virgin agricultural land," said Nujoma, stressing
that the untapped wealth should be used in promoting economic
development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dar es Salaam trade fair provides a place for the
display of products from different parts in the world. It offers
information to consumers and an opportunity for interaction
between exhibitors and visitors.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, who arrived in Dar es Salaam on Saturday for a
three-day state visit, also pledged his country's commitment to
promote the existing good political and socio-economic relations
with Tanzania and called for more intimate trade ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
This year's Dar es Salaam trade fair has attracted more than
1,000 local and foreign companies from 35 countries. It is
expected to end next Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 13 Tanzanians Missing in Boat Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Tanzanians are
feared to have drowned to death in the Indian Ocean after a
fishing boat capsized at a bay in Tanzania's Coast Region at dawn
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated vessel, christened Odysseas, had 28 passengers on
board when it overturned after being hit by a strong wave,
according to chief marine engineer Josephat Natianota of the
Tanzania Harbors Authority.
</P>
<P>
The engineer told the official Daily News on Sunday evening
that 15 people were rescued by fishermen who were in other
fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
The survivors clutched at the vessels' life saving equipment
for some hours before they were rescued and ferried to Dar es
Salaam later in the day, said Natianota.
</P>
<P>
People feared dead include the vessels' crew, particularly
those who were in the engine room and the wheel room.
</P>
<P>
According to Natianota, divers in navy boats went to the scene
of the accident on Saturday morning in search of the missing
persons, but they could do nothing because the vessel had already
sunk in deep sea.
</P>
<P>
"Unless miracles happen, the missing persons cannot be traced
again," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel, India Seek Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel and India have agreed to
establish a diplomatic and security dialogue to further boost their
bilateral ties established eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between visiting Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign
Minister David Levy on Sunday, the leaders of both countries
discussed ways to cement ties in a spectrum of fields including
trade, weaponry as well as science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Levy also called on his Indian counterpart to join in the
efforts of fighting for the release of the 10 Jews convicted and
sentenced to prison terms by an Iranian court over espionage
charges.
</P>
<P>
Singh arrived in Israel Friday on a four-day visit. It is the
first visit of the Indian foreign minister to the Jewish state
since the two nations established diplomatic relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to trade officials in Singh's entourage, the
Indian-Israeli trade is standing at one billion U.S. dollars with
an annual 46-percent growth rate. The trade ties are particularly
marked by the fact that the two countries control 95 percent of the
diamond cutting and polishing industry in the world.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Libya to Resume Air Flights by This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir, the national carrier of
Egypt, will resume flights to Libya this month after a hiatus of
eight years, an official of the airline said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The development comes following intervention of the two
countries' leaders, aimed at the resumption of flights, initially
scheduled for April 1999, the official was quoted as saying by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The delay for more than one year was caused by technical and
commercial problems, the official said on condition of anonymity.
He added that three return flights in a week will be organized in
the last 10 days of July, including two between Cairo and Tripoli
and one between Cairo and Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from EgyptAir will head for Tripoli in the coming
days to make the final preparations for the resumption of flights
and discussion of re-opening EgyptAir offices in Libya, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
An international air embargo imposed on Libya in April 1992 was
suspended last year after Libya's handover of two Libyans suspected
of
the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinian Officials React to Barak's Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Police Chief Al-Ghazy Al-
Gabaly has said the Palestinian people are ready to defend their
territories in case of any Israeli reaction to the unilateral
proclamation of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people, who have a long history of revolutions
and struggle, will stand against any Israeli reaction", Al-Ghazy, a
member of the Central Committee of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization, said during the Central Committee meetings which
started in Gaza Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will discuss the declaration of the Palestinian
state during the two-day meetings.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said a few days ago that in
case of the unilateral declaration of the Palestinian state, Israel
will start to control new Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gabaly expressed his hope that Israel will not think of this
mistaken decision which might cost it dearly as it can not have
forgotten the Palestinian intifada.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are unanimous in the issue of declaring the
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, he said, pointing
out this will crown the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are able to defend their territories against
the Israeli potential invasion to bar the declaration of the state,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Azzam al-Ahmad, the Palestinian Minister of Works and
a member of the Central Committee, crossed his fingers that the
declaration of the Palestinian sovereignty will be made within an
agreed-upon framework with Israeli so as to head off many problems.
</P>
<P>
Efforts can be intensified for reaching an agreement on the
outstanding disputes before the end of the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations after a couple of months, the minister requested.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians believe that they are entitled to have an
independent state proclaimed no later than September 13, a self-
imposed deadline for the Palestinians and Israel to reach a final
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of the Palestinian state is contingent upon the
Israeli, Arab and international position, said Azzam, reiterating
that the declaration can be delayed for weeks if an agreement with
Israel is in sight.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli threats against the declaration, the
minister said "It seems that it is the anti-peace hard-line trend
in Israel which is the decision-maker."
</P>
<P>
He said "Barak has never forgotten his long-standing bloody
history." Israel's military preparations in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip indicate the coming stage will witness confrontations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces in the occupied Palestinian territories have
recently been provided with more heavy weapons. The security in
Israeli settlements has also been tightened, according to official
Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee meetings were attended by the majority of
members from diverse groups of the PLO.
</P>
<P>
PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat delivered a
speech on the latest political developments during the meetings.
The meetings will also discuss a report on the outcomes of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and means of effectuating the PLO
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The meetings were boycotted by the two Islamic Hamas and Jihad
movements which are opposed Oslo Agreement, even though they were
invited to attend the meetings.
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin
had attended the Committee meetings held late April 1999 as an
observer. At the time, the committee decided to put the declaration
of the Palestinian state on the back burner as the date of the
Israeli elections was near.

<HEADLINE> Israel not to Send Commandos For Releasing Iranian Jews: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not send commandos to
Iran for freeing 10 Jewish people who was sentenced Saturday to
prison terms for spying for Israel, a senior Israeli cabinet
official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government will continue to adopt political and
diplomatic measures just as it has been doing since these Iranian
Jews were arrested last spring, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Yitzhak
Herzog told the press.
</P>
<P>
Herzog, one of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's confidants,
also released a prepared government statement, which he stressed
was a cabinet decision unanimously approved in Sunday morning's
weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated Israel, along with "the entire
enlightened world", condemned Saturday's verdict against "innocent
Jews whose only sin is their Jewish origin."
</P>
<P>
"This was not a just trial, but a farcical procedure," it added.
</P>
<P>
Barak had discussed this with a number of world leaders,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, as the state of the Jewish people, will spare no effort
to secure the freedom of those "innocent Jewish brothers." Barak
also called on "the entire free world" to join this effort, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian Revolutionary Court in Shiraz Saturday convicted
these Iranian Jews of spying for Israel and sentenced them to
prison terms ranging from four to 13 years, ending an 11-week trial
of the espionage case.
</P>
<P>
Several Western countries condemned the verdict as a "grave
injustice and gross violation of human rights" and demanded an
immediate release of the Iranian Jews as Israel had denied any
links between their intelligence services and the accused.
</P>
<P>
Tehran, however, insisted these Jews were convicted because of
their cooperation with a hostile government, membership in an
illegal spy ring, and recruitment of new agents.
</P>
<P>
There are about 25,000 Jews in Iran, the largest Jewish
community in the Middle East region outside Israel. Among them, 6,
000 live in Shiraz, a city in the southern Fars province.

<HEADLINE> Iran Satisfied with Tehran-Cairo Cooperation: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi Sunday expressed his country's satisfaction with
cooperation with Egypt but denied a report on resumption of full
relations soon.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt have had good cooperation in the cultural,
economic and international spheres and such cooperation has gained
momentum in recent months, Asefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the factors bringing the two countries closer include
the stances taken by Egypt against Israel's refusal to join the
international disarmament treaty and against the Jewish regime's
expansionist policies in the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied, however, Iran and Egypt are to resume full
diplomatic relations in the near future, as reported by Reuters on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad
Hussein Adeli as saying in Switzerland that the two countries have
a plan to announce the official resumption of full diplomatic
relations in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official had not referred to a specific date for the
resumption of Tehran-Cairo ties and the news report had misquoted
him on the issue, Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt severed their diplomatic relations after the 1979
Islamic revolution as Tehran was not satisfied with Cairo's peace
accord with Israel, a country that Iran does not recognize.
</P>
<P>
However, with the foreign policy of detente advocated by Iran's
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, Iran and Egypt have markedly
improved bilateral relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak made a telephone
call to Iranian President Khatami to congratulate Iran on its new
membership in the Group 15 (G15) developing countries.
</P>
<P>
As it was the first such top-contact between the two countries
in 21 years of strained relations, many people considered it a
prelude to the full resumption of ties.
</P>
<P>
Officials and media of both countries highly praised this
contact, expressing hope that the two countries may exchange
ambassadors soon.
</P>
<P>
However, if the two countries are to really resume relations,
some obstacles have to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
Cairo cannot accept a full restoration of ties until Iran re-
names a Tehran street named in honor of former Egyptian president
Sadat's principal assassin, Khaled Islamboli.
</P>
<P>
Islamic hard-liners in Iran also oppose reconciliation with
Egypt, a major U.S. ally in the region. They insist that Egypt must
demolish the tomb of former Iranian Shah, who got shelter from
Egypt after the Islamic revolution and died in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Strategic Option of Palestinians: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat said on Sunday the peace process is
the strategic option of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech to the Palestinian Central Committee (PCC)
session, he said the terms of reference of the peace process are
the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 as well as the
resolutions on Palestinian refugees, adding none of the concerned
parties has the right to give up the terms of reference.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also reviewed the political developments and the
challenges facing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The PCC is expected to set during its two-day session the date
for declaration of a Palestinian state later this year.
</P>
<P>
Early February, the PCC said the Palestinian statehood would be
declared this year.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that the Palestinian-Israeli final
status talks should end by September 13, the deadline of
incarnation of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli ties are strained at present due to
sharp differences over the final-status issues such as border,
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Blocking Anti-AIDS Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President
Jacob Zuma on Sunday blamed poverty for hindering the fight
against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Here in our own continent we are seeing we need an African
solution to the problem," he told a top-level conference of United
States and South African government officials, law-makers and
scientists in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, prior to the international AIDS
conference in Durban this week, is addressing issues of substance
abuse, crime, violence and HIV/AIDS resulting from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said many South Africans were driven by poverty to
disregard the accepted wisdom on avoiding HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge facing South Africa and most developing
countries was the eradication of poverty, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
As long as poverty and dependence rendered South Africa's women
and children defenceless, and ignorance prevented the rest of the
society from recognizing that their actions counted in the fight
against HIV/AIDS, "our society will not be free of this scourge",
he said.
</P>
<P>
While it was scientifically accepted that HIV/AIDS knew no
social, gender or racial boundaries, it was a fact that the virus
was to be found in greater concentration among the poorer sections
of society, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said it was
estimated one in 10 South Africans was infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
But the government had allocated 75 million rand (about 1.1
million U.S. dollars) to fighting the scourge, she said.

of Africa Unity (OAU) and European Community.

<P>
"The referendum was conducted in an atmosphere of peace and
marked by a high degree of transparency, and the people of Uganda
are of maturity, patience and discipline," said the OAU observers
after they observed all the polling activities including relevant
administrative arrangements in eight districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The NGO observers were generally satisfied with the conduct of
the voting, and the people were free to vote for their chosen
political system. Ugandans were able to vote peacefully and free
from intimidation," Canon Grace Kaiso, national co-ordinator of
Non-government-organization Monitoring Cluster, told a press
conference here Saturday .
</P>
<P>
The monitoring cluster of the Referendum 2000 NGO Consortium
has monitored the referendum for the last five months. On the
polling day, they deployed 7,213 observers throughout the country
who witnessed voting in 10, 115 of the 16,498 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement by Donor Referendum 2000 Group said,
"the voting itself appeared to be conducted in a peaceful and
orderly fashion. However, the Group has concluded that the
referendum campaign as a whole was not conducted on a level
playing field."
</P>
<P>
Resources available to the ruling Movement were substantially
larger than those available to pro-multiparty advocates, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Movement's success was attributed to the political
stability, as well as social and economic progress since it came
to power in 1986, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Constitution defines the Movement Political System
as broad- based, inclusive and non-partisan, which features the
participatory democracy, transparency, accessibility to all
positions of leadership by all citizens, and individual merit as
a basis for election to political offices.

<HEADLINE> Seven Burnt to Death in Taxi Accident in East S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were burnt to
death when a taxi they were travelling in caught fire after
colliding with a car in east South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Province
on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Provincial traffic spokesman Vijen Murugan said the accident
happened at around 2 a.m. when the taxi transporting people from a
church meeting in the town of KwaNdengezi collided head-on with
another car.
</P>
<P>
The taxi caught fire and it spread rapidly to the interior.
</P>
<P>
Murugan said seven people, including the driver, were consumed
by the flames and 13 others suffered serious burns and were taken
to nearby hospitals where some of them were reported to be in a
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Murugan said evidence gathered at the scene strongly suggested
that the taxi was travelling on the wrong lane.
</P>
<P>
The other car was extensively damaged.
</P>
<P>
An intensive investigation into the accident had been launched.

<HEADLINE> S. African Presidential AIDS Panel Gears up for Discussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Presidential
AIDS Advisory Panel on Sunday geared up for its final round of
meetings scheduled for Monday and Tuesday to prepare a report on
the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"We expect these debates and discussions to be as robust as
they were the first time," President of the South African National
Research Foundation Khotso Mokhele told reporters in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
He said information would be distilled from discussions, and a
report would be formulated and presented to President Thabo
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki set up the panel to test assumptions about AIDS and
advise the government on how to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
The panel is made up of more than 30 scientists enlisted by
South Africa, who are evenly split between experts questioning the
link between HIV and AIDS and those subscribing to the
conventional view.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has come under fire in recent months for reportedly
saying that he was not convinced that HIV was the single virus
causing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Mokhele said the argument surrounding the divergent views on
the causes of AIDS was very much "alive not for the purpose of
intellectual debate" but to help the government form appropriate
programs and policies to deal with the pandemic.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Police
Services (SAPS) has launched a crackdown on police corruption to
ensure a clean police force in the fight against rampant crimes.
</P>
<P>
In northeast South Africa's Mpumalanga Province alone, the
operation has nabbed at least 32 police officers on fraud-related
incidents since the beginning of the year, the South African Press
Association reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted provincial police spokesman Senior
Superintendent Theo du Bruyn as saying a six-member police
anti-corruption unit was probing fraud allegations against
another 193 policemen.
</P>
<P>
He said 25 officers had been convicted of corruption, ranging
from accepting bribes from suspects to stealing petrol from the
police stores.
</P>
<P>
He said the SAPS viewed the involvement of police in corruption
in a serious light.
</P>
<P>
"We will not leave any stone unturned until we root out all the
corrupt officers in the service," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Makes Final Salary Offer to Public Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has made a final offer to public servants on a 6 percent increase
of their salary, Public Service and Administration Minister
Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the government was willing to negotiate employee benefits
with public service unions, she told reporters in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the 12 public service unions last
month rejected the 6 percent offer. Most of the unions are
demanding a pay rise of 10 percent for the 2000-2001 financial
year.
</P>
<P>
"The 6 percent offer on the salary increase is final, but we
are open to discussion on areas related to benefits,"
Fraser-Moleketi said.
</P>
<P>
She said joint task teams were established to discuss the
restructuring of employee benefits such as leave, medical aid,
pension funds, HIV/AIDS policy and housing.
</P>
<P>
"The current employee benefits are not equitable, affordable
and not accessible by all," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fraser-Moleketi also reiterated that the government was
committed to ending non-statutory salary deductions.
</P>
<P>
"This (non-statutory deductions) adds to pressures for
increased disposable income of public service employees," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The wage negotiations started on May 15, but broke down on June
30 when the unions indicated that they intended to declare a
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Fraser-Moleketi said they were still locked in informal
discussions with the unions.
</P>
<P>
"We are now waiting for the unions to take the dispute
further," Fraser- Moleketi said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Union Urges Legislation on Living Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Federation of Trade
Unions (ZFTU) has expressed the hope that the new lawmakers will
do their endeavors to legislate for a living wage.
</P>
<P>
ZFTU Secretary General Ephraim Tsvaringe Sunday said in a
statement that workers in the various sectors of Zimbabwe's
economy were grossly underpaid and in most cases were not paid a
living wage.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, it is our sincere hope that new lawmakers,
some of whom are former trade unionists, will make every
endeavour to legislate for a living wage so that the generality of
the Zimbabwean workers comes out of this economic malaise," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the union welcomed last weekend's parliamentary
election results as the people had spoken.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it was the implementation and fulfillment of
the party manifestos of the two major players in the governance of
the country which the electorate awaited.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabweans had demonstrated their political maturity
and the electoral laws of the country were above board.
</P>
<P>
"Having attained this high degree of democratic governance, it
is therefore imperative that we guard jealously our hard-won
independence, sovereignty, integrity and that foreign powers
should desist from dictating terms to us or interfering with our
internal affairs," he said.

<P>
DHAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An activist of the Jatiyatabadi
Chhatra Dal (Nationalist Student Party), a student front of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was killed and six others received
bullet injuries Sunday as two factions of the student group fought
with each other on the Dhaka University (DU) campus.
</P>
<P>
Eye witnesses and police sources said the clash erupted when a
faction attacked its opponents' procession in the morning of the
DU campus, a hot bed of agitational politics.
</P>
<P>
They said the activist was killed when several bombs he carried
exploded in the fight.
</P>
<P>
During the fight, the two groups exploded at least 25 homemade
bombs and traded an unspecified number of gunshots, panicking
common students, said witnesses.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting, the Dhaka University Syndicate decided
to suspended 20 students in connection with violent incidents on
the campus.
</P>
<P>
It also formed an inquiry committee in this connection, and
urged the law-enforcing agencies to take legal actions to help "
maintain a congenial academic atmosphere."

MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Three Russian policemen were killed
when their patrol car hit a self-made mine in the Chechen village
of Shelkovskaya Saturday evening, reported Russian media Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 20:30 Moscow time (1730 GMT) when the
three were driving their vehicle to a shooting range, located on
the western environs of the district center Shelkovskaya. At the
entrance to the shooting range, the car hit a landmine made out of
an artillery shell, and the policemen die of numerous
fragmentation wounds, Itar-Tass cited the police department of the
Russian Interior Ministry in Chechnya as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia's RTR television announced the dead were Alexei
Moskovkin and Yuri Sverchkov of the Moscow Regional Police
Department, and Dmitri Ovdeyev of the Podolsk Police.
</P>
<P>

Chechnya, but rebel hit-and- run attacks cost the Russian military

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Start to Vote in Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of voting stations
were opened Sunday morning in Mexico for nearly 58 million people
to choose the next president, senators and deputies.
</P>
<P>
In the most prominent election in the history of Mexico, they
will also elect three govonarates for the state of Guanajuato,
Moreleo and the Federal District of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
So far the voting has been carried out calmly, and no violence
has been reported in a country of 974 million people.
</P>
<P>
Voting was under way in the presidential election expected to
be a close contest between former Interior Minister Francisco
Labastida of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
and ex-state governor Vicente Fox, of the conservative National
Action Party (PAN). Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the center-left Party
of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) was seen running a distant
third.
</P>
<P>
This represents the strongest electoral challenge against the
PRI, which has ruled for 71 years, longer than any other party in
the world that is still in power.
</P>
<P>
The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took power in 1929,
with opinion polls predicting a neck and neck race between the PRI
's Francisco Labastida and conservative candidate Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
Labastida, 57, and Fox, who turned 58 Sunday, are both former
state governors.
</P>
<P>
In the voting, 862 foreign observers and 36,788 locals attended.
</P>
<P>
But many of the international electoral observers following the
balloting have expressed confidence there would be none of the
actual vote-rigging that had allegedly marked past elections.

<HEADLINE> Removal of Mistrust Between U.S., Iran Not Easy: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Iran's reformist Majlis
(parliament) Mehdi Karrubi said here Sunday that it is not easy
to remove the wall of mistrust between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
A lot of effort is required to break the wall of mistrust
between the two countries, said Karrubi at the end of an open
session of the new parliament, which was inaugurated on May 27.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "it is very difficult to draw an optimistic
picture for normalization of Iran-U.S. ties," the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The parliament speaker added, however, that Iran has taken a
number of steps to help strengthen understanding between the two
countries, especially since President Mohammad Khatami took office
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The idea of dialogue among civilizations, policy of detente and
exchange of sports and scientific delegations have all been aimed
at helping the American people have a better understanding of the
Iranian nation and the problems created by the U.S. government for
the Iranian nation, Karrubi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations following Iran's
1979 Islamic revolution and the hostage taking of U.S. diplomats by
radical Islamic students in the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries have thawed a little since
moderate President Khatami took office.
</P>
<P>
In March, Washington declared the lifting of a ban on three
major Iranian non-oil exports -- of pistachio, carpets and caviar -
-
as a goodwill gesture to Iranian reformers who won an overwhelming
victory in the sixth parliament election in February.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration still keeps the major part of
economic sanctions and sticks to its accusations that Iran supports
international terrorism, attempts to make mass-destructive weapons
and opposes the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Conservative hardliners in Iran also strongly opposes the
normalization of relations with the U.S., maintaining that
Washington, the main foe of Iran,attempts to stir up social and
political unrest in the country.

<HEADLINE> Cairo, Tehran Hold Talks on Normalization of Relations: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Sunday Cairo and Tehran have held talks on the
normalization of relations severed after Egypt signed a peace
agreement with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon return following visits to Poland,
Malaysia and Singapore, Moussa said the Egyptian-Iranian talks were
held "at high level" and bilateral relations "are making progress."
But he did not mention when and where the talks were held.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he "discussed ways of giving boost to the relations"
with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharazi on the sidelines of a
foreign ministers meeting of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami held a telephone conversation in the
first direct contact between leaders of the two countries in more
than two decades.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak informed Khatami of Iran's accession to the Group-15
during its summit in Cairo on June 19-20.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and Iranian officials often discuss regional issues on
occasions of multilateral meetings in recent years. The two
countries also seek means to promote economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has said it is ready to re-establish full diplomatic
relations as soon as Iran changed the name of Khaled al-Islambouli
Street in Tehran, which was named after the man who assassinated
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Crude Oil Export Rises Sharply in First Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam posted a record crude oil
export value of over 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of
the year, 88 percent higher than that of the same period last year,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas sector of the country in the six months tapped
7.4 million tons of crude oil, a year-on-year rise of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export value rose sharply due to a price hike in the
international market, said VNA, adding the average price of crude
oil in the past months stood at between 28 and 30.5 U.S.dollars

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Ready For Talks With India: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Yes, we can hold talks as per the agreed agenda. We have the
two-plus-six agenda of 1997 and the Lahore Declaration. Pakistan
is not in violation of any of these," Qazi, who is on a three-day
visit to the northeastern Indian city of Calcutta, was quoted as
saying by the Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
According to the two-plus-six agenda, which was worked out in
Islamabad in June 1997 by the two sides and had identified eight
outstanding bilateral issues between the two south Asian neighbors,
foreign secretaries of both countries will discuss peace and
security including confidence building measures that would deal
with the nuclear issue, the arms race and the Kashmir question,
Qazi noted.
</P>
<P>
Other issues listed in the agenda included terrorism and drug
trafficking and economic and business cooperation between the two
sides, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was later reiterated in the Lahore Declaration
following a summit meeting between Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee
and the then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was ready to hold talks strictly according to the June
1997 agreement and the February 1998 Lahore Declaration, said Qazi.
</P>
<P>
In his address in Calcutta, Qazi also urged India to hold
bilateral discussions on Kashmir with Pakistan, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
"You need to adopt a pragmatic approach and an open mind. You
have already lost the battle of hearts and minds in Kashmir," Qazi
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani envoy also expressed his country's keenness to
exchange information with India on the two neighbors' nuclear
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
"We need to know each other's nuclear philosophy and command
and control systems," he said, adding that India and Pakistan
should keep each other informed in this regard just as what Russia
and the United States have done.

Conference (CPPCC), met today with a delegation from the Central
American Parliament, headed by its Vice-President Rodrigo Samayoa
Rivas.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of

<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic briefs
in the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is badly in need of natural gas as the gas
consumption is sharply on the rise, reported Turkish daily News on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the state-owned Turkish Pipeline Company
(BOTAS) Gokhan Yardim said at a meeting in Izmir in southwest
Turkey that the country's natural gas consumption rises by 19
percent annually, the highest growth rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the economic growth, industrialization, increase
in population and fast urbanization to the roaring energy
consumption, especially natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is expected to consume 15 billion cubic meters of natural
gas in 2000 and 55 billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has signed natural gas agreements with Russia,
Turkmenistan and Iran, and liquid natural gas agreements with
Algeria and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's production, domestic sales and exports of
television sets rose by 35 percent in the runup period to the Euro
2000 Soccer Championship and the Olympic Games in Sydney,
Australia, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Maral Oztekin, president of the Association of Electronic Goods
Manufacturers, said that the output of TV sets in the first five
months of 2000 increased to 3.56 million from 2.64 million in the
same period of 1999. Meanwhile, big-screen TV set sales rose from
403,000 to 660,000.
</P>
<P>
"We expected a 15 percent increase in TV sales, but Euro 2000
and Sydney Olympics have doubled the sales," he said.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Tourism Investors Association (TYD) and
the Greek Tourism Entrepreneurs Association (AGTE) decided to work
together in the tourism sector, reported the Anatolia News Agency
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The TYD and AGTE representatives met in Bodrum, west Turkey, on
Saturday night and decided to turn the Aegean to a "sea of peace"
and explore the Aegean tourism market. They also agreed on
exchanges of tourism personnel.
</P>
<P>
There will be two tourism fairs in Salonica, Greece, in fall and
in Istanbul in February, 2001. Both associations will be
represented at the fairs.
</P>
<P>
A joint committee will meet in Istanbul in July and in Athens in

<P>
ABU DHABI -- The gross domestic product (GDP) of Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states in 1999 reached 266.5 billion U.S.
dollars against 260.8 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Industrial Investment Agency's release attributed the
upsurge to the upward oil price last year and the burgeoning growth
rates in Europe and Asia which led to a rise in total earnings of
GCC members from 42 billion dollars in l998 to over 70 billion
dollars in l999.
</P>
<P>
The improving economic performance in GCC states brought about
GDP growth from 1.03 percent in l998 to 2.21 percent in 1999, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the OPEC members' compliance with the March, l999,
Crude Reduction Agreement, the GCC states had more oil revenues
which stepped up their economic growth, according to the release.
The GCC states are the biggest oil producers in OPEC.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) achieved the highest growth rates
among GCC countries to 4.0 percent followed by Oman 3.7 percent,
Bahrain 3.2 percent, Saudi Arabia 1.8 percent, Qatar 1.3 percent
and Kuwait 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Personal Financial Records Database Operational in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- This metropolis in east China has
started the operation of a database on the personal financial
records of 1.1 million local residents.
</P>
<P>
This is the first database of its kind in the whole country.
The database, run by the Shanghai Credit Information Service Co.
Ltd, collects all the information on a resident's lending and
borrowing records and bank accounts in all the financial
institutions, serving as a reference for banks and social
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Banks will dial a number into the database before making a
decision on whether or not to grant loans to an applicant. Bank
staff will be able to get the needed information on the particular
person in five seconds.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the database will improve credit card business
and reduce the loan risks and operational costs of banks and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Such database have long been in existence in developed
countries, and for 17 years in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the People's Bank of China, Shanghai
started the database construction in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese cities are expected to get approval for similar
databases, it was learned.

<HEADLINE> China Reaches World's Advanced Level in Remote Sensing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's remote sensing technology,
which is widely used in the domestic grain output assessment,
resource exploration and disaster monitoring, has reached the
world's advanced level, said an expert from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Though China has a more complicated situation of crop
cultivation, the accuracy of image and data processing of the
grain output assessment in China is on a par with that in the
United States and European countries, said Nie Yueping, a
researcher from the Institute of Remote Sensing Application under
the CAS.
</P>
<P>
He said that the institute used data from meteorological
satellites to monitor the growth of winter wheat in 11 provinces
and municipalities in north China during the 1986-1990 period, and
provided important reference for the government's grain purchase
plan in summer.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the institute built an information
system to monitor and estimate the output of the three major kinds
of crops in China -- wheat, corn and paddy rise -- which account
for more than 85 percent of the country's total grain output.
</P>
<P>
The institute is now able to provide services for monitoring
and estimating the growth and output of crops all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the institute also use satellite remote sensing
techniques to monitor the expansion of urban areas and the illegal
use of farmland for construction. In addition, remote sensing
plays an important role in the monitoring and forecasting of
natural disasters such as floods and drought.
</P>
<P>
"We have even used the technology to do some things which we
had never expected to do," said Nie. "For example, we used it to
help discover buried cultural relics."
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the institute provided remote sensing pictures
of an ancient tomb in suburban Beijing to archeologists, who
decided that there were other tombs of the same size near the
original one.
</P>
<P>
Nie said that the next goal for the institute is to do global
grain output assessment. With an estimation of grain output
worldwide, China will be able to adjust the domestic grain growth
and output accordingly, and thus play a better role in global
economic integration.

<HEADLINE> CPC Should Better Represent Advanced Culture: Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)
should better represent the progressive course of China's advanced
culture, a Xinhua commentary said here today.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the CPC must always stand in the
forefront of the times, lead the nation to create an advanced
culture befitting the times and historical developments, and
become the leader and disseminator of such advanced culture, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua commentary came at a time when the Party is
intensifying its efforts to study the recent important speech made
by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also China's president, said during his inspection tour
of south China's Guangdong Province earlier this year that the key
to running China well lies in the CPC, in its ideology, style of
work, organization, discipline, capabilities and leadership.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will remain successful and enjoy the heartfelt support
of the people of China so long as the Party earnestly represents
the development requirements of China's advanced social productive
forces, the progressive course of China's advanced culture and the
fundamental interests of the Chinese people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The speech represents a high condensation and scientific
summary of the historical experience of the CPC in its efforts for
revolution, construction and reform over the past 80 years,
according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The progressive course of the advanced culture means the
building of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, which
is made up of two parts: socialist ideology and ethics, and modern
science and culture.
</P>
<P>
To represent the progressive course of this advanced culture,
it is of the utmost importance that Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory be always upheld as the
guidelines, the commentary stressed.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Hosts China's First Ethnic Costume Expo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An exposition showing more than 3,
000 unique and valuable costumes worn by various ethnic minority
groups in China opened today in this capital of southwest China's
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Among the items on display, there is a patched coat of fish
skins, which is typical of the traditional costume of the Hezhe
people, who live in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, and a
Tibetan costume worth more than 800,000 yuan (about 97,000 U.S.
dollars), which is some 300 or 400 years old.
</P>
<P>
The Exposition of Ethnic Clothing and Decorations, co-hosted by
the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Yunnan provincial
government, is the first of its kind ever held in China, which is
home to 56 nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo attended the opening ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 costumes with distinctive national features,
as well as some ancient ones, were collected for the exposition
from 27 provinces, including 58 items of clothing of the Gaoshan
people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ten costumes decorated with gold, silver and jewels, which are
worth 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million dollars) in total, were
escorted by armed policemen to Yunnan from neighboring Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, about 400 exhibition booths at a garment fair
have been occupied by dress production and marketing enterprises
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
A fashion design contest focusing on national features and a
competition of models displaying ethnic garments will be held
during the exposition, involving 590 fashion designers and 587
models from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinyou, vice-minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission,
said he hoped that clothing with ethnic features will be accepted
as daily articles of clothing by more Chinese people through such
activities.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Foreign Criticism of Verdicts on Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday strongly rejected
Western criticism of its sentencing 10 Iranian Jews on charges of
spying for Israel as "foreign intervention."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said Iran would not
accept any interventionist attitudes aimed at influencing its
judicial process.
</P>
<P>
"The courts of the Islamic Republic of Iran investigated the
case and issued verdicts independently," Asefi said, "political
stands of no country would have any impact on the judicial process
of the courts."
</P>
<P>
Iran's revolutionary court on Saturday sentenced 10 out of 13
Jews, and two Muslims accused of spying to terms ranging from four
to 13 years in prison. The other three Jews were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews were arrested more than one year ago in Shiraz,
capital of Fars Province, the center of Iran's Jewish community of
about 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The accused have been treated kindly and they also have the
right to appeal, the spokesman said, quoted by the official IRNA
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and trial of the Jews sparked protests from Israel
and Western countries who demanded their release. Iran insisted
that the case has nothing to do with religious beliefs and no
foreign country should interfere in its domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., France and a number of EU countries have condemned the
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
Asefi called on the Western governments to observe the
principles of international law and refrain from interfering in the
domestic affairs of other states.

<HEADLINE> Injured Iranians Released from Hospital in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 39 Iranians out of 43
accident-survived passengers were released after treatment in
hospital of Erzurum, east Turkey, on Sunday, reported the Anatolia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A traffic accident took place in Erzurum province Saturday night
when a long-distance Iranian passenger bus, coming from Tehran to
Istanbul, was turning over from an overpass in Yenisehir
intersection. All the 43 occupants were injured.
</P>
<P>
The other four Iranians, including the bus driver, still remain
in the hospital for further treatment.
</P>
<P>
Lutfullah Zakeri, Iranian Chief Consul in Erzurum, thanked
Erzurum Governor Derya Kadioglu, police officials and hospital
staff for the timely rescue and medical treatment of the Iranian
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is notorious for frequent traffic accidents. Over the
last two decades, the number of people who died in traffic
accidents has totalled 163,000, and more than one million injured.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer underlined the need to
enact a traffic law to lessen traffic accidents and do away with
fatal tragedies.
</P>
<P>
A traffic law will be beneficial to the entire society, said the
president while receiving Boray Uras, who lost his daughter in a
traffic accident in Istanbul earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Uras traveled from Istanbul to Ankara on foot to draw public
attention to Turkey's traffic problem and rally support for passing
a traffic law.

<HEADLINE> Jet Carrying Philippine Cabinet Members Loses Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A jet carrying five Philippine
cabinet members suddenly lost pressure due to a door seal leak
while flying to Manila from a southern city on Saturday night, and
landed safely in Manila later, a government official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plane carried Public Works secretary Gregorio Vigilar,
Agrarian Reform secretary Horacio Morales, and three other
officials of cabinet rank who accompanied President Joseph Estada
in a visit to Davao,said Press undersecretary Icasiano Guetierrez,
who was also aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
Estrada left Davao on another plane, he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said they were flying in stormy weather over
Marinduque when they heard a loud thud near the plane door
followed by a sudden lost of plane pressure.
</P>
<P>
"The plane bobbed up and down, almost losing control. The
pilots hurriedly reached out for the emergency oxygen masks and
the emergency book manual,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The pilots brought the plane from 18,000 feet to 11,000 feet to
stabilize the plane with a red emergency light continuously
flashing in the cabin, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last April, a Boeing jet slammed into a tree-covered hill on
Samal island near the Davao airport in the southern Philippines,
killing all 131 people aboard in the country's worst air disaster.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang Shuts Down Polluting Smelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Production at the Shenyang
Smelting Plant, a large state-owned enterprise in this capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province, was halted today, as its
emission of pollution was higher than the state standard.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a large state-owned enterprise
anywhere in China has been closed down because it was emitting
pollution.
</P>
<P>
This morning, all the plant's equipment, which had kept running
for more than half a century, came to a standstill, and workers
were busy clearing waste.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuying, a local resident who has lived near the plant for
more than 20 years, said that she and her family were pleased to
hear the news about the suspension of the plant. "We will be able
to breeze fresh air from now on," said a smiling Liu.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1936, the Shenyang Smelting Plant was one of the
backbone enterprises of China's metallurgical industry. In the
1980s, it stood in the 69th place among the 500 largest state-
owned enterprises of the country. Its gold, silver, copper, lead
and zinc products were one of the biggest in terms of quantity.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that it had contributed greatly to China's
economic development, it discharged large quantities of waste
residue, water, and dust, which caused great harm to the health of
the local residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the local environmental protection department,
every year the plant discharged into the air 74,000 tons of sulfur
dioxide and 66.8 tons of heavy metal, polluting one fourth of the
total area of Shenyang, one of oldest industrial bases in China.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the Shenyang City People's Congress, Liaoning
Provincial People's Congress and National People's Congress time
and again appealed for a solution to the pollution issue of the
plant, and in May this year the State Council approved a decision
to gradually reduce production at the plant until its operations
were finally suspended.
</P>
<P>
Meng Fanguang, a 47-year old worker at the plant, said, "More
than 10,000 workers in our plant have to accept the fact of the
suspension and change to other jobs. For me and my colleagues, the
closing of the plant might not be good, but for most of the
citizens of Shenyang, it is very good."
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, once known as one of the top ten most polluted cities
in the world, has put high great store on the improvement of its
environment in recent years. Last year, it was listed by the
United Nations as a demonstration city for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of the smelting plant shows the city's
determination that it is making efforts to get rid of pollution
completely in an early date, said a local official.

BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Ph.D. candidates will
set out tomorrow to work in China's western areas to assist with
local economic development.
</P>
<P>
At a departure ceremony held at Qinghua University here today,
a senior official from the Central Committee of the Communist

</P>
<P>
There are some one million college students nationwide
participating in the volunteer program.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huan, a volunteer and also a Ph.D. candidate from Qinghua
University, said that the volunteers will give lectures and help
out with some projects to assist the west.
</P>
<P>
He added that he values the opportunity of going to the west
because he has set his sights on a career in Xi'an, capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six students from Hong Kong are also participating
in the program. "We students from Hong Kong are very concerned
about the development of the west. We are not merely content with
the summer vacation volunteer program; we will maintain contact
with the local governments after the program finishes," said Liu
Weiping, a Ph.D. candidate from the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The summer vacation program, which started in 1997, has played
an important role in helping promote local economic development in
China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Expresses Concern Over Fireworks Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
expressed deep concern over the recent fireworks explosion in
south China's Guangdong Province, urging local governments to take
immediate measures to ensure industrial safety.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, at a fireworks factory at 8:05 am Friday in
Jiangmen City, claimed 36 lives, leaving 160 people injured and
more than 30 missing.
</P>
<P>
The provincial committee of the Communist Party of China and
the provincial government called an emergency meeting in Jiangmen
Saturday morning to make arrangements for safety and rescue work
in enterprises throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all fireworks factories and manufacturers of
cigarette lighters in the province have been ordered to suspend
production. Plants of this kind which are located in the populous
delta area of the Pearl River may even be closed down.
</P>
<P>
Rescue and restoration work in aftermath of the blast is still
underway.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the explosion was ignited by sparks
produced by employees pounding iron nails inside the warehouse
building.
</P>
<P>
The explosion leveled the 3,200-sq-m factory belonging to the
Jiangmen Local Products Export Company. It also blew off roofs,
shattered windows and collapsed walls of buildings up to one
kilometer away, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris, local
doctors said.
</P>
<P>
The factory had reportedly ignored an order from local fire
departments to improve its fire-fighting and alarm systems.

<HEADLINE> No Date Set For Three-Way Summit: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- No date has been set for a three-
day summit in Washington to discuss the Middle East peace process,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing his cabinet about the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks and the proposed three-way summit between
himself, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Barak said Clinton has not made up his mind to call the
summit in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Only President Clinton has the right to decide on when to hold
this summit, but the president decided to postpone to make such a
decision and therefore there will be no three-day summit for the
near future," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak strongly supported the idea of convening this summit,
saying it is time for both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to make
decisions on key issues discussed in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But the idea was opposed by Arafat. He refused to attend the
summit before gaps between the Palestinians and Israel are narrowed
on all key issues including Jerusalem, borders, refugees, and
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat instead urged Clinton to organize another round of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to narrow the gaps before calling
for a summit.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein stuck to his position that the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 did not apply to Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations to solve the border issues, saying the
resolutions were passed more than 25 years ago before the
establishment of the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
His similar remarks Thursday drew rebuff from the Palestinians
and the United States, who said the two U.N. resolutions calling
for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories and talks to start
for "establishing a just and durable peace," are the basis for
resolving the Middle East conflict.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement issued Friday in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, Arafat sharply denounced this Israeli position, which he
said is very dangerous and "Israel is making an effort to thwart
the whole peace process."
</P>
<P>
Also rejecting Rubinstein's position, the United states said
Saturday that the resolutions do apply to Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said on Sunday that
Rubinstein's position is wrong and his remarks did not represent
the government's stance on this issue.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll from Embargo over 1.3 Million: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.3 million Iraqi have
died because of the decade-old devastating U.N. embargo, Iraq's
Health Ministry said in a report released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that from August 1990 till the end of last May,
a total of 1,316,578 Iraqis perished due to the "disastrous
effects" of the embargo on Iraq's health sector. Among the victims
were 600,000 children under the age of five, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that such a high mortality was caused by
diarrhea, pneumonia, respiratory infections and other curable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition was also attributed to the rise of mortality among
children.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the mortality rate among newborn
children has risen to 207 per thousand, while before the embargo
there were only 42 deaths per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Surgical operations have been decreased by 66 percent due to the
acute shortage of medical appliances caused by the embargo, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. embargo ever since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) has said in a recent report that life in Iraq is increasing
desperate in spite of an oil-for-food deal intended to ease the
bite of the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
"Deteriorating living conditions, inflation, and low salaries
make people's everyday lives a continuing struggle," the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that the U.N. oil-for-food program, which allows it
to sell oil to buy humanitarian necessities, has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> No Date Set For Three-Way Summit: Barak EDS-Retransmitting with corrections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- No date has been set for a three-
way summit in Washington to discuss the Middle East peace process,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing his cabinet about the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks and the proposed three-way summit between
himself, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Barak said Clinton has not made up his mind to call the
summit in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Only President Clinton has the right to decide on when to hold
this summit, but the president decided to postpone to make such a
decision and therefore there will be no three-way summit for the
near future," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak strongly supported the idea of convening this summit,
saying it is time for both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to make
decisions on key issues discussed in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But the idea was opposed by Arafat. He refused to attend the
summit before gaps between the Palestinians and Israel are narrowed
on all key issues including Jerusalem, borders, refugees, and
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat instead urged Clinton to organize another round of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to narrow the gaps before calling
for a summit.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein stuck to his position that the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 did not apply to Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations to solve the border issues, saying the
resolutions were passed more than 25 years ago before the
establishment of the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
His similar remarks Thursday drew rebuff from the Palestinians
and the United States, who said the two U.N. resolutions calling
for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories and talks to start
for "establishing a just and durable peace," are the basis for
resolving the Middle East conflict.
</P>
<P>
In an official statement issued Friday in the West Bank city of
Ramallah, Arafat sharply denounced this Israeli position, which he
said is very dangerous and "Israel is making an effort to thwart
the whole peace process."
</P>
<P>
Also rejecting Rubinstein's position, the United states said
Saturday that the resolutions do apply to Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said on Sunday that
Rubinstein's position is wrong and his remarks did not represent
the government's stance on this issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of men posing as army
personnel escaped with a substantial amount of weapons from an
army camp in northern Malaysia, Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak
said.
</P>
<P>
In the incident early Sunday morning, 15 impersonators dressed
in Malaysian army camouflage uniforms entered the 304 territorial
army camp at Pengkalan Hulu in the northern state of Perak, he
said at the Subang air force base near here.
</P>
<P>
"All 15 of them came and fled in three green Pajero vehicles
bearing military plates," he told reporters after receiving
Singapore Defense Minister Tony Tan.
</P>
<P>
M16 and Steyr rifles were among the more than 90 weapons carted
away.
</P>
<P>
He said the men told the sentries that they were there to make
a surprise check.
</P>
<P>
The guards tried to verify the matter with higher authorities,
but the group "asserted authority with their ranks" and demanded
to be taken to the armory.
</P>
<P>
Najib said the police and the army were conducting a major
operation in areas near the borders to track down the suspects,
adding the incident was professionally planned and unprecedented
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Deputy PM Tells Reason for Military Weapons Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Poor security check and weapon
control system allowed impersonators to cart away an assortment of
weaponry from an army camp in Malaysia's northern state of Perak
early Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
The incident showed that procedures relating to security
maintenance at key installations such as weapons depot were
ignored, Abdullah also Home Minister, said in the northern state
of Pulau Pinang, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A group of 15 impersonators dressed in Malaysian army
camouflage uniforms complete with ranks and berets entered the 304
Territorial Army camp at Pengkalan Hulu in Perak and carted away
more than 90 weapons including M16 and rifles, as officially
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said when security consideration was not put first,
incidents like the one in Pengkalan Hulu Sunday and the abduction
in Sipadan Island, off Sabah, East Malaysia, last April were bound
to happen.
</P>
<P>
Armed gunmen kidnapped 21 people, comprising Malaysians and
other foreign nationals, from Sipadan and are still holding 20 of
them in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn from these incidents," Abdullah was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned the prevailing peace had lulled Malaysians into
complacency, assuming that nothing could breach the security.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Integrated Medicine Held in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- International Conference on
Integrated Medicine was held here Sunday, with about 400 delegates
from over ten countries sharing their experiences in the
development of traditional medicine and discussing the prospects
for the integrated medicine.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening ceremony of the two-day conference,
Chinese Health Minister Zhang Wenkang said as part of human
civilization, traditional medicine contribute to the health of
peoples in many countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government, fully recognizing the
historical contribution, scientific and practical value of
traditional Chinese medicine, views it as a treasure of the
Chinese civilization and strives to modernize it.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see that more and more people in the world are
paying attention to traditional medicine," he said, adding that
the Chinese government wishes to do its best to promote exchange
and cooperation between countries and further promote the
development of traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
Of traditional and modern medicines, he said, "We also

their own theoretical systems and methodologies, they can also
integrate and infiltrate into each other, learn from each other to
improve the clinical efficacy and theoretical level," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization (WHO) representative to Thailand E.B.
Doberstyn said WHO has long recognized that there is an extremely
rich history of traditional health systems, practices and remedies
in Asia.

<P>
WHO will support member countries to integrate traditional
medicines into their national health and drug policies, promote
the proper use of traditional medicines, improve research
methodologies to study efficacy, quality, safety and application
of traditional medicines and collect and disseminate up-to-date
information on traditional medicines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that international trade in herbal medicines has been
increasing, he said that there is an urgent need to redefine
regulations governing the use of herbal medicines and change the
regulations when necessary to assure quality, safety and
standardization of the remedies.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 2, (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni

GUANGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive survey of the
marine environment near the Pearl River estuary, a Sino-Japanese
governmental cooperation project, has been launched in south China
's Guangdong Province.

According to the new agreement, the Japanese government will
contribute 20 million yuan (about 2.41 million U.S. dollars) to
the survey project.
</P>
<P>
The survey will take two years to finish, according to members

GUIYANG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Wu Yi has urged
China's western regions to make better use of foreign capital to

Wu, also an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the

the people of those areas with historic opportunities; they should
seize the time, further emancipate their minds and open wider to
the outside world, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In attracting overseas investment, the west should develop new
ways of thinking, new mechanisms and methods, the state councilor
said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also noted that it is imperative to fully protect the
legitimate rights and interests of overseas investors and improve
the investment environment, so that investors from other parts of
the world can be sure of making profits there.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the west should also further open to the rest

<HEADLINE> Arafat Orders PNA Officials to Stay Put: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Preparing for a unilateral
statehood declaration, Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat issued an order late last week banning departures of
top PNA officials as of next month, the Israeli daily Ha'aretz
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Starting August 3, top PNA officials will not be allowed to
leave PNA territories unless Arafat himself personally approves
special departure requests, the paper reported, citing a
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) member.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's no-travel order attests to stepped-up preparations in
the PNA, as the September 13 target date nears. Palestinian leaders
have vowed that they will declared the conclusion of the interim
phase on that date.
</P>
<P>
Arafat wants his top officials to stay close by in anticipation
of violent clashes and possibly punitive Israeli measures following
a unilateral statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
About 100 members of the PLO's Central Council are meeting in
the Gaza Strip Sunday and Monday to discuss a series of final-
status issues, among them the date for the statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
In another development, both the Palestinians and the Untied
States have rebuffed an Israeli interpretation that U.N.
resolutions do not require Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein
argued that U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 do not apply to Israeli-
PNA negotiations, since they were passed more than 25 years before
the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Arafat sharply denounced "this dangerous Israeli position"
Friday evening. In an official statement he charged that Israel is
showing contempt for international law and U.N. decisions.
</P>
<P>
By distancing itself from the U.N. resolutions "Israel is making
an effort to thwart the whole peace process," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA leadership sent urgent letters to the United
Nations and various countries, calling on them to force Israel to
comply with binding international decisions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also rejected Rubinstein's position, and reiterated
that the U.N. resolutions applies to negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the stagnant peace negotiations and the extremely dim
prospects of reaching a comprehensive and permanent peace before
the September 13 deadline, Arafat has reiterated his determination
to declare statehood in September, even without a deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side retaliated by stepping up threats over a
unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood. Israeli Prime
Minister called on the U.S. to hold a three-way summit between him,
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton to make crucial decisions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has yet to announce whether there will be a summit under
the present situation where the two sides remain far apart on most
of the major issues.

<HEADLINE> U.N. FAO Chief Concludes Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) Director-General Jacques Diouf
concluded his two-day visit to Iraq and left the country on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
It was a low-profile departure with no press conference or
statements, a U.N. source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The FAO chief arrived here Friday after two FAO staff were
killed in its Baghdad office by a gunman Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Diouf held talks with Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan, Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, Agriculture
Minister Abdul Ellan Hameed and Irrigation Minister Mahmoud Diyab
Al-Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership highly appreciated the efforts exerted by
the FAO to alleviate the plight of the Iraqi people, who have been
under sanctions ever since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FAO chief promised that his organization will
continue to make efforts to better implement the U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on
Saturday, Diouf said that Iraq is still a full member of the FAO,
so his organization should work hard to ensure Iraqi's humanitarian
needs.
</P>
<P>
The FAO office in Iraq is mainly in charge of the implementation
of the U.N. humanitarian deal, which allows Iraq to export a
limited amount of crude to finance imports of food, medicine and
essential parts for its oil and electricity sectors.
</P>
<P>
A gunman, identified as 38-year-old Fuad Haidar, burst into the
FAO office building in central Baghdad early Wednesday morning,
shot and killed two FAO staffers and wounded several others.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour confrontation with the security forces, the
killer surrendered and is now under custody in the Jadria Police
Bureau in central Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Amir Khalil, the FAO representative in Baghdad, said that the
Iraqi government has promised to provide "maximum security" for the
400 U.N.staff in Iraq, and security has been reinforced outside U.
N. offices in Baghdad since the tragic incident.

<HEADLINE> 11 Indonesian Ship Wreckage Survivors Found: Antara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 11 people, consisted of men, women and children, were found
floating in the waters aboard Minahasa IX ship. Most of them wore
life vests and others held on to debris, said Setia Rahardjo, head
of the government's search and rescue agency.
</P>
<P>
Minahasa IX, heading to Tobelo (North Maluku) from Manado (
North Sulawesi), found the 11 people in the waters close to the
Karakelong island, about 192 kilometers northeast of Manado on
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The survivors had confirmed that the heavily overcrowded vessel
had sunk after taking in water in rough seas and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
The survivors were dehydrated, sunburned and weakened by hunger,
Rahardjo said, adding that rescuers had so far found no evidence
of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said a search of the area where the survivors were
found was still going on, but the chance of more survivors seemed
slim.
</P>
<P>
The passenger ship, Cahaya Bahari, left Tobelo on Halmahera in
North Maluku province on Wednesday en route to Manado. Radio
contact with the vessel was lost after its captain M.M. Paparaga
radioed an "SOS" advising that the ship was taking water in fast
during a violent storm at noon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There is conflicting data about the total passengers on board
as the Cahaya Bahari was licensed to carry only 270 people. The
National Search and Rescue Agency claimed that at least 492
passengers, refugees from Maluku and crew may have been aboard.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Barak Talk over Phone on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin here
today urged all the parties involved in the Mideast peace process
to take "serious and concrete attitude" towards the process and
earnestly implement all the agreements reached so as to ensure the
advance of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a phone call from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Barak briefed Jiang on the latest developments in the Middle
East region and the problems in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After expressing gratitude for Barak, Jiang said he had noticed
that "some obstacles" had occurred in the peace talks while it is
advancing. "The international community, including China, is
unwilling to see such difficulties," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang considered it "inevitable" that difficulties appeared
when the peace talks enters the current phase, stressing that all
the difficulties "are not insurmountable."
</P>
<P>
Given all the parties involved "take serious and concrete
attitude, build mutual trust, make compromise, and earnestly
implement all the agreements reached," Jiang said, the peace
negotiations "will make steady progress."
</P>
<P>
He said that China has consistently supported the peace process
in the region and made contributions to its advancement.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to continue its efforts for the further
development of the peace talks," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Transfer 1,000 SLA Refugees to Other Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel is considering transferring
about 1,000 former Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militiamen and their family members to other countries, a Interior
Ministry official disclosed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of such ex-SLA militiamen wanting to move abroad
will be flown to Germany next week if all bureaucratic procedures
are smooth as expected, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also conducting intensive talks with other countries,
mostly in North and South America, to persuade them to absorb some
SLA refugees.
</P>
<P>
The work will be coordinated by Shin Bet (Israel's General
Security Service) assistance teams with the refugees, the official
added.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 SLA militiamen and their family members have been
taking shelter in Israel since May after their army collapsed under
pressure of Lebanese resistance guerrillas, and Israel withdrew
from the so-called security zone in south Lebanon later.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 SLA militiamen had been fighting along with Israeli
occupying troops against Lebanese resistance groups since the
security zone was set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim
to protect its northern border.
</P>
<P>
Most high-ranking SLA officers, together with their families,
fled to Israel for fear of being captured by Lebanese authorities
to face possible death sentences for collaborating with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
However, their life in Israel is not easy as they could only
receive a monthly allowance of between 2,400-3,400 shekels (about
588-833 U.S. dollars), whereas the average earning for Israelis is
6,000 shekels (1,471 dollars). They also have difficulties in
finding housing and jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Around 300 former SLA militiamen and families had crossed back
into Lebanon. It is estimated that once the situation in south
Lebanon stabilizes, more refugees will decide to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Those choosing to return will receive one-off compensation from
Israeli government in light of their service years in the army. For
example, a regular soldier who served 20 years will receive nearly
30,000 dollars, according to a brochure distributed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
However, once they return to Lebanon they will stand trial for
their roles as traitors during the 22 years of Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Lebanese military court tried 10 batches
of SLA collaborators. Most of them received sentences ranging from
one-year to 15-year imprisonment, while three SLA soldiers were
condemned to death.

<HEADLINE> S'pore May Have Water Supply From Indonesia in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Water could be piped from
Indonesia to Singapore as early as 2005 if a proposed 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars-deal can be finalized this week, local English
newspaper The Sunday Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that Singapore will have a new source in
Riau Province, Indonesia, in five years if the massive engineering
project involving overland channels and undersea pipelines gets
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
Government-owned Riau State Holdings President/Director
Arsyadjuliandi Rachman was quoted as saying that representatives
from the Riau provincial government will head for Singapore this
week to finalize the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The project, estimated to cost at least 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars and expected to supply water to Singapore for "a long,
long term," will harness a water catchment area of some 51,000
square kilometers, 80 times the size of Singapore, in Indonesia's
Riau province and the water will be channeled through two undersea
pipelines -- a 250 kilometers line from Riau's Sungai Kampar river
to Bintan, Indonesia, and another 200 kilometers line from Bintan
to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The project is said to involve Indonesia-listed Upton Synergy
Indonesia (USI), the Riau government-owned Riau State Holdings and
Singapore Technologies as well as international partners.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Singapore and Indonesia entered into
agreement in 1991 for the development of water resources in
Indonesia and the supply of water to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 agreement, valid for 100 years, allows Singapore to
purchase up to 4.5 billion liters of water a day from Indonesia's
Riau province.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of Singapore buying water from Indonesia also
cropped up in talks between Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
and Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid in January when Goh
visited Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has depended on Malaysia for its water supply. Johor,
the southern most state of Malaysia, supplies 214 million liters
of raw water a day to Singapore and buys back 35 million liters of
treated water from Singapore's water treatment plant in Johor.
</P>
<P>
The two pacts on water supply Singapore signed with Johor in
1961 and 1962 will expire in 2011 and 2061, respectively.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President

sensitize and mobilize the people on the control of AIDS, as its
infection rate continues escalating in this east African country.
</P>

called for more effective means of communications to mobilize and
sensitize the public.

said despite the efforts by the government, donor agencies and
individuals to check further spread of the killer disease,
thousands of lives continue to perish in the country.

BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Century 21 Real Estate Corp, one of
the world's largest franchisers of residential real estate
brokerage offices, plans to set up a nationwide first-owner and
secondary real estate network for Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
According to Business Weekly of China Daily, Century 21 will
also open the first office in Beijing in July.
</P>
<P>
The goal of Century 21 China is to grant franchises in 30
regions, to develop 2,000 offices and train 14,000 professional
agents in China, said Harry Lu, president of Century 21 Real
Estate China.
</P>
<P>
"China's accession to the World Trade Organization will bring
us more opportunities in our business expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that China's real estate market has slowed in recent
years, overheating has disappeared and the markets are now more
stable.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is making progress in improving market
regulation, but this is a long road with many hurdles to be
overcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's housing reform which has abolished the welfare housing
distribution system has thrown millions of people into the real
estate market.
</P>
<P>
Most of these people know little about the real estate market,
Lu said. "They need qualified agents to help them and Century 21
will try to regularize the intermediary market," he added.

<HEADLINE> No End to Conflict with Israel in Framework Accord: Qurei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian side will refuse
to sign a framework agreement that declares an end to the conflict
with Israel, a senior Palestinian official has said.
</P>
<P>
"We will only declare an end to the conflict when Israel has
implement the final peace deal," including an agreement on
Jerusalem and refugees, Palestinian chief negotiator Ahmed Qurei,
also known as Abu Ala, was quoted by Israeli daily the Jerusalem
Post as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Qurei said that the Palestinians have learned a lesson from
the "bad experiences with the interim agreement," which Israel
still has not fully implemented, although an agreement on its
implementation was signed at Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, last
September.
</P>
<P>
The Sharm el Sheikh peace deal asks the two sides to reach a
framework agreement in February before striking a final peace deal
in September, while setting out specific regulations stipulating
Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
release of Palestinians from Israeli jails and opening of safe
passages linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has proposed that the
framework agreement for a final peace deal must state the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict is over. Barak also said he wants to keep the
important key final-status issues including Jerusalem, refugees,
border, Jewish settlements for the leaders to decide at a three-way
summit between himself, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are requesting the U.S. to organize another
round of talks soon before calling for a summit.
</P>
<P>
Qurei said negotiations are meaningless unless Barak gives his
negotiators a mandate to narrow the gaps, warning that an early
summit would end in failure and lead to frustration on the
Palestinian streets.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no negotiations without authorization by the
leaders," he said. "If the Israeli negotiators have no mandate to
take decisions, we should leave things up to the summit or to
circumstances," he added, implying that the Palestinian people may
opt for violence if no satisfactory agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must recognize that East Jerusalem is part of the
territories occupied in 1967, then we will discuss the Israeli
needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qurei also stressed that the United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 242 and 338 must be the basis of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Qurei, who heads the Palestinian delegation to the final-status
talks with Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, said
that the only breakthrough was in discussions over the Jordan
Valley, but that was not written down for the record.
</P>
<P>
On the Jewish settlements, one of the key final-status issues,
Qurei said that "the settlers can stay if they apply for residency
or citizenship of the Palestinian state and the Palestinian side
will review each application, but only on an individual basis, not
as groups or communities."

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanon is violating U.N. Resolution 425 by failing to send
troops to the border in order to take control of the south, Israel
complained to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel withdrew from the zone on May 24, Lebanon has
accused Israel of not complying fully with resolution 425. The UN's
approval of the withdrawal on June 16 was held up over Lebanese
complaints that IDF troops were still located in Lebanese territory
in some places.
</P>
<P>
Stone-throwing incidents along the border with Lebanon continued
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli senior rabbis aligned with the religious Zionist
movement want to see an end to the presence of female solider in
elite combat units of the Israel Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
The rabbis are currently preparing for a public battle on the
matter and believe that the development of combat units for women
will cause serious harm to religious soldiers, perhaps even
bringing their future service in combat units into doubt.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz decided 18 months ago to extend
combat roles for women serving in the IDF, a precedent-setting
decision of which Mofaz was very proud.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- As of late Saturday night, no progress had been made toward
solving the Israeli doctors' strike. Doctors will wage a full-scale
strike Sunday, and hospitals around the country will operate on a
Shabbat schedule.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak deferred a recommendation
made by mediators in favor of establishing a public commission to
examine the health system.
</P>
<P>
Barak informed the mediators that such a commission should not
be formed before the Israel Medical Association and the Finance
Ministry resolve all other disputed issues, such as the amount of
wage increments.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian Liberation Organization's Central Committee
will convene in Gaza Sunday to discuss preparations for a
Palestinian state that officials said they were determined to
declare later this year -- with or without a peace treaty with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei, who heads
the Palestinian team to the final-status talks, predicted there
would be a decision to declare statehood this year.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat intends to
declare the state within all the territories captured in the 1967
Six-Day War, with east Jerusalem as its capital, but he does not
intend to extend his authority over territory not yet under his
control, a Palestinian security officer said.

<HEADLINE> 40 Injured in Police-Workers Clash in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- About 40 people were injured
during the four-day police-labor confrontation triggered by the
attempt of the striking laborers to block the strategic Indo-Nepal
border connecting with Jogbani of Bihar state of India, police
sources told the press Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The injured included 24 policemen and more than 10 workers, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
"Police used force after the laborers threw brickbats at us,"
said Superintendent Police Kalyan Timalsina.
</P>
<P>
Police was compelled to fire rubber bullets, tear gas, gas
grenade and blank fire to disperse the agitated workers to get the
situation under control, he said.
</P>
<P>
The workers smashed six vehicles, including some government
vehicles, during the confrontations. Police had detained three
people in connection with the vandalism.
</P>
<P>
On May 29, the employees of Biratnagar Jute Mill in Morang
district bordering India resorted to agitation with 16-point
demands protesting against the mill lease-holder Nirmal Vyas'
decision to run the factory in accordance with the Labor Act,
which would curtail some of their facilities, including welfares.
</P>
<P>
When their demands were not fulfilled, the employees closed the
border with 50 trucks lining at the Nepali side of the border,
leading to the paralyze of the transportation on Biratnagar-
Jogbani route and disrupting daily border business.
</P>
<P>
As the workers have threatened to continue the agitation if
their demands are not met, the opposition parties are pressing the
government to help solve the labor dispute as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Police Shortage Worsens Traffic Jam in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Insufficient number of traffic police
and inadequate training are making the poor traffic situation in
Dhaka city even worse, The Daily Star newspaper reported here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Only 1,400 policemen of Dhaka's traffic department are engaged
in maintaining traffic in the capital where more than 300,000
registered motor vehicles and 80,000 licensed rickshaws are plying,
a traffic department official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides, over 400,000 illegal rickshaws and carts and a large
number of unlicensed motor vehicles have made the city's traffic
situation precarious with frequent jams on important points, added
the official.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of shortage of police force, the unfit and
unlicensed vehicles, illegally parked vehicles and vehicles
without required documents are escaping the punishment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 70 percent of the traffic force gains no
training on maintaining traffic, the official admitted.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate training is not only resulting in poor service from
traffic policemen but also causing injury to some of them while
discharging duties.
</P>
<P>
The traffic department arranges 10 to 15 days' training on
primary lessons of traffic control for the new recruits at the
department, but this is not at all sufficient, another official
said.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they give wrong signals or do not understand what to
do," he said, pointing out the lack of training.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges West to Relax Technology Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has urged the
Western countries to relax terms of technology transfer to least
developed countries to enable the latter to address development
and environmental needs, local newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Closing an international environmental conference for
sustainable development in Africa here on Friday, Tanzanian
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Jakaya
Kikwete said that lack of appropriate technologies, including new
environmentally friendly technology, was undermining Africa's
resolve to bring drastic economic prospect to its people.
</P>
<P>
"It is disappointing to note that there has not been any real
progress in the technology transfer despite the fact that it was
agreed in the famous Agenda 21 during the UN environmental meeting
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even though technology transfer is included in the Agenda 21
and the Convention on Biological Diversity, these principles can
not be implemented fully due to a stance taken by developed
countries of invoking the protection of intellectual property
rights," he stressed. "This effectively renders technology
transfer on grant and concessional terms by and large inoperable."
</P>
<P>
He said that another factor hindering progress was the low
private and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Most FDI flows are going to those countries that are already
rich and developed and very little is going to the poor and
underdeveloped countries that need those resources the most," he
added, citing that unfortunately only one percent of FDI is
flowing to Africa at present.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete also called for public participation in environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"Education and public awareness programs can change attitudes
and produce more sustainable environmentally friendly life
styles," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference was attended by experts from Zambia,
Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers Organize Eviction of Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Some white commercial farmers in
Mashonaland Central Province in north Zimbabwe are mobilizing
their workers and the supporters of the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) to drive out war veterans and villagers
occupying farms in the area, The Sunday Mail quoted the police as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,500 white
farms since February this year to press for accelerating land
redistribution and President Robert Mugabe has refused to
intervene in the farm invasion.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Commissioner responsible for crime and operations
 Griffiths Mpofu said on Saturday that on Friday farmers had
organized their workers and MDC supporters to attack war veterans
at Ceres Farm in Shamva.
</P>
<P>
Relating to the incident, Mpofu said a lorry from Ceres farm in
Shamva had ferried the workers to where war veterans and some
villagers camped within the farm.
</P>
<P>
Five people had then taken some whips from the car and attacked
the war veterans, forcing them to flee.
</P>
<P>
"During the disturbance, the occupants of the Nissan Sunny
(car) were shouting that the war veterans must go back to their
homes and that there was no reason why they should remain in the
farms because the MDC was also now in Parliament," said the Deputy
Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He said it was sad to note that the farmers were now involved
in mobilizing their workers and some youths to forcibly evict
those occupying the commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to warn some elements within the commercial
farms never to take the law into their own hands. The police are
ready on the ground and anybody who is attacked should report," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police have arrested 24 youths in Harare as they
step up efforts to quell post-election violence.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that political violence could resurface in
some parts of the country this weekend as the candidates who won
in the June 24 and 25 parliamentary elections celebrate their
victory.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Closes over 400 Illegal Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 400 clinics, pharmacies and
laboratories operating illegally and with ill-trained staff in
Kenya have been shut down over the past six months, Kenyan
Minister for Medical Health Amukowa Anangwe has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper the Herald on Sunday quoted the minister
as saying 130 owners of such premises had been convicted for
drug-related offences and fined a total of 280,000 shillings
(about 3,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"In Nairobi alone, the exercise revealed the majority of the
offenders are operating in premises which are either unregistered
or not licensed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anangwe said new laws will be established to check malpractice
in this domain because the existing regulatory measures are
inherently weak.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry has proposed stringent and deterrent
 penalties for offenders under the Miscellaneous Bill 2000 that
will pursue vigorous drug sector reforms.

<HEADLINE> On-line Ads Grow Rapidly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- On-line advertising is coming into
a life of its own in China with smarting advertisers focusing
their attention on the country's 9,000 Internet-based firms.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by Forrester Research, China's
on-line advertising market was valued at 8 million U.S. dollars in
1999 and it said that the market will be worth about 440 million U.
S. dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The growth of on-line advertising is far outpacing that of the
conventional ad industry. On-line advertising is expected to win
a greater share of the market in coming years, Business Weekly of
China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
DoubleClick, one of the world's top on-line advertising
agencies, recently opened its first Chinese office in Beijing and
has no business at present. But this NASDAQ-listed firm is the on-
line ad agent for at least 140 Asian website portals and is also
the on-line ad operator for IBM, Ericsson and Dell.
</P>
<P>
Kevin O'Connor, CEO and co-founder of DoubleClick, said that
his company provides an advantage in that a customer needs only
sign one contract to launch an on-line ad in more than 80
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey on local Chinese on-line advertising
agents, 7.68 percent of Internet users frequently click to and
read on-line ads; 25.18 percent sometimes.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the China Internet Network Information
Center also shows that 49.04 percent of Internet users click to
the ads only when they are interested in the contents of the ads;
14.09 percent never do it while only 4.01 percent hate the ads
because they fear they will be encouraged to spend money.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has been steadily
growing this year and its growth rate is expected to hit 7.5
percent, reversing the downward trend of the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The performance has resulted from the state's active fiscal
measures and the steady monetary policies, an official from the
State Economic and Trade Commission wrote in the latest issue of
the news weekly Outlook.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first quarter of the year, the
economy grew at a rate of 8.1 percent, which was 1.3 percentage
points higher compared with the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the growth rate for the first half of the
year will reach about eight percent, up 0.4 percent over that of
the same period of last year, and up 1.3 percent over that of the
second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Major economic indices suggest that the economy has embarked on
the road of higher growth. For the first five months of the year,
the country's fixed capital investment was up 9.5 percent to 523.3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales witnessed noticeable growth, up 10.4 percent to 1,
360 billion yuan in the first five months. Foreign trade grew 36.1
percent to 174.1 U.S. dollars, raking in a surplus of 10.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial production in the first five months
this year was 11 percent higher than that in same period last year.
The state-owned enterprises also recorded a remarkable improvement,
with profits up 310 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the upward movement so far this year, the economy is
still facing some problems, such as insufficient domestic demand,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
China's imminent entry into the World Trade Organization and
other undecided factors may also hinder the economic recovery, it
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The study on "Needs Assessment Survey of the Disadvantaged
Women and Children in the Urban Areas of Bangladesh," conducted by
Concern Bangladesh, observed that growth of urban slums and spurt
in homeless population are two of the "gravest challenges" the
country is now facing.
</P>
<P>
Covering urban population of Dhaka, Chittagong and other major
towns, the study pointed out some 600,000 more households are
either squatting or homeless, resulting in total homeless
population of 2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
The target population for the survey included socially and
economically disadvantaged women and children, especially sex
workers, the disabled and the street children.
</P>
<P>
The Concern Bangladesh's study said apart from brothel-based
sex workers, 33 percent of the floating women are "mainly engaged
in sex work" as a means of livelihood. The number of such floating
sex workers would "range from 83,000 to 171,000."
</P>
<P>
An earlier study on "Floating People and Slum Population" by
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics showed that urban population is
increasing by about six percent a year, while the overall
population growth rate is 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Electrification Strategy for Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China is turning to small
hydropower stations to deliver electricity to more rural
households, according to Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Rural electrification (RE) means a majority of rural residents
in a country use electricity basically for lighting and home
appliances.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious RE strategy calls for 600 primary RE counties to
be put in place by the end of this year, said Wang Shucheng,
minister of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to build 400 medium-stage RE counties by 2005
and another 400 by 2010, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for promoting
and supervising the RE undertakings.
</P>
<P>
China's total exploitable hydropower potential is estimated to
be about 378 million kilowatts, ranking it the largest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,300 small hydropower stations have been completed,
with a total installed capacity of 23 million kw.
</P>
<P>
The small hydropower stations produce about 72 billion kw hours
annually, supplying electricity for one-third of the country's
counties and one-fourth of its total population, said Tian Shen,
deputy director of hydropower development bureau with the Ministry
of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
But only 29 percent of China's hydropower resources have been
exploited, far less than in some developed countries and around 75
million rural people have still no access to power.
</P>
<P>
It is truly necessary to use more small hydropower stations to
achieve sustainable development in rural areas, the weekly said.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Control on Textile Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to intensify control
on its textile production capacity, according to a regulation
recently issued by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry must continue to eliminate redundant
construction to keep from destroying the fruit of last year's
efforts, said an official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China's textile industry laid off redundant workers
and upgrade its backward technologies. It rid itself of 9.06
million out-of-date spindles and 1.16 million redundant workers in
the past two years, Business Weekly of China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the industry reversed its six-year losing trend
and earned profits of 800 million yuan (96.38 million U.S. dollars)
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But with the recovery of the home textile market, firms and
individual operators began to randomly increase production
capacity despite the strict control by the State Administration of
Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 20 cases of unauthorized activities were
discovered in the country this year, an official of the
administration said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has formulated a regulation requiring the
textile industry to restrain its production capacity while
considering market demand.
</P>
<P>
Textile machinery producers and purchasers must have permits
from the State Administration of Light Industry in advance of
setting production targets and arranging any purchase orders of
machines.
</P>
<P>
Companies found in violation will see their machines and
incomes confiscated and their business licenses revoked as
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Trade departments must strictly monitor imports of cotton
textile machines and especially spinning frames, the regulation
said.
</P>
<P>
Textile machinery production for export purposes must be
registered with the State Administration of Light Industry.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Airways International Plc.
(THAI), Thailand's national carrier, has been voted by
international passengers as the world's outstanding airline,

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Insists on Trying Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid insisted on trying former President Soeharto for the sake of
the legal supremacy.
</P>
<P>
No single Indonesian citizen was above the law, the president
stressed while speaking before 200 participants of the National
Forum in Bali on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wahid added that Soeharto's trial does not mean that the entire
nation must hate him because he had devoted much of his life to
the country and the people.
</P>
<P>
Nor does it mean that the country's former strongman is not
entitled to have get-together (silaturahmi) with other Indonesian
people, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto will continue to be tried, while on the other hand,
we will also continue to hold silaturahmi with him. This does not
mean if Soeharto is tried, we must hate him," he was quoted by the
Antara News Agency Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last Week, Wahid said the ailing 79-year-old former president
may hand over more than 40 billion U.S. dollars to the government.
The president said Soeharto will be pardoned if found guilty of
graft, as long as he returns his wealth.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana Tuesday
admitted meeting Mines and Energy Minister Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono recently, but denied reports that the family wants to
return Soeharto's wealth to the state.
</P>
<P>
Siti, who represents the family in the talks, repeated Soeharto
's claim that he has no money stashed overseas.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Yudhoyono said that negotiations with Soeharto's
family on returning the former ruler's wealth to the state would
be restarted.
</P>
<P>
"We will build a new communication," said Yudhoyono, who is
acting as the government's representative in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been facing corruption charges in his 32 years
rule of the country. He was declared as suspect early this year
and was put under house arrest by the Attorney General's Office in
May.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Mediating in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan is currently here to seek way for bringing
about dialogue between the government and the opposition to settle
the country's present political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Razali Ismail, who arrived here on Thursday, has met with First
Secretary of the ruling State Peace and Development Council
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt and Foreign Minister U Win Aung as
well as General Secretary of the opposition National League for
Democracy (NLD) Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no official disclosure of the details of the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Razali is also expected to meet other political party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Razali's visit followed the one to Myanmar made in October 1999
by Alvaro de Soto, the then special envoy of the U.N. secretary-
general.
</P>
<P>
In May 1990, a general election was held by the present Myanmar
military government which took over the power of state in
September 1988.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the NLD won the majority of the parliamentary
seats with 396 or 82 percent out of the total 485.
</P>
<P>
The NLD complains that although 10 years have passed, the
election result has not yet materialized.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in late 1997, the government and the NLD tried for
several times in vain to have their leaders meet formally, as the
government insisted on excluding Aung San Suu Kyi from the meeting,
while the NLD stuck to her inclusion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has repeatedly stressed that it is a
caretaker or transitional government and has no intention to hold
on to power for long.

<P>
HELSINKI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were crushed to death
and 30 others injured at midnight Friday at a Rock festival in
Roskilde, Denmark, the Finnish News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When the popular U.S. band Pearl Jam started performing, the
audience swarmed forward to the stage, apparently because the
microphones were placed too far from the stage, a witness was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The victims slipped or fell in front of the stage and were
trampled to death, despite the fact that various precautions
measures were taken, said local police and the festival organizers.
More rails were placed at the stage and more people were deployed
to keep order, they said.
</P>
<P>
The band was shocked by the tragedy. "This is so painful,"
Pearl Jam said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the incident, a performance scheduled for Sunday
in Belgium was canceled.
</P>
<P>
The annual Roskilde festival has run for 30 years. More than
110,000 rock music fans have come to the festival this year from
Nordic and western Europe.

</P>
<P>
The government has worked out a plan to curb pollution and

A total of 466,700 hectares of farmland hit by oriental
grasshoppers have already been brought under control in the

Artificial Rain Eases Drought in NE China
</P>
<P>
People in northeast China's Liaoning Province experienced a
delightful rain this weekend after almost two weeks of sweltering
heat.
</P>
<P>
Two cloud-seeding helicopters flew for ten hours Saturday,
spraying silver iodide into a cold air mass moved from the west
into the province. As a result, 14 cities in the area received
moderate to heavy rain, and some regions in the province even had
heavy storms, which lessened the serious drought in over one
million ha of dried land.
</P>
<P>
However, the local meteorological bureau warned that the
artificial rain will not solve the drought problem, as the water
supply in most reservoirs has not reached the necessary level.

and pastures.
</P>
<P>
China will give free grain to farmers who reforest their own
land, as the country has ample grain reserves thanks to years of
good harvests. The state will be responsible for the maintenance
of the saplings and trees.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Rallies Back to Win Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pete Sampras of
the United States rallied from first set down to beat fellow
American Justin Gimselstob 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 and 6-2 at the Wimbledon
tennis championships on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, ignoring left leg injury, appeared on the brink of his
first Wimbledon defeat since 1996 when he lost the first set with
hardly a whimper. His serve, the base on which his six singles
titles were founded, was misfiring and he looked totally dejected.
</P>
<P>
But the 28-year-old top seed decided to play himself out of
trouble and he was back to his best by the time he swept past
Gimelstob to set up a last 16 match with unseeded Swede Jonas
Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Gustavo Kuerten, suffering from a heavy cold,
succumbed to big-hitting German Alexander Popp 7-6, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Australian Patrick Rafter, a semifinalist last year, went
through 6-2, 7-6, 6-3 against another German, Rainer Schuettler,
while second seed Andre Agassi, who had to save two matchpoints in
his previous match, had no such problems in beating France's
Jerome Golmard 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Of this year's top seven men's seeds, Agassi and Sampras are
the only two left.
</P>
<P>
As evening fell, Mark Philippoussis, seeded 10th, reached the
last 16 after winning the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam since
1968.
</P>
<P>
The Australian beat Sjeng Schalken 4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 20-18 in
a five-hour match of high tension. Dutchman Schalken was also
involved in the longest match of last year's championships which
he lost to Jim Courier.
</P>
<P>
Defending women's champion Lindsay Davenport reached the last
16, where she meets fellow American Jennifer Capriati, after
beating Argentine Paola Suarez 6-4, 6-2. Monica Seles, with the
minimum of fuss, defeated Sarah Pitkowski of France 6-0, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The sixth seed now plays another veteran campaigner, Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, for the first time on grass after the ninth-
seeded Spaniard saved two matchpoints in beating Sandra Nacuk of
Yugoslavia 3-6, 7-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's drama on the most famous court in the world came
just minutes after more than 60 of Wimbledon's former champions
and finalists had taken part in a parade.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Venus Williams beat Nathalie Dechy of 6-0, 7-6 to
join her sister Serena in the last 16. She now plays Sabine
Appelmans of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Australian Jelena Dokic, famous for her tempestuous father and
last year's first-round defeat of Martina Hingis, showed she was
no one-hit wonder by beating American Brie Rippner 6-2, 6-1. Dokic
will next play American Kristina Brandi.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Market Goods Globally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mauritian Prime Minister
Navichndra Ramgoolam Saturday urged African countries to trade
more amongst themselves and take advantage of the new trade
investment legislation of the United States to trade more on the
global market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of this year's Zambia
international trade fair in Ndola, Copperbelt Province, Ramgoolam
said there was need for African countries and COMESA members in
particular to trade more among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam, also current chairman of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), said African countries were
rich in resources and produce abundant goods which should be
shared among themselves.
</P>
<P>
With abundant resources and products, he said Africa was set to
compete with the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Let's take advantage of the new trade and investment
legislation of the United States government known as the trade and
development act 2000 to trade more on the global market.
</P>
<P>
"The new act has opened new partnerships between the United
States and Africa," he told the participants including Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said the new legislation has also opened new trade
opportunities for Africa to do more business with the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
"The more we trade on the global market the more we shall
improve the quality of life of our people," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that lack of information about Africa's
products to the international market, was a hindrance to exporting
its goods.
</P>
<P>
"Africa needs to market itself well by making its products
known to the global market. There are many good things about
Africa but these remain unknown to the outside world. With the new
United States legislation, we need to sell our continent and
maximize the use of the new act 2000," Ramgoolam said.
</P>
<P>
He called on COMESA countries to remove impediments towards
achieving free intra-COMESA trade by October 31 this year, saying
his government has reduced duty on 1,500 products.
</P>
<P>
"We must remove impediments towards free trade in COMESA. To do
this, we need sacrifices," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiluba, Ramgoolam will return to Zambia in
October this year to launch COMESA free trade area (FTA) in
Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Universities In Africa Challenged To Speak out on Truth, Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chancellor of Swaziland
University Lydia Phindile Makhubu has challenged universities in
Africa to speak out in support of truth and justice to awaken the
conscience of the society.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the graduation of 265 students at Africa
University, 25 kilometers away from Mutare in east Zimbabwe on
Saturday, Makhubu said Africa, as a society, was in a state of
crisis and unable to confront moral issues and to distinguish
between the right and the wrong.
</P>
<P>
She said it was the duty of universities to produce students
who will conscientize the society towards the consolidation of
human rights, democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
"Institutions of higher learning are being challenged more than
ever before to speak out in support of truth and justice in a
continent where such are easily compromised," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said universities must accord students with academic
freedom at campus so that they would be able to speak out on all
issues that affect the society.
</P>
<P>
She said while most universities were facing pressure to expand
and increase enrolment, many institutions in southern Africa had
embarked on a noble idea of establishing long distance education
programs to accommodate all needy cases.
</P>
<P>
She said if the long distance program was fully explored, it
would expand access to education and increase university
stakeholder.
</P>
<P>
The graduation is the sixth since the opening of the university
in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Urges EU to Push Ahead Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 2 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President Romano
Prodi warned Sunday that the European Union must push ahead with
enlargement or risk seeing the continent split in two again.
</P>
<P>
"We can't take responsibility for the rebirth of a Berlin Wall,
" he told a seminar in the central Italian town of Arezzo, urging
Italy, a founding member of the EU, to play a full role in calling
for enlargement and act as a counter-weight in French and German-
led plans for speedier EU integration.
</P>
<P>
"It's a grandiose and unprecedented design to create the world'
s greatest economic reality with democracy and respect for the
individual countries' diversity," said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
In the Milanese daily, Il Sole-24 Ore, Dini supported the
Franco-German proposal for a two-speed Europe, but said it should
not be envisaged as revolving around a "preferential axis" between
Paris and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he favors inserting a mechanism into the EU treaties
to allow countries that want to move more quickly towards
integration to do so.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good thing if Germany and France are on the
same wavelength on some fundamental issues on the EU agenda," said
Dini.
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because the Franco-German alliance is on the way,
there is a need for a country with deep European roots which can
use this alliance, knowing that it is indispensable for Europe's
future to stand as a guarantee for those who may feel fear or
anguish before this great design," said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
According to Prodi, France and Germany support "strengthened
cooperation" and replacing unanimity with majority voting in EU
decisions on a much broader range of topics, but it remains an "
open question" whether the formula will be an intergovernmental
agreement, or a supranational one, as he would prefer.
