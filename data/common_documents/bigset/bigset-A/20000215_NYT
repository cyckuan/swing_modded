JACKSON HAS FOND MEMORIES OF WINDY CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The man dressed in the yellow, long-sleeved Lakers
sweatshirt settled in before three dozen media members and a
half-dozen TV cameras. He looked a lot like the fellow who once
coached the hometown team to six NBA championships in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But he sounded like a totally different individual once the
questions began. Especially the ones concerning his former
employer, the ones about a dynasty transformed into an expansion
team overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard one bad report about Chicago, that it's a team
that gave up on Pippen-Jordan-Rodman and their championships, or
that management's tough there. I haven't heard a bad thing,'' the
gray-bearded, bespectacled former Bulls coach said Monday
afternoon. ``I think this management treats players very fairly, I
think they're pragmatic, I think they're good business people in
this organization. I think they did a great job with the Bulls and
I think that players that are looking to this city to play in will
find it very satisfying as a sports town.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement must have stunned the locals. Particularly the two
named Jerry _ Krause, the Bulls GM, and Reinsdorff, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   For these words came from Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who was
once Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who openly feuded with the Jerrys
through the last three Chicago championships, in 1996-97-98.
</P>
<P>
   It has been one year and eight months since Michael Jordan's
era-ending jump shot against the Utah Jazz clinched the Bulls'
sixth title. And yet everything, including Jackson _ who coaches
against his former team for the first time tonight _ has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Since June of 1998, the Bulls have sunk to the bottom of the
NBA, just as Krause and Reinsdorff planned. Even before the fifth
and sixth championships, they were looking to rebuild, to parcel
out pieces like Scottie Pippen in exchange for young talent and
salary-cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen ripped management. Jordan ripped management. Jackson
ripped management. Management fired back. Krause asserted that
organizations _ not players _ win championships.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, they were allowed to stay together for a sixth
title. But no more. Pippen was shipped out for spare parts and
salary-cap space. Jordan retired. Steve Kerr and Luc Longley were
swapped for more random pieces and more salary-cap room. Dennis
Rodman retired, then unretired elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jackson is back and will undoubtedly be flush with emotion
tonight at United Center. But bitterness over the Breakup of the
Bulls won't be among his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   A year away from the game, a successful first half-season with
the Lakers, and a ceremony honoring Jackson here last May have
combined to soften the landscape, to loosen old tensions. But it's
hard not to think about what might have been, had there been no NBA
lockout, and had the Bulls been allowed to continue their
incredible run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have probably won seven, eight championships,'' said
Lakers guard Ron Harper, a member of the Bulls' last three
championship teams, who also makes his first return as an opponent.
``I mean, who knows, that's just a thought. Hey, I got my
championship rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did, too, before retiring to his Montana ranch for a
year of reflection. He doesn't stop to think about what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, really I don't because we had a prelude to it the
year before (when Krause nearly broke up the team), and we went
through the idea of (it),'' Jackson said. ``Originally, I was going
to retire after seven years, I felt comfortable doing that, then it
went on for eight. And then the ninth year (1998) was _ it was just
the pie a la mode. It was the a la mode on the whole wonderful time
I had here. And that year, I thought the team and the group played
closer together than almost anytime they played before. Even though
we didn't have the best record of the last three-peat group, it was
a year in which we had the best time as a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very good memories that I have. The people that
surround the team, the sports staff, the press people in this town
treated me very well. The fans that were overflowing with their
emotions and their generosity to me and my family. All those things
are all positive aspects, and the reality is that Jerry Reinsdorff
invited me to come back twice to coach the team last year, and I
felt very comfortable saying no, that it was the right time for
myself to retire, and I felt the right time for the rest of the
team to give it up, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, he hasn't spoken to the Jerrys (save for Jerrys Buss and
West), and doesn't plan to while he's here.
</P>
<P>
   As for the emotional response to playing against the Bulls at
United Center, Jackson himself isn't sure, but he expects ``moments
of suspense and drama'' when he walks from the visitors' locker
room to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could anticipate what the emotions are going to be
like, but I really can't,'' he said. ``I know it's going to be an
emotional time, but I don't know to what level. It's going to be
different being at the other end of the court. It's going to be
different seeing that other team at the other end of the floor. And
then being the opposing person in a home space, or what feels like
a home space, is going to be different. But I think by the time the
jump ball goes up, it'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it's a fine opportunity to give Jackson's
players some added motivation as they start the second half of the
season, and a six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely there, the emotion is definitely high,'' said
Kobe Bryant. ``You're a little more pumped us for this game than
you would be if it was just another team starting off the road
trip.''

 TO WTO-ANALYSIS)  
 CLINTON'S UNFINISHED TRADE AGENDA  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The trade policy debate is affecting a broad range of U.S.
international economic policies, including the following:
<P>
   &UR; CHINA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In November, when U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
and Chinese officials reached the historic deal to bring China into
the World Trade Organization, part of the deal was for Congress to
approve Permanent Normal Trade Relations status for Beijing. This
status would end the annual vote on trade benefits that has been a
constant source of U.S.-China friction.
</P>
<P>
   Victory in Congress was considered a done deal _ until the WTO's
Seattle summit in December. Now, many legislators see anything
WTO-related as too controversial to touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Seattle, a lot of members of Congress came back to
Washington and no longer took a strong position supporting
China-WTO,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., one of the leaders
of the pro-China campaign. ``They associate the WTO with trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate groups, especially in Silicon Valley, warn that a
potential trade bonanza may be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress doesn't pass Permanent Normal Trade Relations, all
other countries will benefit from China being in the WTO except
us,'' said Daryl Hatano, vice president of the Semiconductor
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFRICA AND THE CARIBBEAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bills approved by Congress last year to give free-trade status
to Africa and the Caribbean were the administration's only
legislative trade-policy victories of 1999. But differences between
the House and Senate versions must be ironed out in conference
committee _ and the talks have unexpectedly stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Backers are arguing over three key provisions: whether to
require foreign apparel makers to use U.S. fabric; whether to
include the Caribbean and Central America or limit the bill to
Africa; and whether to include anti-child-labor protections.
Congressional leaders have recently said the bills may be shelved
altogether in an attempt to give the China legislation top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEBT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Clinton administration announced that it would
cancel 100 percent of poor nations' bilateral debt to the United
States. The move was a turnaround for U.S. policy and marked a
partial victory for critics who said that the poorest nations' huge
annual debt payments prevented them from fighting their own
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the switch was partly due to Clinton's need
to rally Third World support behind the controversial U.S.
negotiating position at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   In response, several European countries have announced similar
moves. But the IMF and other multilateral development banks have
refused to copy the American plan, saying rich nations must
compensate them if any debt is to be canceled. And Congress has
refused to give even the funds for Clinton's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A fight is brewing over U.S. proposals to end the IMF's
long-term lending programs for poor nations. The Clinton
administration wants to limit the IMF to short-term emergency
lending.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the U.S. plan remain fuzzy, the
administration's move in part reflects belated recognition of
longtime criticism from liberals, who say that the IMF's strict
loan conditions force poor nations to cut social programs.
</P>
<P>
   However, liberals and poor nations complain that the move would
simply create the need for new aid programs to compensate countries
that desperately need them.

 SIDEBAR)  
 ANALYSIS: DEADLOCK OVER TRADE ISSUES KEEPS WTO STUCK IN LIMBO  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a year ago, free-trade policies were viewed worldwide as
virtually self-evident truths. Now, they are harshly questioned.
</P>
<P>
   After grinding to a halt at the riot-scarred World Trade
Organization summit in Seattle in December, the march toward a new
global order hit another roadblock last week.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Geneva of the WTO's governing body, the General
Council, diplomats were unable to resolve their deep differences
over Seattle's hot issues, such as internal WTO reforms, labor
rights and concessions for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they resorted to happy talk. WTO Director General Mike
Moore announced an agreement to resume talks about services and
agriculture in Geneva later this month and in March, respectively.
The organization ``is very much in business'' with ``a tremendous
amount of goodwill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials admitted that the talks have no fixed agenda and
are likely to spend the rest of this year simply trying to come up
with one.
</P>
<P>
   They virtually abandoned hopes of a new, multiyear ``round'' of
WTO negotiations _ the purpose of the Seattle summit. They also
failed to extend several WTO measures that expired January 1 _ a
worldwide ban on e-commerce taxation, which the United States had
fought hard to keep, and Third World nations' exemption from strict
patent, copyright and investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   These expired rules now languish in a sort of twilight zone,
with the WTO's 135 member nations informally agreeing not to
challenge them for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're passing like ships in the night,'' said U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, referring to the international
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is if the multilateral system appears to be
faltering, you leave a vacuum'' in which protectionist pressures
can mount around the world, she warned. ``That is exceptionally
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has reacted to the impasse by
resorting to a kind of diplomatic triage. It has downplayed efforts
to start the new WTO round and instead is concentrating on trying
to ensure congressional passage of legislation giving permanent
trade benefits to China.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration may be aggravating tensions in the WTO
rather than smoothing them.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; U.S. Push on Reforms
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to coax Democrats to support the China bid, U.S.
officials have pushed forward on one of the most hotly debated
issues at Seattle: American insistence that the WTO address labor
and environmental reforms. Third World governments _ many of whom
harshly repress labor organizing and have lax pollution controls _
claim that such talk is a mere attempt to allow rich nations to
levy trade sanctions against poor nations' products.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the recent economic summit in Davos,
Switzerland, President Clinton argued passionately that the world
trading system must heed Seattle's ``wake-up call'' by protecting
labor rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   His words were applauded by U.S. union leaders, whose support is
key to the election campaign of Vice President Al Gore. For many
diplomats, however, Clinton's address was poison.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that did not mention Clinton but clearly attacked
his proposals, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said ``a peculiar
alliance'' is championing ``globophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of the far left, the far right, environmental groups,
labor unions from developed countries and some people who proclaim
themselves representatives of civil society are uniting around a
common purpose: to save people of developing countries from
development,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is getting hot in Washington, where congressional
support is weakening for the China legislation and for other
trade-related measures, such as a free-trade pact for Africa and
the Caribbean and financing for Third World debt cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of free trade say Clinton's advocacy of social issues
is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say we want a more open trade system and also want
arrangements that will prevent trade,'' said Sen. Daniel Moynihan,
D-N.Y. ``American trade policy is in a crisis. It is the only
crisis on the horizon that could spoil the economic good times.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heated rhetoric and uncertainty about the WTO's
direction, most experts agree that the current boom in
international trade and investment is not about to end, at least in
the short term. The process of economic globalization _ the merging
of nations' commerce, communications, investment, services and even
culture _ is too complex and powerful to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the debate will be over who benefits from that process.
</P>
<P>
   In Davos, Barshefsky lamented that ``there is a message that the
labor movement has started that has an underlying resonance among
the American public. Why are 60 percent of all Americans against
free trade?'' she asked, referring to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the challenge is not how to cobble together a
short-term diplomatic coalition but how to forge a new, long-term
international consensus on social concerns, as Clinton is trying to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What showed up in Seattle, aside from the street protests, was
a deepening gap between the developed and developing world,'' said
Greg Mastel, a trade policy analyst at the New America Foundation,
a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the president has got to create consensus over
how to address (social issues) in the WTO. But it will be very
controversial with the Third World, and the gap may grow deeper in
the short term. All great challenges, almost by definition, are
very difficult to do.''

ST. LOUIS HAS WEST SINGIN' THE BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you talk about the top teams in the Western Conference,
it's Dallas, Detroit and Colorado _ winners of the past four
Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   The top team in the West this year, however, is the St. Louis
Blues, who trailed the Mighty Ducks 3-1 late in the second period
Saturday night before firing off five consecutive goals and winning
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues (35-15-6) have 76 points, three more than the Red
Wings in the Central Division. Since losing to the Kings in the
second game of the season, they are 17-5-4 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Blues do not have the resume of the other top
clubs, they have gotten stronger from their postseason losses.
Three times in the past four years, they have reached the second
round. Since 1995, they have been eliminated three times by the Red
Wings. Last year it was the Stars, who went on to win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very persistent and give hard, 60-minute efforts,''
said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg. ``Their players are working very
hard. There are no cheaters on that team. They play a mean type of
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cite the play of captain Chris Pronger, who is battling the
Kings' Rob Blake for the Norris Trophy as the league's top
defenseman. His 34 assists are a career high, but more impressive
are the 34 minutes he averages each game.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Turgeon remains one of the league's top scorers even
though he went out just before the All-Star break with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference is the play of pesky left winger
Tyson Nash, who relishes the role of taking on the other team's top
players and helps prove every night that St. Louis belongs.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the Blues played a home-and-home set against
Detroit and Nash got under the Red Wings' skin even before the
first game began. Chris Chelios fired a puck at Nash during pregame
warmups in retaliation for Nash sending a puck into Detroit's net,
his usual pregame custom.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Nash was punched in the back of the head by Detroit
captain Steve Yzerman and then taunted the future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he threw a pillow at me,'' Nash said. ``I wasn't
sure what he threw at me. He must have hit me with a soft glove.
Was it his bare hand? The ref must have had his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues and Red Wings split the series, but the two could meet
again in the playoffs. Even though the Wings have the second-most
points in the West, they are seeded fourth behind the three
division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kidd almost home: Trevor Kidd, the Florida goaltender who
dislocated his right shoulder two months ago trying to stop a shot
during the team's Skills Competition, hopes to be back by the end
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a minor-league rehab assignment, but Friday is
Kidd's target date.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Kidd used the Carolina home-and-home series at the
end of the month as a target, but the timetable has moved up. Coach
Terry Murray has not ruled out the possibility of keeping three
goaltenders until Kidd comes all the way back. The Panthers would
rather not trade Mikhail Shtalenkov, who was acquired from Phoenix
when Kidd went down. They'd like him to agree to go to the minors
and this way they can expose him during the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   If Shtalenkov is not taken, they would then have a quality No. 2
next year and try to unload veteran Mike Vernon during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coming on: Despite the painful loss to St. Louis, the Mighty
Ducks are optimistic about reaching the playoffs based on their
history as a second-half team.
</P>
<P>
   In the franchise's seven-year history, the Ducks have never had
a winning record at the All-Star break. Three of the past four
seasons, though, they've had a winning record after the All-Star
break. The Ducks play 27 of their final 28 games against Western
Conference teams, including 10 against the Pacific Division. Twelve
of those final 28 are against the four teams that were holding down
the spots directly in front of the Ducks, including four against
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew all along it was going to be a battle in this league
to make the playoffs,'' Hartsburg said. ``We set some higher goals,
but we knew we were in a tough conference. We were falling out of
it pretty quick there. We're playing well now and we have to keep
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fired, then hired: Joe Murphy has landed with the Washington
Capitals less than a week after getting cut by the Boston Bruins
for making extremely negative comments about coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The Edmonton Oilers were interested and GM Glen Sather has done
well with reclamation projects. Murphy scored a career-high 82
points for the Oilers in 1991-92 and Sather wanted him for his
depleted second line.
</P>
<P>
   __ Finally: The NHL lost one of its cornerstones this past week
when Sid Abel, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, died at 81 of
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Abel, who also had battled cancer the past few years, was the
center on the Production Line, one of hockey's legendary units. He
played between Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay and helped Detroit win
three Stanley Cups and four division titles. During the
championship season of 1949-50, Lindsay led the league in scoring,
followed by Abel and Howe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BLUELINE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
EAGLE HAS LANDED
</P>
<P>
   Although Dallas' !bold!Eddie Belfour faced only 14 shots Sunday
when he won his 300th career game, it wasn't an easy night. The
Washington Capitals came in 14-3-2 since Jan. 1 and lost 2-1 when
Stars rookie !bold!Brendan Morrow scored twice. Dallas, 8-2 in its
last 10, looks ready to defend its cup. !bold!Brett Hull returned
after missing Friday's loss to the Kings with a broken nose. Former
captain !bold!Derian Hatcher and !bold!Jere Lehtinen are expected
back this week after missing considerable time because of
injuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAVE TO BEAT BAD TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers, fighting for a playoff spot in the East,
are happy they don't have to face the lowly Islanders. The Rangers
lost to them 4-2 Sunday night and are just three points ahead of
ninth-place Buffalo. Especially tough is goaltender !bold!Steve
Weekes, who beat them twice as a member of the Islanders and twice
with Vancouver before he was traded. On an up note, !bold!Jan
Hlavac, a member of the Rangers' ``Checkmate'' line that includes
!bold!Radek Dvorak and !bold!Petr Nedved, became a father Saturday
and scored a goal on Sunday, his fifth in five games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BAD SIGN
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing Boston has a playoff shot since the Bruins started
the season 0-5-4 and were 3-12-8 during a stretch in November and
December. In between, Boston had an 11-2-1 run, so not everything
has been bad. But center !bold!Jason Allison is gone for the season
because of injuries. Winger !bold!Joe Murphy was cut not long after
he signed because of publicly second-guessing coach !bold!Pat
Burns. The lack of offense has taken its toll on the defense. Last
season, the Bruins allowed three or more goals 31 times in 82
games. Through 58 games this year, Boston has done it 30 times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHY WAIT?
</P>
<P>
   The NHL trading deadline is May 14, but the Toronto Maple Leafs
think that is too close to the end of the season. The Leafs are
first in the Northeast Division and third in the East overall. But
they remember losing in five games to Buffalo in last year's
conference finals so they have been making moves all along. Last
week, it was pesky !bold!DarcyTucker, who came over from Tampa Bay
in exchange for Toronto native !bold!Mike Johnson. New this season
are !bold!Jonas Hoglund, Nik Antropov, Cory Cross, Dmitri
Khristich, Wendel Clark, Gerald Diduck and now Tucker.

 PELICAN BAY GUARD GUILTY IN SHOOTING  &HT;     By BILL WALLACE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former guard at Pelican Bay State Prison was found guilty
Monday of shooting an inmate without justification during an
incident at the maximum security facility in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Federal jurors at U.S. District Court in San Francisco
deliberated two days before finding ex-guard David Gene Lewis, a
52-year-old Crescent City resident, guilty of violating inmate
Harry Long's constitutional rights during the incident.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, Long was under attack by another
Pelican Bay inmate armed with a razor. Though Long was clearly not
the instigator, Lewis shot him through the chest. Long recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was indicted last year for using his position as a guard
to violate Long's civil rights and for using a firearm in the
commission of a crime, both federal offenses. The jury found him
guilty of both charges Monday after a trial that began February 1.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known when Lewis will appear before U.S. District
Judge Maxine Chesney for sentencing. He could be imprisoned for up
to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred during an outbreak of inmate shootings in
California's huge prison system. In 1994, the year Long was
wounded, seven California prisoners were fatally wounded by guards.
A year earlier, eight inmates were killed in shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The number of fatal shootings dropped sharply after a
system- &LR; wide order was issued in 1995 prohibiting guards from
firing at inmates to break up fights.
</P>
<P>
   Pelican Bay, the institution where Lewis once  &LR; had worked, was
one of the most criticized California prisons at the time of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Del Norte County facility, which houses 3,700 inmates, is
considered one of the toughest prisons in the country. It has a
specialized wing called the Security Housing Unit that was built to
hold some of the state's most violent convicts.
</P>
<P>
   One year after Long was wounded, U.S. District Judge Thelton
Henderson ordered a court-appointed monitor to review the prison's
operations and recommend reforms.
</P>
<P>
   A scathing 1995 report issued by Henderson contained a 105-page
section detailing incidents in which guards beat, shot, shocked and
scalded inmates. The judge concluded: ``Prisoners at Pelican Bay
have been subjected to excessive force _ including assaults,
beatings and naked cagings in inclement weather _ on a scale
sufficient to demonstrate a pattern rather than a collection of
isolated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misuse of force at Pelican Bay is not merely aberrational,
but an inevitable and all too common consequence of ... actions and
omissions which tolerate and encourage the use of grossly excessive
and unnecessary force,'' Henderson wrote.

BUSH WRESTLES WITH ENGLISH, LOSES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ George W. Bush was on ``Meet the Press'' on
Sunday, and reader Kwame Mbutu noticed that W kept talking about
how others are ``subscribing'' to him viewpoints that are not his.
<P>
   Hey, W, why look a gift horse in the mouth?
</P>
<P>
   But besides that, cancel my subscription to W.
</P>
<P>
   W reminds me of a wrestler I once interviewed, the Assassin, who
answered my more probing questions by saying, ``I can't indulge
that information.''
</P>
<P>
   W also talked about ``Chechnyans,'' which are no doubt close
cousins to the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   If W gets elected, let's hope he pushes Congress for a dramatic
increase in funding for education of U.S. presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bush, if he gets hisself elected, could hire a tutor. Like
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley stopped by the Chronicle offices Monday, and some who
listened to him said they felt he was too low-key, non-dynamic.
Wonder what Confucius would say to that.
</P>
<P>
   Hint to Bill: Get with your adviser Michael Jordan, take some
lessons in Jordan's speciality _ talking trash. He was the master.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, W has sent his dad, brother, nephew and dog Spot to
California to take his place while he's busy elsewhere, which makes
me think of the singing group, Everything But the Girl.
</P>
<P>
   W will soon be seen wearing a T-shirt saying: ``My mom and dad
went to California and all I got was this stupid primary victory.''
</P>
<P>
   I'M NOT superstitious (knock on linoleum), but my weather
adviser Al Sleet (yes, I'm ripping off George Carlin) notes that
every time a new Starbucks opens in the Bay Area, we get more
Seattle weather.
</P>
<P>
   One tipoff is that rainstorms are now rated  &UR; Tall, Grande  &LR; and
 &UR; Vente.  &LR; With or without steamed clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an encouraging word Monday when the radio
weatherperson said, ``Rains continue to pelt the Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelting is OK, unless you're a beaver. What you have to watch
out for is being  &UR; lashed  &LR; or  &UR; buffeted  &LR; by the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Which, incidentally, is why W isn't in California. He had to
send his cowboy boots out to be buffeted.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING of wind, Michael Haworth was watching the Buick Open
over the weekend and announcer David Faraday commented on the
weather, saying, ``What wind there is, is rushing from the players'
rear.''
</P>
<P>
   Would that be a south wind?
</P>
<P>
   WHY STANFORD is excelling in the basketball world at present: No
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent Cardinal victory, Doug Wilkins heard the radio
announcer say of the Stanford five, ``It's like the Trojan Horse
without the Achilles Heel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the road to the Final Four will be a real Odyssey, though I
think that announcer is a bit of a Homer.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE STILL buzzing, politely, down in Carmel about Tiger
Woods' charge to victory in the AT&AMP;T. Tiger stirred up so much
excitement with his comeback that many locals sent their butlers
out to see what all the commotion was.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Glen reports that there's a movement at Pebble Beach to
rename the Del Monte Forest ... Tiger Woods.

 BUSH MAY NOT MAKE MARCH 2 DEBATE WITH MCCAIN  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, missing in action in California since
November, may duck a March 2 debate with Arizona Sen. John McCain _
the only scheduled California meeting between the two leading
Republican candidates for president before the state primary.
</P>
<P>
   Although CNN and the Los Angeles Times have had the Southern
California debate on the schedule for months, Bush's campaign said
Monday there is no guarantee the GOP front-runner will show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush never agreed to any debate in California,'' said
Margita Thompson, spokeswoman for the Bush campaign in the state.
``That doesn't mean he won't do it,'' she said, but added that the
candidate's campaign plans are uncertain until after February 19,
the date of the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   The dustup over the debate is only the latest woe for Bush, who
has seen his once-effortless stroll toward the Republican
presidential nomination turn into a grim slog through a minefield
of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has been leading the Republican polls for months,
McCain's stunning landslide victory in the New Hampshire primary
February 1 has turned up the heat in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain are now slugging it out in South Carolina, where
the polls show them running neck and neck before Saturday's
primary. In New Hampshire, and now in South Carolina, McCain's war
hero persona and blunt campaign style have gone over well with
voters, and Bush's advisers might not be anxious for a
head-to-head, televised debate only days before the campaign's most
important primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the situation (the Bush campaign) is in, I wouldn't be
making decisions on what happens after Saturday (in South
Carolina),'' said one Republican consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty over Bush's plans for California comes the day
his campaign begins inundating the state's airwaves with millions
of dollars in television advertising, a barrage that McCain's
financially strapped campaign probably cannot match.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked if our campaign is going to compete
aggressively in California, and this is one indication that we
will,'' said Gerald Parsky, the governor's state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky denied that the coming television blitz will be a
substitute for the personal attention Bush has been giving other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be in California one day next week and then several
other days before the primary, Parsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can win California just by paid TV,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many California Republicans are worried about campaign strategy,
fearing that Bush has not shown enough concern and respect for the
nation's most populous state. Bush has been absent from California
since mid-November and declined to show up at this month's state
Republican convention in Burlingame, where McCain was a visible,
and loudly cheered, presence.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to debate McCain in California can only hurt Bush,
said John Herrington, secretary of energy under President Ronald
Reagan and former head of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will damage him severely,'' said Herrington, who headed the
Steve Forbes campaign in California. ``If I was advising him, I'd
say (the Los Angeles debate) was a must. It's a major strategic
error. ... The McCain people must be rubbing their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   With the primary race tightening, Bush needs to spend time in
California, said Mark Baldassare, who polls for the Chronicle and
the Public Policy Institute of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be taken seriously as a presidential candidate in
this election, candidates need to come to California and make their
case because of the size and composition of the electorate here,''
Baldassare said. ``It's the biggest test of the election season.''
</P>
<P>
   Word that Bush might skip the debate in California caught the
event's organizers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has told us informally that he is planning on
attending,'' said Maryanne McNellis, who is arranging the debate
for the Los Angeles Times. ``All I can say is that he spoke with
one of our people on the campaign trail and said he would be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials insist a different event is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still open as to whether and in what forum (Bush) will
appear to debate in California,'' Parsky said. ``It's very possible
he won't debate before the L.A. Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsky refused to commit to any debate in California, insisting
that ``no decision has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   The CNN-Los Angeles Times debate would be broadcast live just
days before the March 7 primaries, when voters in California, New
York, Ohio and 13 other states will help select their parties'
candidates for president. Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley
already have agreed to a similar California debate March 1.
</P>
<P>
   And recent polls in California have shown McCain quickly closing
the once-wide gap with Bush, who also is falling behind both Gore
and Bradley in head-to-head matchups.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey released Tuesday by the Public Policy Institute of
California shows that among likely voters of all parties, Gore
leads with 29 percent, Bush has 24 percent, McCain has 17 percent
and Bradley has 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's poll last month showed Bush on top with 28
percent, Gore at 27 percent, Bradley at 13 percent and McCain far
back with 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, who are the only ones whose votes will count
in their party's California primary, Bush still leads McCain by 46
percent to 24 percent. That advantage was 56 percent to 11 percent
a month ago.

 BRADLEY ACCUSES VICE PRESIDENT OF NAME CALLING, SCARE TACTICS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bill Bradley threw his sharpest elbows yet at Al
Gore, charging in an interview Monday that the vice president has
deliberately misrepresented the effects of Bradley's health plan in
order to scare AIDS patients and is guilty of ``low-level,
bottom-feeding politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore shamelessly tried to scare a vulnerable population in
this city by asserting what isn't true,'' the former New Jersey
senator said in an interview with the Chronicle editorial board
Monday. ``That's what he was trying to do ... and we deserve
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's tough words were prompted by a story published Monday
in the Chronicle in which Gore charged that Bradley's plan would
devastate tens of thousands of people with AIDS and HIV and leave
them without long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, (Bradley) just made a catastrophic mistake in
the design of his health care plan,'' the vice president said
Sunday during an interview with The Chronicle at the close of the
California Democratic convention in San Jose. ``And since the day
that he unveiled his plan in September, he has been backpedaling in
an effort to fill the gaps and explain away the unexplainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane kept up the attack Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really scary is Sen. Bradley's health care plan. It's
right up there with `Scream 3,' '' Lehane said. ``Sen. Bradley has
been consistently challenged on his health care plan, but has yet
to build a refute that challenges Al Gore's plan on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute came as a new poll showed Gore leading in the March
7 primary and pulling away from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 2,058 California residents by the Public Policy
Institute of California has Gore leading among likely voters in an
open primary with 29 percent of the vote, followed by Republican
George W. Bush with 24 percent, Republican John McCain with 17
percent and Bradley with 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democratic voters who will decide the party primary's
victor, Gore now leads Bradley 52 percent to 15 percent. A month
ago, Gore's lead was a narrower 48 percent to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Monday that Gore's assertions in the Chronicle
story ``made my blood boil'' and that the vice president ``should
be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator took the unusual step Monday of calling a
news conference specifically to address Gore's comments,
surrounding himself with local supporters, including Supervisors
Michael Yaki and Tom Ammiano and an AIDS patient and gay activist,
Jeff Sheehy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Saturday, at the state Democratic convention, the vice
president said `Let's not be divisive.' Now he comes out with an
outrageous attempt to scare a vulnerable population,'' Bradley said
at the news conference. ``It's the worst use of scare tactics I've
seen in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy, too, said he was outraged by Gore's attacks. ``For the
vice president to try to frighten people who are in a precarious,
marginal situation causes me to have serious questions about his
character,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's public jabs at Gore came after a major environmental
speech at the San Francisco Sierra Club headquarters Monday in
which he criticized Gore for a lack of leadership on environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He charged that the Clinton administration's record on offshore
oil drilling, protecting public lands and prosecuting polluters has
not been leadership but ``window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my administration, we will keep the promises that we make
on environmental issues. We will enforce the laws and strengthen
that enforcement. And I will clean up our politics in this country
by cleaning out the lobbyists and special interests who seek to
despoil our environment for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley saved his toughest criticism of Gore for The
Chronicle editorial board, maintaining that his own health care
plan would better assist people with AIDS and HIV because it would
move them to private health insurance _ and that insurance would be
regulated by federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``All money is the same under my proposal. All service is the
same. All benefits are the same,'' Bradley said. ``So what is
better is that somebody with HIV will be able to join a federal
health system. They can't join private systems now because of
pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is better in the proposal I offer is the major investment
in community health centers and clinics, which is where most
patients who have HIV and AIDS can be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he wasn't really surprised by the attack and other
shots Gore took at him during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenor of his remarks is consistent with what (Gore) has
said all along,'' he said. ``It's name calling. Once again, he
called me names. It's another example of the meanness in politics
that's fundamentally destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``has mischaracterized my record and my proposals,''
Bradley said. ``That basically disrespects the voter.''
</P>
<P>
   But while claiming he was ``not stepping back'' from responding
to such techniques by Gore, Bradley sidestepped the question of
whether he will go negative on Gore in TV ads or speeches _ a
technique that some insiders say may be necessary for him to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took off the gloves here today. ... I'm not going to
hesitate to draw comparisons ... (but) if the only thing that makes
the news is attacks, then I don't have an audience,'' he said.
``The way you change politics ... is you do things a different way,
and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his TV ads will get tougher than a current spot,
which features an endorsement by basketball superstar Michael
Jordan, Bradley said with a smile, ``I didn't think it would be
good for Michael to go negative.''

FREE-AGENT LINEBACKER RANDALL GODFREY ON TITANS' WISH LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If the enthusiasm shown by one NFL general
manager for unrestricted free-agent middle linebacker Randall
Godfrey means anything, the Dallas Cowboys can expect to lose their
leading tackler of last season soon.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Reese, general manager of the AFC champion Tennessee
Titans, is extremely eager to meet with Godfrey on Tuesday in
Nashville, Tenn., and sell the four-year veteran on the merits of
coming to a Super Bowl team with a new training facility, a new
stadium and ... Jevon Kearse, arguably the best defensive player in
the game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to recruit the heck out of him,'' Reese said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, a second-round pick in 1996, started every game for the
Cowboys after the 10th game of his rookie year _ 1996-98 at
strongside linebacker, then last season at middle linebacker where
he led the team in tackles with 143, including six for losses. He
also had one sack, four quarterback pressures and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall Godfrey fits our mold perfectly. He's versatile and
athletic,'' Reese said. ``He's not a 270-pound Levon Kirkland kind
of guy ... that's not us anyway. We need a guy who can play a lot
of different spots for us, inside as well as outside, and we've
seen enough of (Godfrey) on tape to know that he can do that for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey arrived in Nashville last night. He visited Jacksonville
on Friday, but walked away from the Jaguars without a contract
offer in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would like to re-sign Godfrey. But if they can't,
they have 1999 rookie Dat Nguyen waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Godfrey have an acrimonious past over contracts.
Godfrey was upset last year when, as a restricted free agent, he
was forced to take the team's qualifying offer of $429,000 even
though he had started 40 consecutive games, counting the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Reese, a classic car enthusiast, said Monday that he isn't above
trying to win Godrey over by taking him for a spin in his recently
acquired 1966 Chevelle Super Sport in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   Said Reese, ``Sure, if he likes that sort of thing.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Green Bay might turn its attention to Cowboys' unrestricted
free-agent defensive end Kavika Pittman now that the Packers have
been turned off by the contract demands of Atlanta free-agent
defensive end Chuck Smith.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cowboys defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman indicated 18.16?]
during the season that he wanted to stay in Dallas for personal, as
well as professional,
</P>
<P>
   reasons. The Cowboys gave him a one-year contract for the
veterans' minimum ($400,000) and a chance to resurrect his career,
which Spellman did. Now comes the real test, as NFL teams,
including the Packers, begin to show an interest in the 29-year-old
unrestricted free agent. nn

BILL BRADLEY CITES HIS BOLDNESS IN COMPARISON TO AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The difference between
Bill Bradley and Al Gore is the difference between boldness and
timidity, Bradley told a Kansas City audience Monday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visiting Missouri for the second time in a week _ and just 22
days before the Super Tuesday primaries _ the Democratic candidate
said his plans for health care, education and gun control go far
beyond what the vice president proposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan will insure over 30 million people; his is about 6 or
7 million people,'' Bradley said about health care. On prescription
drugs for senior citizens, Bradley said, ``We provide a
prescription-drug benefit for the elderly that has no limit. He
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major difference in terms of scope and in terms of
boldness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who in national polls is trailing the vice president
after losing the first two presidential contests in Iowa and New
Hampshire, called Missouri ``must-win'' territory not only because
he is a native of the state. Missouri will join California and New
York and several other states holding contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all must-win states now,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from New Jersey was more than three hours
late for his appearance at Downtown Airport. Still, about 80
supporters endured the delay, some leaving the airport and
returning later. The campaign provided a barbecue dinner to entice
Bradley's backers to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Republican John McCain, the Arizona senator, is
moving up in the GOP polls because of his advocacy of campaign
reform, an issue that Bradley also pushes.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, Bradley took a shot at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only Democrat with no problems in the '96 fund-raising
scandal is the one you are looking at right now,'' he said,
referring to campaign-abuse allegations that Gore confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how Bradley is faring in Missouri is unclear. No
independent polls have been released showing how Bradley stacks up
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters are confident that last week's endorsement
by former basketball great Michael Jordan will boost his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds a lot of credibility,'' said Missouri state Sen.
Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat and Bradley backer. ``Jordan
is well respected, especially by younger folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan appears in a new television ad touting Bradley; the ad is
not yet airing in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A big concern for Bradley could be his ability to attract
independent voters. The only requirement for voting in the
Democratic or Republican primary in Missouri is that a voter be
registered. So Democrats can vote on a Republican ballot and vice
versa. Independent voters also can vote in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire ran a similar type of primary Feb. 1. In that
election, Bradley and McCain found themselves competing for the
same pool of independents. McCain won that battle, which
contributed to his landslide defeat of Bush and Bradley's narrow
loss to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bradley said McCain was able to spend far more time
in New Hampshire than he was because Bradley competed in Iowa and
McCain did not.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he'll do better with independents in Missouri. But
University of Missouri political scientist John Petrocik said
Bradley faces a tough fight on that front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that John McCain is the Cinderella candidate who is
getting all the attention from everybody,'' Petrocik said. ``That
obviously hurts Bradley in an open primary state.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Duwe, spokesman for the Missouri Republican Party, said
voters are looking for something new after seven years of Bill
Clinton, and Bradley doesn't offer it.
</P>
<P>
   He ``doesn't present an alternative,'' Duwe said.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy Temple, executive director of the Missouri Democratic
Party, said the number of independents who will wind up backing
McCain over Bradley is probably small. The Gore-Bradley race is
exciting enough that voters who lean Democratic will wind up voting
in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   The primary ``will be overwhelmingly dominated by people who
have partisan feelings,'' Temple said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another factor. McCain and Bradley are very different
candidates, Temple said. When Democratic voters figure that out,
few will be inclined to back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect that Bradley's status as a Missouri native will
mean little because he's known best for his ties to New Jersey,
which he represented in the Senate for 18 years.

SCIENCE CITY'S FIRST THREE MONTHS SHOW A $900,000 LOSS; A 20
PERCENT PROFIT WAS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Science City chief
David Ucko will stand in front of his board of directors at Union
Station on Wednesday and deliver his first ``State of the City''
address. That state is not as healthy as hoped.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the new museum-theater complex was expected to open with
high profits, it already is losing money. After its first quarter
of operation, Science City revenue is $900,000 below expectations,
according to recently released figures.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this shortfall rests not so much with the museum
itself, where attendance remains on target, but with the complex's
three theaters, where attendance is half what had been forecast.
Either way, this lack of traffic is hurting Union Station's new
restaurants, too.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating Science City's start-up is the fact that 40 percent
of Science City's key managers have left during the last several
months, all of them voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Ucko, in an interview last week, sounded upbeat that the museum
was nearly free of start-up glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really turned a corner. It's very different today than
when we opened,'' said the president of the Kansas City Museum,
which developed and now runs Science City.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Science City's financial performance and
management turnover have triggered several behind-the-scenes
responses:
</P>
<P>
   - The Kansas City Museum obtained a private loan in case of
further deficits, according to Ucko and other Union Station
officials. The borrowing comes from Union Station's endowment,
which itself was set up to offset the high costs of operating the
historic building. The loan hasn't been used yet.
</P>
<P>
   - The museum board, in a step some members think is
unprecedented, granted extra power to one of its committees to
track how Science City's management handles problems.
</P>
<P>
   - The situation is spurring private discussions, even among some
museum board members, about whether the museum's control over parts
of the building should be given to an experienced retail
consultant, Jones Lang LaSalle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with Science City,'' said Louis Smith, a
member of a civic board overseeing Union Station and president of
the Kauffman Foundation, which was Science City's largest private
funder. But he noted: ``We still have a ways to go in some areas.
The key for the museum board is to identify the issues and resolve
them quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   What's happening at Science City is hardly unique. The museum
industry is littered with examples of expansions or start-ups that
missed budget projections and even suffered equipment breakdowns,
as Science City has.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of science centers have gone through troubles in their
formative years because they didn't get their budgets or revenues
right,'' said Emlyn Koster, president of a New Jersey science
museum and member of the Association of Science-Technology Centers
board. ``Sometimes it takes pain and effort to overcome these
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Station reopened in November after a makeover costing more
than $250 million, which was split between private and taxpayer
funding. The building was converted from a train station into a
science museum with three theaters: a planetarium, a stage and
Iwerks large-screen cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Science City was designed as a new kind of science center, one
that borrowed a theme-park device of having costumed actors
interact with museum-goers. By all indications, from media
interviews to museum exit polls, this experiment has been generally
well received.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Meyers, the Kansas City Museum's vice president of
operations, tells the story of filling in as a guide in the surgery
room one day. She told a 10-year-old girl the body on the surgical
table had eaten too many cheeseburgers. The girl mentioned she had
eaten a cheeseburger that day. Meyers assured her that clogged
arteries depended on a person's diet, not just one burger.
</P>
<P>
   As the girl left, Meyers heard her tell her mother, ``From now
on, I'm eating my vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   A different story, however, comes from statistics.
</P>
<P>
   While Science City has sold three times more season tickets than
expected, overall attendance is nearly 13 percent below
projections. Officials estimated 235,879 patrons for the days and
nights through January, but actual paid attendance came to 204,426,
not counting private parties.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Science City's admissions revenues for November,
December and January didn't reach budget projections in all three
months; the shortfall was $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   The museum itself fell short of its attendance yardstick in
December but rebounded in January. Revenues for the quarter
suffered, for instance, because busloads of school kids visit
Science City each weekday, but at a reduced price.
</P>
<P>
   The three theaters have not come close to original estimates,
despite hundreds of thousands of dollars spent to schedule a
variety of shows. In January, night-time shows drew just 55 percent
of their audience goal. One-fifth of all Science City visitors were
expected to come for Iwerks movies alone, but Meyers acknowledged,
``That is not happening at all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION- 2ND TAKE] &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo.: ``That is not happening at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Science City's operations are on pace to run a
considerable deficit its first six months _ a time when the complex
is not only supposed to earn money but have a 20 percent profit
margin.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with the theaters has been something of a vicious
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Science City officials find the public isn't aware of the
theaters. But that's because, Meyers said, ``We haven't marketed
the theaters much.'' And there was little marketing because, Ucko
said, ``It's no fun refunding tickets'' from canceled shows.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, in particular, were canceled partly because of
projection breakdowns _ something encountered at other Iwerks
theaters in Orlando, Fla., and Indianapolis and something Kansas
City Museum officials were warned about before they chose Iwerks.
</P>
<P>
   Ucko said Iwerks had ``explained away'' its previous problems.
An Iwerks representative said the company was opening theaters all
over the world without breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tom Edmundson, manager of Indianapolis' Iwerks theater,
who handled calls from Science City staffers wanting technical
help, said: ``It seems when Iwerks opens a theater, there's more
down time than the industry standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Science City recently launched a marketing campaign to boost
evening City Nights shows, but the dearth of theater-goers is
having a domino effect on Union Station's restaurants and shops.
Rod Anderson, a restaurateur who operates Pierpont's and a few
other eateries, judged his business to be $150,000 below
projections so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Nights was supposed to be this hit and be packed all the
time, and it's not,'' Anderson said. ``That's where we're feeling
the biggest letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   For months leading up to Science City's opening, Ucko and Meyers
recruited managers with theme-park backgrounds because the new
museum was supposed to be a theme-park hybrid. Yet, all those from
theme parks left since mid-1999, part of the turnover of six of
Ucko's 15 directors.
</P>
<P>
   Other science center directors, consultants and associations
maintain that turnover is normal with a new museum. Most indicated
20 percent was average in the first few years.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one could name another science museum that lost 40
percent of its key directors in such a short span.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not normal,'' said Patrick Gallagher, Science City's
primary exhibits designer, who has worked with dozens of different
museums.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left the Kansas City Museum as its marketing director
last year, Joe Donnelly voiced his frustration to several project
officials and museum board members. In one incident, he walked into
one official's office and remarked that Science City's
administrators ``don't know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, who now markets Union Station for tourist groups, says
the incident reflected his concerns at the time. They also echo the
thoughts of other top managers who quit during the past year and
were interviewed by The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   These managers and other former staffers brought up several
issues:
</P>
<P>
   The theaters hardly make use of their potential. For example,
the planetarium did not have a special program for the recent
eclipse, as other did around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, managers from theme-park cultures expected problems
to be handled more quickly. ``It was a long ordeal to get a
decision made to change something,'' said Amy Siedlik, a ticket
manager who quit last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ucko agreed. Many museum decisions involve consultation with
other agencies. For instance, one complaint his staff hears in
Union Station is that visitors don't know where the museum is. So
Ucko wants to add signs. But because the path to Science City goes
through the station's historic Grand Hall, he must work out
compromises with the station's owner and a preservation board.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it a very complicated place to work,'' Ucko said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the former managers believed the remaining organization
lacked experience running a high-volume museum. In response, Ucko
produced brief biographies of 16 current managers. One listed
previous experience with a museum: Ucko himself, in Chicago and Los
Angeles. Several others came from hotels. Meyers herself came from
a computer consulting and analyst background.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I bring to the table is I have been able to pick up a
number of industries in my career and figure out what makes them
tick,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ucko said, ``The staff that we have in key guest experience
roles...all have significant operating experience in relevant
settings.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Science City's performance so far a start-up blip or will
deficits and departures continue? ``That's almost a better question
to ask after the summer,'' Meyers replied. That's when attendance
is supposed to peak.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, though, Science City leaders are taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Museum and the Union Station Assistance Corp.
arranged a $7.2 million financing package. It's mostly for
constructing additional tenant space, but $1.2 million is set aside
for what Ucko calls ``a line of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Museum already faced a financial hole before
Science City ever opened. Union Station leaders had set up an
endowment to subsidize station operations, but later reduced its
annual payout from $2 million to $1.3 million to help build up the
fund for future years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact is the museum may have to do a little more
aggressive fund-raising,'' said Thomas McDonnell, president of DST
Systems Inc. and chairman of the civic board overseeing Union
Station.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of Science City's operation, however, goes
beyond its own bottom line. Union Station's fiscal condition
basically depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ucko alluded to this in a December memo to Union Station's
preservation board: ``We must recognize that Science City bears the
brunt of the financial responsibility for...Union Station. The
tremendous effort and investment made to save this landmark...will
be for naught if we cannot generate the significant revenues needed
to operate and maintain it.''

COMPANY THAT OPERATES GUY'S FOODS SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, MO. - The company that
operates Guy's Foods sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
Monday, hoping to buy time to obtain additional financing from its
main lender and possibly find a buyer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Liberty, Mo., company has been losing money and defaulted on
its debt to LaSalle National Bank of Chicago. An emergency hearing
will be held today before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Koger on a
plan to fund the company's payroll. That payroll covers 1,000
employees, 600 of whom are at the company's headquarters and
manufacturing plant in Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known whether Guy's intends to cut its work force.
Company officials did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the bank requested the company to file (Chapter 11)
if it wanted to continue its line of credit,'' said Gary Justis, a
lawyer with Lathrop &AMP; Gage who represents Guy's.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for LaSalle, Daniel Flanigan of Polsinelli White
Vardeman &AMP; Shalton, said the bank ``is taking a hard look at the
situation and will be analyzing it a day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy petition, filed late Monday afternoon in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Kansas City, contained only sketchy information
about the company's financial condition. Instead of a financial
breakdown, boxes were checked off indicating that assets and
liabilities ranged between $10 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Justis said Guy's had been losing money, but he declined to say
what triggered the filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they're having financial difficulties,'' he said.
``The best thing I can tell you is that as soon as we can get
financing in place, we'll have a lot more information available to
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   An affiliate of Guy's, Family Snacks of North Carolina Inc.,
filed for bankruptcy in October in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Justis and Flanigan both indicated that at least one company had
expressed interest in buying Guy's or its assets. Neither would
identify the company, but both said it was not industry giant
Frito-Lay Inc., a subsidiary of Pepsico Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing, by halting pending and future legal
actions against Guy's, would make it easier for a buyer to acquire
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Guy's, whose corporate name is Family Snacks Inc., produces
snacks that include tortilla chips, potato chips, pretzels, snack
nuts, ready-to-eat popcorn, pork rinds and corn chips. The products
are made at the 325,000-square-foot Liberty plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded more than 60 years ago by Guy Caldwell
and was acquired by dairy giant Borden Inc. in 1979. In November
1994, the company was taken private when Borden sold Guy's to a
group of Guy's executives, including the company's current
president and chief executive officer, industry veteran Victor R.
Sabatino. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   While Borden owned Guy's, the snack food company's market share
declined in the face of competition from industry leader Frito-Lay,
the Eagle Brand offshoot of Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and other
rivals. Anheuser-Busch got out of the snack food segment four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A story on Guy's that ran in The Kansas City Star in October
1997 said sales that year were expected to be $120 million,
compared with $60 million in 1994, when Borden still owned the
company. Guy's was said to have lost $5 million to $10 million in
1995 and to have broken even in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Long known in Kansas City as a sponsor of Kansas City Athletics
and Kansas City Royals baseball broadcasts, Guy's once held a
dominant 50 percent share of the local snack market. That share
plummeted, however, in the years after Borden's purchase of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Guy's on Monday said the Liberty plant
made ``more variety of snack foods'' than any other snack plant in
the United States. The company has an eight-state distribution area
in the Midwest and manufactures for nationwide warehouse
distributors and international customers.
</P>
<P>
   The statement quoted Sabatino as saying that Guy's filed for
Chapter 11 relief ``to protect the best interests of all our
creditors, as well as our valuable customers and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's two largest unsecured creditors are Stone
Container Co. of Kansas City, which is said to be owed $564,895,
and Rapidways Truck Leasing Inc. of Kansas City, owed $533,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other unsecured creditors are the Kansas City Royals, said to be
owed $207,812, and the St. Louis Rams, $188,223.

FIVE SLAIN NEAR WARRENSBURG, MO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANYANIKA SAMUELS and LYNN FRANEY  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star WARRENSBURG, Mo. _ A woman and four of her
six children were shot and killed Monday morning at their rural
home, a crime that appalled friends and neighbors unfamiliar with
such violence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two other siblings, girls 1 and 3 years old, also suffered
gunshot wounds. They were being treated Monday night at Children's
Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities arrested a man at the scene, a sheriff's dispatcher
said. They did not specify his relationship, if any, to the
victims. No charges had been filed Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving two frantic 911 calls, police officers went to
the Wood family's bunker-style, ``earth contact'' home. There, they
found 31-year-old Tina Wood, and her children, 10-year-old Jared,
8-year-old Joshua, 7-year-old Emily and 5-year-old Hannah, all shot
to death.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old was in critical condition and the 1-year-old was
in fair condition, a Children's Mercy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Wood and her husband, Raymond, lived just north of DD
Highway on Southeast 501 Road, a dirt track about four miles east
of Warrensburg. They shared the property with Raymond Wood's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Warrensburg is about 60 miles east of Kansas City off Missouri
Highway 50.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Stanke, who lives near the Wood family, said he got a phone
call about 8:30 a.m. Monday from someone at the Woods' house asking
for help. He called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatcher Pat Leighter said the sheriff's office also received
a 911 call from the Woods' home about a disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County Sheriff Charles M. Heiss would not say exactly
where the bodies of Tina Wood and her children were found.
</P>
<P>
   Tena Duncan, a neighbor, said Monday's violence astounded her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the country, and it's Warrensburg besides that,'' she
said. ``We don't expect anything like that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiss said Johnson County had no murders last year, and just one
the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of thing never happens here, but it's happened and
now we have to deal with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods had just moved into their dugout home last year, after
living for years in a trailer next to the grandparents' home.
Neighbors said the children would play outside on a blue swing set
or ride bicycles with their dad.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors also said Raymond Wood had run a chimney-repair
business with his father, driven a bus part-time, and worked at an
energy plant. Mark Erwin worked with Wood at the plant, and his
family had bought property from Raymond's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Raymond Wood) was quiet but if you talked to him, he would
talk to you,'' Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Della Davis, another neighbor, couldn't believe the news of the
killings. Her daughters used to babysit the Wood children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very good people,'' she said, as she worked Monday at
a downtown florist shop, arranging sweet-smelling bouquets of roses
and carnations for Valentine's Day customers. ``They were always
helpful, always friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Tina Wood gave Davis' daughters piano lessons.

POLICE OFFICER ORGANIZING BOOK DRIVE FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Seven months ago Mark
Wilson traded his beat as an Overland Park, Kan., police officer
for a job trying to make life better for people in the war-ravaged
remains of Kosovo.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday he turned to a class at Shawnee Mission South High
School for help.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who is on a yearlong leave from the Overland Park Police
Department, spent the last full day of his vacation asking people
to gather books for Kosovar students who are studying English.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know everything they can about the United States.
They don't necessarily want to move over here, but they want to
know what we're like'' in a pluralistic society, Wilson told
students in the South Helping Our Community volunteering class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids want to be like us. They're tired of the cycle of
violence that's been going on for a thousand years, and they want
it to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest burst of violence that led Wilson, 41, to
Kosovo in July. After the bombing campaign that drove out Serbian
forces last year, civil authority and much of the infrastructure
were left in disarray. The United Nations recruited civil police
officers from several countries to help restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson spent about a month in Pristina and then moved south to
Suva Reka, where he is the local chief of operations for the
international civil police force. He will earn about $100,000 for
the yearlong stint, but he said he took the job mostly because he
needed a change in his life.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   His first memory of the province is of mountains of garbage,
smoking ruins and hungry packs of dogs dragging what appeared to be
a human rib cage. There were sticks rising from fresh mounds to
mark bodies that had been pulled from mass graves, identified and
reburied. And there were more mounds without markers, where dirt
covered unidentified victims.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovars welcome the civilian authority, Wilson said, but
he and his officers still must check their cars for explosives
every day. Albanian organized-crime groups are trying to control
the province, he said. The criminals drive red cars with red
license plates _ their own version of marked patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   Several civilian police officers have abandoned their posts
because of the danger and lack of equipment, but Wilson thinks
they're too soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been without electricity since October,'' Wilson said.
``No electricity means no heat and no water, since everyone here
has a pump....Unbelievably, you get used to it; it's like camping
indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   The electricity was beginning to flow again about the time
Wilson flew to Kansas for a 10-day break, and now he's trying to
take care of Kosovar education.
</P>
<P>
   Books were burned in the Kosovar schools, Wilson said, and
English teachers want desperately to replace them. The class at
Shawnee Mission South is organizing a book drive to last at least a
week. On Monday they were just starting to work out the details.

   Kosovar teachers want mostly classic literature in English,
especially the works of American novelists and poets such as Mark
Twain, Ernest Hemingway and Walt Whitman, Wilson said. Children's
books also are welcome. Because the war is so recent in their
memories, Wilson asked that donated books contain minimal violence.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson plans to have the books delivered to elementary and
secondary schools in Suva Reka, and distribute books further if
enough donations come in.
</P>
<P>
   Students in South Helping Our Community, who must volunteer for
20 hours each school quarter, hope to receive donations from
outside the school as well as from their classmates. People who
want to donate books should call the school at (913) 993-7500.

GRAMMYS, CONVENTION AT RISK OVER UNION DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Negotiations between a major concessionaire at the
Staples Center and a union have broken down, with officials saying
that they fear protests could disrupt the Grammy Awards ceremony
next week and possibly even the Democratic National Convention in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Ogden Entertainment, which operates the food
concessions at Staples Center, said Monday they want to bring in a
mediator to try to resolve the labor dispute that has been going on
since the facility opened in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put calls in to the U.S. Mediation Service over the weekend
and hope to hear back from them this week,'' said Lon Rosenberg,
regional manager for Ogden. ``We would like to get this resolved as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Hotel and Restaurant Employees, Local 11,
said they are discussing the next steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we are looking at is a demonstration at the
Grammys, but we want to look at all our options,'' spokeswoman
Kristin Reeg said. ``One of our problems has been that they want to
cut the pay of the workers there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, aware of the pressure he could receive from city
officials, sent a letter to them dated last Friday advising them of
the situation and the potential for protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor negotiators are attempting to use the fact that Staples
Center will host the Democratic Convention to leverage Ogden's
negotiations at this facility,'' Rosenberg wrote. ``They are
banking that this pressure will ultimately influence the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But before that event will be the Grammy Awards, scheduled for
Feb. 23, which will have a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they don't demonstrate, as a show of good faith. But
that's beyond our control,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy spokesman Adam Sandler said it doesn't involve his
organization and is not an issue his group wishes to become
involved with.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said plans call for the streets in front of
Staples Center to be closed off that night, so any demonstration
would be blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Democratic convention, to be held Aug. 14-17,
said they hope to see a resolution to the labor dispute soon so it
will not serve as another distraction to their plans. The
Democratic Party has regulations prohibiting it from meeting in
nonunion facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg said the main disagreement is over the minimum number
of hours people will be credited for working at an event. Ogden
wants it to be four hours, while the union is seeking eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might make sense at a baseball game, but it doesn't for
the events held at Staples Center,'' said Rosenberg, whose firm
also has the concessions at Dodger Stadium and where negotiations
are scheduled. ``A lot of the people only work two hours and are
credited for four.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the facility pays the city's living wage of $8.76 an
hour, without health benefits, for workers. Under the proposed
agreement, he said Ogden would pay benefits to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg estimated there are 550 workers who are affected by
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reeg said the company had not been paying the living
wage as recently as two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers were going up and telling them they were violating the
living wage (ordinance),'' Reeg said.

LANDRY LEFT LEGACY FEW WILL MATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all heard of having big shoes to fill, but when Tom Landry
got the call to become Heaven's Coach on Saturday night, he left a
big hat to fill.
</P>
<P>
   It has settled heavily on our shoulders with an emptiness
matched only by the void we feel so deeply in our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Who, we wonder, can ever wear that hat again? Will there ever be
another like him, in any sport? Will there ever be another Tom
Landry?
</P>
<P>
   It's an almost blasphemous question. Another Landry? Sure, when
there's another Abraham Lincoln, maybe. But how sad it would be if
we never see his like again.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the qualities that Tom Landry had, I would like to think
there could be another like him someday,'' new Dallas Cowboys coach
Dave Campo said Monday from Valley Ranch. ``He not only was a man
of great football knowledge, but he was also a man of great people
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine the way he treated people, his faith, his
ability, he may have been one of a kind, but maybe there'll be
another Tom Landry sometime in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the atmosphere of professional sports today, the odds are
heavily stacked against it. There may be men out there with similar
qualities to Landry, but it is highly unlikely they will ever get
the chance to dance a 29-year waltz with one organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFL today, that's virtually impossible,'' TCU head
coach Dennis Franchione said. ``You don't build programs in the
NFL, you buy them. And if you don't win within two or three years,
you're gone. Building a club like Coach Landry did is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   It can happen more easily on the college level. Recently retired
Tom Osborne at Nebraska and Joe Paterno at Penn State are certainly
icons of the college game and, like Landry, men of character and
high moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not, nor ever will be, Tom Landry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coach Landry's case, integrity and class were certainly
words that followed him wherever he went,'' Franchione said. ``Add
innovation to that list. He was a guy who was doing things way
ahead of everybody else, especially defensively. He always seemed
to be on the cutting edge of development in new trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in sports today is just not conducive to
long-term development. In their first seven years, the Cowboys had
just one winning season while they built that team. That took
patience, by the fans, by the administration and by coach Landry.
Today it's instant coffee, microwaves and
what-have-you-done-for-me-yesterday?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this: Every coach should aspire to be Tom Landry in
some way. If you can maintain the class and integrity and the
professional way that he handled things, you'll have a lot of
positive things going on in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   For there to be another Tom Landry, noted Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock, there might also have to be another Tex Schramm and
another Clint Murchison, the men who stood behind Landry in those
early days when fans were howling for the coach's scalp _ what
there was of it _ as the expansion Cowboys suffered through five
consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bowing to the fans' demands, Murchison and Schramm
stepped forward to sign Landry to a 10-year extension. They
believed in the man in the hat, and he would reward them with 20
consecutive winning seasons. That's how the Cowboys became
America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really admired this man, but I don't necessarily agree that
there can't be another Tom Landry,'' Hitchcock said. ``There are
coaches out there who will be around for 20 or more years. If they
can get people who stick with them through the thin times, then
they could have a chance to accomplish what Landry did as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong belief and foundation is essential to be successful.
His was through the word of God. Sometimes it's through the
structure you have in your family that gives you the strength to
draw upon, but that faith gets tested all the time. You have to
have a tremendous belief in what you're doing, and you cannot do it
on your own. Those who think they can are arrogant. It's
impossible. You need a strong infrastructure around you, a circle
that has to be very loyal and very defined.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rangers manager Johnny Oates, already in Florida getting
ready for the opening of spring training this weekend, it's a moot
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ``know'' there'll never be another Tom Landry,'' Oates said.
``There may be another guy who can get in on the ground floor and
last 29 years some place. The odds are against it, but I guess it
could happen. But there's a lot more to Tom Landry than 29 years
with an organization or coaching a football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three different articles I've read mentioned the word
`integrity.' Everyone places values on different things, and that's
the one word that rings a bell with me. It means to be honest and
morally right. That's the best description I could give of Tom
Landry in the way I got to know him, and I've never heard anyone
say anything contrary to that. He walked the walk and talked the
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The special set of circumstances that helped Landry and the
Cowboys become the most glorified team in NFL history may never be
repeated. Joe Torre and the Yankees? He just needs another quarter
century and sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very unique situation,'' Oates said. ``I don't know
how many teams we can call America's Team. It was a team that
captured the imagination of the country, and he was the man in the
hat, the man who led it.''
</P>
<P>
   How much did Oates admire Landry?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not big on autographs, but I have two in my home that are
on display,'' he said. ``One is Mickey Mantle's and the other is
Tom Landry's, and I'm a guy who grew up in Redskins territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Landry converted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry may, in fact, have converted more people than anyone this
side of Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Fill Landry's hat? Those who have not first been fitted with a
halo need not apply. nn

CRUDE COSTS SOAR, PUMP COSTS TO FOLLOW AS OPEC SQUEEZES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gasoline prices have risen markedly in the past
month, reaching an average price of $1.38 a gallon in Southern
California and are likely to go higher as crude oil prices reached
$30 a barrel Monday, industry experts and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that the basic economic laws of supply and demand are
responsible for driving up the price of crude oil and with it pump
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Crude prices are now three times higher than the $10-a-barrel
mark of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been
propping up the price by limiting production and consumers are
feeling the pinch in their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, the average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline in
Southern California reached a $1.38 per gallon, according to a
survey by the Automotive Trade Organizations of California, an
association of independent service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Will Woods, Auto-CA's executive director, blames OPEC for the
run-up, but also believes an OPEC country will help bring prices
down.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said at least one OPEC country usually breaks the
agreement to limit production when prices move this quickly in an
effort to cash in. OPEC's resolve historically hasn't lasted long,
Woods said. He expects production levels will rise soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting to see it any day,'' Woods said. ``We've been
watching the oil companies, and they're kind of holding off on
purchasing (crude). They try to limit their purchases, which is
smart business.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in price is actually low, compared with the change
in the price of crude oil, said Arco spokeswoman Cheryl Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, crude oil was around $10 per barrel, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, it's dependent on a whole series of factors, supply
and demand being a big part of it,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, she said, oil prices are only being controlled by
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pump prices are rising even though California's refineries are
at full capacity, and there is no international crisis affecting
prices.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to gasoline prices, California is somewhat
isolated from the rest of the nation, and that typically results in
higher prices here, said Rob Schlichting, spokesman for the
California Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the state requires a special clean-air
formulation that other states don't, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these things called the Rockies that are separating
the West Coast from the rest of the country,'' Schlichting said.
``In California, most of our crude oil either comes from Alaska or
it comes from in-state.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its isolation from the rest of the oil market,
California still is affected by the prices dictated at the market,
Schlichting said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average price of regular gasoline, including all
grades and taxes, was $1.4105 per gallon Friday, up 4.29 cents over
three weeks, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The average still is about a nickel per gallon off the peak of
about $1.46, recorded in November 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Winter months see a drop in gasoline usage as drivers stay off
the roads, but January's demand was 5.5 percent higher than for the
same period in 1999, analyst Trilby Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The higher prices tend to hit independent dealers harder than
the company-owned filling stations that have the deep pockets of
the oil companies behind them, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   More price increases are likely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming up on the end of March when the type of fuel
changes, so we'll probably see prices creep up some more,'' he
said.

NO MINOR BREAK FOR KINGS WINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles right-winger Brad Chartrand, who had
five goals and 11 points in 40 games earlier this season, will miss
at least one month after suffering a fractured jaw Saturday in a
minor-league game with the Long Beach Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand underwent surgery to have a plate and a pin inserted
in his jaw, which was struck by a puck.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand, who spent most of his season on the fourth line
before he was sent down, was a favorite of coach Andy Murray but
was not part of the Kings immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got the news just as they were ready to activate
winger Donald Audette (sprained left ankle) from injured reserve.
The club is traveling to Chicago this afternoon with one open
roster spot in case Audette is ready to play. Audette practiced
with the Kings on Sunday, but Murray said he would not use him
until the seven-game, 11-day trip that begins Wednesday against the
Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also sent Franticek Kaberle to Long Beach and
scratched Jaroslav Modry. He is expected to take on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   __ Flaming out?: Calgary already has set the NHL record for
overtime victories in one season with 10. But during their winless
streak, which reached eight Saturday night in Phoenix, the Flames
dropped two in OT.
</P>
<P>
   Valeri Bure has 28 goals, which already is a career high and
more than twice as many as anyone on the team. Bure assisted on two
of three goals by brother Pavel during the Feb. 6 All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Many think the Flames do not have enough offense to maintain a
playoff pace, but Bure is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won in the past, so we can do it again,'' he said. ``We
need to play the simple game, go back to basics. (Flames coach)
Brian (Sutter) I'm sure is going to let us know straight out,
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Further bad news: Veteran goaltender Grant Fuhr had a setback
in his minor-league rehabilitation after arthroscopic knee surgery.
Fred Brathwaite, who took over for Fuhr in November, started Monday
but has been pulled twice during the Flames' winless streak. There
is no timetable for Fuhr's return.

that Reagan brought to presidential campaigns. For McCain is still

CHIEF PARKS SLAMS DA'S FAILURE TO PROSECUTE IN LAPD SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT, GREG GITTRICH AND TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks said Monday that the
Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office is not moving quickly
enough to prosecute allegedly dirty Rampart Division cops.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the apparent unwillingness of District Attorney Gil
Garcetti to file even minor charges against the officers threatens
to hinder the Los Angeles Police Department's investigation into
the widening police corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The chief's criticism _ which came in a meeting with Daily News
editors and reporters _ came hours after Garcetti said his office
would look more closely at prosecuting a former Rampart officer who
was fired last year over a vicious station-house beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prosecutors, when they were evaluating that case _ although
they very much wanted to prosecute the case _ felt ethically it
simply did not meet the standard of proof that would have permitted
us to go forward,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti made his comments in response to questions about a
story in Monday's Daily News that outlined how county prosecutors
on two separate occasions rejected requests from top LAPD officers
and detectives to prosecute former Officer Brian Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   When the District Attorney's Office reviewed the case against
Hewitt in the past, Garcetti said, the evidence did not meet
statewide requirements for filing criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, given perhaps new information, we are re-evaluating
that case to determine whether we can ethically and properly
prosecute that case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Parks said the LAPD hadn't given prosecutors any ``new
information'' related to the beating as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have done a hell of a lot of work over the weekend,''
Parks quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the city's top cop and the county's chief
prosecutor has mounted in the past month over the handling of the
Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, Parks called on Garcetti to immediately resolve 57
cases involving 99 defendants in which police investigators found
probable cause to believe rogue-officer-turned-informant Rafael
Perez's involvement had tainted them. Garcetti said the cases would
be reviewed as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, nevertheless, Parks welcomed the news that Hewitt may
yet be prosecuted for the February 1998 beating of Ismael Jimenez,
a muscular, tattooed gangbanger with a long criminal rap sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who has denied any wrongdoing, was fired by Parks last
June. An LAPD disciplinary board recommended the dismissal after it
conducted a hearing into the matter and ruled that the officer
maliciously and egregiously mistreated the handcuffed gangbanger.
</P>
<P>
   Official documents disclosed for the first time by the Daily
News on Monday revealed the scope of evidence gathered by LAPD
detectives against Hewitt. The evidence includes samples of blood
splattered on the walls of the Rampart Station, which were matched
to the victim's DNA; testimony from an emergency room doctor
detailing the victim's injuries; testimony from several citizens
and law enforcement personnel; and a piece of carpet from the
Rampart Station that is soaked with the victim's bloody vomit.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney representing Hewitt declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said he understands Park's frustration with the time it
is taking county prosecutors to file charges in the LAPD corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I have a very good working relationship with the
chief and we have talked a lot,'' he said. ``I think he understands
that our evaluation must be independently objective. We also are
looking at the strategic factors of when you prosecute in terms of
the number of cases that will be brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to maximize our effort to successfully prosecute cases
and not just bring a case that is ultimately thrown out of court
because we don't have sufficient corroboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said testimony from Perez would not provide enough
evidence by itself to warrant a prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethically and legally,'' he said, ``we must have sufficient
corroboration. ... Until we have that, we can't move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks maintains that the LAPD has given prosecutors enough
evidence to justify filing charges against three officers,
including Hewitt. The cops are suspected of crimes ranging from
perjury to assault. A source close to the investigation identified
the officers as Hewitt, Michael Buchanan and Nino Durden, who was
Perez's former partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as these officers can sit at home, they have the
comfort of being together. You have to separate them, file charges
against them and make them make choices,'' Parks said. ``These are
not people who have been to jail. Jail frightens officers to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office,
said it is extremely unlikely the officers would be held in jail
until trial on crimes such as perjury or assault under the color of
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, up to and including the officers charged with
the Rodney King beating, they are released on their own
recognizance or the bail is set at such a level that they can make
it,'' Gibbons said. ``So they'd still be sitting at home.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   According to Gibbons, the District Attorney's Office wants its
prosecutors to file ``the strongest cases possible to ensure that
when these officers are convicted, they go away for the longest
possible time.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said he has 10 full-time prosecutors assigned to the
Rampart investigation and is ``very likely'' to add more.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Parks questioned why the District Attorney's Office
waited until last month to create a task force to look into the
corruption. Parks noted that Perez has been detailing LAPD
corruption since last September. The former officer was arrested in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been investigating this for two years,'' Parks said.
``Every bit of information given to the public has been uncovered
by the Police Department. We have the resources to do it and we
will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks expects to release a detailed report of the department's
findings and recommendations for changes by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential the LAPD comes out of this with the reputation
that we can investigate ourselves,'' he said. ``Otherwise the Los
Angeles Police Department will be crippled.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is one of many current and former LAPD Rampart anti-gang
officers identified by Perez as being involved in abusing and
framing innocent people for crimes between 1995 and 1998. In
confidential testimony to investigators, Perez charged that Hewitt
enjoyed ``thumping'' people.
</P>
<P>
   Perez agreed to talk to investigators in exchange for a lenient
sentence for stealing cocaine from an LAPD evidence locker. He is
scheduled to be sentenced before the end of the month.

W.A. ANDRES, 73, EXECUTIVE WHO LED GROWTH OF DAYTON HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Iowa, Calif., Minn.)  (mk) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William A. Andres, who led Dayton Hudson Corp.'s expansion from
a regional department store chain to a national retailing
powerhouse, died Wednesday of lymphoma in Fort Myers, Fla. He was
73.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Andres from 1976 through the sharp
recession of the early 1980s, Dayton Hudson grew from 400 stores to
more than 1,000, and its revenues tripled to $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, a Forbes cover article said Andres was ``analytical and
has a reputation for getting to the heart of matters quickly and
decisively.'' He was the company's first chief executive who was
not a member of the Dayton family.
</P>
<P>
   In his boldest bet, Andres quickly expanded Dayton Hudson's
Target chain, correctly predicting that the future of retailing lay
in large discount retailers situated mostly outside cities rather
than full-priced urban department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Target now provides most of the company's more than $30 billion
in annual sales, and on Jan. 30, Dayton Hudson changed its name to
Target Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Andres rose rapidly through the ranks at Dayton Hudson. After
joining the company as a management trainee selling robes in August
1958, he became a department manager in three months and a vice
president less than five years later. By 1968 he was chairman and
chief executive of Dayton. He gave up that post when the company
bought the J.L. Hudson department store chain one year later.
</P>
<P>
   But his move aside was only temporary. He became president of
the combined company in 1974, chief executive in 1976 and chairman
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the office, Andres was an avid golfer and gardener, his
son Richard said. He was also an accomplished amateur magician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually put himself through undergraduate school doing
magic'' in Fayette, Iowa, Richard Andres said. ``Magic ran through
his whole life.'' His most memorable trick involved chopping the
head off a volunteer with a mock guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   Andres graduated from Upper Iowa University in 1948 and earned a
master's degree at the University of Pittsburgh one year later.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by Betty, his wife of 52 years; three sons,
Robert, of San Diego; Charles, of Brainerd, Minn.; and Richard, of
Minnetonka, Minn.; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a very strong partnership. It was always, `Betty and
Bill did this. Betty and Bill did that,''' Richard said of his
mother and father.

GEORGE JACKSON, MOVIE PRODUCER, DIES AT 42 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Jackson, who grew up in Harlem to become a
movie producer, record company executive and Internet company
founder, died on Monday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson died after a stroke a week earlier, said Frank Cooper,
his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Jackson and his partners had been working in
a Manhattan loft to create a series of Web sites, called the Urban
Box Office Network, aimed at minorities. The first of the Internet
sites is expected to go online on Feb. 29. An article in the
company's newsletter said that Jackson had a ``25-hour-a-day
dedication'' to the Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson helped produce ``New Jack City,'' a 1991 movie that
portrayed the rise and fall of a drug dealer in Harlem. When fights
among youths broke out at movie theaters around the country where
the film was playing, Jackson and his partner, Doug McHenry,
defended their movie, saying it carried an antidrug, antiviolence
message.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion article in The New York Times, the two men wrote,
``The real cause of violence at the theaters is not cinematic
images of drug culture but decades of poverty in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jack City,'' which brought in $50 million in box office
sales in the United States, was the most successful film produced
by Jackson-McHenry Entertainment. The company produced 12 films in
the late 1980s and early 1990's. Others included ``A Thin Line
Between Love and Hate'' and ``Krush Groove,'' the first major movie
to focus on hip-hop and rap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Polygram hired Jackson to be president and chief
executive of Motown Records. At the record company, Jackson helped
promote such artists as 98 Degrees and the Temptations. He left
Motown after about a year when the Seagram Co. bought Polygram.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, Jackson had dinner with two friends, Cooper and
Adam Kidron, at the Mayflower Hotel in Manhattan. The three came up
with an idea for an Internet company aimed at urban minorities, a
group they felt was not being served by other start-ups. They wrote
out their plan on a napkin.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Urban Box Office Network has 175 employees and
plans 30 Web sites, ranging from one devoted to hip-hop music to
another catering to young Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Feb. 2, Jackson, an energetic man who weighed
more than 300 pounds, attended a meeting at the company, but then
left because he did not feel well. On his way home, Jackson asked
the cab driver to take him to the hospital, said David Jaye, the
company's spokesman. He fell unconscious and never woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was born in Harlem on Jan. 6, 1958. He attended the
Monsignor Kelly School, a private school for talented children,
many of whom came from poor families. He graduated from Fordham
Preparatory School in 1976, and obtained a degree in sociology and
economics from Harvard College in 1980. At Harvard, Jackson played
football.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career at Procter &AMP; Gamble, where he worked for two
years in marketing and sales. He then went to Universal Pictures.
And from 1984 to 1986 he worked for Richard Pryor's production
company, Indigo, which was part of Columbia Pictures, where he was
executive vice president of production.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked on projects with, among others, LL Cool J,
Russell Simmons, Ice-T, Wesley Snipes and Mario Van Peebles.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was on the board at De La Salle Academy, a private
school for children in the sixth to eighth grades. He helped found
the academy on West 97th Street in Manhattan with his former
teacher, Brother Brian Carty, and other alumni from Monsignor Kelly
School. The school accepts 135 talented children from low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is survived by his wife, Yuko; a daughter, Kona Rose;
his mother, Henrietta Hogan Jackson Stancil; a sister, Dr. Sharon
Jackson, of Silver Spring, Md.; and a brother, Bobbie E. Stancil,
of Boston.

LENORE WINGARD, 88, SWIMMER WHO WON 2 OLYMPIC MEDALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Colo., Md.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lenore Kight Wingard, an American swimmer who won medals in the
1932 and 1936 Olympics, died Wednesday at a hospital in Cincinnati,
where she lived. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Wingard won a silver medal in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles
and a bronze at the 1936 Games in Berlin, both in the 400-meter
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Her silver-medal performance in 1932 came just a tenth of a
second behind Helene Madison of the United States in a race so
close that the judges took 15 minutes before declaring a victor.
And both Wingard and Madison, who won with a time of 5 minutes 28.5
seconds, broke the previous world record.
</P>
<P>
   As much as her medals, Wingard remembered the atmosphere of the
1936 Olympics, which was dominated by the presence of Hitler.
Wingard, who swam in the days of wool suits and shirts, recalled
that she once couldn't cross a street and go to her dormitory room
for more than two hours because Hitler was coming down the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we stayed, we were fenced in, always guarded by
soldiers,'' she told The Cincinnati Enquirer in an interview in
1991. ``When it was over, I was glad to get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Wingard, a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was born in Frostburg, Md. She taught
herself to swim when she was 14, growing up in the Pittsburgh area.
</P>
<P>
   She then went on to local, state and national meets. In 1933,
she won all the national freestyle swimming championship meets from
100 meters to 1,500 meters. By 1936 she held more swimming titles
than any other woman.
</P>
<P>
   Wingard won 20 national freestyle championships, and she held 21
American records and seven world records in the freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from competitive swimming, she managed pools,
taught swimming and, until about five years ago, swam about three
miles a week at a local YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Cleon J. Wingard; a son, Cleon
Jr., of College Hill, Ohio; a daughter, Diane Lynn Peterson, of
Denver; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

   You don't need to shop on Rodeo Drive to find one. In fact, your
neighborhood hardware store probably has them stacked one in front
of the other.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing you can't be seen without at Riviera
Country Club this week, especially if you plan on following Tiger
Woods, the coolest and hottest golfer on the planet, it's a
stepladder.
</P>
<P>
   Any old model will do. At the Buick Invitational in San Diego
last week, people dragged metal ones with more than one step. We
even saw a few plastic step stools, a great investment at under
$10. Mark our words: It's just a matter of time before Woods' most
ubiquitous sponsor slaps its swoosh on some climbing device and
starts selling them for twice the going price.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods is on the course, stepladders aren't just chic,
they're as functional as a Gucci umbrella in a steady drizzle.
Unless you can walk on stilts or know a 7-footer upon whose
shoulders you can sit, a stepladder or stool is as helpful to have
at your fingertips as a guide dog is to the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine sitting directly behind Marge Simpson at the movies or
having your neighbor build a second-story add-on that blocks out
the view of the beach from your home and you have an idea of the
frustrations of following Woods around the course without the
proper gear _ or at least a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In Woods' gallery in San Diego we heard a man tell his pal he
was stepping gingerly from the green to the next tee in the wet
grass of Torrey Pines Golf Course because he ``was afraid I might
trip and die.''
</P>
<P>
   We !ital!think he was joking. Although it's true, jockeying for
position outside the gallery ropes from one hole to the next when
following Woods is good practice for running with the bulls in
Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Woods' mother, Kutilda. She is a diminutive woman who
has a hard time seeing over her son's golf bag, much less a dense
wall of humanity. The first time Woods played in the Masters, in
1995, she sneaked a cardboard periscope onto the grounds of Augusta
National Golf Club. It allowed her to see her son's shots, all
right, but it wasn't all right with the marshal who saw the
periscope and promptly confiscated it.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice for would-be Woods gallery goers? ``Either you get
ahead of him,'' she said during one of her son's rounds at Torrey
Pines as she walked serenely toward the next fairway while most
everyone else made a beeline for the tee. ``Or you stay at home and
watch it on TV''
</P>
<P>
   There's at least one more option.
</P>
<P>
   We saw a woman at Torrey Pines get down on her hands and knees
and peer through people's legs in an effort to watch Woods putt. Of
course, she couldn't see the golfer for the knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult thing about playing with Tiger,'' fellow
pro Phil Mickelson said last week, ``is that my wife is not able to
watch. You just can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Woods doesn't have to be as vexing as getting up and
down from a sunken bunker. Like those swing thoughts you have when
you're standing over a ball embedded in the sand, there's a
checklist to follow when planning to follow Woods:
</P>
<P>
   __ Do wear comfortable, closed-toe footwear. If you have track
shoes, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   __ Don't try walking against the tide when in Woods'
neighborhood. Unless you dig mosh pits.
</P>
<P>
   __ Do come carrying a baby in a Snugli, even if it means you
have to make like Adam Sandler and borrow an infant for the day.
Last week we saw a crowd part to allow a woman with a child
strapped to her to forge ahead to the front of the gallery ropes.
Chivalry might be dead, but no one wants to see a baby get crushed.
</P>
<P>
   __ Don't climb trees unless you bring rope and crampons. At an
L.A. Open played at Rancho Park some years back, a fan shimmied up
a tree to get a better look at Arnold Palmer. As his idol drew
near, the man lost his balance and toppled to the ground like an
acorn.
</P>
<P>
   __ Do make the effort to behold Woods in the flesh. By the time
he's through playing, you'll be reveling in how you once did.
</P>

DICK CLARK'S FORTUNES ON UPTAKE IN GAMES, DINING, SPECIALS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Dick Clark has been around long enough to see
the TV game show trend come and go several times. Now, the ageless
host is cashing in on it again, as his production company's most
recent quarterly earnings show.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31 _ the firm's second quarter of
fiscal 2000 _ Burbank-based Dick Clark Productions Inc. reported
net income of $998,000, or 11 cents per share, up from $867,000, or
9 cents, the like period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues increased 38 percent to $22.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Helping fuel this upswing is Clark's new game show, ``Greed,''
which has had more episodes ordered by the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also produces the daily talk show ``Donny and Marie,''
featuring the Osmond siblings, and the variety series ``Your Big
Break.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark also has been expanding into related areas: His company
has struck a licensing arrangement to open a music attraction
called Dick Clark's Great American Music Experience in spring 2001
at the Queen Mary entertainment complex in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   There are also eight Dick Clark's American Bandstand Grills and
one Dick Clark's AB Diner around the Midwest now; three of these
opened in the last quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   The company is perhaps best known, though, for producing TV
specials. Clark's ``American Music Awards'' and ``Dick Clark's New
Year's Rockin' Eve'' have both been given renewals to air for the
next five years.

   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ In its third acquisition in as many years,
Power-One Inc. on Monday said it would buy Irvine-based HC Power
Inc. for $98.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition represents Power-One's first foray into high-end
power systems for telecommunications and Internet service
providers, said Steve Goldman, Power-One's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``HC and Power-One have come together as a result of both
parties recognizing the tremendous strengths we add to each
other,'' Goldman said. ``This acquisition is also an element in our
strategy to accelerate our growth by further capitalizing on the
explosion of the Internet, wireless communication and datacom
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Power-One will issue 2.1 million shares of its stock to
shareholders of HC Power. At Monday's closing price of $46.875 per
share, the deal is valued at $98.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently thought it was a good deal, too. The
company's stock increased $3.25, or 7.74 percent, after the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens stock analyst J. Keith Dunne said the
acquisition opens up a $3 billion market to Power-One it previously
did not have. The deal also gives HC access to a larger sales force
with broader coverage than it had before, Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   Power-One also plans to shave some of the cost from the
manufacturing process of some of HC Power's products by moving
production to its plant in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Labor costs average $1 per hour in the Dominican Republic vs.
$14 at HC's Irvine plant, Goldman said.

RONALD ROSEMAN, 66, OBOIST, COMPOSER AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ronald Roseman, an oboist, composer and teacher who
was admired as a soloist and for his work with the New York
Woodwind Quintet and the Bach Aria Group, died on Thursday at his
home in Manhattan. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Ronald Cannava, a spokesman for
Queens College, where Roseman was on the faculty of the Aaron
Copland School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Roseman was a sensitive player who had a warm tone and an
impeccable sense of style that made him an authoritative
interpreter in a repertory that ranged from Bach and Telemann to
the Romanticism of Arthur Bliss and the spikey music of Ralph
Shapey. As a composer he maintained an almost classical sense of
form, balance and counterpoint within a vital modern language.
</P>
<P>
   Roseman was born in Brooklyn and played the recorder and flute
before switching to the oboe when he was 12. He studied oboe at the
High School of Music and Art and the Henry Street Settlement, and
later privately with Harold Gomberg, who was for many years the
principal oboist of the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Roseman was the Philharmonic's acting principal oboist in the
late 1970s. He was also the principal oboist of several freelance
orchestras, including Musica Sacra and the New York Chamber
Symphony in its early years.
</P>
<P>
   At Queens College, where he earned his bachelor's degree in
1950, Roseman studied composition with Elliott Carter and Karol
Rathaus. He also studied privately with Ben Weber and Henry Cowell.
His compositions included works for orchestra, voice and various
chamber music combinations.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s Roseman played the shawm, a Renaissance wind
instrument, in New York Pro Musica. But he was heard most
frequently on the modern oboe and sometimes its lower-pitched
cousin, the English horn. He joined the New York Woodwind Quintet
in 1961 and the Bach Aria Group in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He made more than 50 recordings, of which his traversal of the
Handel Sonatas and Trios on Nonesuch Records was particularly well
regarded. Besides his teaching position at the Aaron Copland
School, which he joined in 1975, Roseman was on the faculty of the
Mannes College of Music, the Juilliard School and the Yale School
of Music.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Okkyu; a daughter, Remie; a son,
John; and his mother, Florence Grippe.

LEHTINEN SET TO HAVE ANKLE RE-EXAMINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars winger Jere Lehtinen's right ankle hasn't
improved enough for him to play, so he's going to New York to see a
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done everything we could have done,'' Lehtinen said.
``It just takes too much time. It takes time, but this is too much
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen fractured his ankle Oct. 16. He returned on New Year's
Eve, played eight games, then went back on injured reserve. Dr.
Bill Hamilton _ who has also looked at Mike Modano, Emmitt Smith
and Deion Sanders _ is scheduled to see if he can find what is
delaying Lehtinen's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it necessary to get a second opinion to see if
somebody else can see something we don't see,'' Stars trainer Dave
Surprenant said. CHAMBERS PUSHING
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers has decided it's now or never.
Sidelined since the fourth game with a knee injury, Chambers has
been pushing himself to see if he can return this season.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just pushing it a little bit to see what is going to
happen with it,'' Chambers said. ``But I'm a little more confident
today than I was a week and a half ago. I think there is a chance.
Last week, I told you the way it is it doesn't look like I'd play,
but there's definitely a chance I could come back and play this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers has been skating almost daily.Friday, he had his best
day since surgery. He has experienced a little soreness and
swelling, but the deadline for him having enough time to get back
into the lineup is quickly approaching. He said he'll need at least
10 to 15 games before the playoffs to get the speed of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep going as hard as I can,'' Chambers said. ``If
there is any chance of my playing, I need to know it. If there is
not, I need to know that, too.'' HATCHER SORE
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said yesterday's practice would
go a long way in telling him when he would be ready to return from
his calf injury. So what did it say about the possibility of him
playing tomorrow against Nashville?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Hatcher said. ``It doesn't feel that good. For me to say
I'm going to play Wednesday, I can't say that.'' Hatcher has been
sidelined since Dec. 17 with a lacerated muscle in his right calf.
He has been skating and starting to get restless, but he isn't
pushing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do anything stupid,'' he said. ``You come back
for a game or two, something happens, and you are out for another
month.'' LUKOWICH IN THE MIX
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Brad Lukowich has become the odd defenseman out since the
Stars traded for Dave Manson and Sylvain Cote. Once Derian Hatcher
returns, coach Ken Hitchcock will have to choose from eight solid
defensemen to fill six spots.
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich, 23, has not played the three games since Cote and
Sylvain joined the team last week. The Stars can't reassign
Lukowich to their minor-league affiliate to get more ice time
because he would have to clear waivers, and there would be plenty
of takers for a physical, up-and-coming defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process for him and a process for any young defenseman,
but there comes a period of time where he's going to have play some
games, and he's going to have to be brought into the fold,''
Hitchcock said. ``We're at that stage with Lukowich now where over
the next two or three games he has to play. Somebody will have to
sit, and he'll have to play.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Ken Hitchcock said that center Joe Nieuwendyk's separated
right shoulder is getting better and that Nieuwendyk could begin
skating by himself within seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars have former Michigan K-Wings coach Bill McDonald
working with the team until the end of the season. The Stars sent
forward Jamie Wright down to Michigan to get him a couple of games.

HOME PRICES IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CLIMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Prices of single-family homes in the San Fernando
Valley soared nearly 17 percent from January 1999 to this January
while sales cooled as the market wrestled with an inventory
squeeze, a trade group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The median price, the point at which half the homes sold for
more and half for less, climbed to $222,000, or $32,000 more than
in January 1999, said the Southland Regional Association of
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   That's the highest monthly median since prices hit $225,000 last
September, but it is still well under the peak of $245,000 reached
three times in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, escrow closed on 705 detached homes, 2.2 percent
fewer than in January 1999. Nevertheless, the market remains
strong, industry executives and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That strength is evident in the fact that the number of active
listings totaled just 3,515 during January, down 744, a decline of
17.5 percent, from January 1999. Even so, more than 700 homes sold,
which is high for a January.
</P>
<P>
   Including condominiums, agents had 4,358 properties listed, or
16 percent fewer than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a market the size of the Valley about 6,000 active listings
are needed monthly to meet demand, said Jim Link, executive vice
president of the Van Nuys-based Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year there was tight inventory, so the fact sales were
only down 2percent in my view shows that demand is there,'' Link
said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita Realtor Mitch Davis, the trade group's president,
noted sales have remained strong even though interest rates have
been climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an understatement to say that the inventory is very
tight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory is typically freed up when there is a burst of new
construction or migration out of the area, neither of which is
likely to occur in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And some people may be waiting for more price appreciation
before trading up and putting their homes on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have a year or so to go for most people to recoup
the equity they lost in the early 1990s. Once that's recovered it
could open up the supply a little more,'' said Nima Nattagh, an
analyst at First American Real Estate Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   With prices spiking, bargain hunters are flocking to the
condominium market. Condominium sales soared 27.7 percent last
month, to 244 units. That's the second-highest for a January since
304 units sold during January 1990, a time when the median
single-family price was $230,000.
</P>
<P>
   This performance was strong enough to push combined sales to 949
properties, 4 percent ahead of the 1999 level.
</P>
<P>
   The overall outlook remains robust.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still going to have a fairly solid market. The slight
rise in mortgage rates probably will not have that much of an
influence on home sales,'' Nattagh said. ``The overall outlook is
still fairly rosy.''

KINGS GET FIRST OVERTIME WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even on the night he passed his boyhood idol
Maurice Richard on the all-time goal scoring list, Luc Robitaille
would have traded it all for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's two goals Monday night gave him 545 for his career,
but it wasn't until Sean O'Donnell's scored two minutes into
overtime that he could avoid a potential disaster and enjoy a 4-3
win over the Calgary Flames in front of 14,455 at the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Los Angeles Kings, led by Robitaille's high-scoring
first line, who had won four of five. The Flames had dropped five
straight and were winless in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of keeping the Flames on low, the Kings allowed two
goals early in the third period that could have ruined the momentum
heading into a seven-game, 11-day trip that begins Wednesday in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That put the Kings at an awful disadvantage since the Flames
already have set an NHL record with 10 overtime victories.
</P>
<P>
   But they also had dropped two in OT during their losing streak.
The Flames did not get off a shot after regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kings, led by Ziggy Palffy, won in OT for the first
time this season. With 3:18 left in the extra session, he setup
behind the Calgary net and passed to O'Donnell in the slot for the
game winner.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's second goal was his 28th of the year and moved him
into 18th all-time. It also tied him with former New York Islanders
winger Mike Bossy for 35th all-time in scoring with 1,126 points.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille often has spoken of his affection for Richard, who
retired six years before Robitaille was born, but remains a legend
in his native Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   But recently Robitaille talks more about the Kings getting back
in the playoffs fof just the second time in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Flames, who two weeks ago were ahead of the Kings in
the playoff race, was critical.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they letdown just when it looked like the game was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames moved within a goal of the Kings when All-Star
defenseman Phil Housley was an unassisted power play goal with Glen
Murray off for holding.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, Calgary tied the game on Jarome Iginla
beat the Kings Jamie Storr for his second goal of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings first letdown came after they took a 2-0 lead midway
through the first period, they let down and let Calgary back in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Iginla made it a one-goal game when he took a pass from Marc
Savard near center ice skated in on Kings goaltender Jamie Storr
and firedthe puck over his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two days, Kings coach Andy Murray had warned of
a letdown after last Friday's 3-2 victory over Dallas that ended a
22-game winless streak against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did not regroup until early in the second period whenm
Robitaille scored his 28th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They reapplied pressure on Flames goaltender Fred Brathwaite, an
MVP candidate when the Flames were the league's surprise team, but
who has struggled during the losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:02 gone in the second period, defenseman Rob Blake fired
a slap shot off the right goalpost that ricocheted to a waiting
Robitaille. Brathwaite never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, the Kings hottest scorer, also assisted on the play, his
second of the game. Palffy, who came in with four goals and 11
points in the last five games, gave the Kings the early lead when
he scored just 1:51 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Robitaille in the role of playmaker, threading
a pass across the crease to a waiting Palffy. It was Palffy's
eighth goal in the last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Robitaille tied Richard. Palffy took a pass
from Jozef Stumpel and fired in front of Brathwaite. Robitaille was
there and scored his 27th of the season.

STARS' MORROW EXCELS SOONER THAN EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ To be honest, Dallas Stars winger Brenden Morrow
finds the irony kind of amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his room in Carlyle, Saskatchewan, he has a poster of
his childhood hockey idol. The funny part, of course, is that
player is now his teammate and sometimes linemate, Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign of old age. No question,'' Hull said. ``But
someday it will happen to him. He'll be around a dressing room, and
some young kid will say I used to have a poster of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow definitely has poster-boy potential. Like John McCain's
emergence in the Republican race, the 21-year-old rookie's ascent
into the NHL has been quick and unexpected. Everybody with the
Stars knew Morrow was going to be good. Nobody thought he would do
it this season. He has 10 goals and six assists in 38 games,
including both Stars goals in a 2-1 victory against Washington on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been steadily getting better and better,'' Stars center
Mike Modano said. ``He's like a Keith Tkachuk or a Brendan
Shanahan. He's tough, and he knows where to go to score goals and
how to hold his space in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are tough and strong and you know where to go at that
age, it's a break for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad company to be keeping for a guy who was supposed to
spend a good portion of this season with the Stars' minor-league
affiliate, the Michigan K-Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said the plan had been to bring
Morrow, along with Roman Lyashenko, up around the beginning of
February. The Stars didn't want to rush them. They figured a year
in Kalamazoo could only help both players, and they would be good
to go before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of my impression from the day they drafted me,''
Morrow said. ``It was something I thought maybe I needed, too.
Things fell into place better than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and chemistry problems with the first players Dallas
brought in forced the Stars to move their plan to Mach 3. On Nov.
18 against Philadelphia, Morrow made his NHL debut. He hasn't gone
back since. There was a little dip in his productivity, but a quick
chat with Hitchcock, and Morrow was back to playing the feisty,
annoying, scrappy, ornery game that got him to Dallas in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Where did he get his style from?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you'd probably have to start with Shanny, Twister, Sony
and Jeremy.
</P>
<P>
   The first three are the bulldogs he had growing up that were
models for his style. All were named with hockey in mind, Shanny
for Brendan Shanahan, Twister for Tony Twist and Sony for reasons
nobody can quite remember. The last is his big brother, Jeremy, the
reason he was able to play the kind of style he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was younger I always had the older brother to protect
me so I'd go out and play in everyone's face and I'd just had big
brother there to protect me,'' Morrow said. ``Playing against grown
men when I was 15, I'd \Rtick\S a few of them off and have my
brother there to protect me.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still playing that way. Only now, he protects himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game before the All-Star break, Morrow recorded
what is known in the hockey world as a Gordie Howe hat trick. He
scored a goal, assisted on another and got into a fight. His
teammates admired the fight almost as much as they liked the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always scored but none of them have ever been pretty,''
Morrow said. ``When I was 15 playing Bantam, I scored 117 goals in
50 games. So I score my goals but none of them were anything
special. They just bounced in off my leg or garbage goal here.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his isn't a scoring game. He has spent this season
proving himself wrong, spending a good portion of playing time on
scoring lines with Joe Nieuwendyk, Modano and Hull.
</P>
<P>
   That's kind of funny, too. His friends from Carlyle call every
now and then. Only nobody wants to talk about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always ask about Mo, Nieuwendyk and Hull and guys like
that,'' Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow tells his friends the same thing he keeps telling
himself: He can't believe he's playing with guys he had posters of
when he was growing up. His favorite poster, and he thinks it's
still hanging, is the one of Hull standing under a rainbow, and
beside a pile of golden pucks, with the words ``Golden Brett.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tell him that,'' Morrow said. ``He's got a big
enough head. He doesn't need me telling him that.''

SURGING MAVERICKS STILL COULD REACH PLAYOFFS

<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Mavericks have a little more bounce in their
steps these days.
</P>
<P>
   That's what 10 victories in 14 games will do for a franchise
carrying the burden of the worst record in professional sports
during the 1990s. Now it's 2000, and it's cool to be seen at a
Mavericks game because the team has a chance to make its first run
at the playoffs since the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are 20-28, their best record after 48 games since
they were 26-22 in 1989-90, which is also they last time they made
the playoffs. With 34 games remaining, they trail Minnesota by 71/2
games in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' surge, along with other changes the past 11/2
months, gives Tuesday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks at Reunion
Arena the feel of a season opener almost. Call it the Mavs' second
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a great push before the All-Star break,''
center Shawn Bradley said. ``I think we wish we would have had a
little more wins than we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough schedule at the beginning of the year, but I
think we've had a good push since the (new year), and hopefully it
can continue. Hopefully we can refocus now and come with a new
attitude and continue the aggressive play in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban's acquisition of the team and Cuban's acquisition of
Dennis Rodman have generated much of the attention. But the
emergence of All-Star Michael Finley has generated much of the
success.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who has three triple-doubles this season and barely
missed eight others, is averaging 22.8 points per game. Finley, 26,
capped his solid showing in the first half of the season with his
play in Sunday's All-Star Game, which the West won, 137-126. Finley
played 10 minutes and scored 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream come true for me to be an All-Star,'' Finley
said. ``Every year I've prepared myself to have an opportunity to
make it here with my workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically speaking, my chances were better the last couple
of years than when I first got into the league. But I'm going to
continue to work on my game. I'm not going to be satisfied with
making it this year. I want to make this a consistent thing and, at
the same time, make my team better.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland forward Scottie Pippen said Finley didn't deserve to
make the All-Star team after the Blazers defeated the Mavericks,
107-94, on Jan. 10. The comment stung Finley, who scored 32 against
Portland five days later in a 113-105 Mavericks victory. He has
scored 30 points in four of his past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it hurt him a little bit to hear that come out,''
Mavericks guard Erick Strickland said. ``But for the most part,
he's a very confident individual, and he's not going to let that
bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of Finley. He went in the off-season and got
himself ready to go and came back and did everything you'd expect
from a person to lead his team, and he's been consistent all year
in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mavericks have been inconsistent. They opened the
season with 14 of their first 21 games on the road. Typically, they
couldn't make the proper adjustments away from home, and started
with a 7-14 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could erase the first 20 games, we'd be straight,''
forward Cedric Ceballos said. ``But we do have them, so we're going
to get ourselves together and try not to have two bad 20-game
losing seasons in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Mavericks look back at those first 21 games with
remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you regret it because I don't think we totally gave
our heart and soul to them,'' Strickland said. ``There were games
we could have won, but it came down in the stretch, and we lost a
lot of close ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't play the same type of defense. We didn't
understand the mentality of defense in the beginning as we do
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' surge the past six weeks coincides with the Jan.
3 announcement of Cuban's bid to purchase controlling interest in
the franchise from Ross Perot Jr. for an NBA-record $280 million.
Cuban has been a hands-on owner who has told the team he will try
to sign the best players. To that end, Cuban signed Rodman, who
grabbed 13 rebounds in his debut Wednesday against Seattle before
the second-largest crowd to watch an NBA game in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban also said neither Nelson nor his son Donnie, a Mavericks
assistant, will be coaching the Mavericks next season, and vowed to
put the Mavericks back on the NBA map.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and gave us a speech when he first got in, and that
was very powerful,'' Strickland said. ``He let everybody know that
you're cared about as a person and as a player, and you're the ones
that make this thing run.
</P>
<P>
   ``So everybody looked within that and understood that he's going
to be a guy that stands behind us, and we have to be the people
that goes out and provide wins for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that's precisely what the Mavericks have been doing. nn

OPEN-WHEEL VETERANS DRAWN TO CUP MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Robby Gordon and Scott Pruett have put
their careers where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued by NASCAR's six-year, $2.4 billion television contract
that takes effect in 2001 and disturbed by the open-wheel split
between the Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams,
Gordon and Pruett have left Indy cars for the NASCAR Winston Cup
circuit. Pruett is making his Winston Cup debut this week at
Daytona, while Gordon is back in a stock car after a two-year
absence.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup racing was an easy sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some of the CART programs, we had to sell the series,''
Gordon said. ``With the TV package and with the merchandising
opportunities in NASCAR, sponsors want to be involved in Winston
Cup racing. You have to follow what corporate America is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Boesel, an Indy-car driver by trade, was wearing a
``will-drive-for-food'' look Monday at Daytona International
Speedway. Boesel said Gordon and Pruett could open the doors for
open-wheel drivers to switch leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need them to do good,'' Boesel said.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett was ninth-fastest in Saturday's qualifying for the
Daytona 500 with a 189.470 mph lap around the 2.5-mile trioval.
Gordon was 31st at 187.907 mph. Both will start in the first
Gatorade Twin 125 qualifying race Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This week's goal simply is to make the 43-car field for the
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on just trying to get the car qualified for the
race, keep the car in there, and let me learn a lot about going
racing,'' Pruett said. ``Hopefully, three-quarters of the way
toward the end of the year, we've got our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has had a problem keeping his ride.
</P>
<P>
   He has driven for seven owners in seven seasons, with 28 career
starts and 13 DNFs. His only full-time Winston Cup job came with
Team Sabco in 1997. Gordon had one pole and one top-five finish in
20 races before he and team owner Felix Sabates parted ways.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Gordon, who spent the past two seasons in CART, is
his own owner. He has formed a Winston Cup team with Mike Held and
John Menard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, I didn't think I'd be back so soon,'' Gordon, 31,
said. ``Since the last time I was here, obviously I've gained age,
and with age comes maturity. As a race-car driver, I still believe
I'm as brave as anybody out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, 39, had established himself as a 10-year CART veteran
when he decided to jump cars with Cal Wells III, who owned the
Indy-car driven by Pruett last season.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett's only stock-car experience came in the IROC all-star
series, in which he has competed six times with a career-best
second-place finish in the points standings in 1995. So drafting
and trading paint aren't totally new to Pruett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to do it,'' Pruett said. ``One of the goals in my
life was to come down here and do that \RWinston Cup racing\S, but
I wouldn't do it unless the right opportunity came along, so I
could do the deal right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it came at a time when I had a number of years
left on my contract with Cal, so that made it a difficult
situation, but it was win-win no matter what. So I looked back and
said, `You know what? I've been in CART 10 years. If I'm ever going
to go do Winston Cup, this is it.' So I packed by bags and headed
to Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Pruett have left open-wheel racing for the Winston
Cup circuit for one reason: They believe this is where the future
of racing is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing where corporate America is today, this is where we
wanted to bring our race team, and this is where we're going to
stay,'' Gordon said. ``We thought it was a now-or-never deal,
especially with the TV package.'' nn

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ OK, we're all on record as thinking it
thoroughly appalling and a bit scary that the minority party in
Austria's new governing coalition is a right-wing hard case led by
a man who is the next thing to a neo-Nazi and maybe even the real
deal. With the point made, we'd probably do best now to wait,
before making any more moves against Austria, to see if the
resulting government in fact misbehaves intolerably. (Teepen, Cox

   HERRIN-COLUMN _ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ There's a trace of lunacy in
the fuel tank when an otherwise mind-its-own-business couple drives
eight hours in hopes of finding two tickets to a Bruce Springsteen
show that sold out faster than I could write this paragraph. But as
Susan and I frequently told ourselves (particularly after pulling

crazy just to remind yourself that you're still alive. (Herrin,

 &HT;    Roger, Susan, Springsteen and me
 &HT;    By Jeff Herrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ We are a middle-age gang of jukebox
graduates and Duke Street Kings; Spanish Johnnys and late Juliets;
tramps like us and hey-Rosie-wontcha-come-out-tonights.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us are bald. Some of us are divorced. Not too many of us
pass for skinny any more.
</P>
<P>
   But in the right setting, under the right stars, an amazing
force takes hold of us with the opening notes of ``Tenth Avenue
Freeze Out.'' We're on our feet - 20,000 of us - singing the horn
parts. Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doooooooooooooh! One of
the most thrilling, godawfulest sounds I ever hope to hear.
</P>
<P>
   And I realize, as I look at these words, that there will be
hundreds of Rocky Mount citizens, thousands of North Carolinians,
1.2 billion Chinese who could read these paragraphs and wonder,
``What in the name of Hurricane Floyd is this guy going on about?''
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few who will simply nod their heads, roll down
the windows, let the wind blow back their hair. And those are the
ones who will understand right away the gratitude of Roger, a
history teacher who stood before me in a New Jersey parking lot
last summer, ready to trade a lung for what I was handing him:
</P>
<P>
   Admit One. Continental Arena. Section 114; Row 26; Seat 15.
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   There's a trace of lunacy in the fuel tank when an otherwise
mind-its-own-business couple drives eight hours in hopes of finding
two tickets to a show that sold out faster than I could write this
paragraph. But as Susan and I frequently told ourselves
(particularly after pulling onto the New Jersey Turnpike),
sometimes you have to do something crazy just to remind yourself
that you're still alive.
</P>
<P>
   I think Bruce would understand. I know Roger did.
</P>
<P>
   He had been No. 96 in a line of people waiting for a handful of
unclaimed tickets that went on sale the afternoon of the July 20
show. I was No. 34.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and I had vowed to avoid eye contact, maintain low
profiles, pretend we were French ... anything to keep the world
from knowing we were Southerners in the Land of Youse Guyz. But
much of Springsteen's music centers on the ties that bind. And six
hours of standing in a sweltering parking lot gets everyone
drinking from the same water bottle at one point or another.
</P>
<P>
   So ... Hi, Rog.
</P>
<P>
   He knew college basketball, loved Springsteen and needed a seat
in the house. How do you turn away a guy like that?
</P>
<P>
   I took his money, entered the Promised Land and bought three at
the window. The last-minute ticket allotment ran dry well before
No. 96 could have made it to the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Susan and I had found ourselves a new brother.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult obsession to explain. Springsteen put his hooks
in us in college, when so much of his music dealt with the
struggles we all face in growing up and finding out who we are.
</P>
<P>
   On a night in 1980 that now seems pretty darn close to magic, an
awkward college kid (that would be me) tried against all odds to
tell a girl how he really felt about her. I had all the grace of a
drowning man, but I somehow touched the life buoy of our guy's
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' I said after a long spell of flailing in water
over my head, ``there's this thing Bruce Springsteen wrote ...
`Thunder Road' ... he goes, `I know you've been hungry for words
that I ain't spoken, but tonight we'll be free. And all our
promises will be broken.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the goofiest moments of my life, but she stayed
with me anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So when tickets went on sale last weekend for Springsteen's
April 21-22 concerts in Charlotte and Raleigh, I tweaked my Web
browser, hit the speed dial, and somehow came up with seats at both
shows.
</P>
<P>
   I did it for a glimpse of my youth and for two more nights of
the best rock 'n' roll on the planet. I did it for Roger and for
all the tramps like us who will never shake this mania.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I did it for Susan and me, for the promises we've
found and made on our own. Sometimes you have to do something crazy
just to remind yourself that you're still alive.

 &HT;    Do-it-yourselfers can fix simple drain problems
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Most people are scared to death by the idea of
sticking their heads under their sinks and dismantling their
drains.
</P>
<P>
   Some are afraid they'll cause more problems than they'll
correct, and some consider the whole business of hands-on plumbing
too yucky to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   If you're willing to give it a shot, the average
do-it-yourselfer can fix most simple drain problems without the
help of a $50-an-hour plumber.
</P>
<P>
   But be prepared for some minor setbacks and frustrations. I've
rarely done a drain job that didn't require at least one extra trip
to the hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   HOW A DRAIN WORKS
</P>
<P>
   When you lift the plug from a sink or tub, gravity pulls and air
pressure pushes water down through a system of watertight, airtight
pipes into a public sewage system or private septic tank.
</P>
<P>
   The water from a typical bathroom sink first goes through a
drain basket then through a straight pipe called the tailpiece.
After the tailpiece comes the trap, a pipe shaped something like a
U with one side a little longer than the other.
</P>
<P>
   The trap attaches to a pipe with a 90-degree bend that is
sometimes called a J or a trap arm. The water travels through the
trap, up through the bend in the J and out through a connector to
the pipes behind the wall at the back of the sink. The pipe leading
out through the wall should slope slightly to encourage water to
flow away from the sink.
</P>
<P>
   The main drain pipe behind the wall goes in two directions: One
leg goes straight down and carries the waste water to the sewage
system, and the other leg goes straight up through the roof of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The pipe that goes up, which is called a vent, allows air into
the system to keep the water flowing. Without vents, opening a
drain would be like turning a bottle of water upside down; as water
leaves the bottle, the drop in air pressure inside the bottle can
slow or stop the flow of liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Each connection between the links in the drainage chain has to
be sealed, and that's usually done with plumber's putty, washers or
joint tape. Leaks occur when seals fail. Sometimes the seal between
the drain basket and sink is broken. Sometimes there's a bad joint
between the tailpiece and the trap.
</P>
<P>
   Position yourself under the sink, and run lukewarm water into
the bowl allowing it to drain. Using a flashlight or work light,
trace the course of the drain looking for signs of leakage.
</P>
<P>
   Also notice whether the drain parts seem to be aligned properly.
Pipes that are crooked often are the site of leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing a drain leak usually means taking the leaky connection
apart and repairing or replacing the parts that have failed.
</P>
<P>
   DISMANTLING DRAINS
</P>
<P>
   For most repairs you'll need the following tools: a good pair of
large, channel-type pliers, some kind of work light that can be
positioned under the sink, a bucket, some rags and a roll of Teflon
tape.
</P>
<P>
   It's easiest to make your repairs with plastic parts, so you'll
need a fine-tooth handsaw to cut plastic pipes to fit. You might
need a hacksaw to cut metal pipes. A large pipe wrench might also
come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   The drain piece you'll remove most often is the trap. It's the
piece you remove if you've dropped something into the drain that
you want to retrieve. It's also the site of common clogs.
</P>
<P>
   Both ends of the trap pipe are threaded, meaning they have
screwlike grooves cut into them. The trap is held in place by nuts
at both ends. One nut slides over the body of the tailpiece, and
the other hangs on the bent end of the J.
</P>
<P>
   To remove the trap, place a bucket underneath and turn the nut
attached to the tailpiece with the channel pliers. If the nut is
metal, it may be so corroded that it won't turn. In that case,
apply a little penetrating oil and tap the joint lightly with a
hammer. In about 15 minutes, the nut should turn.
</P>
<P>
   Once the nut is loose, you can remove it by hand. At this point,
any water in the drain will start spilling into the bucket. (Did I
mention you might want to wear rubber gloves?)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the nut at the J pipe in the same way you removed the nut
at the tailpiece. Any water left in the drain should spill out at
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Pull the trap loose, and turn it upside down to shake out
anything loose inside. You can use a small wire brush to clean the
inside of the trap and remove clogs or remaining debris.
</P>
<P>
   Joints on traps, whether plastic or metal, come in two basic
types: ground joints and slip joints. When you take the pipes
apart, you'll be able to tell what kind you have.
</P>
<P>
   In a ground joint, the end of the tailpiece has a wedge-shaped
ring called a flange that keeps the nut from slipping off. In a
plastic joint, the flange fits directly into the mouth at the top
of the trap and is held in place by tightening the nut. In a metal
joint, a rubber washer is positioned between the flange and the
mouth of the trap to form an airtight seal as the nut is tightened.
</P>
<P>
   In a slip joint, the shaft of the tailpiece is smooth. The nut
is slipped over the shaft, and a movable washer goes over the shaft
to keep the nut from sliding back off. The ends of the trap are
widened so the end of the tailpiece slides a couple of inches into
the trap. The washer is then slid down into the mouth of the trap,
and the nut is tightened to hold the assembly in place.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an important tip to remember about plastic drain washers:
Slide the washer onto the tailpiece flat side first so the flat
side is against the nut. The angled side fits into the mouth of the
trap.
</P>
<P>
   If you dismantle a trap and find any of the pieces, including
the washers, are worn or damaged, take the bad part with you to the
hardware store so you'll be sure to get replacement parts that
match. You can replace metal parts with plastic parts of the same
design.
</P>
<P>
   Before reassembling the trap, wrap the threads at the ends of
the trap with Teflon tape to insure a tight seal.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic joints can be tightened by hand. Overtightening can
break the plastic washers and ruin the seal.
</P>
<P>
   With metal joints, tighten by hand, then twist the nuts another
quarter turn with the pliers. Leave the bucket in place while you
run water to test your connections for water tightness.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've mastered removing and replacing traps, you'll find
most other sink-drain repairs are not much different.
</P>
<P>
   The keys are placing buckets to catch water, dismantling joints
carefully, replacing parts with matching parts and being prepared
for little surprises.
</P>
<P>
   If your first attempts are not 100 percent satisfying, remember:
You're gaining experience that will make your next attempts easier.

 &HT;    Dedication is not the problem, inspiration is
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Anyone who's ever authored something longer
than a grocery list understands that writing requires dedication
and discipline. Inspiration and an endless source of ideas don't
hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   Dedication is something you don't know you have until one day
you realize
</P>
<P>
   your friends no longer ask you to go anywhere because they know
</P>
<P>
   you'll be too busy writing - or at least trying to. An
observable
</P>
<P>
   characteristic of dedication is a sloped shoulder, the result of
too many
</P>
<P>
   hours spent in airports with a laptop hanging from it.
</P>
<P>
   Dedication drags me out of bed each morning well before
daybreak, and
</P>
<P>
   sets my fingers to a cold keyboard while the rest of the village
burrows deeper into the feathers for an extra 40 winks.
</P>
<P>
   Early mornings are an ideal work time for me. No phone
solicitors wanting to
</P>
<P>
   rip out my windows or brick up the basement walls. All too
frequently,
</P>
<P>
   however, the truth of the old ``lead a horse to water'' adage
applies. Just substitute writer for horse and paper for water.
</P>
<P>
   For total focus I would have to be stranded oarless in a rowboat
in the
</P>
<P>
   middle of an alligator-infested swamp with nothing but my laptop
for company.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances I'm sure I could crank out a hefty
sequel to ``War
</P>
<P>
   and Peace'' well before the mosquitoes declared me Flavor of the
Month.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination, however, is the writer's curse, and I am
heavily afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   It's unbelievable the things I can find to do after I have
rolled the chair up to my desk and clicked on the computer. Just
the other day I spent 30 minutes fishing cat hair out of the
keyboard with a ballpoint stylus I found in a pencil box.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the little rituals like: If I have 400 words by 6
a.m., I'm
</P>
<P>
   allowed to play 3 games of Free Cell (a highly addictive
computer card game)
</P>
<P>
   before I have to go back to work. Naturally, 3 games turned into
5, and then
</P>
<P>
   10, and pretty soon I found myself going for a world's record
for the number
</P>
<P>
   played between bathroom breaks.
</P>
<P>
   That was when I called my son for help. 'Get this monkey off my
back and out
</P>
<P>
   of my computer,' I whined. He walked me through the deletion
process, but just
</P>
<P>
   as my addiction was about to fade into the oblivion of computer
netherworld, he suggested I save the game onto a disk - just in
case withdrawal was too painful. So I did.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, I was Free-Cell clean as the seductive disk cooled
its floppy
</P>
<P>
   self in the bottom desk drawer. But on the third day I caved.
The habit was
</P>
<P>
   too strong. Soon I was playing during meals, while the bathtub
filled, and even
</P>
<P>
   when I was on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly reality reared its electronic head. Free Cell had to go.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I yanked the offending disk out of the A-drive,
walked
</P>
<P>
   it to the garbage can behind the garage, and stuffed it in among
the coffee grounds and orange rinds. It was a tense hour before the
truck pulled up to haul it away, but after that I was a free woman.
</P>
<P>
   Writers need inspiration and will go looking for it in
ill-assorted places,
</P>
<P>
   but little inspires us to flex the fingers and put the brain in
gear more than
</P>
<P>
   an imminent deadline. Most writers, I suspect, operate on the
deeply
</P>
<P>
   philosophical approach to writing that was voiced by Charlie
Brown as he sat
</P>
<P>
   glumly on a schoolyard bench rationalizing himself out of
getting to work on a
</P>
<P>
   book report about Peter Rabbit. ``I work best under pressure,''
he points out,
</P>
<P>
   ``and if I wait 'til tomorrow there will be lots of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas, however, are elusive. Occasionally, the apt turn of a
phrase can
</P>
<P>
   inspire volumes. Other times I couldn't come up with 50 words if
WW III were
</P>
<P>
   being declared outside my office window and Hemingway sat beside
me.
</P>
<P>
   Like today.
</P>
<P>
   Where are those alligators when I really need them'

 &HT;    2000 Suburban logical, sensible
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it appears to be the oversized offspring of a motor
home and a conventional sport-utility vehicle, the redesigned
Chevrolet Suburban really is a logically evolved vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Logical, even sensible, that is, if:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There's a need to transport as many as eight passengers, all
of whom are adults and need some leg, hip, shoulder and head room.
Or if there's a need to haul loads in a vehicle that will pass the
standard test of accepting a 4-by-8 sheet of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There's an occasional or full-time need to go off the road or
for a good distance down the highway, perhaps even towing a smaller
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There's no overwhelming concern about economy. (The Suburban's
base price is $28,627; the EPA figures are 14 and 16 mpg regular
unleaded city and highway, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Suburban, which is more than 18 feet long, is about 8
inches shorter than the new Ford Excursion, a major competitor. But
that doesn't mean it's always easy to park in lined or otherwise
tight spaces, and its width of 78.8 inches means there can be times
when drivers and passengers will worry about losing the massive
side mirrors to traffic signs or utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Suburban, although based on the equally new Silverado
pickup, has a carlike ride (the test LS had a $366 premium-ride
suspension option) and is a steady-driving vehicle when roads are
unobstructed and lanes are sizable. Off the road, it'll creep and
crawl comfortably with the only real concern low-hanging limbs.
(The Suburban is about 74 inches tall, so inside parking can be a
worry, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The interior is more than limo-size, with room to move about,
carry bags and boxes, and places to store small items. Drink
holders abound, as do power outlets. When it comes to power, the
5.3-liter V-8's 285 horsepower propel the 5,000-pound Suburban with
authority, but the kickdown from fourth to third gear (no manual is
offered) can be aggravatingly slow in coming. The transmission can
be set in two- or four-wheel drive or in the automatic mode so it
decides when to go to all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   For drivers unaccustomed to large vehicles, slowdown times and
braking distances have to be adjusted, and it's best to be extra
alert for vehicles darting in front of the Suburban (remember the
laws of physics about a mass in motion wanting to keep going?). But
that's an expected trade-off for a vehicle that has the size and
space of the Suburban, no longer No. 1 in bulk, but still a
comfort/convenience contender.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Chevrolet Suburban LS four-wheel-drive
sport-utility
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $38,708 (base: $28,627, plus $710 delivery fee)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 5.3-liter V-8 engine (285 horsepower), four-speed
automatic two-/four-wheel-drive transmission with tow/haul mode
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front and side air bags, side-impact
beams, power anti-lock disc brakes, height-adjustable shoulder
belts, daytime running lights
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle include: LS package with CD player and
nine speakers, front and rear heating/air conditioning, power
windows and heated mirrors, keyless entry system, $7,423
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 14 miles per gallon regular unleaded city, 16 mpg
highway

 &HT;    `Gremlins,' blown fuses tough cases
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this conclusion to the discussion about electrical shortcuts,
we'll look at two that are probably less common than a direct short
to ground but by far more complicated and harder to diagnose.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I discussed three kinds of electrical shortcuts. If
you recall, electricity is like a commuter. It leaves home (the
battery) to go to work (starting the car, running the radio,
lighting the lights, etc.) and then home again on roadways of
copper wire. But electricity is lazy and will avoid work if there
is a short circuit, or shortcut, back home before work. There are
bridges, called fuses or circuit breakers, on the roadway that will
collapse (blow the fuse) if too much electricity tries to jam onto
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The most common type of short is the one that avoids work by
taking a shortcut from the power side (to work) path to the ground
(home) path.
</P>
<P>
   The second type of short can blow fuses by allowing too much
electricity to flow. This happens when the shortcut occurs inside a
motor that uses electricity to make something happen mechanically,
such as fuel injectors controlled by an engine computer.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn the key on in your car, the electricity leaves
home (the battery) and goes off to work in different places. One of
its jobs is to wake up the computer. The computer sends the
electricity to a bunch of sensors on the engine, telling them to go
to work. The sensors sense what the engine is doing and send this
electrical information back to the computer, telling it what the
engine needs to make it run right.
</P>
<P>
   The throttle position sensor senses the position of the
accelerator pedal. It sends this information to the computer that
sends out a signal to the fuel injectors. When the computer turns
them on, they squirt gasoline into the engine. If the driver's foot
is pushing the pedal to the metal, the computer keeps the injectors
on longer, meeting the engine's demand for more fuel. When the
engine is at idle, little fuel is needed, so the computer shortens
the ``on'' time.
</P>
<P>
   If a fuel injector develops a partial short, too much
electricity will flow through it. Because the electricity that goes
through the fuel injector also has to go through the computer, the
computer gets zapped. If this circuit is protected by a fuse, it
should blow first, but that does not always happen.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, sometimes the zapped computer is replaced
without finding the shorted fuel injector that caused the problem
to begin with. A new computer is installed with the bad injector
still on the path, and it happens all over again. Injectors are not
the only computer-controlled devices that cause this kind of
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The last kind of shortcut does not usually blow fuses. It causes
what I like to call ``poltergeists.'' These little gremlins are the
things that cause the dome light to go off and on while a car is
driving down the road or the electric door locks to flip back and
forth for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Each electrical device in the car usually has its own separate
``to work'' path. These paths are isolated from each other by the
plastic wire insulation that comes in all of those pretty colors.
If the insulation on two or more of the ``to work'' power wires
should become damaged and the wire paths touch each other, the
electricity may not know which way to go, so it goes to both jobs
at once _ like turning your radio on and having the dome light come
on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   This shortcut from one power wire to another is called a short
to power or a copper-to-copper short.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems that cars that have been wrecked are more prone to
these gremlins.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for electrical malfunctions, never attempt
to begin a repair without a wiring diagram.

 &HT;    Irritating are motorists who pull up to bumper

   ATLANTA _ There was a time when I would have said that my
biggest pet peeve was left-lane bandits.
</P>
<P>
   You know who I'm referring to. They are the cars that sit in the
left lane, and a stick of dynamite couldn't get them to move over.
They have never seen those signs that say ``slower traffic keep
right,'' or else they just don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Now they seem to have a contender for the status of the most
irritating drivers on the road. For some time now, I have observed
that tailgating on public highways seems to have become common.
</P>
<P>
   It baffles me why some drivers think it is their right to sit
almost in the trunk of the vehicle in front of them. But an
extension of that concept that is even more irritating is when it
happens at an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent ice storm, I was sitting at a traffic light in a
yellow Corvette convertible, which means there is no chance that
the guy behind me didn't see me. The driver behind was driving a
new Chevrolet Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   I was getting a bit nervous because it seemed he was waiting way
too late to begin the braking process. Because I was the first car
at a four-way intersection, pulling forward was not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, he got the big Suburban slowed down in time, but
then he pulled so close to the back of the 'Vette that I couldn't
even see the top of the Suburban's grille in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   He's way too close.
</P>
<P>
   What if another vehicle slides into the rear of the Suburban?
Not only does he get it, because of that size differential, my car
probably would be badly damaged as well.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, I have paid particular attention to vehicles
that park on the back bumper of the vehicle in front of them in
traffic lines or at intersections. It's epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was completely stopped recently for construction on Ga.
316. The eighth or ninth car in line didn't get stopped, and the
front seven were stacked together like cordwood.
</P>
<P>
   This situation is more than stupid, it doesn't accomplish
anything but create the potential for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to a complete stop with half to three-fourths of a car
length from the vehicle in front of you virtually eliminates any
danger of hitting the car in front of you. Simply put, if there
isn't room to steer around the vehicle in front of you, you aren't
going anywhere except into the vehicle in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   Traction control, anti-lock brakes, all-wheel drive _ none of
those newfangled gadgets will remedy this problem.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who can help is you. You need room to maneuver.
Do yourself a favor and leave enough room between you and the next
vehicle so that you can not only see the front vehicle's back
bumper, but also where the rear tires meet the pavement. Safer yet
is to leave three-fourths of a car length (approximately 10 to 12
feet for most vehicles).
</P>
<P>
   There are very few 10-foot vehicles on the road, so don't worry
about someone cutting in front of you. If some rude driver does,
it's not the end of the world. You'll still get there in the same
amount of time and a lot less frazzled.

 &HT;    FOREIGN JOURNAL: FACIAL HAIR A POLITICAL MATTER IN MIDEAST
 &HT;    With PHOTO Mug of Kaplow.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Before my first visit here years ago, a veteran
Middle East correspondent told me to shave my beard. It might make
me look like an Orthodox Jew, he said, and draw hostile glares in
Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   On the trans-Atlantic flight, I sat next to a Palestinian man
from New Jersey who also told me to shave. The beard, he said, made
me look like an Arab and would get me hassled by Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Just like where you live, shop or pray, how you shave is a
political statement in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   For better and worse, people rely on stereotypes in deciding who
they should trust or suspect. Arabs in Israel can count on being
pulled aside at the airport for extra inspection or pulled over on
the road for searches. Israelis can expect an occasional cold
shoulder in Arab areas.
</P>
<P>
   A couple years ago, a Benetton catalogue featured Israelis and
Arabs in photos together. Some readers were bothered that they
could not always tell them apart, clad as they were in the Benetton
duds. It clouded the rules.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that I could have an instructive social
experiment right under my nose _ a mustache.
</P>
<P>
   According to the stereotype, Arab men wear mustaches and Israeli
Jews do not, unless it's with a trendy goatee or the full beard of
Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is as unreliable as other stereotypes. Former
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has a mustache. Amir Peretz,
an Israeli labor leader and member of the Israeli parliament, wears
a bushy mustache like a trademark.
</P>
<P>
   However, a mustache can still generate suspicion in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After I grew my mustache, Israeli police began stopping me and
asking for identification. It happened once when I was walking a
street near my house and twice on the Ben Yehuda outdoor mall _
bombed by terrorists in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt about whether these approaches were mustache-related
was erased one day on the Ben Yehuda mall.
</P>
<P>
   I was approached by two young women soldiers on patrol. Unarmed
and tentative, one asked in Hebrew to see my identification. I
answered in English. Her partner faced her and said, also in
English, ``You see, I told you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it the mustache?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the first soldier. ``It was.''
</P>
<P>
   The mustache has worked to my advantage in Arab locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an Arab face!'' a smiling Cairo taxi driver said to
me recently, asking if I was an Arab.
</P>
<P>
   I thanked him, but told him no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then maybe one of your grandfathers,'' he said, insisting that
I must have Arab lineage.
</P>
<P>
   When I was clean-shaven and crew-cut on another trip to Cairo,
two Egyptians refused to talk to me until I assured them that I was
not an Israeli. So much for the ``Arab face.''
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Iran, I added a couple day's beard to the mustache.
It made a good impression on a mullah, or religious teacher, I met
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   He said I had the beard of a good Muslim. When I explained that
I was just too lazy to shave every day, he explained that any
slight growth qualifies for Islamic piety.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I could be reading too much politics in these
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   I once noticed an Iranian woman speaking in hushed tones to my
translator. After some coaxing, I got a reluctant translation:
``She said you have the ugliest mustache she's ever seen.''

HIS BRILLIANCE ALLOWS US TO FORGIVE ROBERT FROST ALMOST ANYTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The critic Bernard DeVoto once confronted an American literary
icon thusly: ``You're a good poet, Robert Frost, but you're a bad
man.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant every word, and many who knew Frost agreed. Frost was
outrageously jealous, particularly toward the benign Carl Sandburg.
Over much of their long parallel lives, Sandburg was the more
popular poet, the one most easily and most often quoted. Frost
derided Sandburg's free verse as ``playing tennis without a net.''
Sandburg's fame diminishes today while Frost's complete body of
work _ poetry, prose, plays _ fills an imposing volume in the
splendid Library of America series.
</P>
<P>
   We make allowance for genius and tolerate flaws in those who
possess it. Charles Dickens was as egocentric as Frost, Ernest
Hemingway as mean-spirited. Badness may have been in Robert Frost,
but more than a good poet, he was a great one. We're privileged to
love him.
</P>
<P>
   I've long enjoyed this poet. As with many others, I've memorized
and quoted ``The Road Not Taken'' and ``Stopping by Woods'' and
other familiar short lyrics. I'm most beguiled by the narrative
poems in ``North of Boston,'' Frost's second book (1914), which put
his reputation on a consistently upward trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   Such gems as ``The Housekeeper,'' ``The Death of the Hired
Man,'' ``A Hundred Collars'' and ``Home Burial,'' each compressed
into a few pages, pack more drama for greater emotional impact than
most distended novels.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frost (1874-1963) often is a freewheeling entertainer, as
in the delightful ``Departmental,'' wherein he observritual
funeral of an ant. We laugh and smile with Frost, but more often
he'll disturb us. His preoccupation is with the darker side of
human nature, and he's as pessimistic as Sandburg is romantic.
</P>
<P>
   That's not what makes him a great poet.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other, Frost conferred poetic dignity on plain
language. He may exploit odd rhyme patterns or the verse may not
rhyme at all, but its metric discipline and staccato rhythms create
a lovely effect akin to music. His poems may be savored on
different levels, for surface enjoyment or for their philosophical
and emotional depth.
</P>
<P>
   Although born in San Francisco, Frost was raised in New England
and became his region's voice and conscience. His was the bucolic
tradition of another New Englander, John Greenleaf Whittier, whose
``contemporary'' poetry gained favor with later generations for its
nostalgia quotient, expressing ways of life that had all but
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frost may have similar effect on today's reader. Finally,
though, his poetry is timeless, transcending both period and place.
God bless him.

HOW BARNS GET THEIR COLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Why are all the barns in northern Kentucky painted black?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.A., Alvarado, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: ``This color scheme came from the tradition of using lamp
black and diesel fuel as a cheap wood preservative,'' Heber Bouland
writes in an article reprinted by the Michigan State University
Museum Barn Journal.
</P>
<P>
   This was a departure from the tradition of painting barns red,
which became popular in the northern and eastern United States in
the early 19th century. ``Some barn authorities claim it was the
Scandinavian influence; they used red to simulate brick and
wealth,'' Bouland writes.
</P>
<P>
   The Barn Journal, a publication dedicated to the ``appreciation
and preservation of traditional farm architecture,'' is published
on the Web at museum.cl.msu.edu/barn.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Maria Shriver? I want to share my
children's stories with her.
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S., Grand Prairie, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Shriver or anyone else affiliated with ``Dateline
NBC'' in care of NBC News, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Room 510, New
York, NY 10112.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver, 44, is a a contributing anchor on ``Dateline'' and
MSNBC correspondent. She also wrote a bestselling children's book
last year, ``What's Heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   Selling more than 300,000 copies, Shriver's book became the
first children's title in 30 years to reach the top 10 of the New
York Times bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I buy pure gum spirits turpentine?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.W., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Klean-Strip pure gum spirits turpentine is carried by
Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Builder's Square and Payless Cashways stores,
according to the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``professional quality'' solvent is used as a thinner for
oil-based paint and varnishes. You also can find pure gum spirits
turpentine at some art supply stores.

A LONG LOOK BACK FOR JONI 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``Both Sides Now''; by Joni Mitchell; Reprise/Warner Bros.) 
 
By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women and men in rock have tried to copy Joni Mitchell's musical
ethos for so long, it's almost disconcerting when she takes on
another writer's work.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, though, Mitchell can make music by others as
beautiful as her own, as her latest, ``Both Sides Now,'' proves.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by big bands and orchestras, Mitchell borrows from the
songbook that made stars of Billie Holiday, Etta James and Ella
Fitzgerald. She even reinterprets her own early works ``A Case of
You'' and the title song as vampy club pieces. In the process, she
demonstrates that when exquisite songwriting pairs with unmatched
vocal talent, the result is at worst interesting, at best inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentations are the type of string-and-brass
arrangements more associated with Frank Sinatra's heyday.
Mitchell's ease with the musical layers makes it clear that she
could have had a career vastly different than the folksy path she
chose.
</P>
<P>
   On ``You're My Thrill'' and ``At Last,'' she makes up for the
emotional rush of a Holiday or James with plush whispers more
reminiscent of tobacco back roads than the Cotton Club. Listening
to her echoey voice melt with the string work on ``Stormy
Weather,'' the image of Mitchell in a sequined gown, hair up, and
fronting a big band doesn't seem so outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   The best moments are Mitchell's updated versions of her own
classics. The original ``A Case of You'' from ``Blue'' felt
girlishly vulnerable compared to this self-assured update. And when
she utters ``I could drink a case of you,'' one gets the feeling
it's no longer infatuation, but contentment, that would provoke
such a tender response.
</P>
<P>
   With 1994's ``Turbulent Indigo'' album and 1998's ``Taming the
Tiger,'' Mitchell has created some of the most interesting new
music of her 32-year career. It would be a shame if she didn't
continue in her own vein, but ``Both Sides Now'' is a joyful
intermission between creative spurts.

WRITER PAINTS A SYMPATHETIC PORTRAIT OF THE LAKOTA LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``On the Rez``; By Ian Frazier; Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25.) 
 
By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first visited the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1988 because I had
heard that a California millionaire was to be given the title of
``Itancankel,'' or special chief, an honor bestowed on very few
people in the long, storied and tragic history of the Lakota
(Sioux) Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Only partly Sioux and a stranger to the South Dakota
reservation, Phillip Stevens was being anointed by a faction of
American Indians as the warrior leader who would take back the
sacred Black Hills and win $3.1 billion in compensation to lift the
people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies would be elaborate and traditional. Stevens would
smoke the sacred pipe, he would purify his spirit in a sweat lodge,
and in a climactic celebration in a hall in the small reservation
town of Mission, in front of the cameras of the national media, he
would accept the chief's war bonnet and the name He Who Leads With
His Shield.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A PROBLEM ARISES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was, I soon discovered, one problem with this highly
scripted event; it was whispered to me during the ceremony by Dinah
Crow Dog, a relative of Leonard Crow Dog, one of the Lakota's
spiritual leaders: Stevens was not a full-blooded Sioux. Nor was he
an enrolled member of an Indian tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, according to federal law he was not allowed to possess
eagle feathers, the sacred icons out of which a true chief's bonnet
is made. Chief He Who Leads With His Shield, that day 12 years ago,
had to be content with a bonnet of turkey feathers _ a fitting
insult, Crow Dog thought, for this ``wannabe'' chief.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit (some argue to their detriment) the Lakota,
particularly the Oglala tribe that lives on the Pine Ridge
Reservation, have tenaciously held onto their identity. They define
themselves by their blood, their history and their culture. Unless
you are a full-blooded Sioux, you cannot enroll as a member of some
tribes, and then only if you live on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FRAZIER AS WANNABE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't given Stevens much thought since that day in 1988. But
he _ and Crow Dog's obvious satisfaction with the fact that he
would always be an outsider _ came back to me forcefully on reading
Ian Frazier's ``On the Rez.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Frazier too is something of a wannabe
Indian. A middle-aged, middle-class white writer known for his work
at The New Yorker magazine and for his last book, ``Great Plains,''
he wears a ponytail in the style favored by the activists of the
American Indian Movement during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But he is an outsider of an entirely different sort, one of the
few who have taken the time to try to know the Lakota from the
inside and for all the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   He has, he says, no interest in taking part in any of the Lakota
ceremonies, a desire that curiously lies at the heart of the
wannabe. Nor is he interested in dressing like them or worshipping
like them. He doesn't want a nice Indian name or a fancy title.
Frazier's desire to be an Indian goes far deeper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A LOVE OF FREEDOM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is drawn to the Lakota because they hold onto something the
culture that defeated them and threatens to consume them takes for
granted _ a sense of independence and a love of freedom. It is a
trait exemplified through the acts of people like the great Chief
Red Cloud, who negotiated the Fort Laramie Treaty in 1868 and who
sat cross-legged on the floor when he met senators in Washington,
declaring, ``I have grown to be a very independent man, and
consider myself a very great man.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is essentially this ``self-possessed sense of freedom,''
a quality Frazier believes has been reduced to the stereotypical
adjective ``proud,'' that makes him want to be an Indian.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unstructured freedom, almost chaos, in the way
Frazier has written this book. That may reflect in part the way of
life on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RUTTED ROADS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of his musing about the Oglala Lakota occurs while driving
the reservation's rutted roads with his friend Le War Lance looking
for spare car parts or while driving to buy cases of beer in White
Clay, Neb. Much like life on the reservation, which meanders from
morning to night with ritual stops at the post office, at Big Bat's
Texaco (``one of the few places on the reservation that look like
what you are used to in paved America''), at homes of friends and
family, ``On the Rez'' wanders along without an obvious plot or
destination.
</P>
<P>
   One of the book's main characters, a teen-age basketball star
called SueAnne Big Crow, makes her appearance only a third of the
way in. But by the time she does arrive, we are ready for her. And
by the time the story ends, we understand why it was necessary to
delay her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Before we can really appreciate what makes SueAnne a hero, we
have to know where she came from. Off the reservation, in
non-Indian America, we live in a world where very few people want
to be heroes. Even people who risk their lives to save others
invariably disown their heroism.
</P>
<P>
   The Oglala Lakota culture, though, still has room for heroes _
for those of the past like Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull and Red Cloud
and for those of the present like SueAnne, an ordinary teen-ager
who had an extraordinary ability to inspire others and to bridge
the deep chasms that divided people on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BLEAK TO OUTSIDERS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's portrait of the Pine Ridge Reservation doesn't ignore
the qualities that lead people to use words like ``bleak'' to
describe it. It is bleak, relentlessly so, particularly when it is
icy cold and the north wind howls over the plains. Grinding
poverty, a lack of basic amenities, the dearth of businesses,
crushing social problems like alcoholism, and the idleness that
comes with high unemployment are all present.
</P>
<P>
   But outsiders are the ones who use that word. Frazier claims
never to have heard an Indian use ``bleak'' to describe the
reservation. It is simply what it is. Those who don't understand it
and don't try to understand it are outsiders, and they stick out as
plainly as the turkey feathers in would-be chief Stevens' war
bonnets. By the same token, as Frazier clearly shows, it is against
the backdrop of the reservation's ``bleakness'' that heroes like
SueAnne shine so brightly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`EVIDENCE OF GOOD' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Good appears most vividly in resistance to its opposite;
that's what heroism is about, after all,'' he writes. ``The more
you see of Pine Ridge's bad side, the more you long for evidence of
good, and the happier you are when you find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture of American Indians most of us carry around is more
often than not stereotypical and wrong. They are either
romanticized or vilified beyond reality. Frazier's book does
neither. It is a sensitive, honest and sympathetic portrait of a
great tribe trying to cope with a tragedy not of its making.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a wannabe.

SUBJECT'S VANITY FLAWS BIO OF COLORFUL NEW ORLEANS SEX QUEEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``The Last Madam: A Life in the New Orleans Underworld''; By
Christine Wiltz; Faber and Faber, $25.) 
 
(Eds: Accent mark needed over second e in Renee byline) 
 
By RENEE KIENTZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be swell to be eternally youthful, attractive even
in your 70s to virile young men? A strong, feisty broad respected
by friend and foe? Wouldn't it be grand to have the last word in
how the world saw you, even after you've passed beyond? Of course,
darling.
</P>
<P>
   But does it make good reading?
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the late Norma Wallace, subject of Christine Wiltz's
``The Last Madam,'' would enjoy it. For four decades, beginning in
the 1920s, Wallace ran a series of bordellos, cavorting and
consorting with some of New Orleans' most powerful men on both
sides of the law and attaining the status of legend in a city that
appreciates a little creative larceny. Perhaps no one enjoyed her
legend more than Wallace herself, a poor girl who prospered by
packaging sex and her own persona as a colorful character in a
colorful town.
</P>
<P>
   That vanity flaws this book, which rarely challenges Wallace's
Runyonesque glamorization of her life and high times and offers
little more than what Wallace herself would have volunteered (and
did). Wiltz largely based the book on memoirs recorded by Wallace
during the two years before her suicide in 1974. After failing in
life to find a biographer who would do justice by her memoirs, she
would be pleased that they fell into the respectful hands of Wiltz,
a New Orleans native and novelist (``Glass House,'' ``The Killing
Circle'').
</P>
<P>
   Wiltz did interview many of Wallace's acquaintances, former
employees, ex-lovers and spouses, all of whom remembered her as she
would want to be remembered _ as the bigger-than-life ``landlady''
who always expected to be in control and who almost always was.
And, it would seem, still is. The result is that Norma Wallace's
secrets remain her secrets, and she remains the two-dimensional
heroine of her own life story.
</P>
<P>
   Were that story more compellingly told, ``The Last Madam'' might
still be a winning read. The book is, after all, about two usually
irresistible topics _ sex and power. Rarely has New Orleans'
underside been so exposed for those outside the city to see. And
behind-the-scenes glimpses into the workings of bawdy houses should
be worth a peek. But Wallace can't resist polishing her own star,
and Wiltz lets her, feeding us scenes from the Jazz Age madam's
life in prose better suited to the romance genre than biography.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace ``threw her shoulders back and lengthened her stride.''
She wore her fedora ``jauntily askew.''
</P>
<P>
   She made an entrance. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``When Norma walked in that night, their eyeballs popped. ``Who the
hell is that?'' one of the guys asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne knew who it was _ there was no mistaking Mrs.
Patterson (Wallace), with that hair like Marilyn Monroe and those
dark sunglasses. She walked up to the bar, a fire red hourglass on
high heels, and he pushed his way out of the booth.`` &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, Wayne. Wayne Bernard was Wallace's fifth and final
husband, the beefcake youth she first pursued when he was jailbait
and whom she married, in 1965, when he was 25 and she was 64.
Though Wayne insists it was Norma's allure and not her wealth that
attracted him, it's still his candor that helps right the book's
course.
</P>
<P>
   The final chapters are the best, if saddest. ``The Last Madam''
yields its humanity when we get past the ``cheese it, the cops''
anecdotes about whores hiding tricks, when Norma no longer bothers
to drop the names of celebrities she had in her bed and New Orleans
pols she had in her pocket. Wiltz serves best when, at the end, she
lets her own voice take over.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the aging madam's loneliness, the despair Wallace
felt when she'd lost not only her power over Wayne but her capacity
for self-delusion, Wiltz at last makes Norma Wallace a real person.
Not a dame. Not Rosalind Russell as a hooker with a heart of gold
and a head for business. Just a woman, a strong, resourceful,
ordinary woman who led an extraordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad we didn't meet her sooner.

&HT;     DO HAPPY EMPLOYEES MAKE FLYING SAFER? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is a flawed statistic, but it's jarring
nevertheless: The only major U.S. airline that didn't have a fatal
crash in the last decade is the one widely regarded as the best
airline to work for.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Southwest Airlines has an enviable safety record, with
more than 6 million flights and no deaths since it began nearly 30
years ago. But the industry has so few accidents (you are 10 times
more likely to be killed by a co-worker than to die in a plane
crash) that it could all be a big coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   But what if it's not? Certainly there are many factors that can
lead to a plane crash, from weather to mechanical failure to human
error. On the other hand, the best employers tend to attract the
best workers and provide them with the best working conditions. And
the Southwest statistic is only one of several ``coincidences''
connecting air safety with employee satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fortune magazine began publishing its annual list of ``The
100 Best Companies to Work For'' in January 1998, Southwest has
been one of the top five in each of the three years. No other
airline has cracked the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   But long before Fortune began publishing their list, Robert
Levering of San Francisco's Great Place to Work Institute and
Milton Moskowitz had been studying America's top companies. They
worked on a book, ``The 100 Best Companies to Work for in
America,'' published in 1984 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Both Southwest and Delta Air Lines made their top 10 in 1993,
and Delta also had been there in 1984. Among major U.S. carriers,
Delta has the second-lowest rate of fatal incidents since 1970,
behind only Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   (All this column's airline safety statistics are from Web site
AirSafe.com and its publisher, Todd Curtis.)
</P>
<P>
   The only other airline to appear in the top 100 in either ``best
companies'' book was People Express in 1984. The airline thrived in
the early 1980s, then closed in 1986. It never had a fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   One expanding airline, America West, has had no crashes, but it
has flown only about 2 million flights.
</P>
<P>
   The only airline besides Southwest to make any of Fortune's
lists has been Continental, No. 40 last year and No. 23 this year.
It has one of the airlines' worst safety records since 1970, but
there's a huge catch: The company changed dramatically during the
1990s under Gordon Bethune, the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says you can't turn around a company reviled by both
employees and customers?'' Fortune wrote when Continental first
made its list a year ago. ``Since taking the captain's seat here in
1994, Gordon Bethune has made employee satisfaction a top priority.
Every month that Continental ranks among the top five airlines in
on-time arrivals, employees receive a check for at least $65.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bethune took over, Continental has had one fatality.
During boarding in Peru three years ago, an elderly passenger
disregarded a gate agent's instructions and got onto the plane,
went through the aft galley and a catering door, then fell to the
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years before Bethune took over, Continental had
three fatal crashes. Fifty-one people died.
</P>
<P>
   Although the airline statistics could all be coincidences
because of limited data, other studies show that the best companies
to work for typically attract more job applicants, screen them more
closely and do more to retain them than other companies do. Common
sense says that all those things should lead to a better work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt Associates, the Illinois management consulting firm that
also helps with Fortune's list, says the average length of employee
tenure for companies on the list is 6 years. That compares with a
nationwide average of 3.6 years for all companies, according to
U.S. Department of Labor figures for 1998, the most recent year
available.
</P>
<P>
   The best employers particularly push for workers at all levels
to feel involved in the company's success, says Kimberly Scott,
Hewitt's project leader in its best companies study. For example,
all the public companies among Fortune's top 25 offer stock to all
employees, not just managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock clearly is one of the most important mechanisms to link
employees with the companies,'' Scott says.
</P>
<P>
   Again, that makes perfect sense. Employees who act like owners _
or who are owners, of course _ are more likely to fix problems as
they occur, not wait for someone else to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Southwest that consistently make the top 25 pay
their employees well, but they're also more likely to offer quality
of life benefits like support groups, mentoring and time off for
community service. Eighty-one percent offer managers training in
time management and work-life balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortune list is based heavily on an employee survey. Scott
says that helps to make sure the best companies do more than offer
human resources frills; if employees feel overstressed and
underappreciated, the company isn't going to make the list.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the bottom line, Fortune points out that the
stocks of the public companies on its list this year have done
better than the S&AMP;P 500, a benchmark of the overall stock market.
Over 10 years, the Fortune companies averaged a 21 percent annual
return, compared with 17 percent for the S&AMP;P. Over three years, the
figures are 37 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that could all just be a coincidence, too.

&HT;     `AMERICAN BEAUTY' TOPS ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suburban satire-drama ``American Beauty'' received eight
Academy Award nominations on Tuesday, including one for best
picture. The film about a family undone when its patriarch
undergoes a midlife crises leads the field, with the
tobacco-cover-up drama ``The Insider'' and the coming-of-age
heart-tugger ``The Cider House Rules'' close behind with seven
nominations each.
</P>
<P>
   Joining those three films in the best-picture category are the
popular thriller ``The Sixth Sense,'' with six nods, and the '40s
death-row drama ``The Green Mile,'' with four. Of the five
nominees, ``Cider House,'' about a young man who leaves the
orphanage where he was raised to work on an apple orchard in the
1940s, is the major surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' also scored acting nominations for Kevin
Spacey and Annette Bening, director Sam Mendes and screenwriter
Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey won a supporting statue in 1996 ``The Usual Suspects.''
His competition in the best-actor category are Denzel Washington
for his work as the unjustly incarcerated boxer Ruben Carter in
``The Hurricane,'' Russell Crowe as a scientist blowing the whistle
on the tobacco industry in ``The Insider,'' Richard Farnsworth as a
man driving across two states on lawnmower in David Lynch's ``The
Straight Story'' and Sean Penn as a depressed jazz guitarist in
Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown.'' Of the five, only Crowe has
never been nominated, and this is Washington's fourth nod, making
him the Oscar's most nominated black actor.
</P>
<P>
   In the best-actress category, Meryl Streep achieves the other
milestone, tying Katharine Hepburn as the most-nominated actor in
the Academy's 72-year history. Her performance as a music teacher
in an underfunded Bronx school in ``Music of the Heart'' is her
12th. For her performance as a gender-bent teen in ``Boy's Don't
Cry,'' Hilary Swank received her first nomination, as did British
stage actress Janet McTeer, who played a lovelorn Southern mother
in ``Tumbleweeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bening, who plays ``American Beauty's'' tightly wound mother and
wife, and Julianne Moore as a romantic martyr with a secret in
``The End of the Affair,'' both scored their second nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In the supporting actor category, Tom Cruise received his third
nomination for his work as a sex guru in ``Magnolia,'' while past
winner Michael Caine was tapped for his work as a doctor in ``The
Cider House Rules.'' ``The Sixth Sense's'' 11-year old Haley Joel
Osment, Jude Law, who played a dilettante and the object of Matt
Damon's lust in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and Michael Clarke
Duncan, ``The Green Mile's'' gentle giant, complete the category,
each receiving their first nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, each of the five supporting actress nominees is an
Oscar first-timer. Toni Collette played a working mom of the
clairvoyant kid in ``The Sixth Sense.'' Golden-Globe winner
Angelina Jolie played a self-destructive mental patient in ``Girl,
Interrupted.'' Catherine Keener was the comic ice-queen in ``Being
John Malkovich.'' Samantha Morton played the mute girl Penn took
advantage of in ``Sweet and Lowdown.'' And in ``Boys Don't Cry,''
Chloe Sevigny played the karaoke singer who falls in love with the
cross-dressing Brandon Teena.
</P>
<P>

PANHANDLE COWBOY'S GRIT, INTEGRITY EARNED HONOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marshall Cator is a private man. At 97, he has lost much of his
hearing, and his eyesight has faded as well. Still, when it comes
time to brand cattle, he has no reluctance about climbing horseback
and working the herd.
</P>
<P>
   That resilience and determination is why the National Cowboy
Hall of Fame is honoring him with the Chester A. Reynolds Memorial
Award.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was a Kansas City businessman who founded the National
Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center in 1955, to
memorialize the American cowboy and the pioneers who settled the
West. Each year, the hall's board of directors honors one living
person who ``epitomizes the traditional western values of
integrity, self-sufficiency and leadership over a lifetime in the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   Cator seems abundantly qualified.
</P>
<P>
   The Panhandle cowboy was born in a sod house on Palo Duro Creek.
His father, Bert, and two of his uncles had camped along the creek
to hunt buffalo, and soon after decided to build a small trading
post.
</P>
<P>
   The family history is deeply engraved in the Texas Panhandle.
The New Handbook of Texas says the Cators were among the earliest
buffalo hunters in Kansas, killing nearly 7,000 buffalo between
July and September of 1873. Later in the year, they moved to the
Texas Panhandle, where they established a trading center at Adobe
Walls. They hunted buffalo for the next four years, but when the
herd was depleted, they shifted their interests to cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Cator joined his brothers in 1879 at the family compound
along Palo Duro Creek. The family called the three-room picket
house Zulu Stockade because they thought of it ``as wild as the
Zululand region of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cator boys were considered the first Anglo residents of the
Texas Panhandle, the handbook says. Bert Cator established himself
as a regarded stockman and horseman. He became sheriff of Hansford
County from 1893 to 1896 and then again from 1900 to 1909.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Marshall, was riding horses at the age of 3. By the
time Marshall was 11, his uncles were paying him to work their
cattle. Eventually, he ran his own spreads, leasing range on the
historic LX and XL ranches.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Cator never hired managers to run his ranches,
that he always worked alongside his hands and took personal
responsibility for the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a grand gentleman and I think the world of him,'' said
Western historian and entertainer Red Steagall, who will introduce
Cator at the April 1 award ceremony at the Cowboy Hall of Fame.
``He is extremely well respected; a kind, giving and caring
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Steagall said there are legions of stories about Cator's cowboy
abilities. One has to do with his ability with a rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's considered one of the best ropers in the Panhandle
branding pens,'' Steagall said. ``They say he once double-hocked
(roped by both back feet) 110 calves without missing a one.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the story about two Canadian bankers who went to
Cator's ranch to call in a note during the Depression. When they
saw him repairing the motor on a windmill in a gale force wind,
they returned to town and renewed his note, convinced that if
anyone could make it through those hard times, it would be Marshall
Cator.
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives say Cator is nonplused by all the
attention focused on him because of the award. ``He's a very
private person and he doesn't like all this attention,'' said Lynda
Haller of the Cowboy Hall of Fame. ``It took a long time to get him
to agree to come to the Hall of Fame to be recognized. Finally, he
said he would.''

   If past performance is any measure, there is no doubt that in
Senator Hillary Clinton, the people of New York would have a tough,
feisty and intelligent woman standing up for their interests. That
Hillary, though, must have slipped out of the back door of her new
home in Chappaqua, N.Y. The woman who stood in her raincoat and
sensible shoes by the front gate on moving day was but a
caricature. Surely she was an imposter. &QL;

   The Japanese economy is following in the footsteps of the Grand

now appears to be marching swiftly down again. Below the surface,
however, there are reasons to believe that it is, in fact, slowly

   In the darkest hours of the past year, Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso seemed to cling to the hope that by
grimly sticking to an unpopular austerity program, not only would
his country's economy return to growth but his own popularity and
authority would eventually recover from the disorderly devaluation
of January 1999. &QL;

<P>
   When it eventually came, the end was quick and anti-climactic.
As dawn broke on Feb. 6, nearly 2,700 unarmed federal police walked
into the main campus of the National Autonomous University in
Mexico City, and led away 745 students and staff still holed up
inside its buildings. Thus ended a 292-day student strike and
occupation of the biggest university in the Americas. &QL;

   ``Do you have any newspapers?'' Iraqi border guards ask
travellers arriving from Jordan. Like most of their countrymen,
they are anxious for any information, especially about Iraq itself,

Iraq has faded from the world's headlines, the pickings have been
thin. No news may be good news for Saddam Hussein, but it is a

hijacking promised to resolve the mystery of just why the plane was
seized in the first place. &QL;

   ``One almost believes the Internet was created for Reuters,''
said Peter Job, the company's chief executive, at a briefing for

much in common _ in fact, so much so that it is easy to imagine how
the Internet could replace Reuters. And that is the danger Reuters
is now moving very quickly to avoid. &QL;

&HT;     KOZMO, STARBUCKS LINK UP IN MARKETING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The on-line delivery service Kozmo.com is
teaming up with Starbucks Coffee Co. for cross marketing and
in-store promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this spring, Kozmo customers will be able to leave
videos and other delivery items in drop-boxes located in Starbucks
where the service operates. Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffee
retailer, will also help hype Kozmo as it enters new markets.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Kozmo delivers movies, books, magazines, CDs,
video games, and food. Starting this spring, the service also will
deliver Starbucks by the pound.
</P>
<P>
   For Kozmo, it gives the burgeoning company much-needed exposure.
So what does the seemingly ubiquitous coffee roaster get out of it?
How about $150 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all speaks to what most Internet companies are facing,
and that's the high cost of customer acquisition,'' said Howard
Schultz, Starbucks' chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet-to-door delivery service, which was started in
1997, operates in five markets but plans to expand to 20 by the end
of this year. The company opened in New York in January 1999,
followed by Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington, D.C.
The company plans to launch in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said he has been approached by other companies wanting
to establish a partnership with Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starbucks, 90 percent of its 10 million weekly
customer base use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've ever invited another brand or
company to live inside our stores,'' he said. ``It's very clear
Kozmo has resonated with their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet watchers, however, have questioned the economics of
spending the high cost of delivering primarily small ticket items.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Park, Kozmo's chief executive, said his business model
hinges on ``order density,'' or getting a large number of customers
to use the service regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lifestyle brand and we're looking for other products
or service our customers would want to use or purchase on a
frequent basis,'' he said. ``Coffee is probably one of the most
frequent purchases a customer makes.''

&HT;     BRADLEY PICKS THE WRONG TARGET ON ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On almost every issue of his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination, I wouldn't think of advising
Bill Bradley, let alone complain about a stand he took. Whether he
proves to be electable or not, Bradley most closely mirrors my
values and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   However ...
</P>
<P>
   Even though I know it's a lot of politicking on both sides, I'd
like to second Vice President Al Gore's recent request that Bradley
stop attacking him on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bill, get on the vice president for the Buddhist temple
contributions, for proposing a wimpy national health plan or even
for misrepresenting the impact of your health plan on AIDS
patients. But please, cease and desist with scolding Al for his
modified position on choice.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, 20 years ago, when the basically pro-choice Gore was in
Congress, he opposed federally funded abortions for poor women.
That was a nasty, sexist and classist thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, during that time, Gore also voted for an amendment
that labeled any fetus a ``living human being.'' That is the sort
of melodramatic, uninformed and over-simplified rhetoric that has
turned the complex and personal issue of abortion into a political
rugby match.
</P>
<P>
   However ...
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has changed his mind since that time. And,
once changed, he has been a great and consistent friend of the
pro-choice movement.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gore saw the light just because it's good, Democratic
politics. Maybe his wife and daughters sat him down and explained a
few realities of being female.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he looked around and got darned uncomfortable at the
company you keep when you deny poor women the choice to not bear a
child or insist upon equating conception with ``a living human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he just kept his ears and mind open and expanded his
compassion and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Gore is solidly pro-choice and has been for an
acceptable, credible period of time. The protectors of choice need
all the solid supporters we can find.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't need are two guys, already in our corner but
throwing rotten tomatoes at each other and wasting time playing
my-abortion-stance-is-bigger-than-yours.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore rightly declared last week in Los Angeles, ``I say to
Senator Bradley: Stop trying to divide us on the issue of choice.
It's time to fight the real enemy'' _ the Republicans and their
consistently anti-choice national platform plank.
</P>
<P>
   I say the same thing, Senator.
</P>
<P>
   Like you, I am interested in hearing about Gore's ``journey''
from wishy-washy to solid pro-choice. Like you, I believe that
``it's important when you make that kind of change on an issue of
such fundamental principle that you explain why you made that
change.''
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that Gore's answers could go a long way toward
bridging the gap for some folks who still struggle with ambivalence
around the abortion issue. After all, as the old belief holds,
there's no better evangelizer than the convert.
</P>
<P>
   However ...
</P>
<P>
   In the big scheme of things, with the two front-running
Republican candidates for president solidly and consistently in
opposition to abortion, Gore's pro-choice journey looms mighty
small.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Senator, I think more of you for being
unequivocally pro-choice throughout your career. Enlightened men
like you are a rarity and a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   For this, you get more points in my book than Gore gets. But you
don't get enough to make it worth your while to attack him over
abortion. Not when it's George W. Bush or _ even scarier because
he's so subtle _ John McCain who want to turn back the clock and
take away a woman's freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In short, sir, I respectfully suggest you knock it off. Now.
</P>

CELTICS ON THE ROAD TO RUIN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Joseph Smith and his hardy followers had no
trouble finding this place, but the same apparently cannot be said
for all members of the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   OK, most of them made it on time for the first practice
following the All-Star Game. But there is one very large Ukranian
who was unable to take part Monday because he overslept and missed
the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitaly (Potapenko) will be flying commercial,'' explained
coach Rick Pitino, and it goes without saying that it will be a
very costly affair in more ways than one for the Celtics' starting
center. A lighter wallet is the least of his worries, if you know
anything about the mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, with or without Potapenko, the Celtics have a
contractual obligation to play the Utah Jazz at Delta Center. It
will be a matchup of a very strong home team (20-4) against a
rather pathetic road team (4-19), and it is the start of a six-game
trip for the Celtics that has the distinct possibility of
eliminating them from serious playoff consideration. Already
situated in 10th place among Eastern Conference teams, the Celtics
could come home as low as 13th.
</P>
<P>
   The other foes on this trip are Golden State, Seattle, Portland,
Vancouver, and Los Angeles (Lakers). A sane person would forecast a
maximum of two victories, with one a more likely haul.
</P>
<P>
   That would change only if the Celtics suddenly acquire a little
religion at the defensive end of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team has to play better,'' surmises Pitino. ``We can
score with the best teams in the league, but we've got to stop
people at the 3, 4, and 5 spots (that's small forward, power
forward, and center, for the uninitiated). We're young and
physically immature, but, hopefully, that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of one particular young and quite physically
immature player, Pitino has only good things to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny Fortson is still on our team, and we're not going to
trade him just to trade him,'' said Pitino of the player whose
trade to Toronto was rescinded when the Raptors' Alvin Williams
flunked his physical. ``It was a situation where he wasn't happy
with his minutes, and his agent, who is a very good agent, was
trying to do what's best for his client. So it was either trade
him, or make a (financial) commitment, and we're not prepared to do
that. But right now, we'll stick with him and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   More personnel news: Eric Williams has been activated. Calbert
Cheaney (right knee tendinitis) is not with the team. Doug Overton
is on the injured list. Adrian Griffin, who was just getting over a
sprained ankle, did something to his right foot during practice and
his status is unclear for the Utah game.
</P>
<P>
   What's very clear, meanwhile, is that the Celtics will not be a
team of any stature in this league until they start winning some
road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is different,'' analyzed Pitino, ``and we haven't
been a good road team either year (25-64 in his three years), but
this year we've played most people tough, even though we haven't
come away with a lot of victories. We have to continue to stay
close and give ourselves a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Achieving that goal will be a formidable task. The Jazz have won
the last 14 games against the Celtics, and they have not lost to
any Celtic team here since the Big Three were still viable (a
107-99 triumph on Jan. 4, 1988). The Jazz will regard this game as
an appetizer prior to a main course visit from Sacramento Thursday.
You hate talking about the Celtics this way, but what choice does
anyone have? Face it: 4-19 is 4-19.

ON FSNE, VIEWERS WILL BE A PART OF THE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox Sports New England is on to something big. Next month, the
cable network will unveil the next level of television:
convergence.
</P>
<P>
   It means that fans will have a show dedicated to their thoughts,
feelings, and knowledge, all live in real time. Fox Sports, with
partner LiveWave.Com, a Newport, R.I.-based computer company, has
figured out a way for viewers to communicate visually with studio
analysts, producing the first true interactive show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new kind of television,'' said David Woodman, Fox
Sports general manager. ``It's never been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is one step beyond talk radio, and much better. For one
thing, participants are visible and not afforded the cloak of
anonymity as they are on talk radio. To be able to transmit their
images and comments, participants are required to have a web-cam
(about $70 at any computer store) and broadband service. Those
images are then shown live on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a producer will screen callers to maintain some sense
of sanity, but it will be real people providing real thoughts for
the audience. The show also will be able to receive e-mails. In
addition, Fox Sports Net has installed kiosks at Atlas and
Champions to allow patrons there to access the program live or file
a v-mail to be used at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
   Say Fox Sports has Dennis Eckersely in-studio as a guest.
Viewers at home or at one of the kiosks can then ask Eck questions
and receive answers via the television and Internet. ``It removes
the middleman,'' Woodman said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential is endless. Woodman said he already has planned
``issues-oriented'' programming that will include such hot-button
topics as criminal behavior among professional athletes. Woodman
said the March debut will feature Chris Wallace talking about the
NCAA basketball tournament. Fox Sports already has laid the
groundwork for regional sports coverage across the country. Fox
Sports New England plans to have its own regional sports news team
in place by June.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to increase viewers, and this cool technology is
certain to do that. The only downside is that MediaOne can't keep
up with the demand for its services. By the end of the year,
estimates suggest that only one out of 10 Internet users will be
hooked up with the broadband service where it's being offered..
That is expected to change with the expected purchase of MediaOne
by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just a gimmick,'' Woodman said. ``Every so
often, something comes along and upsets the applecart. This is it.
The fans, most of whom are extremely passionate and knowledgeable,
are all too often left out of the process. This technology gives
them a vital role.''

   Ratings for the NBA All-Star Game fell 35 percent from the last
game, played two years ago. The overnight numbers from 47 markets
had Sunday's game earning a 8.3 rating and 13 share; two years ago,
the game pulled a 12.7 rating and 20 share. There was no All-Star
Game last year because of the lockout. Part of the problem is that
the broadcast seemed to be one long infomercial for the NBA. The
NBC announcers seem to have no desire to provide any edge to its
coverage. Sideline reporter Ahmad Rashad was at a loss for
questions other than, ``Did you have any fun?'' . . . Sunday's best
sports story was Tiger Woods. Even with his streak being broken, he
managed to draw viewers. CBS pulled an 8.0 rating and 17 share for
its final-round coverage of the Buick Invitational, up 25 percent
from last year's final round. With the exception of Masters
telecasts, it was the highest-rated golf event since the 1987 US
Open. Even Saturday's third-round coverage was up 52 percent.

&HT;     PHOTOS MAY HELP DETECT EYE TUMORS IN INFANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Hospital name in 6thgraf is CQ)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kim Gaito wondered why she didn't notice the
signs earlier. Flipping through a photo album today, she can easily
spot the white reflection in her toddler's eye that was caused by a
rare and potentially fatal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so obvious now,'' said Gaito, who lives in suburban
Albany. ``Her eye looks like the flash went off in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it sounds strange, photos are actually one of the
earliest ways parents can detect these malignant eye tumors, known
as retinoblastoma.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer strikes at birth or during the first few years of a
child's life, and affects about 5,000 children worldwide. In the
United States, an estimated 350 children will be diagnosed this
year, usually by the time they are 2 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the earliest symptoms are often overlooked by parents who
assume they or their camera are to blame for the peculiar white
reflection in their photos. And most pediatricians and family
practitioners don't routinely screen for the cancer at well-child
visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of the children who get this in the year 2000
will die,'' said Dr. David Abramson, director of the Ophthalmology
Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital: University Hospital of
Columbia and Cornell. ``In Latin America, for example, only half
the children survive the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   For children born in the United States, the odds are much better
because of revolutionary strides in treatment over the past five
years, from lasers to chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But again, the key is early detection. ``Family practice
physicians and pediatricians need to be looking for an abnormal
pupil or abnormal light reflex,'' said Dr. George Stasior, an
Albany ophthalmologist working to raise awareness of the problem.
``We're asking the doctors to ask their parents if they notice
anything unusual and if they do, to bring in a photograph of their
child.''
</P>
<P>
   White reflections in photos, however, aren't the only clue
parents should be aware of.
</P>
<P>
   A child may have what looks like a cataract. Other symptoms
include a red, painful eye; poor vision; inflammation of tissue
around the eye or an enlarged or dilated pupil.
</P>
<P>
   The standard treatment for the condition has been to remove the
affected eye or eyes to prevent the spread of the cancer. About 75
percent of all cases will involve only one eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you have to get the parents to understand is,
you have to save the child's life; next you try to save the eye,''
Stasior said.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that although radiation may shrink the size
of the cancerous tumors, it poses special risks, especially for
children under one. Infants who have been treated with radiation
end up having a higher risk of other cancers later in life,
Abramson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaito's case, three doctors agreed that the best course of
treatment for her daughter was to have the eye removed. Haley, now
2 1/2, has been fitted with a prosthetic eye.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up with one eye isn't expected to be a problem,
Haley still needs frequent visits to specialists to make sure the
cancer hasn't returned or begun to grow behind the other eye. ``We
do have to worry about it coming back,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers aren't exactly sure why retinoblastoma
occurs, it is known to be associated with an abnormality on the
chromosome responsible for controlling retinal cell division.
</P>
<P>
   In children with retinoblastoma, retinal cell division becomes
unchecked, causing the growth of tumors. Although the disease may
sometimes be hereditary, the majority of retinoblastoma patients
have no history of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   As with many cancers, gene therapy holds promise for the future
treatment of retinoblastoma, Abramson said. Other potential
approaches include in-vitro fertilization for parents who carry the
abnormal gene to pre-select healthy zygotes.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next decade, Abramson also predicts progress will be
made in treating this condition before the baby is born.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, parents remain the best watchdogs for detecting
this cancer early.
</P>
<P>
   Gaito decided to get Haley's eye checked after consulting with a
neighbor, who confirmed her suspicions that something didn't look
right. Ironically, she had just taken her daughter in for her
2-year-old check-up, and the pediatrician didn't notice anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish someone had informed me, because maybe we could
have caught it earlier,'' Gaito said. ``This could have been very
serious if I hadn't done anything about it.''

   When the Indian uprising known as King Philip's War ended in
August 1676, with its leaders' heads impaled and stuck up over the
stockade in Plymouth, 25 of the colonists' settlements in southern
New England had been destroyed _ and the prewar native population
of 18,000 had been halved.
</P>
<P>
   The standard view of the conflict (espoused most notably by the
historian Douglas Leach in his 1958 ``Flintlock and Tomahawk: New
England in King Philip's War'') was that it was an ``inevitable''
frontier war, the precursor of the campaigns that would continue to
drive the native population further from the westward path of white
settlement. The strength of this view has been eroded somewhat by
recent scholarship, and now James D. Drake, a professor at
Metropolitan State College in Denver, has put forth a bold
interpretation: That far from being either ``inevitable'' or a
``frontier war,'' the 14-month-long conflict was a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-century since the landing at Plymouth, Drake writes,
``the Indians and the English became one society by virtue of their
shared social space and economy, as well as by their overlapping
legal and political systems.'' To support this thesis _ which
involves establishing the conditions necessary to define a civil
war _ Drake has assembled an imposing array of factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no rigid frontier separating the 60,000 English from
the 18,000 Indians,'' Drake writes. In fact, their settlements
``formed a honeycomb pattern that made frequent social contact
impossible to avoid.'' Indians were often employed as messengers
between English settlements. They were often required to serve in
local militias. They received money payments whenever they killed
wolves, just as did the colonists.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significantly, the Indians and the English were
trading partners, with the Indians supplying wampum that served as
the currency until the early 1660s, furs the colonists in turn
exported to England, and foodstuffs. And while the English placed
limitations on trade with Indians, Drake notes, ``many Indian
leaders stood to benefit from these restrictions and helped the
English to enforce them.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake also traces political linkages. The English colonies
required ``oaths of allegience'' from both colonists and Indians,
and ``the Indian fidelity oaths, like those sworn by the English,
explicitly emphasized the voluntary nature of submission.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors broke this ``coeval society'' apart, Drake
writes. Among them was an economic dislocation triggered by a
``wampum glut'' after English coins began to circulate in 1662,
causing the wampum-producing Indians to lose ``much of their
usefulness within the integrated Indian-English economy.'' At least
as important was the growing push of colonial settlements into
Indian lands _ the very factor that led Leach and other historians
to see the conflict as ``inevitable.'' What Drake notes, however,
is that in addition to the encroachment itself, ``a weakening
commitment on the part of English polities to do anything about it
undoubtedly altered many Indians' beliefs that the colonial system
offered a useful avenue to protect their political authority.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the incident that triggered the outbreak of war, the
execution at Plymouth of three of Philip's followers who had been
accused of killing a Christian Indian, Philip viewed it as an
example of a more favorable treatment of the ``praying Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   While relying more on ``impressionistic samples'' than on hard
data, Drake argues _ again convincingly _ that Indians ``played a
large role from beginning to end in supressing the rebellion.''
(While acknowledging the lack of firm figures, Drake cites examples
of colonial units that included large numbers of Indians _ in some
cases, outnumbering the colonials.) It may be evidence of a more
negative nature, but the treatment of Philip and other Indian
leaders after their defeat _ hanging, drawing and quartering, and
displaying their impaled heads _ was the traditional fate for
traitors, not for enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Attention to King Philip's War has grown in the past few years.
Drake's is the third major book on the conflict to appear in three
years, following ``In the Name of War,'' Jill Lepore's analysis of
how the war was (and is) perceived, and ``King Philip's War,'' a
site-by-site account by Eric B. Schultz and Michael J. Tougias.
Drake's contribution _ and it is a major one _ is to demonstrate
how the war ``destroyed an incarnation of New England'' as a unique
interdependent and interracial society.

TV THROUGH THE PHONE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: mPhase is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phone companies may be on the brink of matching the cable
companies with a powerful new competitive weapon: a system to
transmit television signals over plain old copper phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by a Norwalk, Conn., company called mPhase and
manufactured at Flextronics in Westford, such a system is being
tested in a North Georgia town by the local independent phone
company. A handful of homes, soon to be several hundred, are
getting TV signals over existing phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated filtering technology developed by Georgia
Tech researchers to keep phone calls, Internet traffic, and TV
signals separate, the mPhase ``Traverser'' system could radically
shift the balance of power in the epic battle under way between
traditional phone and cable giants.
</P>
<P>
   With 182 million copper phone lines in service across the United
States, it's easy to imagine the potential for a system that could
turn them into a cost-effective alternative for the nation's 30
million cable TV households and 10 million dish TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good product as far as I'm concerned,'' said Scott
Hardigree of Hartwell, Ga., who runs a firm that manufactures men's
trousers. He has picked up 35 channels over his phone line since
his home was made a test site in September. ``The TV part is as
good as my old cable, if not in some cases better.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, cable giants such as MediaOne Group
have been raiding the Baby Bells' turf, offering first high-speed
Internet access and, now, phone service over upgraded cable lines.
AT&AMP;T is gambling more than $120 billion on coverting cable systems
to challenge companies like Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and others have matched cable broadband with their
own digital subscriber line Net access service, showing that
75-year-old copper wires can in most instances be just as powerful
a broadband delivery medium as upgraded coaxial cable.
</P>
<P>
   But cost-effective ways to gain full parity and match the cable
companies in offering TV service in addition to Internet access
have been slow to develop. Several Baby Bell efforts in the early
1990s were costly fiascoes.
</P>
<P>
   Recently U S West has been trying out a service called VDSL in
Phoenix that delivers up to 120 channels of TV on phone lines. But
for now it closts the company $1,500 to $3,000 per home to install
the system and service is limited to areas within a few thousand
feet of the required phone company equipment. New Brunswick's
telephone company offers some customers a similar 100-channel
product from iMagicTV.
</P>
<P>
   Limited as it may be, analyst Jeffrey Kagan said of the US West
experiment: ``Keep your eye on this technology. It is what the
phone companies can hang their hat on to remain competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald A. Durando, mPhase chief executive, said he is confident
the Georgia trial _ set to expand from 20 users to more than 1,000
within two months _ will show that the company has found a solution
that cheaply delivers TV signals up to 2 1/2 miles from a phone
company's ``central offices,'' ultimately for well under $1,000 per
home.
</P>
<P>
   Flextronics' Westford, Mass. plant is making the set-top boxes
and central-office equipment for the system, which will be offered
nationwide this summer, with assistance from Carroll Design in
Lowell and Wrobel Engineering in Avon.
</P>
<P>
   The technology for separating television and DSL signals from
voice traffic is covered by five Georgia Tech patents. Adding
television to the mix is in essence a quality-control issue of
making sure you can send a lot of pictures and sounds to thousands
of people, all at exactly the same time, with nothing dropping out
and nothing bleeding into your phone call to Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Seen one way, mPhase is offering a way for phone companies to
take on the cable giants without building new wires. But many think
the truly huge market is offering something people know and want _
television service _ as a way to get into the home and offer them
something they don't yet know how much they want: broadband Net
access.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly the experience of Walter Gordon, a Hartwell
attorney who has the system in his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sold on it for TV. It's a very good signal, a very crisp
signal,'' Gordon said. But what he really raves about is the 1
megabit-per-second, always-on Net access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wow factor is just astounding, it's so blisteringly fast.
The TV is just like the icing on the cake.''

NET SECURITY FIRMS REAPING GAINS FROM ONLINE VANDALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's spate of online vandalism wasn't a disaster for one
group of Internet companies _ the ones that make hardware and
software systems to keep online companies safe.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the world's most popular Web sites, including the
Yahoo Web portal and the eBay Internet auction site, were knocked
offline for hours last week. An unknown vandal used software that
sent a stream of false messages to the Web sites. So many of these
messages were sent that they overwhelmed the sites, blocking
legitimate traffic.
</P>
<P>
   To fend off such attacks, Internet companies are taking a hard
look at computer software and hardware that can detect and block
attacks before they can do any damage. And the companies that
produce such products have pounced on the opportunity to tout their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investors bid up share prices of firms like Internet
Security Systems Inc. and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.,
which make scanning software to detect attacks. Even companies like
the data encryption firm Verisign Inc., whose products would have
done nothing to prevent last week's crisis, benefited from a surge
of interest in computer security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of security technologies to an infrastructure has
gone up very considerably,'' said Abner Germanow, an Internet
security researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller firms also moved to capitalize on the fiasco. In press
releases, media interviews, and announcements on their Web sites,
companies asserted that their products and services could have
averted the ``denial of service'' assault that shut down major
Internet sites like Yahoo, eBay, and ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new for us,'' said Irv Johnson, director of
technical marketing for Acton-based Arrowpoint Communications Inc.
``We've been talking about this for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson thinks last week's assaults could help win customers
for Arrowpoint's product, a data switch designed to block the kind
of attack used by the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones are sort of ringing off the hook,'' said Johnson.
``We do see this as a good thing, indirectly. . . . The fact that
these (attacks) have made an impact is going to make the industry
more diligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer security consultants at Boston's Zefer Corp. hope
to get a burst of new business from old customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from some of our clients,'' said Amine Mekkaoui,
vice president of Zefer's Internet security consultancy. ``We're
sending them out additional information about what they need to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mekkaoui said Zefer consultants will be ``going
back to our clients and telling them: `This is another example that
will confirm what we've told you before, about why you should be
addressing this issue.' It's more of a confirmation to them, and a
confirmation of our value to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Predictive Systems Inc., a New York consulting firm, vice
president of information security Steph Marr rejects the idea of
using the Internet attacks to scare his customers into paying for
new services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always hoping for an increase in business,'' Marr said.
``I would imagine that something of this nature would increase our
business. Am I actively going out and using fear as a selling
point? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marr urges his customers to see last week's incidents
as a shot across the bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to our client base and saying: `It's time to
address this issue and make sure this can't happen to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Predictive Systems may get an additional shot of publicity if it
helps authorities track down the culprits. The company specializes
in ``digital forensics,'' the detailed inspection of computer hard
drives to recover data even after it's been deleted. Marr has
offered his firm's help free of charge to the FBI and US Justice
Department to help crack the case.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bycoff, president of Netegrity Inc., says the Waltham,
Mass. firm has focused on protecting e-commerce Web sites from
those who want to break in and steal information, like credit card
numbers. While Bycoff knew about denial-of-service attacks, he
didn't see much interest from customers in being protected from
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been a focus,'' Bycoff said, ``because we all
guessed that the money was on the other side of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Bycoff expects plenty of interest in software for
fending off denial-of-service attacks, and he may add such a
product to the Netegrity line.

TAX CUT, MILITARY ISSUES RESOUND WEAKLY FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLISTON, S.C. _ Rivers Pharmacy's big green awning shades huge
plate-glass windows that look out on a sleepy Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, pine floors yellow with age run under displays of school
supplies, cosmetics, and notions to a back counter where Tommy
Rivers, pharmacist and mayor, presides over the town's pills and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, a dozen fans push heat down from two-story ceilings,
warming the knights of the long table, Williston's principal civic
forum, against a chilly South Carolina winter.
</P>
<P>
   Williston, population 3,300, is no holdover from an earlier
time. As in many South Carolina towns, industry long ago replaced
agriculture as the foundation of the economy here, and the people
who gather around the Formica-topped table these days to discuss
the Republican presidential race are factory workers, military
personnel, nuclear-plant employees, and retirees from professional
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Here and everywhere in this solidly Republican corner of the
state, George W. Bush and his backers are pushing major tax cuts
and more military spending, ideas that have served Republican
candidates well at least since the first election of Ronald Reagan
in 1980. To their dismay, they are not getting the answers that
they expect, answers Bush may need if he is to win here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There is still time for anything to happen, and some recent
polls show Bush's support strenghtening, but a buzz is rising, in
breakfast shops, in taverns, on the streets: McCain could win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters are rallying. ``Let's get on board now and
vote for a guy's gonna win,'' Frank Mizell, manager of First
Citizens Bank and active Bush enthusiast, implored one afternoon
last week. ``Vote for John McCain, you're throwing your vote
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Thomas, who used to truck nuclear waste from all over the
country to be buried in nearby Barnwell, demurred. ``I believe
McCain's going to take South Carolina,'' he said. ``I do too,''
chimed in Norman Folk, a grizzled 79-year-old whose hat advertised
a passion for bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman, wouldn't you like to have a tax refund?'' Mizell
asked, playing a card Bush and his strategists believe is one of
their most potent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Folk said firmly, eliciting a look of shock from the
banker. ``Somebody'd just figure a way to get it back from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Folk, and others around the table, almost all of whom plan to
vote in the Republican primary, said they were impressed with
McCain's promise to strengthen the Social Security system and pay
down the national debt, even though that would mean a smaller tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you Jesus for the Savannah River Site,'' cried the now
nearly frantic Mizell, turning their attention to the vast hunk of
Barnwell County where the federal government manufactures nuclear
weapons and employs 14,000 people _ down about 10,000 since the end
of the Cold War. ``I pray McCain doesn't think he can get in there
and do more for less.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the likely Republican voters around the table were not
buying Mizell's message.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ``knows what the military does, he knows where the money
goes,'' said Thurman Eichman, a retired submarine commander. ``I
trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of time for things to change before the
balloting, but right now, at least in this corner of the state,
there are echoes of McCain's surprisingly strong New Hampshire
victory in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the south, in Barnwell, David Cannon, cochairman of the
county Bush campaign, says with the same sort of complacency Bush
backers once had in New Hampshire, that the Texas governor's
activists here are not worried. ``It's kind of relaxed,'' he said.
``We're just keeping our connections going. I don't think Bush is
going to have a lot of problems with Barnwell County.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit to the north in Aiken, where Sen. Strom Thurmond maintains
a house and a reputation as a demigod, attorney Elmer Hatcher, an
intimate of the late Republican super-strategist Lee Atwater, said
he is still undecided and inactive, but predicted with beady-eyed
certainty that McCain will win the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more people at his events, and a lot more
excitement,'' Hatcher said. He also stressed that, while South
Carolina is solidly Republican now, its electorate also has a
populist character and a working class character much as it did
when the state was part of a solidly Democratic South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, the blue-collar workers voted in the Democratic
primary. Now they vote in the Republican primary,'' Hatcher said.
``They don't care so much what's good for the Republican Party.
They want someone who thinks like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, in conversations here, professional people in their
30s and 40s are the ones who seem most inclined to support Bush,
and almost invariably they cite a desire for the maximum possible
tax cut as the main reason. They also express admiration for Bush's
father and doubt about McCain's electability in a final election
showdown they presume will be with Vice President Al Gore, whom
they loathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the military end of McCain, the prisoner of war record,
but don't think he has a chance of winning the national election,''
said Monty Davis, 42, a mountain of a man who teaches physics and
chemistry at Williston-Elko High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what Bush stands for,'' Davis said as he wedged his
massive frame into a chair at the end of the long table in
Williston. ``He stands for what his father stands for. . . . I
don't like what McCain is going to do with the tax surplus. I do
like what Bush says.''
</P>
<P>
   Kia Valentine, 36, who's resigning from her job as a
language-arts teacher in the Barnwell schools so she can
home-school her own three daughters, said she is leaning strongly
toward Bush because he represents traditional values. She was
stumped for a moment when asked why she thought that about him,
then she said it was ``based on his father's views of education _
that more so than money, family and prayer will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard McCain say anything about family, and that is
my issue,'' Valentine said. ``Everything I know about George Bush
is based on his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road in Barnwell, the county seat, Michael Raley, 35,
who is the county tax collector and Republican Party treasurer,
said he has flipped back and forth a few times and now is ``leaning
toward Bush pretty strongly,'' mainly on the basis of the
governor's tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But, Raley said, he is seeing great interest in McCain among
younger people in the party, ``the people we usually would be
concerned might be drawn toward Democrats. McCain has captured
younger people who are not worried about a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, you're going from one extreme to the other from Clinton
to McCain,'' Raley said. ``George Bush sort of has a playboy image.
You see him on jet skis, snowmobiles, there's that possible drug
use _ people might tie that in with Clintonesque free-going, where
McCain is serious all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagery as conveyed in the candidates' paid advertising looms
much larger in people's minds here than it did in New Hampshire,
where many more people saw Bush and McCain in person. This is a
battle even staunch Bush loyalists said the governor is losing so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has run a slick commercial showing him returning from
the prisoner of war camp, that's what's really what's ringing
peoples' bell here,'' said Mizell, the Williston banker. ``I wish
Bush could be captured and held somewhere for a while. We could
turn this thing around quick.''
</P>
<P>
   In Barnwell, after viewing the latest campaign ads on a VCR at
the public library, Bush cochairman Cannon said his candidate would
win the war of attack ads which broke out last week, in part
because ``people I know, when we think of Bush, we put the whole
family together, and when you attack Bush it's like attacking his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed disappointment with the over-all quality the
Bush ads now blanketing the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see more of Bush's ads on TV,'' Cannon said, ``but I am not
impressed with them like I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus Christ!'' blurted head librarian Ellen Jenkins, who was
otherwise the epitome of a soft-spoken, primly groomed Southern
grandmother, on viewing a McCain ad likening Bush's alleged
untruthfulness to President Clinton's. A Bush supporter, Jenkins
remembers when the candidate's great-grandfather, George Herbert
Walker, owned a plantation here and walked the streets in jodhpurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ad is a negative for McCain, it's too much,'' she said.
But then she slipped into the near-reverie to which many South
Carolinians seem susceptible when they think about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have done that,'' she said, as the discussion
turned to ads highlighting McCain's prisoner-of-war experiences.
``It shows courage and strength, and that's important.''

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Prince Hassan is the man who would have been
king.
</P>
<P>
   It was one year ago that his brother, King Hussein, in the final
days of his battle with cancer, stunned the family and the world by
bypassing Hassan, who for 34 years served as crown prince and heir
to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Hussein, who reigned through a half century in Jordan,
announced that the crown would go to his oldest son, Abdullah. When
Hussein died on Feb. 7, 1999, it was a heart-wrenching and
tumultuous time for the family of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
and a doubly difficult time for Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   He lost the crown, but much more importantly, he said last week,
he lost an older brother who was like a father to him. The huge
media interest in the palace intrigue and his unceremonial sacking
as crown prince obscured just how hard the loss of his brother hit
Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview just two days after members of the Hashemite
family gathered at the late king's gravesite on a hillside
overlooking Amman to mark the anniversary of his death, Hassan
talked about his grieving and about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``To grieve the personal loss will take time, certainly,'' said
Hassan. ``It will take much time, but these are very private
matters. Even in a family with as prominent a public role as
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was 3 when 16-year-old Hussein had the crown thrust upon
him in 1952 after their grandfather, King Abdullah I, was
assassinated in Jerusalem. Their father, Talal, was mentally ill
and considered unfit for the throne. Hassan always looked up to his
brother, and was in many ways raised by him.
</P>
<P>
   How did Hassan feel after that brother transferred his claim to
the crown to Hussein's 38-year-old son, now King Abdullah II? Well,
he said, he is loyal to whatever decision his brother made, and he
had learned from his brother not to feel sorry for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was privileged to work with him and alongside him in the
Hashemite tradition of rising above adversity for many, many years
of our public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly his loss was untimely,'' continued Hassan, perched on
a stool in front of a crackling fire in his palace. ``But as we
have always believed, you get on with life.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting on with life has meant making sure that the turmoil at
the time of Hussein's death did not rupture the unity of the
family.
</P>
<P>
   And, Hassan said, it means continuing his own interests in human
rights issues and particularly in interfaith dialogue, a passion
which takes him all over the world trying to find common ground
among what he calls ``the Abrahamic faiths of Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more than just an academic interest, for Hassan believes
interfaith dialogue can be the bridge to lasting peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move toward, in the terminology of the peace process, to
what we call permanent status,'' said Hassan, referring to this
fall's pending deadline for a final peace between the Palestinians
and Israelis, ``that permanence will be enhanced or diminished by
the presence of interreligious dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's depth of knowledge of religion and history informs his
views of the political workings of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to him say he has had to find a way to offer this
experience and expertise to the young King Abdullah while at the
same time allow the new king to make his own mark.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges that lie ahead for Jordan are daunting: a 25
percent unemployment rate, $7 billion in external debts, and nearly
one-third of its 5 million people living below the poverty line.
Palace observers said Abdullah would do well to listen to his
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have remained close despite regular suggestions to
the contrary in the media. They meet for lunch regularly, sources
said, whenever Hassan is home from his frequent trips.
</P>
<P>
   He travels almost incessantly, and last week was preparing to
travel to Indonesia for a meeting of the World Council on Religion
and Peace. Every time he leaves his home he writes the same prayer
in ink on a wall near the front door: ``The God who delivered you
the Koran will also return you home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Princess Rahma, remarked at the scores of lines of
the prayer on the wall and said that every few months the spot must
be repainted to give Hassan a fresh canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan smoked a small Davidoff cigar and punctuated his
discussion of sometimes abstruse theories with a boisterous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He said his daughter had given him a card recently to help him
emerge from the shadow of sadness, and perhaps a bit of self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``bad Samaritan card,'' he said, adding, ``The message
was, `Stop complaining and get on with your life,' '' his laughter
rising and the cigar smoke billowing.

ARMSTRONG SAYS THANKS, BUT NOT NECESSARILY GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bomb dropped Thursday. After 13 seasons with the Patriots,
offensive lineman Bruce Armstrong _ a six-time Pro Bowler _ was
abruptly released.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about unceremonious. This event was a stunner. There was no
Yazlike farewell tour, no Ray Bourqueish speculation about the
final days of a star performer. The dumping of Armstrong was
handled with all the fanfare of a trip to the cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   The cold chore apparently was a small part of new coach Bill
Belichick's Feb. 10 ``to-do'' list: (itals)Hmmmm, let's see, order
cable for the new house, get a Massachusetts inspection sticker for
the Mercedes, mail an old playbook to Bill Parcells, lunch with
Robert and Jonathan, check tax assessments on the Nantucket
properties, release Armstrong, get a haircut, watch film of Tebucky
Jones, dinner with Robert and Jonathan, more Tebucky film til
11.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it goes in football today. The salary cap rules
and highly paid old guys are dismissed to make room for young stars
coming into their primes. Armstrong understands, but he wanted to
thank the fans of New England and let them know he may still be
back with the Patriots. And he wanted to explain that he wasn't
angry or bitter _ not anymore. So he called his own press
conference at the downtown Westin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a lot of money and being over 30 in this league is not
a good thing,'' the veteran explained. ``Is it wrong? It's not
wrong. But that's the way it is now. Still, I know I'm the best
lineman we got on the football team. They say they want to make us
a better team, well, how does it make the team better if I'm not on
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong walked into a third-floor function room with the aid
of crutches. He recently had knee surgery, a procedure he needed at
midseason but postponed until the end of the year for the good of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to explain that he never told the Patriots to ``shove
it,'' after they offered him $2 million for 2000 and another $2
million for 2001. His old contract called for $3.6 million in 2000
and $3.5 million in 2001, but the Patriots asked him to take the
massive cut so they'd have salary cap room to pay Lawyer Milloy $35
million and keep the likes of Tedy Bruschi. According to Armstrong,
he was told to take it or leave it. He chose to see whether there
was a better deal out there but claims both sides agreed to revisit
the deal if other teams won't do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the business,'' said the 34-year-old veteran.
``I'm not upset, I'm not angry, not anymore. I understand how this
thing works. And I was told if I can't make it work elsewhere,
maybe we can get something done here. If this is the best deal, I
can play here, so right now I'm kind of in a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't play somewhere else out of spite. Everyone wants to
feel wanted, and when you have something like this happen, you
don't feel wanted. But once you get past the emotional part . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be over the emotional part. Armstrong was candid,
realistic, mature, and professional as he discussed his situation.
He did want to clear up one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have read that I was unwilling to take a pay cut,'' he said.
``I didn't want to take a pay cut, but I was willing to do some
things. Everybody has an opinion about it. Someone said I wasn't
smart. I like to think everything I do is a smart move. But there
was no negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   He wore all black, which made him appear relatively trim. He
wore an Adidas ballcap and shirt. He had a giant sparkling rock in
his left earlobe and a gold watch on his left wrist. His crutches
leaned against the wall behind him while he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to spend my whole career in New England _ maybe even a
season or two in the new stadium _ and win a championship here,''
he said. ``I've had a lot of recognition around here and I
appreciate it. I hope it's not over, but realistically it could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unhappy with the way the thing played out, but I'm not
blaming anybody and I'm not blaming the system. The system in place
has made me a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you vilify? I'm not mad at Bill Belichick. I've never
played a down for him. He comes in and looks at a sheet. I'm not
mad at Andy Wasynczuk. He's an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing football. I really do. You have to understand
the dollars and cents, but you still have to be passionate on the
field. Now guys who've played the game 10-12-14 years are being
released. It's canging and you either adapt or you have to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted this opportunity to say `thank you' to the fans
of New England. I wanted to take out a full-page ad in the papers
until I found out how much they cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this place, they want players who play hard and don't whine
a lot, and I feel I did that. I played the game the way it supposed
to be played and I always felt they appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans appreciated Armstrong, but they understand the business.
And they hope he's back with the Patriots next year.
</P>
<P>
   He is, after all, still their best offensive lineman.

EX-BEAR SIGNS WITH THE PATRIOTS; ALLEN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots aren't exactly taking the free
agent market by storm, but they did address a backup situation
Monday by signing running back Raymont Harris and cutting veteran
Terry Allen, the starter last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also appear to be on the verge of releasing running
back Lamont Warren, with Derrick Cullors due to return after
missing the season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots plan to negotiate this week with wide receiver Troy
Brown, who is scheduled to visit Kansas City Tuesday. Defensive
lineman Chris Sullivan spent the day in Cleveland and will visit
the Steelers Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Patriots have begun courting
Pittsburgh defensive end Nolan Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Harris came in for a tryout last season but wasn't signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymont is a tackle-to-tackle, tough runner,'' said Patriots
coach Bill Belichick. ``He's always moving forward. I think he'll
bring a physical presence to the running game. I'm excited about
having him on the team. He's a dedicated, hard-working guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren's days might be numbered because Belichick said he
envisioned Kevin Faulk ``as closer to David Meggett than Joe
Morris. I know that that's asking a lot of a player of his
stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren's cap number for 2000 stands to be $766,400; the Patriots
would be hit for only $240,000 if they cut him. The Patriots took
only a $50,000 hit against the cap by letting Allen go.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick called Brown ``one of the most important people to us
in terms of being able to negotiate with him and work something
out, but there are other players we're talking with as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he's very interested in re-signing linebacker
Tedy Bruschi, whom he spoke to over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tedy was just learning the position when he got here in '96,''
said Belichick, ``but I've seen him grow and develop into a good
football player and an all-around football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he'd still like to have Bruce Armstrong and Ben
Coates back at reduced rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's a better chance that it would work out
with Bruce at this point than it looks like it would be with Ben,''
said the coach. ``But sometimes things change, sometimes they
change in a hurry, and again I'm not shutting the door on
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Pioli, the assistant player personnel director, began work
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to Cleveland and with New York,'' said Belichick,
``he's done a real good job of helping define those type of
players, the players who are lower-profile and maybe have lower
salaries and go on to be productive players, in those two
organizations and also when he was with Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick continued to heap high praise on Bobby Grier, the vice
president for player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience working with Bobby came in the '96 draft, and
that was a very positive one,'' said Belichick. ``That was a
tremendous draft. I thought it was extremely well-organized. I
thought the players were placed generally in the right locations
and the way that the draft room was managed on those two days with
Robert (Kraft), Bobby, and Bill (Parcells), it was probably as good
a draft as any I've ever been associated with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just saying the players that came in, but just the
whole management of it. The maneuvering of the trades, the draft
picks, even a couple of the agreements with the players during the
draft. It was a very impressive day just being part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he'll try to duplicate the way the organization
was run in 1996, when he was an assistant to Parcells here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot more comfortable than I did a couple of weeks
ago,'' he said. ``I have a much better feeling from working with
everybody that I have a better understanding of where we are and
those people have a better understanding of my philosophy about
where I feel we need to go and things we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick still must hire another coach or two, including a
defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots allocated receiver Sean Morey and linebacker Marc
Megna to NFL Europe and allocated linemen Noel Scarlett and Garrett
Johnson to the NFL Europe draft pool. Michael Bishop will not play
in Europe, as the Patriots have decided he'd be best served working
here in Foxborough.

OSCAR NOMINATIONS REWARD QUIRKY FILMS, UNFAMILIAR FACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Who are those guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Like Paul Newman in ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' that
was what millions of Americans were asking Tuesday in the wake of
the early-morning announcement of this year's Academy Award
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank? Jude Law? Janet McTeer? Richard Farnsworth? Chloe
Sevigny?
</P>
<P>
   For many rank-and-file moviegoers, this year's slate of
candidates must seem like a very large herd of dark horses.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the wildly popular ghost yarn ``The Sixth
Sense'' (six nominations, including a Best Supporting Actor nod for
young Haley Joel Osment) and ``The Green Mile'' (four nominations),
this year's honorees don't register on the radar of mainstream
audiences. Half of the acting nominees appeared in films that
failed to make a significant dent in the box office (for example,
``The Insider'' and ``The Straight Story'') or appealed mostly to
the art-house crowd (``Sweet and Lowdown,'' ``Being John
Malkovich,'' ``Magnolia'') _ or haven't yet opened in most of the
United States (``Boys Don't Cry'' and ``Tumbleweeds'').
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' a satiric-yet-transcendent look at a
suburban family, led the pack with eight nominations _ Best
Picture, Best Actor (Kevin Spacey), Best Actress (Annette Bening),
Best Director (Sam Mendes), Best Original Screenplay, Best
Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Original Score.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while ``Beauty'' was the critics' darling and won a slew of
early awards, it was too unconventional, bleak and unsettling for
many middle-of-the-road viewers. It wasn't exactly user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, popularity carries only limited clout at Oscar time.
There were only three technical nominations for 1999's monster hit,
the ``Star Wars'' prequel ``The Phantom Menace'' (it grossed $430
million in this country); none for ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me'' ($205 million at the box office); and four technical
nominations for ``The Matrix'' ($171 million).
</P>
<P>
   What's more, several familiar names once regarded as contenders
_ Tom Hanks for ``The Green Mile,'' Jim Carrey for ``Man in the
Moon,'' Matt Damon for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''_ failed to make
the cut, further limiting the number of familiar faces up for
honors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous years in which the Oscar contest was posed as a
battle between independent cinema and studio product, this time
around the fight seems to be between the familiar and the unknown.
And at this stage the unknowns rule _ the gap between what the
public wants to see and what Hollywood regards as Oscar-worthy has
grown from a crack to a canyon.
</P>
<P>
   There are several races to watch in the weeks leading up to the
March 26 Academy Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Will front-runner Denzel Washington, nominated for his turn as
boxer Rubin Carter in ``The Hurricane,'' see his lead eroded by
growing criticism that the film plays fast and loose with the facts
of Carter's case? (Perhaps it's an omen that ``The Hurricane''
wasn't nominated for Best Picture.)
</P>
<P>
   Will ``The Cider House Rules,'' with its Dickensian plotting,
brave little orphans and unabashed emotionalism, pull even with
early leader ``American Beauty''? It certainly would seem more
palatable for older Oscar voters. (``Cider House'' won seven
nominations, including a largely unexpected Best Picture slot and a
Best Supporting Actor nod for veteran Michael Caine.)
</P>
<P>
   Will ``The Insider,'' a piercing look at journalism and the
tobacco industry, be able to parlay its seven nominations into new
life at the multiplex? (Despite rave notices, audiences simply
haven't been interested; the film's $27 million domestic gross is
but a third of what it cost to make and market).
</P>
<P>
   Will nominations for Hilary Swank (extraordinary as a woman
posing as a man in ``Boys Don't Cry'') and British stage actress
Janet McTeer (overwhelmingly convincing as a blowsy Southern gal in
``Tumbleweeds'') launch those films when they finally get to a
local theater? (``Boys Don't Cry'' opens Friday at the Fine Arts
Theatre; ``Tumbleweeds'' is scheduled to open in Kansas City
theaters March 3.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, most of us who hope to be Oscar literate by the
time of the awards ceremony have a lot of catching up to do.

MONDALE RECALLS N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS -- ``For me, it was liberating,'' says the only
person alive who has been through what George W. Bush is going
through.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after a maverick named Gary Hart rattled the
foundation of Walter Mondale's front-runnership, the man who
survived a New Hampshire earthquake says the memories are not of
fury or panic but of a huge burden being lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was an enormous relief,'' he says today, deservedly
secure in his reputation not simply as the guy buried in Ronald
Reagan's 49-state landlside reelection in 1984, but as a
distinguished public servant whose decency and integrity remain his
defining characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of regrets about what I had wasted in all those
months leading up to the New Hampshire election,'' Mondale recalled
last week. ``But there were no regrets at all about suddenly facing
odds that were a good deal less than 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   No parallel is exact, but 1984-2000 comes close. But Mondale as
the true Comeback Kid is more understanding. He makes two important
points:
</P>
<P>
   --The first occasion when voters nationally allow a result in
one state to influence their attitudes is not the Iowa caucuses but
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to me much faster than it's happened to Bush,''
Mondale said, ``but the basic point is that the primary might as
well be occuring in living rooms all over the country. People
really don't know the candidates at this point and they really pay
attention to what the verdict in New Hampshire has been. In my
case, I had 40-point leads over Hart all over the country that
disappeared almost overnight; it's been slower in Bush's case, but
it is the same process at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tried denial: New Hampshire is quirky; too many
independents clouding the picture; he's still in command
nationally. The fact is he's no better than 50-50 going into the
final days of the pivotal campaign in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Mondale behaved totally differently. I remember interviewing him
the day after the New Hampshire primary on the way to Georgia,
listening as he minced no words in recognizing what had just
happened. The day after that, he called in a bunch of us who were
covering his campaign to announce the end of his front-runner
status, to say the message from New Hampshire was national and that
he had heard it.
</P>
<P>
   --Knocking a presumed nominee off his high horse is fun, if only
for the chaotic, anarchic mess it produces. But there is also
genuine curiosity about how the former front-runner will respond to
the sudden onset of candidacy-threatening adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense I had right off the bat,'' Mondale said, ``is that
people want to see a kind of vulnerability in a politician, the
kind where his dependence on the voters is clear, where none of the
trappings of protection really work. I don't think at this point
that Bush is showing any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from it. The Bush response has been very much like his
father's response to severe embarrassment in the Iowa caucuses in
1988 at the hands of Pat Robertson and Bob Dole: Get the knives and
party steamroller out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father won in New Hampshire after his Iowa fiasco
essentially by cheating. He really did lie about Bob Dole's record,
claiming he was some kind of wild Washingtonian tax-increaser. And
he used a muscular local supporter, then-Governor John Sununu, to
get a late attack advertisement onto New Hampshire television over
the final weekend when Dole had no opportunity to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Those tactics, however, occurred in the aftermath of Iowa,
toward which the country has a more nuanced, ambivalent reaction
precisely because it is an event built around organized meetings of
party activists. They worked in New Hampshire, where there is no
respect at all for Iowa's winners, whereupon Dole's campaign fell
apart nationally.
</P>
<P>
   If Mondale's analysis is correct, Bush's son is playing with
fire by treating his quite different New Hampshire experience as an
aberration instead of as a wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   Mondale eventually prevailed over Hart because he recognized the
challenge his candidacy posed and because he had 20 years of
involvement in national affairs to draw on as he fought back.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast today is stark. Bush is denying anything more than
token legitimacy to John McCain's insurgency, and without a
personal reservoir of support to draw on, he is betting that his
institutional backing can crush the challenger for him. He may be
right, but Bush has no safety net under him if he's wrong.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The dirty secret about all the women

roughly 12 hours a week less on housework in 1995 than they did in
1965. If nobody cares any more, why does Hillary Clinton feel

IF KUMQUATS BE THE FOOD OF LOVE ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Valentine's Day inspires dread in many, but food editors may
suffer most of all. Not only do they have to come up with creative
ways to recycle old stories _ a burden they share with many
journalists _ but every year brings a blizzard of promotional
literature touting the latest ``aphrodisiac'' delicacy. (This
year's pitch was for _ no joke _ kumquats.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we shouldn't blame the poor copywriters, but you'd think
they might have noticed, over all these years, that the concept
itself has some serious problems. An aphrodisiac, after all, is
merely a substance that excites sexual desire. What could be more
tasteless and pathetic _ for Valentine's Day or any other day _
than plotting ways to drug one's beloved into compliance?
</P>
<P>
   Literature tends to rely on the slightly more sophisticated
``love potion,'' whose magic inspires devotion, not mere lust _ and
thus a more complicated plot line than an aphrodisiac could set in
motion. Love potions can generate tragedy, as in Tristan and
Isolde's case, or comedy, as in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and
Donizetti's ``Elixir of Love.'' But most love potions (the pop
song's ``No. 9'' is an exception) are long-acting agents, not aids
for one-night stands.
</P>
<P>
   No one would deny that food can be a sensual pleasure (and I'm
not talking about ``American Pie''). But the connection with sex
has always been more sizzle than steak, more placebo than
pharmacology. M. F. K. Fisher goes at the subject in her ``Alphabet
for Gourmets,'' under ``W is for Wanton,'' but even the great food
writer must concede that gastronomy runs a distant second to true
desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two people wish, hope, plan, to be together, they need have
no fear of what they must eat first, and indeed no interest in
it,'' she writes. ``If the other hunger be urgent and strong
enough, they are . . . impervious to the throes of postprandial
digestion.'' Fisher is much more creative when it comes to quelling
lust, offering an anti-aphrodisiac meal that starts with too many
martinis, moves on to meat and red wine, and ends with rum-soaked
figs.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Aphrodite, were she still a goddess on Olympus, would find
it quite a comedown to see her name transformed into a date-rape
drug. And Venus, her Roman counterpart, may have it even worse _
she shows up most often these days in venereal disease. But
seduction has always been a guy's game, in mythology if not
reality.
</P>
<P>
   There's Don Juan, the legendary Spanish nobleman, who certainly
has all the best lines: Moliere, Mozart, Byron, and Shaw, among
others, have immortalized the devil-defying rake. Lothario, a
character in a couple of early English plays, had somewhat less
staying power; he's shrunk to a mere type, and been lowercased in
some dictionaries. Casanova was real _ an 18th-century adventurer
whose memoirs fill 12 (well-received) volumes _ but his alleged
conquests numbered only 122 or so, far behind Don Giovanni's
claimed mille e tre (not to mention Wilt Chamberlain's tally). Poor
Romeo, who's often included on the list, doesn't really belong _ he
died of excess devotion far too young to become a serial seducer.
</P>
<P>
   There's no good female counterpart to these eponyms, or to other
words for lady-killers. When William Safire sent out the call to
readers 13 years ago, they voted for man-eater _ which sounds even
worse now than it did then. (Safire concluded that women as well as
men can philander _ the original Greek word, in fact, referred to a
woman's love for a man. But the connotations of cheating seem to be
overtaking the earlier meaning of flirting, playing the field;
philanderer may have missed its chance at becoming a unisex term.)
</P>
<P>
   The women who make names for themselves in the
seduction-and-betrayal line _ Mata Hari, Jezebel, Delilah _ tend to
have done something really memorable on the betrayal side of the
equation, not merely carved a lot of notches into their belts. Of
course, that's because men have a reputation for being easy; to get
credit as a femme fatale _ and there have been some _ a woman has
to not only bed them but practically enslave them.
</P>
<P>
   Even among men, it seems, not everyone has equal access to the
seducer's hall of fame. In a London newspaper a couple of years
ago, a reader wondered why all the famous rakes were Spanish or
Italian. ``Have there not been English philanderers of fame?'' he
asked. ``Did not Lord Byron acquire a reputation as a supreme
seducer? Why do we not say of someone that he is a `real Byron'?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be that it all started in Italy, the home of both
St. Valentines (or Sts. Valentine). And what they would make of the
press releases being issued in their name, heaven only knows.

   REGIONAL-JETS (Undated) _ Many airline passengers go out of
their way to avoid flying a turboprop plane. Those passengers may
soon discovering they have more choices, as the battle to attract
more customers from smaller markets has become so intense that
airlines are now scrambling to replace their turboprop planes with
jets. Virtually every major carrier is now stocking its fleet with
regional jets. Jets, in addition to being more popular than
turboprops, are cheaper to operate on long routes. If regional jets
appear to be a panacea for airlines, they do come with a few
strings attached. Pilots unions are fearful of them. Consumers may
also be in for a few inconveniences. The airlines would like to be
able to swap bigger planes for smaller, regional jets, at the last

   MANAGEMENT-COLUMN (Undated) _ They were in high school or
college when the great wave of layoffs swept corporate America in
the late 1980s and early '90s. And while they heard stories about
neighbors who had lost their jobs, they didn't give them much
thought. Now, many of these 20-somethings are managers, and holding
onto employees, not letting them go, is their main concern. The
trouble is, when pink slips do have to be delivered, these
Generation X'ers are often the ones who have to deliver them. It
ties their stomachs up in knots. Of course, managers have always
had to ax underlings when their performance lagged or the company's
profits sagged. But not so long ago, the bearer of bad tidings was
usually an old pro at the task, or at least old enough to know how
to cope with the emotional turmoil of performing it. Today,
increasingly, the dirty work is done by a 20-something for whom
management has mostly meant recruiting employees with stock
options. By Charles Butler.

&HT;     OLD FRIENDS FIND LOVE BLOSSOMS AT A RIPE AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On the path of aging, marked by broken bones,
loneliness and loss, Grace Opey and Buddy Russell also have found
love, expressed in a sweet courtship of tea, a pat of the hand,
bingo and, now, an engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   Opey, 80, shows off that diamond ring as a young woman would.
When she and Russell hold hands, the bend and gnarl of their
intertwined fingers make the gesture all the more poignant.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence ``Buddy'' Russell, 84, breaks from a matter-of-fact
retelling of the relationship to offer his own ode to love. ``Love
blooms eternal in everybody's breast. Sometimes, when you least
expect it, the right one is there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Opey and Russell have known each other for 17 years,
meeting when their spouses, John and Peggy, were alive. The four
attended bingo at the Louise Corning Center, where Russell calls
the bingo numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The couple exudes a certain, well, youth. Opey wears her hair in
a girlish pageboy, and Russell, in his simple blue suit, possesses
a polish probably not far removed from his days as an Internal
Revenue Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   Opey was the first to lose her spouse, Jack, an accountant who
died six years ago. In her single days Opey was an office worker,
but then worked at home during her long marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy and Peggy Russell noted that Grace was alone and in need
of some help; since badly breaking her right leg three years ago,
Opey has relied mostly on a wheelchair for mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I noticed that and got good friends (with Opey).
We used to take her home nights. Of course, Peg was glad to do that
and liked Grace a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Peggy Russell died of congestive heart
failure, just short of her 100th year.
</P>
<P>
   As her health failed, she spent her last five months at Eden
Park nursing home, where her husband spent 12 hours a day with his
wife of 25 years. Her death left him depressed, but he did take his
doctor's advice to socialize. He returned to the Louise Corning
Center.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship resumed, but began to shift. Grace invited
Buddy in to tea. By the way she patted his hand, or glanced at him,
Russell wondered if the friendship had deepened.
</P>
<P>
   Both, however, continued to think of their late spouses. Grace
had known John since she was 8. A decade older, he had always said
he'd wait until she grew up to marry her. They were married 50
years and four months when he died. And, as Russell nudged his new
relationship along, he worried about what people might think and
suffered a measure of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   He also felt the press of time. He reasoned, ``Everybody sees
these wonderful things in this girl. ... If I don't make tracks
with her, I thought I might lose her. Some guy might come along,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What generated the love affair was a friendship,'' said
Russell, who loved what everybody loves about Grace Opey: her
boundless kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he knew Opey still thought about John, and he still
mourns Peggy, ``I thought maybe someday I could make a little niche
in her heart.'' Six months ago, she told him that she did indeed
care for him.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 23, the couple dined at a restaurant, where Russell
surprised her with the engagement ring. They had their picture
taken in front of the Christmas tree. ``I was so excited when he
gave me the ring, I couldn't eat my dinner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They have not set a date. ``Well, I think the world of him. I
love him, but I don't know when this is going to come off. There
are too many things we have to settle,'' Opey said. They both have
their own homes. Russell wants a customary period of mourning. ``I
need to go through a period of time. You don't go from one wedding
to another in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have developed lovely habits. There are the
evenings, watching classic movies together. Buddy always leaves by
10 p.m. then dials Grace's telephone number and lets it ring once.
``Then I know he's home safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not worry, they will not wait too long, said Russell. ``As
you get older, you don't want to wait forever, because forever may
never come, or it may come all of a sudden.''

BOTSWANA COMES TO GRIPS WITH AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some regions of the southern African nation of Botswana, half
of all pregnant women carry the human immunodeficiency virus. So
health officials were disheartened recently when most women refused
drug treatment known to minimize the transmission of HIV to their
unborn babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was something most women would welcome,'' said Dr.
Howard Moffat, one of Botswana's leading physicians. ``But fewer
than 50 percent of women actually accept the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are complex, Moffat said last week in a telephone
interview. But one is an overwhelming fatalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they themselves are infected and their lifespan is going
to be quite restricted _ and they don't know who is going to care
for their children _ there is a feeling amongst some women that,
`We might as well both go together,' '' Moffat said.
</P>
<P>
   Their attitude is understandable. Botswana shares with nearby
Zimbabwe and Malawi the distinction of having the world's highest
AIDS-virus infection rates _ about one adult in every four. But
only about 200 people in a population of 1.5 million have access to
the kinds of antiviral drugs that are extending lives in wealthy
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Despair about that inequity, as much as the virus itself, is the
target of a state-of-the-art virology laboratory in Gabarone,
Botswana's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is being launched with a $4.9 million AIDS grant
from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., among the first of a $100 million
grant to Botswana and four other hard-hit African countries.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred million dollars is just a drop in the ocean of
AIDS-related needs in Africa _ and only one-tenth of 1 percent of
Bristol-Myers Squibb's revenues over the five-year grant period.
But AIDS experts in Botswana and Boston say the new lab has a
significance beyond its dollar value. African-based HIV science,
they say, is a necessary antidote to the ``what's-the-use?''
attitude that afflicts Botswanian mothers-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, the Gabarone virology lab is the vanguard of a
gargantuan effort, just beginning, to bring AIDS drugs for
prevention and treatment _ and ultimately an effective AIDS
vaccine, researchers hope _ to ground zero of the world AIDS
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the new lab will greatly expand Botswana's ability
to determine who, and how many, are HIV-infected. Most of them
currently don't know, but as effective drugs become available
against HIV and associated infections, especially tuberculosis, it
will be vital to find out who is infected. The nation's main blood
bank can run 100 to 200 HIV blood tests a month. With the new lab,
``we can run those in a day,'' says Dr. Richard Marlink, director
of the Harvard AIDS Institute, which is collaborating with
Botswanian scientists on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The new facility would have little significance, however, if its
purpose was merely to diagnose HIV infection. Far more important,
the lab is the first in the world built specifically to investigate
an HIV subtype known as 1C, or clade C _ the type now responsible,
Harvard scientists say, for more than half the world's AIDS-virus
infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just the past few years, subtype C has spread like wildfire
throughout southern Africa, up East Africa to the horn and on to
India,'' Marlink says. ``It infects more individuals worldwide than
all the other HIV subtypes put together.''
</P>
<P>
   For such an important scourge, amazingly little is known about
HIV-1C, for the simple reason that nearly all AIDS research until
now has focussed on HIV-1B, the subtype responsible for nearly all
the infections in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Why has clade C spread so fast in East Africa, apparently
out-competing other HIV subtypes already established there? No one
knows, and little research is being done to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Does HIV-1C respond to treatments the same way as subtype B?
Will its apparently revved-up mutation rate produce drug-evading
resistance more quickly? Scientists have just started trying to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important in the long run, will vaccines being
developed against the HIV-1B prevalent in the northern hemisphere
work against clade C, the scourge of the south? Public health
officials will never know if scientists don't learn how different
the clade C virus is, immunologically speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Max Essex, a Harvard AIDS researcher, is convinced that the
clade C virus is more easily transmitted from mother to child and
through heterosexual intercourse than other HIV subtypes. He thinks
it may also be more virulent, leading to more rapid disease
progression and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The epidemic of HIV-1C that is blazing across southern Africa
today is infecting a much larger fraction of local populations than
are other subtypes in other regions,'' Essex says. ``Its prevalence
and its rapid spread suggest its greater potential for causing
larger epidemics than any other HIV the world has experienced
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all scientists agree with Essex and Marlink that clade C is
more transmissable and more virulent, although no one can explain
why the 1C virus has supplanted other strains in parts of Africa
and India. Women infected with 1C in Zambia, where clade C
predominates, transmitted it heterosexually even when they had
lower blood levels of the virus than men who transmitted the virus
to women, according to a paper presented last month at a San
Francisco AIDS conference.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the same conference found 1C virus in about four
percent of a group of about 200 foreign-born individuals with HIV
infection in New York City. Sara Beatrice of the New York City
Health Department and her colleagues said public health officials
and physicians ``should be aware of the growing genetic diversity
of HIV-1 in this country,'' if only because tests to determine the
amount of HIV-1B in patients' blood may not be accurate among those
infected with non-B virus types.
</P>
<P>
   So far no one has apparently documented transmission of the 1C
subtype from foreign carriers to others outside regions where the
virus is endemic, leaving open the question of whether 1C has
started to infiltrate US or other populations. As the 20-year-old
AIDS epidemic has shown, however, international borders are porous
to viruses and other infectious organisms.
</P>
<P>
   But even if HIV-1C poses no new and urgent threat to
northern-hemisphere societies, its overwhelming predominance in the
world's most AIDS-affected regions is reason enough to focus more
resources on understanding the 1C virus, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sems to mutate much more quickly than other subtypes, so
there is a greater chance there will be natural resistance to
drugs,'' Moffat says. Botswana offers a scientific blank slate to
begin studies of 1C's resistance to drugs, he adds, ``because so
few people here have had treatment.''

attack at 28 _ too young, too soon. Two years ago, the Bronx
microphone master became the first Latin solo rap artist to go
platinum, and his ubiquitous breakthrough hit, ``Still Not a

that just wouldn't quit _ ``I'm not a player, I just crush a lot.''

Brooklyn-born rapper six weeks to sell 2 million, and it's barely

CHAPMAN AIMS FOR HEART WITH `TELLING STORIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tracy Chapman has been a long time gone from Harvard Square,
where she was discovered singing in the streets in the mid-'80s
before moving into local coffeehouses. The former Tufts University
student is now a firmly entrenched San Francisco-based star who has
won four Grammy awards, including one for best rock song (``Give Me
One Reason'') her last time out in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Chapman, now 35, kept a low profile for most of the late
'90s, except for playing the Tibetan Freedom Festival and a recent
Bob Marley tribute concert. She comes back into broader view with
the release of an extremely thoughtful album, though it may have
low commercial appeal. It digs deeper into her own heart, while
using more traditional acoustic instruments than has been her norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling Stories'' offers mostly laid-back tales about love's
fragility and life's uncertainty _ familiar topics to Chapman fans,
but this time she's even more introspective.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to downplay the beauty of the melodies. This CD may
require more intense listening, but it's still rewarding if you're
a Chapman lover. You just might have to be a more hard-core lover,
that's all.
</P>
<P>
   The album's first single is the title track, a mesmerizing song
that sets the tone. ``There is fiction in the space between you and
me,'' sings Chapman in the riveting, world-weary manner for which
she's known. It's addressed to someone who is writing memoirs but
changing the facts ``to make your everyday life seem less
mundane.'' A haunting theme, with haunting execution.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman's lyrics, along with her sculpted, late-night voice,
come to the forefront on ``Less Than Strangers.'' It's another
eerily soulful track, about how love can fade away to nothing:
``You and me had some history/Had a semblance of honesty/All that
has changed now/ We shared words only lovers speak/ How can it be
we are less than strangers.'' A stately ballad, it builds to a
verse about seeing a former lover on the street, but the person
walks away.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the album is likewise subdued musically but not
emotionally. Chapman's once-fiery politics are held down, though
hints appear in the quietly urgent ``Paper and Ink,'' about how
``money's only paper and ink/We'll destroy ourselves if we can't
agree how the world turns.'' The song is brought home by delicate
fills from hammered dulcimer and uillean pipes, evidence of
Chapman's more world-music base this time. (She herself augments
her acoustic guitar by playing the bouzouki.)
</P>
<P>
   Emmylou Harris adds a guest vocal (the only ``name'' guest on
the record) to the softly acoustic ``The Only One,'' about losing a
family member. ``She was the only one of my own flesh and
blood/Sometimes I hear her calling straight from the house of
God,'' sings Chapman, who will back this disc with a college tour
in April, followed by a larger tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The album has a greater spiritual emphasis than before, witness
``Unsung Psalm'' (``Yes, I have strayed and succumbed to my
vices/But I tried to live right'') and the folkie ``First Try''
(``I'm struggling with the limits of this ordinary life/I'm just a
first try''). Overall, the CD may not reach many new listeners, but
it should please _ and inspire _ many of those who have followed
Chapman through the years.

`AFRICAN CEREMONIES': PORTRAIT OR DISTORTION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The photographs featured in ``African Ceremonies'' seem harmless
enough. Explicit images of young Taneka men being circumcised.
Himba women attending a wedding covered in little more than a
copper-colored mixture of ocher and butterfat. Spear-carrying Dinka
men tending their cattle in the atmospheric haze of a setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher's goal in photographing
and researching the 43 traditional African ceremonies featured in
their two-volume coffee-table book was to ``record the most
traditional aspects of Africa before this all disappears,'' the
Boston-born Beckwith says in a telephone interview from her London
home. The book was so popular when it went on sale in November, it
has already sold out its initial press run.
</P>
<P>
   But are the images in ``African Ceremonies'' a lasting record of
a vanishing way of life? Or are they something more ominous?
</P>
<P>
   Since January, a handful of scholars, both black and white, have
called the book ``voyeuristic'' and ``colonialist'' in reviews in
the Los Angeles Times, New York Times Book Review and the magazine
Black Issues Book Review. They contend that showing Africans
rustic, nude, and covered in paint reinforces Western stereotypes
of Africa and denies the continent its modernity.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith and Fisher ``evoke an Africa that is out of time,''
harumphed K. Anthony Appiah, a London-born, Ghana-raised Harvard
University professor, in his Times Book Review. ``You would never
guess from `African Ceremonies' that by the year 2020 half the
population of Africa will live in cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone in his native England, John Reader, who
wrote the LA Times review of the book, complains, ``I've been
seeing this going on for 30 years. This same kind of coverage that
is what editors feel readers want to see. I think it's time to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith and Fisher, who are both white, speak passionately
about the continent they've spent up to seven months a year for the
last 30 years exploring. Critics like Appiah, they argue, missed
their book's point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left the job of recording the modern world, the political
upheaval, the famines and civil wars to other journalists who are
more skilled in this area,'' says Beckwith, who received a degree
in painting and photography from the School of the Museum of Fine
Arts. ``The outside world has such a strong sense of Africa often
as a source of disaster. We thought there's a richness and a power
and an ancientness that's survived for centuries that's hidden
behind the news headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Beckwith, who are in their 50s, have spent their
lives pursuing that ancientness. Fisher crisscrossed Africa
compiling research and photographs for her 1984 book ``Africa
Adorned.'' Beckwith lived with various indigenous African cultures
to create her books ``Maasai'' and ``Nomads of Niger.'' ``African
Ceremonies'' is their fourth book collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Work on it began 10 years ago when Beckwith and Fisher decided
to consummate a 20-year-old dream to create a comprehensive visual
record of traditional African ceremonies. On a 15-foot board that
hung in their London studio they pinned cards describing every
ceremony they'd seen or heard of while in Africa: births and
initiations. Courtships and marriages. Seasonal rites. Worship and
death rituals.
</P>
<P>
   From this jigsaw puzzle of information, the women pieced
together ``African Ceremonies.'' They trekked by mule train and
camel caravan to remote areas in 26 African countries to gather the
information.
</P>
<P>
   The book's dazzling, critically lauded photographs apparently
hit a nerve among the book-buying public. Some 12,500 copies of the
$150 tome were snatched from bookstore shelves here and around the
country. (A second printing of 9,000 books should hit stores by
early March.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Often the larger books you do worry about,'' says Dana
Brigham, co-owner of Brookline Booksmith, where at least a dozen
books are on back order. ``Especially since it's a high price
point. But this one was great.''
</P>
<P>
   What are people responding to? In Reader's 1998 book, ``Africa:
A Biography of the Continent,'' he says Westerners think of Africa
as the ``Dark Continent'' because ``Africa is believed to be
inherently more barbaric and less civilized than the rest of the
world.'' In many ways ``African Ceremonies'' buys into that
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think of majestic animals, they think of naked warriors
standing with their spears,'' says Appiah, during a recent
interview from his Harvard office, unfurling a list of imagery
Westerners connect to Africa after decades of reading magazines
like National Geographic and watching films like ``The Gods Must Be
Crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are real people,'' Appiah adds, ``but there are also
guys dressed in British-style lawyer outfits arguing cases in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, days before embarking on an extended visit to the
United States, Beckwith and Fisher discussed why they chose to
focus on this subject. They spoke of war, political upheaval,
famine, and political leaders who want no part of their
``primitive'' pasts. They both noted that 20 percent of the
ceremonies captured in their book no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   Such pronouncements make Appiah laugh in disbelief. ``All
ceremonies in all societies change all the time,'' he says. ``Some
of the ceremonies they photographed, nothing like them, maybe, will
be done in 50 years. Of course, for some of them, nothing like them
were done 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Flip through ``African Ceremonies,'' says Appiah, and you'll
encounter a photograph of a guy wearing a Mike Tyson T-shirt
watching dueling Bassari initiates during a coming-of-age ceremony.
Did you notice, he asks, the aluminum encircling the waists and
arms of the young Bassari men?
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes really high temperatures to smelt aluminum,'' notes
Appiah. ``If you have a ceremony with aluminum bracelets as an
important part of it, you know that it wasn't done 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did such an accomplished array of people participate in
them. The king of Baganda, whose coronation is featured in
``African Ceremonies,'' was Appiah's Cambridge University
schoolmate. Photographs of a jubilee celebration show Appiah's now
deceased uncle, the king of Ashanti, who was a practicing lawyer.
Beckwith and Fisher don't include that information in the
accompanying text.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's a lawyer is extremely interesting,''
explains Fisher, an Australian. ``If we had the space we could have
put it in. But we chose instead to (write about) something else
that might not be there in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Things like the Maasai transition from warrior to elder, which
was shortened by eight years, says Beckwith, because the Kenyan
government felt that the warrior class needed to contribute more to
the economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to say that all Africans don't have the right to move
into the 20th century,'' Beckwith continues. ``We're not trying to
hold people back in a romantic traditional way. But if they keep
their age-old values intact, they have a very good chance of
survival. Without these values you find many individuals lost in
terms of their identity and their roles in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's also apparent, as Appiah notes, that Africans can adopt
modern values into their traditional ceremonies and still retain
their cultural identities.
</P>
<P>
   Consider another story Beckwith tells about a Ghanaian village
chief who spent nine days building up a celebration by giving
Beckwith and Fisher colorful details.
</P>
<P>
   When the festival started, about 300 elders emerged from a
forest. They did not wear the traditional hunters' outfits
decorated with talismans, as Beckwith and Fisher expected. They
sported leisure suits and Reeboks instead.

WATCHDOG AGENCY DISCIPLINED FEWER DOCTORS IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Still struggling to overcome a history of
ineffectiveness, the board that watchdogs doctors in Massachusetts
took even fewer disciplinary actions in 1999 than it did the year
before when its rate was among the lowest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state's Board of Registration in Medicine took
action against just 38 physicians _ the lowest number in years _
and has almost 700 backlogged cases. More than 75 percent of the
cases involve complaints of substandard care and still await
initial review by a three-person unit that determines if further
investigation is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``My board and my staff get angry at me for saying this, but
this is unacceptable,'' said Nancy Achin Sullivan, who became the
board's executive director in October.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan has vowed to reduce the backlog. In a 1999 annual
report, Sullivan calls for an overhaul of the system, including
reforms of the process for screening and tracking complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there are 26,242 fully licensed doctors and
4,400 medical residents.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Massachusetts has ranked near the bottom of
surveys by the Public Health Citizen Research Group, which measures
serious disciplinary actions taken by states against doctors. In
1987, the board administered 93 disciplinary actions and ranked
20th among all 50 states. In 1998, Massachusetts ranked 47th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be surprised if we rank last in the report for 1999,''
said Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Michigan, wh about 30,000 doctors,
disciplined 116 physicians in 1999. Tom Lindsay, the director of
Michigan's watchdog agency, said that in 1994, the state passed a
law establishing goals of concluding investigations within 90 days
and completing cases within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts board received particular criticism last year
when it finally took action against a doctor who over several years
had repeatedly been accused of sexually abusing patients.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the board has turned up the heat on
disciplining physicians. In the past two months, it has taken the
unusual step of summarily suspending two doctors for allegedly
practicing substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan blames high staff turnover, low funding, and a lack of
subpoena power for the state's poor record in policing bad doctors.
</P>
<P>
   She says her first major goal is to review, by the end of June,
the 445 cases that are more than six months old. Half of those
cases are between one and more than five years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about three years of work in six months,''
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   She has also begun implementing small changes, such as housing
clinical and police-type investigators in the same offices, instead
of keeping them on different floors. The agency also received an
increase of $400,000 in its annual budget this year, bringing it to
$3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money should put the agency in a position to take care of
the backlog, Sullivan said. In addition, she said she would like to
use some of it to hire outside help to deal with complaints about
substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal is to give the board the same level of subpoena
power that the Department of Public Health has, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Watry, the executive director of the North Carolina
Medical Board, said subpoena power is vital for investigations,
such as when doctors may be prescribing drugs to addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are investigating someone for a violation, you have to
get them independently, so no one has a chance to leave something
out,'' said Watry. ``I have never seen a patient complain that a
doctor gave him too much Demerol.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the added resources the Massachusetts board is
getting, its board chairwoman, Dr. Mary Anna Sullivan, warns that
changes may not come overnight. ``The reality is that there never
will be no backlog, as we are always pouncing on the most extreme
cases, so it leaves the lower cases to languish,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Wolfe, 58, of Woodsville, N.H., says that he is one of
several people who have complained about a doctor to the board, but
to little avail. Two years ago, he visited a Massachusetts doctor
to complain of a swollen scrotum, which made it hard for him to
walk. Wolfe said the physician ordered X-rays and then told him
that he saw nothing abnormal.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a friend of Wolfe who is a radiologist said that the
physician could not have made a proper diagnosis with an X-ray for
soft tissue. The doctor also prescribed tetracycline, even though
Wolfe had indicated he is allergic to it.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe filed a complaint against the doctor in April and said he
was informed last month the review of his complaint was still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like reports like mine end up in a dead file unless
it's a horrendous injury,'' said Wolfe. ``But unless it reaches a
threshold, lawyers won't touch it either, so the average person has
no recourse but to go to the board. Then the board doesn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan hopes to change that public perception. A three-time
cancer patient herself, Sullivan said she understands what it is
like to feel wronged by the health-care system. ``I was
misdiagnosed for my first breast cancer, and I wake up every day
wondering if my treatment had started a year earlier if the cancer
would have evolved so far, or reoccurred,'' she said. Sullivan was
diagnosed with breast cancer when she was a state senator in 1990
and survived Hodgkin's disease as a teen.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan also stresses that to charge doctors with
performing substandard care the agency must prove at least one case
of gross negligence or numerous substandard-care cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the board's staff has been busy reviewing 252
priority cases after coming under fire last March for not
protecting the public from several potentially dangerous doctors.
</P>
<P>
   One physician, Dr. Marcos Ramos, had dozens of sex-abuse
complaints lodged against him over several years but was not
disciplined until last year, after law enforcement officials became
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 252, there were 183 cases in which charges had been
dismissed even though three or more complaints had been lodged
against the doctors. The board found after its review that the
dismissals had been appropriate, but sent letters of concern to
those who had five or more complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this review contributed to the growing backlog,
Sullivan said, ``It was important for the board to do the reviews
because people have to know that there is an agency that is
protecting them and to show that the Ramos case was really an
anomaly. The mistake was a huge mistake, but it was an exception
and not a rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The board has also looked closely at 19 cases that involved law
enforcement agencies. Of those, nine have resulted in action, and
six are still being examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best doctors in the country here in this state,''
Sullivan said. ``We should have high standards.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the hourly fees. What lawyers really want in these
high-tech boom times is to ride their clients' coattails to riches.
And increasingly, that road leads to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As salary wars rage in legal offices from Boston to Silicon
Valley, lawyers are embracing a new way to profit from the success
of their clients. Many are taking ownership stakes in customers _
sometimes instead of fees _ in hopes of reaping big returns on
clients they usher from start-ups to initial public stock
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is turning lawyers into venture capitalists, and
it's forcing many to rethink the way they do business, as ethics
and objectivity run headlong into greed and competitive pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking an equity position is another way of telling your
client you believe in what they're doing,'' said William Zucker, a
partner at Gadsby &AMP; Hannah and head of the Boston law firm's new
technology group. Working for a young, cash-poor entrepreneur, he
added, requires ``recognizing that some of the reward will be down
the road. There's no guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Most lawyers contend that entrepreneurs want them to invest in
their companies. Young firms often need the money, they say, and
it's a vote of confidence. Lawyers in California regularly invest
in clients. Ad agencies and consultants are getting access to their
clients' IPOs too; accounting firms such as Arthur Andersen have
set up venture capital arms to get in on the action.
</P>
<P>
   Even here on the East Coast, individual lawyers have been
investing informally in clients for years. An attorney working on a
deal might be invited to invest $25,000 or $50,000 in a company
that's going public. Venture capital firms will often invite their
lawyers to invest small amounts along with them during, say, a $20
million infusion into a Web firm.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy creeps up on lawyers when they invest directly
in clients. At issue is their objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Can investors be sure all of a company's risks are divulged in a
stock-offering document that was drafted by lawyers who own part of
that company? If the business is ever sued, might the lawyers be
named as defendants because of their ownership stake?
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers feel the conflict is no greater than it ever has
been with attorneys and their clients. In a contingency lawsuit,
for example, lawyers earn a percentage of their clients' winnings
in a case. The lawyer is rewarded for representing the client well.
Most large firms are not trading their services for equity stakes
but rather are charging fees and separately investing in promising
clients.
</P>
<P>
   So, do lawyers deserve a piece of the action when clients go
public?
</P>
<P>
   John LeClaire, cochairman of the private equity group at Goodwin
Procter &AMP; Hoar, Boston's biggest law firm, says they do. Companies
in the start-up phase get very close to their lawyers, he said.
Lawyers help make introductions for them, and they draw up
documents from incorporating to taking on venture investors to
filing with regulators to go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go on the road with these people. . . . You live with the
ups and the downs of these people like your family,'' LeClaire
said. As for the investment return, he added: ``It's all 16-hour
days and a lot of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, entrepreneurs need to be mindful of giving
away chunks of their company to everybody who walks in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising executive Matt Devine is one of William Zucker's
clients at Gadsby &AMP; Hannah. He and his brother are launching a
business-to-business Web site, Chefmarket.com. They're building a
Web community where chefs can be in contact with peers, food
sellers, and other restaurant service people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker's law firm wants to invest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Devine said he's paying the firm's legal fees, and he's not
looking for a free ride. He said Gadsby &AMP; Hannah is doing their
legal paperwork and ``helping us navigate our way through the
financial area, sourcing investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Devine willing to sell stock to his lawyers? That's still up
for negotiation, he said. ``If they're successful in helping us
land some of this financing, yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker's firm has been taking equity stakes in clients for only
about nine months. Many other firms in town are just beginning to
dive into the practice too. But the phenomenon is quickly picking
up speed.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of watching clients in hot Internet and technology
businesses amass fortunes while they earn only the fees of hired
guns, some lawyers fret that they're being left behind. Others are
jumping ship to become legal counsels to hot companies.
</P>
<P>
   Law firms increasingly see taking small stakes in clients _ and
running those investments as a venture fund _ as a way to offer
bigger incentives to partners and to attract new associates.
</P>
<P>
   At Goodwin Procter, partner David Henken runs a
multimillion-dollar venture capital fund, the result of several
investments in clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the clients' perspective and ours, this is a complete
alignment of interests, rather than a conflict,'' Henken said.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms, like Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish, are wading into
client investments more slowly. Managing partner Michael Mooney
said he's mulling the ethical issues related to the practice, as
well as complications that need to be sorted out, such as taxes and
how to spread the value of such investments among partners and
others at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   At Hale and Dorr, Boston's number three law firm, managing
partner Bill Lee said taking stakes in clients is good business,
but only in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes we take in clients tend to be smaller than on the
West Coast, because we're concerned about conflict issues,'' Lee
said. It's important to keep priorities in line, he said,
especially when the stock market is soaring and IPOs are making
headlines. Betting the farm on clients' shares would be foolish, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the next downturn comes, and when the next boom comes, we
still want to be lawyers,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Malpractice insurers historically have shunned lawyers who
invest in their own clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurers didn't want there to be this independence problem,''
said Dennis Mullins, a New York lawyer who represents Lloyd's of
London and other large insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now lawyers are angling to get the insurers to broaden their
definition of ownership and control. They suggest they should be
able to hold stakes of less than 10 percent of a private company
and less than 5 percent of a publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Top lawyers in town say they're jumping on the investing
bandwagon in large part because their West Coast rivals are already
doing it successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the feeling of being part of a growing enterprise,'' said
Justin Morreale, head of Bingham Dana's corporate department.
``Usually the clients like it. You're shoulder-to-shoulder in more
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers shouldn't be involved in pricing a deal they're trying
to invest in, Morreale said, and they shouldn't own more than a
quarter or a half percent of a client's stock. But he dismisses the
notion that lawyers have to sit on the sidelines to avoid a
conflict of interest. ``That's ancient history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But lawyers are looking over their shoulders as they
make these equity investments.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Bradley, partner in charge of the emerging business
practice at Holland &AMP; Knight in Boston, said the firm never wants
to be a majority investor, or even a significant investor, in a
client. The idea is to be on board with clients, as a shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not investing for the purpose of making a killing,''
Bradley said. ``We don't twist anybody's arm.''

THE LIGHT AT THE END OF A FIBER-OPTICS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiny Netoptix Corp. of Sturbridge, Mass., down and nearly out
after another failed turnaround strategy this time last year, found
a buyer willing to hustle up a stunning $2.1 billion for its
fiberoptic business Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Call it another amazing tale of the new economy: the acquisition
agreement with Corning Inc. drove Netoptix stock, which traded at
just 3 3/4 last March, up by 20 Monday to 156.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the comeback, ultra low-profile investor Gerhard
Andlinger, was the biggest winner of them all. Andlinger's firm
injected $6 million of cash into Netopix and began calling the
shots 13 months ago in return for 2 million shares plus the right
to buy 2 million more at $1.50 each. That stake was worth $624
million Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Andlinger had appeared just last month at a luncheon for
investors hosted by brokerage Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston to
pitch the company. One of the few institutional investors present
at the meeting recalled what sounded like a slow and methodical
exit plan. Now all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``His workout schedule just went from years to months,'' said
portfolio manager Philip Fine of Loomis Sayes &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``He
did a great job for himself and his investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Corning was willing to shell out so much in stock for a company
with revenues of just $4.7 million in the last reported quarter to
get its business selling glass filters that speed traffic over
fiberoptic communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, already a big player in fiber optics, is racing with
competitors like JDS Uniphase Corp. to offer a full range of fiber
components and modules for big telecommunications clients. Just
three months ago, Corning paid $2 billion to buy Oak Industries
Inc., a telecommunications equipment manufacturer based in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Filters like those made by Netoptix split light poring through a
fiber optic cable just like a prism, increasing capacity by
dividing the light impulses into many more streams of information.
</P>
<P>
   Andlinger is no stranger to turning struggling companies around.
His firm, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., has put money into more than 50
companies in America and Europe since it was formed 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Austria, Andlinger first visited America as a high
school junior and one winner in an English-language essay contest
sponsored by the New York Herald Tribune. He returned to attend
Princeton and later Harvard Business School, eventually landing a
job at the company that would be his on-and-off employer for years,
ITT Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Andlinger left ITT three times: jumped twice, pushed once. Upon
his final exit, he joined with a group of other ex-ITT executives
to create a firm to invest in and often purchase troubled companies
that could benefit from their management experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets invovled personally at the operational level,'' said
Paul O'Brien the former New England Telephone chief now involved in
several young technology companies and a Netoptix director as of
last month. ``I think Netoptix is a classic example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   They made lots of money along the way, though Monday's Netoptix
deal clearly appears to be the biggest win ever. There were a few
clunkers: Andlinger's mid-1980s acquisition of bygone sunglass
leader Foster Grant, went sour. The Leominster company, buried by
cheap Japanese imports, filed for Chapter 11 protection in US
Bankruptcy Court a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Netoptix had gone through several reinventions before Andlinger
came on the scene. Once known as Galileo Electro-Optics Corp. and
more recently just Galileo Corp, the company had been a defense
contractor that supplied night-vision products to the military.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War led Galileo into a business making
glass-coated parts that gave an electrical charge to the toner in a
printer or copier, allowing the ink to adhere to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   But the client that accounted for half of all the company's
revenues, Xerox Corp., abruptly dumped Galileo in 1997 with
disastrous result.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another new strategy, this time into medical products, never
really got off the ground and Galileo looked like it was in big
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Andlinger moved in with a cash infusion in January 1999 and
began to move the company into the fiberoptic communications
business.
</P>
<P>
   Investors credit the strategy and the recruitment of key
managers, particularly German engineer Ralf Faber who became
president of Netoptix last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just reinvented themselves,'' said Fine, the Loomis
Sayles portfolio manager. ``They sold off the medical stuff and
hired some sharp techies from Germany. You only had to talk to
these guys for about 90 seconds to realize they were for real.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Netoptix clearly happened in a hurry. Corning
officials said Monday the deal came together so quickly they hadn't
figured out which accounting methods would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Netoptix officials said they were first contacted by Corning
officials on Jan. 27, a day after the company's annual meeting.
Corning executives began touring facilities four days later and by
early last week they were in the offices of Netoptix's Boston
lawyers working out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   One footnote to the annual meeting: a proposal to eliminate a
two-thirds majority requirement for a takeover vote did not have
enough initial support. The question was set aside and the meeting
reconvened last week to push through a new simple-majority rule.
</P>
<P>
   At these prices, it hard to imagine it would have mattered.

PIONEERING ASIANS FIND LAND OF PLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ At Ming's Restaurant on Wednesday evening,
the main attraction wasn't the Peking duck, it was Bill Lee,
cofounder and president of RemarQ Communities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, an affable and modest if overachieving 29-year-old, told
the story to a transfixed crowd of 120 other Asian Americans of how
he gave up a six-figure salary as an attorney to start a company in
an unheated garage in San Rafael, 15 miles north of the Golden Gate
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1996 with just $6,000, was sold two
weeks ago for ``several hundred million'' dollars. As far as
Silicon Valley goes, it was a typical Internet Cinderella story,
complete with perilous moments and happy ending. And it was just
what the audience wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very inspiring,'' remarked Yiping Zhu, who came to hear
Lee at the monthly meeting of the Chinese Software Professionals
Association with his friend John Cao.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu and Cao, who met on a whitewater rafting trip sponsored by
one of the dozens of Asian-American technology-oriented
organizations in the Bay Area, are contemplating their own Internet
start-up. Cao is a consultant with KPMG; Zhu once worked for KPMG
and is now employed by iPrint.com, an online provider of commercial
printing services.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly surprising that so many Asians work in technology
companies in Silicon Valley. For years, the region has beckoned
immigrants from across the ocean with its rags-to-riches tales. One
out of five engineers and scientists in the Valley are Asian
immigrants, according to a study by AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor
at the University of California at Berkeley's Department of City
and Regional Planning. The figure doesn't even count the growing
numbers of young Asian-American professionals whose ancestors
immigrated to the United States years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is that many of these technically savvy Asians are
striking out on their own, following in the footsteps of Internet
pioneers such as Jerry Yang, the Taiwanese-born cofounder of Yahoo
Inc., and Sabeer Bhatia, a native of India who started Hotmail
Corp. and then sold it to Microsoft Corp. two years ago for $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the US-born Lee, the story was much the same. After
graduating from law and business schools at the University of
California at Los Angeles, Lee went to work at a law firm. One
Friday evening, as he was toiling on a legal brief, he got a
fateful call from a friend, Craig Wallace, who asked him to forsake
his job and start a company in Wallace's parents' garage. To his
parents' dismay, Lee agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In that garage, Lee learned an early lesson: ``When you've got
nothing, don't act as if you have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   His confident talk caught the ear of a venture capitalist at
Benchmark Capital, who sent his partners to check out the company.
Lee and Wallace, flying by the seat of their pants without even a
business plan, forgot to put titles on their freshly printed
business cards. When asked about the lack of titles, Lee bluffed,
saying the company didn't believe in hierarchy. At the end of the
week, Benchmark wired the fledgling company $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   RemarQ, based in San Jose, changed course several times before
settling on its current focus: running online message boards for
companies such as Siebel Systems and AltaVista. Last month,
Critical Path Inc., an Internet messaging company, agreed to buy
RemarQ for an undiclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Zhu and Cao joined a small crowd that
fluttered around Lee, peppering him with questions about venture
capital and board members.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Lihong Cai, marketing manager for e-Commerce
Technology Inc. in Cupertino. Cai said he enjoyed hearing about the
mistakes Lee made along the way and the near-death moments when Lee
and his partner had to write cash-advance checks from their
personal credit cards to pay employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked was that he was very honest about everything,''
said Cai, whose company was also founded by an Asian entrepreneur.
``He didn't make it seem like it was all perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, beaming from his newfound status as role model, offered the
following fortune-cookie advice: ``It's critical to make contacts,
to attend events like this.''

WIRELESS WEB, VIA SPEECH RECOGNITION, THE NEXT BIG THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For wireless phone companies, speech recognition is becoming the
industry's Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing home a trend that has begun to sweep Europe and Asia,
in recent months companies such as Bell Atlantic Mobile and Sprint
PCS have locally made the leap from selling basic phone service to
offering units that can connect to the Internet to find stock
quotes and news headlines and get and send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are responding. By almost all accounts cell phones as
``Internet appliances'' will evolve into a multibillion-dollar
business globally. International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass.
predicts 40 million US wireless Web subscribers by 2003, more than
11 times the current 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts think the only way wireless Internet access
will ever live up to its potential _ and become more than an
occasional hobby for hard-core technology nuts _ will be if people
can ask for and get information the same way they usually use a
phone: By talking and listening to the response, rather than
dialing numbers and toggling around the handset display.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be walking through the airport or trying not to
drive your car off the road and be looking at this tiny screen to
get information,'' said Richard R. Wise, a vice president and
Internet specialist with Mercer Consulting in Lexington, Mass.
``This issue of text-to-voice and speech recognition is going to be
crucial to making this handheld Net device market work.''
</P>
<P>
   With a potentially huge market at stake, the race to develop
speech-recognition systems is heating up, with Greater Boston
serving as a base for much of the research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The companies now working on the technology include Belgian
speech technology giant Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, which has 400 employees
at its Burlington, Mass. North American headquarters; SpeechWorks
International Inc. of Boston; Dragon Systems of Newton; Parlance
Corp. of Medford; InTouch of Cambridge; Shoutmail.com of Chestnut
Hill; and Wildfire Communications Inc. of Lexington. Their progress
is being driven to a considerable extent by research at three
speech-recognition labs at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies focus on selling and improving
applications that create documents and reports by dictating to a
computer, or serve voice-mail functions like giving airline flight
departure information or connecting calls to a particular employee
at a business in response to spoken queries.
</P>
<P>
   But as Net-capable phones become more and more popular _ Sprint
PCS, for example, sold nearly 1 million in the last three months of
last year _ executives at these companies see a large demand for
adapting speech technology to serve people trying to get
information over their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The dream is that someday people with Net-enabled wireless
phones could speak commands like ``Tell me the weather for zip code
02138'' or ``Current traffic on the turnpike'' and hear a
computer-synthesized voice answer, rather than having to hunt and
peck around the keypad trying to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no truer application of `anytime, anywhere' access to
the Web than your voice and your cell phone,'' said Stuart R.
Patterson, president of SpeechWorks, which has grown from to 220
employees from 90 in the last year and runs speech-recognition
systems for United Air Lines, ETrade, Federal Express, Bell South,
and a new find-a-restaurant guide called Foodline.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Gaston Bastiaens, president of Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, said the
cell phone and the network that serves it must react to the sound
of a caller's voice, not the pushing of 6's and 7's on a keypad.
``That's a very clumsy user interface,'' Bastiaens said.
</P>
<P>
   A growing political backlash against unsafe driving caused by
people with one hand or two eyes on their cell phone could also be
a potent force driving improved speech-recognition technology.
Nationally, 15 states and some 300 cities and towns have recently
considered laws or ordinances banning cell phone use while driving,
according to a recent Associated Press survey. Given how much more
distracting it can be to try to read or search for information
while driving, high-speed wireless Web surfing could become
especially controversial.
</P>
<P>
   In its top predictions for 2000, Yankee Group analysts said
wireless industry officials ``must push hands-free, voice
recognition, and new microphones and earpieces to avoid potential
catastrophe, including loss of consumer confidence, an increased
number of accidents, or a stock market dip.''
</P>
<P>
   While market prognasticators predict that consumers will snap up
Net-enabled phones, it is not clear that they want to make as much
use of them as wireless companies hope. The Yankee Group polled
Americans last year asking them how much they want wireless-phone
access to various types of information, on a 1 to 4 scale.
</P>
<P>
   The highest average rating was for weather, but only a lukewarm
2. News and stock quotes all got barely a 1.5, with only 12 percent
of people saying it was somewhat or very important to them to be
able to get this information from the wireless phone, according to
Yankee analyst Adam Zowal.
</P>
<P>
   And the average customer was not willing to spend more than 83
cents per month per service, according to Yankee Group's survey,
far below the typical $10 a month carriers charge with premium
digital calling plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely missionary work'' that has to be done,
Kendra Vandermuelen, AT&AMP;T's senior vice president of product
development and strategy, told the Dallas Morning News recently.
``The market does not fully appreciate what can be done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Take away the hassle users now have to get much of that
information, however, and the service becomes a much easier sell.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Valente, vice president of technology and advanced
systems development with Sprint PCS, said his company has seriously
evaluated several speech-based systems over the last two years.
However, Valente added: ``We do feel that it's not crucial to have
speech technology to work with the wireless Web, but it would be an
enhancement. I think we are getting very close to something that
the end user would find of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't used the service, you might think it sounds
like you have to press a lot of keys to move around, but it's
something that users get used to. Once you try it and get used to
it, it's really not all that bad,'' Valente said, adding that many
frequent requests _ like access to a stock portfolio _ can be
bookmarked in the phone for rapid access.
</P>
<P>
   But a considerable number of industry analysts do not share that
view and believe that speech-recognition technology will be crucial
to making wireless Net access a mass-market proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The unstoppable, exponential growth in computer processing
power, coupled with advanced mathematics, has made it more and more
feasible to develop systems that can nearly instantaneously
decipher at a basic sound-wave level what a caller is saying,
interpret those sounds as words, and interpret those words as part
of a question or command.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the same advances have allowed companies like
SpeechWorks and Lernout &AMP; Hauspie to offer systems that read back
information with ever-more-human inflection, cadence, and pausing.
Tom Morse, Lernout &AMP; Hauspie's senior director of engineering,
noted a special challenge to adapting speech technology for
cell-phone use: ``Wireless typically means you are not in a nice,
quiet office.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a voice perspective, we will soon get a lot closer'' to
being able to reliably filter out extraneous sounds, Morse says.
``The real challenge is being able to respond succinctly and
intelligently to what is being asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Samsung, among other cell phone makers, sells $180 units
that can be dialed by speaking the name of a person whose number
has been entered into the phone's memory. Wireless users who
subscribe to the Wildfire service can use it to dial numbers
hands-free from the car.
</P>
<P>
   But even while the costs of both cellular airtime and chip
processing power continue to plunge, a big question is how much
speech technology to put on the phone, and how much to put on the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Some users might prefer to rapidly download a lot of information
to the phone and have a speech module there turn it into spoken
language rather than burn up airtime hearing it read from a
computer linked to the phone network.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want your device costing you $2,000,'' said Morse.
``You don't want to be putting the biggest possible processor on
your phone.''
</P>
<P>
   And how you get the information once your phone has found it is
another area ripe for the application of speech technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shoutmail.com of Boston, for example, has pioneered a new system
that allows people to get electronic mail without even having to
own a computer. People who sign up for a Shoutmail e-mail account
dial in to hear a robotic female voice read them their mail,
through a system developed by Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, and can respond by
dictating ``wave files'' in their own voice that recipients play
back on their computer.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which already has 350,000 subscribers nationally,
is launching a text-to-speech product that will offer people a
customized package from 800 categories of news and information _
including sports scores, horoscopes, and news headlines _ delivered
over their phone.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, subscribers will hear announcers who have read spots
at a Shoutmail studio. However, Shoutmail president Jacob Guedalia
said the company is also now offering a free system for Web page
owners to convert their site content into a form that can be read
aloud by the Shoutmail robot lady when users ask for it by punching
a number on the keypad.
</P>
<P>
   Shoutmail plans soon to add L&AMP;H technology to its network to
make access to that information available by response to spoken
commands _ ``What is Delta flight 404 departure time?'' or ``Stock
quote for Gillette symbol G'' _ as an alternative to entering
touch-tone commands from the keypad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands that voice needs to be part of the
story,'' Guedalia said. ``Letting your phone reply to you with a
voice, rather than having to look at tiny text on a little screen
while you're trying to drive, just makes a hell of a lot more
sense.''

BEHIND THE OIL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For all the growing concern about global warming in the last
decade, you would have thought that when the phenomenon finally
began to bite, policy makers and the scribes who follow them would
tumble all over each other analyzing its significance for our daily
life.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have legislators calling for the government to set
up new emergency oil reserves. Consumer advocates demanding that
prosecutors put oil firms on the hot seat. Monday morning
quarterbacks rattling on about about bad management in the supply
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson calls to
order his meeting in Faneuil Hall Wednesday, eight or ten tankers
will have arrived in New York City. The price of oil to be
delivered in March has already dropped to around 80 cents. Refiners
once again are cranking out more No. 2 fuel oil than in all
likelihood we will need.
</P>
<P>
   In its broad outlines at least, the home heating oil crisis will
have been resolved by the simplest and most intuitive of mechanisms
_ the market. Barring another really cold spell, there will be
plenty of oil at prices rapidly declining from their highs.
</P>
<P>
   But the yammering will continue into spring.
</P>
<P>
   The root cause of the problem that sent oil prices soaring
toward $2 a gallon in January was the increasing uncertainty
attached to New England's weather in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been
more successful than anyone thought possible in cutting output and
thus putting a floor under export prices. London's Economist
magazine, for instance, spent most of last year predicting that oil
soon would fall to $5 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it rose to close to $20.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, too, that refiners cut back somewhat on the amount
of distillate supplied to the market at crucial times, though
aggregate numbers now show the industry produced about the same
this year as last.
</P>
<P>
   But the last few years have been dismal for the refineries _ not
only is there too much oil, but too much refining capacity too.
That's good news for consumers, but it is bad news for producers _
and for the consumers who will depend on them a few years in the
future. Refineries are said to have lost money two years running.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a legion of wholesalers, uncertain of how much oil
to add to inventory _ and at what price? _ and you have a recipe
for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Until mid-January, it looked pretty good. December was an
astonishing 10 degrees above normal _ despite the cooling effect
that the La Nina weather phenomenon was supposed to bring. The year
1999 went into the record books as the fifth hottest on record,
behind 1998, 1997, 1995 and 1990. The temperature in Boston stood
at more than 60 degrees in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Then Arctic air blasted New England, not one but two weekends in
a row. With inventories low, prices soared. It was the first
sudden, substantial increase in oil prices since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis hit poor people hardest. Programs designed to
ameliorate the impact were slow to kick in. Citizens Energy found
itself getting 1,600 calls a day, and was forced for a time to stop
taking on new requests.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hesitated to release $130 million in federal aid
_ then gave New York ten times more than Massachusetts' $3.5
million in aid, even though prices were 70 cents a gallon higher
here than there.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers, meanwhile, suffered too. Drivers and furnacemen worked
around the clock. Trucks stood in line for up five hours to receive
a half load of oil. Customer payments slowed; bank credit lines
were exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Out of curiosity, I asked my fuel oil dealer Monday what this
year's crisis had cost me. Since September 1, I have purchased
1,060 gallons for $1,553. In the same period last year, I needed
1,097 gallons, which cost $1,019. The year before that, I required
1,329 gallons for which I paid $1,451.
</P>
<P>
   That's simply not much of a crisis, except for those at the low
end of the income distribution _ and those who care for their
needs. Instead of beating up on the oil industry, we would do
better to improve assistance to the needy, and reflect on how well
the market system copes with the massive uncertainty of climate
change.

A LIVELY VISIT TO THE PORTUGAL TOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATALHA, Portugal _ Brilliant sunshine decorates the undulating
countryside, bringing out its rural best, making you glad to be
alive. So, of course, Diogo said, ``Shall we visit the dead?''
</P>
<P>
   He had three tombs in mind as we drove north of Lisbon, each
with a story. One, to my surprise, contains a boyhood hero I'd lost
track of. The others represent an epic Portuguese royal love affair
that ran a sticky course from steam heat to tragedy to the macabre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must know this gentleman,'' Diogo Cabral, a Portuguese
friend showing us around, nods toward an inscription that is simple
although the setting is regal: ``Henrique o Navegador.'' Why, it's
none other than Prince Henry the Navigator, or Hank of the High
Seas as I used to think of him. He hasn't been with us for a long
time. Almost 5 1/2 centuries have passed since he was filed away
(1460) in this vault in this chapel in this Dominican monastery of
Santa Maria da Vitoria in the small town of Batalha. But I am
pleased to stand beside his sepulchre, pat him admiringly _
actually his marble effigy _ while offering a silent ``Thank you,
Hank'' prayer for his imaginative soul.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he wasn't canonized, I have, since grammar school
days, considered Henry the patron saint of people who want to go
places. When Portugal led the world exploration league in the 15th
century, Hank, a son of King Joao I, inspired, plotted, often
financed the voyages of such dauntless captains as Gil Eanes,
Bartolomeu Dias, and Vasco da Gamma, who lengthened Portugal's
reach well beyond the accepted boundaries of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Swackhammer in my geography class and Miss Long in history
had a keen appreciation of the man's efforts in broadening
knowledge of the planet, and they passed it along. We pupils shared
their amazement that such a small country played such a large role
in discovery. Portuguese sailors were remarkable traveling men who
sailed into unknown seas, around Africa to the Orient, either
dispatched by curious Hank or following his designs.
</P>
<P>
   During his active days the prince (not much of a wanderer
himself) gazed out at the sea from a coastal tower at Sagres on the
country's southwest tip, where he presided over a navigational
school and shipyard. But, for family reasons, he's a country boy _
in location _ now. Buried inland in the sticks, 90 miles above
Lisbon, he is confined to Batalha, amid farming country where you
may find teams of oxen pulling plows as they did in his time.
</P>
<P>
   Win a battle, build a church. That seems to have been the
Christian dee-fense! philosophy of Portuguese kings, fighting off
powerful neighbor, Spain, or reclaiming territory from the Moors.
King Joao I prayed and promised to dedicate a monastery to the
Virgin if she helped him pull off a long-shot by turning back the
Castillian invaders at Aljubarrota in 1385. Presto _ an upset was
his, and he called his nearby construction site Batalha (battle),
where Santa Maria da Vitoria's gothic spires began to sprout three
years later. It was the answer to the prayers of architects,
contractors, and laborers, too.
</P>
<P>
   In this many-cloistered building you could get cloisterphobia.
Except that these sectors are so attractive, enhanced by the
Portuguese Manueline style of exuberant stone carving that florally
decorates windows and portals.
</P>
<P>
   King Joao and his queen, Philippa (an English bride), are buried
in the founder's family chapel, side by side, their marble forms
holding hands. Although he spiritually belongs beside his mistress,
the sea, their son, Prince Henry, lies a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The church, with several unroofed chapels, was never completed.
``We Portuguese are famous for unfinished works,'' says Diogo,
``but this doesn't detract from the beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far to the south of Batalha is another Santa Maria, a
Cistercian abbey, started in another small town, Alcobaca, in 1148.
Portugal's first king, Alfonso Henriques, offered it in thanks,
after asking for divine help to beat the Moors at Santarem.
</P>
<P>
   As the country's largest church, it soars above three aisles,
and houses the tombs of the storied lovers, Ines and Pedro, whose
passions rose even higher _ before being crushed, now remembered
for a bizarre, ghastly postscript.
</P>
<P>
   A prince who would become Pedro I, the young nobleman married a
Spanish princess but fell for her lady-in-waiting, Ines de Castro.
Their affair displeased his father, King Alfonso IV, who had Ines
banished. But when his wife died Pedro resumed his attentions to
Ines and their illegitimate children. This was too much for
Alfonso, who arranged her murder in 1355.
</P>
<P>
   Heartsick _ some called it madness _ Pedro enjoyed a semblance
of revenge in 1357. When his father died and he became king, Ines's
killers were rounded up and paid with their hearts that were torn
out. Later, in 1361, he decided that the dead-and-buried Ines would
be his true queen-for-a-day. She was exhumed, garbed in royal robes
and placed on a throne next to his. Pedro ordered the court to pay
respects to her skeletal self, kissing her less-than-appealing
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they are today,'' says Diogo. ``But not like King and
Queen Joao and Philippa, linked hand in hand at Batalha.''
</P>
<P>
   No. Ines and Pedro are separated by an aisle. Their figures, now
serene, attended by sculpted angels and saints, grace splendidly
carved sarcophagi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they are together in the next life,'' says Diogo.
Maybe. A nice thought. Along with Prince Henry, sailing ships to
the stars.

QUITE THE TIME TO VISIT NEWPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The place to be Feb. 18-27 is Newport, R.I., for its annual
Winter Festival.
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival features more than 150 events with
something for everyone. Again the festival will focus on musical
events, and to add to the fun there'll be food, ice sculpting,
auctions, a progressive dinner, a chili cook-off, a citywide
scavenger hunt, a children's block hunt, fireworks, and more.
</P>
<P>
   The Newport Winter Festival is listed as one of the top 100
events in North America by the American Bus Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among highlights will be performances by the US Air Force Band
of Liberty and Roger Ceresi and the Rockin' Soul Horns, the return
of Beatlemania, the all-you-can-eat Chili Cook-Off to see who has
the best chili in Newport, the international performance troupe Big
Nazo, the Bellevue Cadillac, a Children's Fair Feb. 20-21, the
Chris Fritz Band, tours of historic homes and inns, a Fantasy
Auction at the Astors' Beechwood Mansion, and a festival day at
Easton's Beach Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>

   Australia's Gold Coast is bracing for the World's Biggest Surf
Party, March 15-19 _ a celebration of the unique Australian icon,
the surf lifesaver. Australia traces surf lifesaving to 1906 when
the first official lifesaving club was established. Although ocean
swimming became popular in the country in the 1880s, it was illegal
to swim between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. Then in 1903, the rules were
relaxed, but one had to bathe in neck-to-knee outfits. The
Australian Surf Life Saving Championships is one of the world's
largest sporting events, with more than 6,500 lifesavers throughout
the country participating. The celebrations include beach parties,
concerts, beach cricket (a great sporting tradition), and more.
Held in an area of Australia that is famous for its never-ending
beaches, rain forests, and easygoing lifestyle, the event is also a
great time to meet the locals. For information on Australia, call
800-333-0262.

HONEYMOONING ON THE SHIP OF DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the Grim Reaper was also a passenger on their dream
cruise, a Michigan couple has won Thrifty Car Rental's sixth annual
Honeymoon Disasters Contest.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan and Amber Oles of Rochester Hills, Mich., took a cruise in
which five on-board deaths occurred in fewer than 10 days, causing
passengers and even crew members to nickname the vessel the Ship of
Death. (Thrifty has generously omitted the name of the ship.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the deaths, which included one of a man
collapsing in front of them, the couple had other problems. The
ship was being remodeled, so the gym, hot tub, and other facilities
were off limits. And despite a ``Do Not Disturb'' sign on their
cabin doorknob, a steward barged in at, shall we say, a delicate
moment!
</P>
<P>
   But it will now be smooth sailing for the Oleses because their
prize is a second honeymoon to a destination of their choice in the
continental United States, including air fare, hotel, and rental
car (bet you it's a Thrifty).
</P>
<P>
   If you've had a honeymoon horror you want to share, enter your
tale by Sept. 30. Go to www.thrifty.com and e-mail your entry by
visiting the ``Promotions'' section, visit any Thrifty location, or
write to Honeymoon Disasters 2000, c/o Thrifty Rent-A-Car System
Inc., Corporate Communications Department, CIMS (NU)1020, PO Box
35250, Tulsa OK 74153-0250. Mailed entries must include a stamped,
self-addressed envelope.
</P>
<P>
   And next week we'll have more honeymoon horror stories from
other entrants. &QL; 
 &QL; 
This only seems like a horror story: In Germany, ``don't be afraid
if the best man steals the bride from the reception and takes her
to a local bar,'' says Jonathan Orr-Ewing of the Hotel Nikko
Dusseldorf. ``It is an old German tradition that the groom has to
go out and find them.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What time zone is the Panama Canal in? (Answer at
end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: The Mackinac Bridge, which connects Michigan's upper and
lower peninsulas, is nicknamed Mighty Mac. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Travel is the act of leaving familiarity behind.
Destination is merely a byproduct of the journey'' _ Eric Hansen,
an American travel writer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mardi Gras, Orlando style . . .: Get set for Mardi Gras 2000, a
44-night festival held Feb. 18 to April 1 at Universal Studios
Florida in Orlando. It's the longest-running Mardi Gras celebration
outside of New Orleans and comes complete with fancy floats and
wildly dressed float riders throwing tons of trinkets to the
crowds. You'll also find music from popular bands and Cajun-style
food. The party-hearty event, heading into its fifth year, is
included in the price of theme park admission. For more
information, call the Mardi Gras hot line at 407-224-5500. &QL; 
 &QL; 
. . . and Burlington style: The Magic Hat Mardi Gras parade returns
to downtown Burlington, Vt., Saturday, March 4, and its sponsors
promise it will be bigger and badder than ever. The zany parade,
which begins at 4 p.m., will be accompanied by an outdoor block
party at the Church Street Marketplace. And the night before, a
Magic Hat Masquerade Ball will be held at the Radisson Hotel from 7
p.m. to 1 a.m., featuring the Creole and Cajun sounds of Geno
Delafose and Balfa Tojours. For more information, call 802-86-FLYNN
or visit www.magichat.net. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: In Pennsylvania, ``any motorist driving along a
country road at night must stop every mile and send up a rocket
signal, wait 10 minutes for the road to be cleared of livestock,
and continue.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ship-on-shore dining: Here's a chance to feel as if you're on a
luxury cruise liner without leaving land. Boston's Hampshire House
restaurant and the Cunard Line are holding a QE2 Transatlantic
Theme Dinner Feb. 23, March 7, March 24, April 4, and April 18,
from 6-11 p.m. The setting will be the Hampshire House Library,
transformed to evoke the style of a grand dining room aboard the
Queen Elizabeth 2. ``Passengers'' will first have cocktails at a
Captain's Reception hosted by Hampshire House proprietor Tom
Kershaw. A British steward will announce dinner with the striking
of a brass bell, and a four-course meal with white-glove service
will be served as a music ensemble plays. The meal itself will be
reminiscent of those served on Cunard since 1840, with a red pepper
bisque, a broiled red snapper appetizer, grilled sirloin beef, and
a chocolate rum mousse. There also will be a chance to win a trip
for two on the QE2. The price is $60 a person. For more information
or reservations, call 617-227-9600. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum in
Farmington Hills, Mich., gives your senses a workout. Every
contraption there _ and there are hundreds _ blinks, whirs, makes
crazy noises, or does all three. The museum is a repository of
pinball games, fortune-telling machines, Nickelodeons, singing
stuffed animals, and dozens of other machines and games, many of
which you won't find elsewhere. And if you need to rest from all
that, there's a replica of the Sing Sing electric chair. The museum
is free but you'll need lots of change to operate the machines. For
more information, call 313-626-5020 or visit
www.marvin3m.com/video.htm. &QL;

&HT;     ATTACKER HITS INTERNET SECURITY COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Officials of an Internet security company
believe that a saboteur who invaded one of their World Wide Web
sites on Sunday may be linked to attacks that crippled some of the
biggest Web sites last week.
</P>
<P>
   The saboteur, identifying himself as ``Coolio,'' vandalized a
Web site linked to RSA Security Inc. of Bedford, Mass., RSA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it's possible this was the work of individuals
linked to last week's attack,'' said Scott Schnell, a senior vice
president at RSA.
</P>
<P>
   Joel De La Garza, a consultant at Securify, a security company
in Palo Alto, Calif., agreed that the RSA incident could be related
to the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information pertained on the defaced RSA Web page is
possibly consistent with information gathered in the other attacks.
We have pretty incriminating evidence,'' De La Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week an unprecedented computer assault shut down several of
the largest commercial Internet sites, including Yahoo, Amazon.com,
eBay, ETrade Group and ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   Called distributed denial-of-service assaults, the attacks sent
massive amounts of data requests from hijacked computers to Web
site computers, shutting down the systems for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating the incidents. George Grotz, an FBI
spokesman in San Francisco, said no charges had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Justice Department officials said investigators
want to question several hackers known by their Internet names,
including ``Coolio.''
</P>
<P>
   RSA said the saboteur did not gain access to its actual Web
site, but rather redirected traffic from one of its satellite
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently, the hacker broke into a server and caused it to
redirect people looking for the Web site RSA.com,'' Schnell said.
``Our actual site, RSAsecurity.com, was not affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell said the company has secondary Web addresses that refer
users to the main site, RSAsecurity.com. One of the secondary sites
is RSA.com.
</P>
<P>
   The altered version of RSA.com featured the same general look of
RSAsecurity.com, with the addition of the capital letter ``L''
placed on the foreheads of the RSA employees pictured.
</P>
<P>
   The site contained a number of messages. ``The most trusted name
in e-security has been owned,'' the intruder wrote, using lingo for
taking over a site. ``Big things are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, which ironically advertises a countermeasure for last
week's attacks, is signed off with the words, ``Owned by Coolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnell said RSA was working with a ``couple of different law
enforcement agencies on this.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``COLORS OF THE MOUNTAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Da Chen (Random House, $25)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is that rarity in these times, a truly marvelous book. Da
Chen was born in 1962, in a tiny town in southern China, and his
memoir begins with his childhood stories of life during the
Cultural Revolution. Chen's grandfather had been a wealthy
landlord, reason enough to incur relentless mistreatment for him
and his family (he lived with Chen's parents and their five
children), as well as the loss of their house, land and most
possessions. Food was scarce, humiliation was waiting around every
corner, and the future seemed without promise. And yet, the view
through young Chen's eyes is remarkably cheerful, made so by his
curiosity and pugnacity and by his parents' enduring dignity in the
face of their dreadfully altered lives. This big-hearted and
sometimes even humorous story is written in simple, evocative
prose, and it ends as Chen leaves for college in Beijing. It's a
moving moment, but not the book's first _ we were misty before we
got past the dedication. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE BRETHREN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Grisham (Doubleday, $27.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock a rich man, but we must give Grisham credit:
He doesn't take the advance and run. His new novel is inventive and
unpredictable, and very different from any of his previous books.
It focuses on three judges who are incarcerated in a
minimum-security prison for sins ranging from tax evasion to
driving drunkenly over two hikers in Yellowstone. In jail, they
preside over a ``court'' in which inmates file grievances against
each other (witnesses are expected to lie, and verdicts are quick
and without appeal). The judges also run a mail scheme in which
they pose as young, nubile inmates, bait wealthy men on the
outside, then blackmail them for the gay sex talk in their letters.
Trouble brews when they target Aaron Lake, U.S. congressman from
Arizona and the presidential candidate backed by the powerful
director of the CIA. Everyone's sleazy here, and the efforts at
damage control are complex and entertaining. When this one lands on
the bestseller lists, the honor will be deserved.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``MATCH WITS WITH MENSA'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Perseus, $19.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have found our omnipotence, and it is in vocabulary _ we will
stomp all challengers into the ground. It was the only subject in
this book at which we showed any prowess, but thank God there was
something. The editors say they have assembled more than 800
puzzles. We were struck by the inordinate amount of yakking that
precedes them. You must wade through much discussion of a category
_ trivia, analogies, logic etc. _ and a sometimes lengthy list of
acknowledgments before you get to the tests themselves, which makes
us think that Mensa members need rest between bouts of mental
exertion. We were also struck by how much Mensa members _ to be
one, you must score in the top two percent of the population on any
standard intelligence test _ like to look at themselves in the
mental mirror. But we digress. Here is what the editors consider to
be a ``warm-up'' trivia question: ``Domenikos Theotocopoulus is
better known as who?'' The answer is El Greco, the painter. We
looked it up.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE WHITE DEATH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By McKay Jenkins (Random House, $23.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls John McPhee his mentor, and you can see McPhee's
influence in the way Jenkins comes at his subject _ avalanches _
from all sides. His main path is the story of five young climbers
who died in an avalanche on Mount Cleveland in Montana's Glacier
National Park in 1969. He mixes the personal stories of those young
men with fascinating information about snow, mountains, rescues and
survival. He shows us how terrifying it is to be caught under snow,
not knowing which way is up (the only way to tell, he says, is to
spit _ whichever way it falls, you should dig, if you can move, in
the opposite direction), how you increase your chances for survival
if you remember to shut your mouth (many victims are found with
their mouths full of snow), how your chances plummet if you are not
rescued within minutes. Dogs have found people alive in 15 feet of
snow, sniffing them out by their individual scents. Each living
person smells different, Jenkins says. All corpses smell the same.

banning soft money contributions, Bush also proposes banning
contributions from lobbyists while Congress is in session. Texas
has a similar ban that prohibits anyone from contributing to
lawmakers while they're in session. The proposal is yet another

<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Growing up as a talented hockey player in
Wisconsin, Eric Heiden always had a dream of playing in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he declined an invitation to play on the U.S. World
Junior team. The decision was difficult, but it turned out to be
perhaps the best one Heiden ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago today, on the oval located in front of Lake
Placid High School and nestled directly in the heart of the
village, Heiden grabbed his first of five pieces of history _ the
gold medal in the 500-meter speedskating event at the 1980 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Four gold medals would follow in the next nine days, making
Heiden the first Olympian to claim five individual golds in one
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like it has been 20 years, that's for sure,''
Heiden said Monday. ``I look back at the time since Lake Placid,
and it seems to have flown by. A lifetime ago, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiden is 41 now and is an orthopedic surgeon in Davis, Calif.
His athletic career is over, but his challenges are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back at the accomplishments I've been able to
obtain, the greatest of them all is what I'm doing now,'' Heiden
said. ``It's a lot of work and it's not always fun. Skating was
always fun, even though it was a lot of work. I've had to work
harder now, so I appreciate this a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Plant, president of the Goodwill Games _ which will be held
Wednesday through Sunday in Lake Placid _ was in a meeting Monday
night at the Olympic Center, in an office that overlooks the
speedskating oval.
</P>
<P>
   The track had just been resurfaced, and to Plant _ who also is
the president of the U.S. Cycling Federation and who was one of
Heiden's U.S. speedskating teammates in 1980 _ it looked exactly
like it did two decades ago, when history was written with a steel
pen on icy parchment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't forget something like that,'' said Plant, who grew
up with Heiden in Madison, Wis. ``Eric is the kind of guy you put
up in a category with people like Jesse Owens. There are two people
in my life who had an incredible will to win. ... Eric Heiden and
(1999 Tour de France champion) Lance Armstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiden's efforts in 1980 are still legendary, and they led to
his being voted as the Associated Press' Men's Winter Olympic
athlete of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no fun,'' Norway's Frode Ronning, one of Heiden's
biggest rivals, said in 1980. ``You always knew he was going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And win he did, taking the 500-, 1,000-, 1,500-, 5,000- and
10,000-meter races, the last of which came one day after the U.S.
men's hockey team beat the Soviet Union 4-3 in the biggest upset in
Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea how to train for Heiden,'' Norway's coach, Sten
Stenson, told The New York Times in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Heiden hung up his skates after Lake Placid, choosing to focus
on another of his athletic passions _ cycling. He was enshrined in
the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1983, and one year later, came close to
competing in the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, where he was an
alternate on the U.S. cycling team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Heiden won the U.S. Professional Cycling championship,
and one year after that, he competed in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you begin to achieve goals, you want to keep achieving,''
Heiden said. ``And as you achieve certain goals, you want to move
on to other goals.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Plant still marvels at Heiden's work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when he was training, we helped push him,''
Plant said. ``But he knew how to win better than anyone. His dad
was a doctor, mine was a police chief. Not bad for a couple of
Cheeseheads, huh? We did OK in life. But we had to work at it, and
no one works harder than Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiden graduated from Stanford University Medical School in
1991, and he used the vacation time accrued during his surgical
residency to work as an analyst for CBS during the 1992 Winter
Olympics in Albertville and the 1994 Games in Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
   He completed that residency in 1996, and has been practicing
medicine ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Heiden's competitive days, at least on a worldwide scale, are
finished. But he likely will be a significant part of at least one
Olympic medal quest later this year, when the Summer Games are held
in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith, a WNBA star with the Sacramento Monarchs, tore
a ligament in her knee and was originally told she would not be
able to take part on the U.S. Olympic women's basketball team. Now,
she's fine, and it was Heiden who operated on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, surgery is like competition,'' Heiden said. ``You
rehearse what you're going to do, you make plans, you make
contingency plans, just like in competition, just like in surgery.
It's the same kind of energy, the same kind of nervous feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of feeling of accomplishment, too.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ John Delaney has a vision. It's under water. It's in
outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney, a University of Washington oceanographer, wants to
build a huge undersea observatory _ hundreds of miles in size _
deep down off the Pacific Northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   What we learn there, he says, will provide revolutionary new
insights into oceans and even into the search for extraterrestrial
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know that much about the ocean as a dynamic
entity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Neptune Project aims to change all that _ and more.
</P>
<P>
   It can be difficult to fully appreciate the scope of the Neptune
Project, in part because of the difficulty in categorizing
Delaney's scientific interests.
</P>
<P>
   He's an oceanographer who waxes on about the possibility of life
in the hidden oceans of Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa. He talks
plate tectonics like a geologist. He speaks of creating ``virtual
seafloors'' for schoolchildren to experience the ocean depths. He
builds consensus like a CEO. He quotes poet T.S. Eliot to
illuminate his science.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's this visionary who saw the need for this 15 years ago and
worked away at it quietly until now, when it's finally coming to
fruition,'' said Ross Heath, dean emeritus of the UW College of
Ocean and Fishery Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has kicked
in some early seed money for the Neptune Project shows that this
project has implications extending well beyond Earth-bound ocean
science.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to NASA, the National Science Foundation, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and the UW have
contributed more than $1 million total for Neptune Project
feasibility studies. The UW and Woods Hole have committed another
$1.3 million for starting up design and development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're particularly interested in the project because of
astrobiology,'' said Pat Beauchamp, director of NASA's program for
remote exploration, study and sample return (such as on Mars) at
JPL in Pasadena, CA.
</P>
<P>
   Astrobiology is NASA's word for the study of extraterrestrial
life. The reason NASA is interested in the Neptune Project is
because it will focus a good deal of its attention on a bizarre
kind of life found on Earth around undersea volcanos, otherwise
known as hydrothermal vents.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the questions we need to ask ourselves is how do you
determine what life is?'' Beauchamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the creatures living near these undersea volcanos were
unknown _ and completely unanticipated _ until just a few decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are the ``Archaea'' bacteria, microbes that feed on rock
and chemicals in complete darkness and under the extremely high
temperatures and pressures of the volcanic seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists now believe these bugs may have been the first
forms of life to appear on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   And if they were the first ones here, why not elsewhere? Like
Europa?
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound wild and crazy to some, but if there are
underwater vents on Europa then what we learn in the Neptune
Project here on Earth likely would be directly applicable to
Europa,'' said Beauchamp.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that doesn't sound so wild and crazy anymore is due
to recent photos of Europa taken during the Galileo spacecraft's
recent fly-by of Jupiter's moon.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks on the ice surface of Europa, combined with a lack of
craters, indicates a dynamic surface and fluid underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Because one of Jupiter's other moons, Io, is known to be a
raging volcanic orb, it seems likely Europa may also have a
volcanic core.
</P>
<P>
   We now know water and volcanic activity are sufficient to
support life, Delaney noted. It's not impossible, he said, that
even complex forms of life could have evolved and adapted to live
in Europa's ice-covered ocean.
</P>
<P>
   As ambitious and far-reaching as the Europa connection is to the
Neptune Project, it's only a small piece of the total picture.
</P>
<P>
   There are undersea observatories already out there, including
one system examining an volcano. NOAA's New Millenium Observatory
(NeMO) was located last year near an active undersea volcano known
as Axial on the Juan de Fuca Ridge some 250 miles off the
Washington-Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Neptune Project, however, would be a whole different animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on a much grander scope,'' said Stephen Hammond, in
charge of NeMO for NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.
``We're talking about hard-wiring an entire plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Neptune project, which would include NeMO, will encompass
the entire Juan de Fuca tectonic plate, a massive moving piece of
the earth's crust. This will require hundreds of miles of
fiber-optic cable hooked up to scientific instruments and cameras
designed to perform many different tasks.
</P>
<P>
   William Wilcock, a UW marine seismic scientist, said the project
would provide unprecedented study for those seeking to better
understand Pacific Northwest earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shallow structure of the oceanic crust is simpler than on
land,'' Wilcock said. The ability to study the stresses and strains
on an entire plate, he said, would give scientists new insights
into the Cascadia subduction zone and perhaps even identify times
of increased risk for seismic events.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney also envisions systems that enable researchers to study
and monitor fisheries and sea life. He gets especially excited when
talking about how Neptune can assist with education and public
involvement with science.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, he said, a room where schoolchildren can, in real-time,
remotely operate instruments that they can watch travel across the
seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about is more than just a new way to do
this science,'' Delaney said. ``We're talking about giving people a
new ability to see the world we live in.''

&HT;     OLYMPIC HOPEFUL FEASTS ON A DIET OF SWIMMING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Imagine slipping into the still water of a swimming pool at 5:30
a.m. six days a week for the first of two grueling, two-hour daily
workouts. Even if your goal is the upcoming Olympics, it can be
tough finding the motivation to rise hours before dawn to travel
over snowy roads only to push your body as hard as you possibly
can.
</P>
<P>
   But Richelle Fox's exhausting workout regimen is paying off in
an unexpected way: In the past two months she has suddenly become
an international poster girl for swimming fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was one of six female athletes featured in the December
issue of Marie Claire magazine. The story, ``How I Created the Body
I Need,'' let each woman describe in detail her workout and diet
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Fox followed up that appearance with a similar picture-story in
Mademoiselle's January issue, with dramatic pictures of the
butterfly specialist churning through the water. Other athletes
were also featured, but Fox was once again the face _ and body _
for swimming in a major women's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a prior commitment to be training in Puerto Rico, Fox
would have been featured in an upcoming issue of Self magazine. But
she was unavailable, thus missing an opportunity for a trifecta of
appearances in national magazines.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the United States national swim team, the
25-year-old Fox lives and trains in Westchester County, in suburban
New York. The self-effacing swimmer dismisses her back-to-back
magazine spreads as a simple matter of location, her suburban home
making her a convenient person for New York City photographers.
</P>
<P>
   But convenience doesn't fully explain why Fox is now making a
splash out of the water. The statuesque swimmer, who carries 142
well-sculpted pounds on a 5-foot-9-inch frame, does not only look
terrific. She also follows a diet that defies the very word, an
eat-as-much-as-I-can routine that might be considered an
inspiration to anyone who trains religiously and is unsure about
how much to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine having to watch everything I put into my
mouth,'' Fox said during a recent telephone interview. ``I eat and
burn off about 5,000 calories a day.''
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, Fox starts with a protein shake before her
5:30 a.m. pool hours. After the workout she gulps down a
carbo/protein drink to hold her over until she gets home, where a
stack of pancakes awaits. She snacks on yogurt and fruit during the
morning, and at lunch will make a hoagie with turkey and cheese.
Before her afternoon workout she usually has an energy bar.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner Fox regularly eats more than her husband of almost
three years, David Fox, who was on the gold-medal winning freestyle
relay team at the 1996 Olympics. He's an investment banker with
Goldman Sachs and commutes to Wall Street daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have one or two pork chops, a baked potato, veggies and
salad. I might have that too, but then I'll have a second round.
After dinner, if there's ice cream around or cookies, I'll down
those,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite consuming more than double the recommended daily calorie
total, Fox's weight has not fluctuated by more than a mere pound
since she was a high school swimmer in Scotia, N.Y., winning race
after race and earning a full scholarship to the University of
California at Los Angeles. Her older brother, Kyle, who made waves
as a high school student when he obtained a court order to swim on
the Scotia-Glenville girls team because there was no boys swimming
program, was also on the UCLA swim team.

</P>
<P>
   While Fox has suddenly become the poster girl for swimming
fitness, she says she didn't earn any money for either magazine
spread. Even though Fox has an agent who helps her find sponsors
among nutrition and swimwear companies, she agreed to both photo
shoots solely for self-exposure and to promote her sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't consider me valuable enough to charge for these
things,'' Fox said. ``It's been a lot of fun. Years from now, I'll
look back on it and think it was a pretty good experience to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is eagerly hoping that she'll also have an opportunity to
one day look back on the upcoming Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia, and reflect on a wonderful experience. After training in
Colorado Springs for two years, she failed to make the U.S. team in
1996, performing poorly at the trials and missing the team by two
places.
</P>
<P>
   She has trained diligently ever since, making the most of her
affiliation with the national team. Between clinics and swim meets,
Fox has been to Brazil twice in the past year, she swam in the
Pan-Pacific Games in Australia last year and this month she is
competing in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Now her sights are on the Olympic trials in August. So focused
is Fox that she named her Great Dane puppy Sydney, after the
Australian city and site of the games. ``We gave her that name
because hopefully I'll get there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a degree in exercise science, Fox envisions a future
in corporate fitness, perhaps as a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's always warning me, `Someday you're going to have a
job and a normal life.' The advice I hear from other swimmers who
have stopped is to swim as long as you can,'' Fox said. ``I think I
may be lost at first when I make the transition to having a normal
life.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ Keisuke Itai, a former sumo wrestler, says he will come
out of hiding this week to unveil proof that the sport's governing
body knew about bout fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly magazine Shukan Gendai had been running a series of
exclusive interviews with Itai, a 43-year-old former wrestler, in
which he said sumo was plagued with bout-rigging.
</P>
<P>
   Itai said that for five years until his retirement in 1991 he
had overseen much of the match-fixing, explaining his nickname of
``Bookmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine last week, Itai said there was a ``smoking gun''
tape he recorded in 1989 at a secret meeting of the Sumo
Association, the sport's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Itai said the tape, which the magazine authenticated and the
Sumo Association has not disputed, proved that the sport's top
officials were aware of bout-rigging but had done nothing to stop
it _ a charge that officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest revelations, the Sumo Association
threatened Itai with a lawsuit for defamation. Now, Itai says he
fears for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Itai said two friends, both sumo insiders, had told him that
someone had offered the Kominto, a powerful rightist group, 300
million yen ($2.7 million) to ``get you.''
</P>
<P>
   The same group was reportedly after Onaruto _ Itai's former
coach and the last sumo insider to allege widespread match-rigging
_ when he died mysteriously in 1996. Onaruto died a month before
his own expose was published, but police reported no evidence of
foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Itai also said that a reporter from Shukan Gendai had heard that
the Kodokai, a vicious organized-crime gang, had been offered 50
million yen to silence Itai.
</P>
<P>
   Itai said he had no way of confirming the threats. All the same,
he went into hiding Monday, reportedly fleeing with only a change
of clothes, a copy of his ``smoking gun'' tape and some of his
favorite jazz recordings.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bookmaker'' was still prepared to take a gamble. On
Friday, he came back to Tokyo to prepare for what he hopes will be
a crushing blow: the distribution of copies of his secret tape at a
news conference this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in his room at a grimy hotel close to the Sumo
Association's headquarters, Itai handed a copy of the tape to the
International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, which runs for 17 minutes, several top Sumo
Association officials, identified by Itai and Shukan Gendai,
address roughly 100 wrestlers and coaches at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Shinichi Morishima, a top official, warns the
audience that ``rigged sumo,'' which he also described as
``spiritless, lazy sumo,'' could be the downfall of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When wrestlers participate in sumo wrestling that is
spiritless, the essence of sumo is lost,'' he says. ``If wrestlers
can maintain their position or the Sumo Association lets this take
place, we will get used to it, and it will spread. In other words,
sumo will cease to be what it is and become a show.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape makes it clear that sumo authorities knew of
bout-rigging but did not back up a warning with any action.
</P>
<P>
   Itai said he had made the tape after the Shukan Post, another
Japanese weekly, alleged that match-fixing in sumo was widespread.
Itai recorded the proceedings on a Walkman that he said he carried
for listening to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recorded it without giving it much thought,'' he said. ``I
didn't realize how explosive the tape was until after I retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Shukan Gendai said it had told Tokitsukaze, the head of the Sumo
Association, about the tape before publishing Itai's story and that
Tokitsukaze had said the meeting was not about match-fixing but
merely about allegations at the time. He characterized Itai's
interpretation of the gathering as misleading. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese say they suspect Itai is publicizing his
allegations for ulterior motives. Itai, a member of the God Light
Association, a small religious group, has said he is on a mission
to cleanse Japan's national sport of bout-fixing. That, he says, is
the only way to halt the sport's slide in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Itai said he found it difficult to foresee the outcome of the
events he had set in motion. He said he expected little official
help, as Japan has no witness-protection program to shield him from
purported assassins.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the only possible breach of the law in this case is
a failure by wrestlers to declare bribe income to the tax
authorities. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Probably only one thing is certain: that the sumo world will
ostracize Itai for triggering one of the most wide-ranging scandals
in its 400-year history. &QL;

   Cons: While Oscar accepts alternative lifestyles now, it has yet
to reward anything as strange as this.
</P>

   JERUSALEM _ Anyone who seeks the roots of Joerg Haider's ideas
in the Nazi era is wrong. The roots go much deeper and are, in a
way, much more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wants to understand the origins and texture of the
Haider phenomenon should go back to 1895-1897.
</P>
<P>
   Then the basically liberal, multiethnic and tolerant (albeit
already decrepit) structure of the Habsburg monarchy was challenged
by the emergence of a populist, xenophobic and racist Viennese
politician named Karl Lueger.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Vienna was the height of rapid economic and
industrial development that drew to the mainly German-speaking
metropolis hundreds of thousands of migrants from the non-Germanic
parts of the empire _ Czechs from Bohemia, Slovaks from upper
Hungary, Jews from Galicia and Bukowina.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the ethnic German majority in Vienna felt overwhelmed
and threatened. That these migrants were not technically foreigners
was irrelevant. Not being ethnic Germans, they were culturally and
linguistically different.
</P>
<P>
   Lueger was a local Viennese politician who started as a radical
democrat, standing up for the ``little man'' against state
bureaucracy and corruption. A dashing charmer (known as ``der
Schone Karl'') and a good public speaker, he soon took an
anti-foreign line against Czechs and other Slavs and against the
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He promised voters in Vienna municipal elections to keep as many
foreigners out as possible, to make it hard for Czech migrants to
get city social benefits and to stop teaching Czech in schools.
Vienna would remains ``ours.''
</P>
<P>
   On this platform he won the municipal elections in 1895. The
aging and liberal Emperor Francis Joseph I declined to give the
required imperial assent to his installation as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Lueger went on to win elections, and the emperor repeatedly
refused to yield until finally, in 1897, he bowed to the ``will of
the people,'' and Lueger became mayor.
</P>
<P>
   During the days between Lueger's election and his inauguration
as mayor, a liberal Jewish journalist on the staff of the Neue
Freie Presse wrote in his diary a ``new St. Bartholomew's Night''
threatened to descend on Europe. Fellow liberals thought he was
exaggerating.
</P>
<P>

   JERUSALEM _ Anyone who seeks the roots of Joerg Haider's ideas
in the Nazi era is wrong. The roots go much deeper and are, in a
way, much more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wants to understand the origins and texture of the
Haider phenomenon should go back to 1895-1897.
</P>
<P>
   Then the basically liberal, multiethnic and tolerant (albeit
already decrepit) structure of the Habsburg monarchy was challenged
by the emergence of a populist, xenophobic and racist Viennese
politician named Karl Lueger.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Vienna was the height of rapid economic and
industrial development that drew to the mainly German-speaking
metropolis hundreds of thousands of migrants from the non-Germanic
parts of the empire _ Czechs from Bohemia, Slovaks from upper
Hungary, Jews from Galicia and Bukowina.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the ethnic German majority in Vienna felt overwhelmed
and threatened. That these migrants were not technically foreigners
was irrelevant. Not being ethnic Germans, they were culturally and
linguistically different.
</P>
<P>
   Lueger was a local Viennese politician who started as a radical
democrat, standing up for the ``little man'' against state
bureaucracy and corruption. A dashing charmer (known as ``der
Schone Karl'') and a good public speaker, he soon took an
anti-foreign line against Czechs and other Slavs and against the
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He promised voters in Vienna municipal elections to keep as many
foreigners out as possible, to make it hard for Czech migrants to
get city social benefits and to stop teaching Czech in schools.
Vienna would remains ``ours.''
</P>
<P>
   On this platform he won the municipal elections in 1895. The
aging and liberal Emperor Francis Joseph I declined to give the
required imperial assent to his installation as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Lueger went on to win elections, and the emperor repeatedly
refused to yield until finally, in 1897, he bowed to the ``will of
the people,'' and Lueger became mayor.
</P>
<P>
   During the days between Lueger's election and his inauguration
as mayor, a liberal Jewish journalist on the staff of the Neue
Freie Presse wrote in his diary a ``new St. Bartholomew's Night''
threatened to descend on Europe. Fellow liberals thought he was
exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist's name was Theodor Herzl. In 1896, in the shadow
of Lueger's campaign and election, he wrote his pamphlet ``Der
Judenstaat.'' The next year, he convened the first Zionist
Congress, in Basel. After all, a Vienna, a Europe democratically
electing to power a racist and xenophobic politician would be a
dangerous place for Jews to live.

&HT;     BUDGET CUTS PUT ART IN JEOPARDY

   &HT;     (Eds: Refiling to correct garble in byline)  
 &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By COREY FISCHER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I recently was invited to the Kennedy Center in
Washington D.C. to receive an award from the Fund for New American
Plays for ``See Under: Love,'' a play I adapted from a novel by the
same name by David Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has been struggling in the trenches of
non-commercial theater for over 25 years, the call from Washington
was heady stuff, and I felt extremely grateful for the recognition.
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington, I paid a visit to another institution to
which I feel an enormous debt of gratitude: the National Endowment
for the Arts. A Traveling Jewish Theatre _ the nonprofit theater I
helped found and still co-direct _ would probably not have survived
for over two decades had it not been funded in its formative years
by the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   When I stepped out of the wrought-iron elevator on the seventh
floor of the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, I was
confronted with tangible evidence of what it means to be on the
front lines of the so-called culture wars.
</P>
<P>
   File cabinets and conference tables line the hallways. Piles of
records, grant applications and videotapes are stacked wherever
there's an inch of space.
</P>
<P>
   The office quarters have been reduced by more than one third of
the already modest size they'd reached in ``the good years.'' When
I met with staff members, we sat on a well-worn sofa and chair
squeezed between several cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   One key program officer couldn't join the meeting because of the
enormous work load she's carrying. In addition to space, the
National Endowment for the Arts lost more than one-third of its
staff and nearly half its budget when it became a political
football between 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The good people of the NEA, like residents of a besieged city,
do what they can to maintain a sense of normality. They screen
applications, organize site visits, develop new initiatives, meet
with artists and members of Congress. And, yet, I leave convinced
that the situation is anything but normal.
</P>
<P>
   It is not normal for the leaders of a great democracy to turn
against one of the most basic human impulses: the creation of art.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, all societies that have done so have been equally
hostile to any expression of human freedom. This animus toward art
is often couched in the argument that in the absence of government
support, the market will best determine what kind of art should be
nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the market supports art that is marketable. Such art
may be of high quality. It may satisfy our needs for entertainment
or diversion. But art-as-product rarely provokes, challenges or
innovates.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, when public support for the arts was generous and
broad, artists created a body of work that became part of America's
deep cultural memory: the photos of Dorothea Lange, the songs of
Woody Guthrie, the theater of John Houseman and Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, government support, through the newly
created NEA, helped support a vital legacy in the form of
institutions like the Lincoln Center, the Guthrie Theater, the
Public Theater, scores of museums, creative writing programs and a
national network of neighborhood arts programs, resident theaters,
symphonies and dance companies.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat among the cubicles and the overflowing files at the
NEA, I began to fear for that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the theater and other unmarketable art forms will
persevere, one way or another. The need to create simply runs too
deep to be extinguished by budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, walking back through the overcrowded hallway, I wondered at
all the dreams and hard work that lay buried in the piles of grant
applications stacked along the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that these nascent theaters, dance companies and
musical groups will still exist 20 years from now are all too slim
as long as our cultural future continues to be held hostage by
politics.

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ Deep in the mountains of Austria's rural southern
Carinthia region, the Baerental forest extends over 1,600 hectares
(4,000 acres). It is prime timber and hunting land that has helped
build the fortune of its owner, the governor of Carinthia and the
leader of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jewish family that was forced to sell the ``Valley of
the Bears'' on the eve of World War II, in a murky transaction
involving Haider's relatives and blocked bank accounts, says the
sale was illegal and immoral. Now, the family wants justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider got rich selling my family's wood, and he is in power
now with the help of my money,'' said Naomi Merhav, the 73-year old
daughter of Giorgio Roifer, whose land Haider now owns.
</P>
<P>
   Amid international concern that he is whitewashing Austria's
World War II collaboration with Nazi Germany, Haider began a
political offensive last week, promising to ``take pertinent
measures'' where Austria has ``inflicted great injustice on our
Jewish fellow citizens or wiped out their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how Haider obtained the Baerental goes to the
same issue, but also points up the ambiguity of Nazi-era
transactions and the difficulty of dealing with present-day claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austria has had one of the worst records on restitution of any
country in Europe, and the origin of Haider's own property
underscores the need to be concerned about Haider's position on
restitution,'' said Richard Chesnoff, author of the recent book
``Pack of Thieves,'' about the Nazi theft of Jewish property across
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, as fascism began to spread across Europe, Nazi Germany,
which by then included Austria, began confiscating the property of
Jews and others.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nuremberg laws, Jews were forbidden to own property in
the Reich. Land, homes, paintings and other valuables were
``Aryanized'' and ``de-Jewified'' _ the terminology of the day _
and given to racially pure Nazi party members.
</P>
<P>
   The Roifers' lush forest was an attractive property, and several
Nazi officials wanted the land. But the Roifers were citizens of
Italy, an ally of Hitler's, and it was only when the Creditanstalt
Bank in Vienna abruptly and for unclear reasons foreclosed on a
long-term loan to Roifer, an Italian Jewish timber merchant from
Pisa, that the family was forced to sell, according to Austrian
press reports, court documents and Nazi-era records.
</P>
<P>
   Roifer came to Austria, but died before he was able to sell the
woods to a friendly local businessman named Max Goetz.
</P>
<P>
   Roifer's widow, Mathilde, asked her brother to try to sell the
land to Goetz, and then fled to Palestine with her three children.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider's great-great-uncle, Josef Webhofer, a local Nazi
official, intervened, and the Roifer family sold him the land at
what the family says was a fraction of its value. The deal was
closed in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian press reports say the Baerental is worth about $16
million today.
</P>
<P>
   A Haider associate sued an Austrian magazine that wrote about
the case in 1986. The suit was over a separate issue, on which he
won. But Judge Doris Treib wrote in her opinion that the way the
Roifer family lost the land was ``clearly scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that this Mrs. Roifer was deprived of this
property by coercion,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence to this effect included a notation by a Nazi forestry
official in Vienna that the legal documents authorizing the sale
were not valid. On the back of the power of attorney papers, he had
written that the power of attorney of ``the Jewish seller,'' Mrs.
Roifer, had expired.
</P>
<P>
   But in twisted legal language that circumvented this problem he
added that ``at the request of the buyer Josef Webhofer,'' a lawyer
named Heinz Bruenner would be unilaterally designated as an
``intermediary for the further selling of the forested estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merhav contends that without a valid power of attorney, the
original sale of the Baerental to Webhofer was invalid. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October 1940, Webhofer bought the Baerental for 300,000
German Reichmarks, equivalent to only a few years' income from the
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Creditanstalt loan was paid off, and in a common Nazi-era
practice of further restricting Jews' access to their property, the
remaining money went to a blocked bank account in Italy that Mrs.
Roifer's relatives could not touch. By the end of the war,
inflation had whittled it down to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sum that was paid was peanuts,'' Mrs. Merhav, a retired
museum curator, said in a recent interview from her home in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Mrs. Roifer returned to Austria to seek
compensation, but the courts refused her. Only in 1954 did she get
anything from Webhofer for her family's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother succeeded in getting something that is worth today
about $120,000,'' Mrs. Merhav said. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not entirely clear, Haider was given the
land as a gift in 1986 by Webhofer's son Wilhelm, and he has argued
that his family obtained it legally.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned in 1989, Haider told the Austrian magazine Profil
that the Roifer family must have done well out of the sale because
it was brokered by ``the Jew Loew from Villach.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Franz Josef Maria Loew, who handled the sale, was
baptized in a Roman Catholic church in Schottenfeld in 1895, Profil
reported. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 950) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merhav last saw the Baerental woods as a small girl, and
says that while the Austrians may have authorized the sale, the
scrawled notes on the power of attorney document show it was
probably illegal even under Nazi law.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Merhav maintains, Josef Webhofer's heirs should return
the land or pay up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to see Mr. Haider,'' Mrs. Merhav said, ``I would
tell him, `Look, you have my land, perhaps illegally. If it is
legal, it is not ethical or moral. The forest was sold to a man
called Webhofer, but morally I should get some compensation.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is, Mrs. Merhav said, a fine line between selling the land
by choice, and being forced to sell it. ``My mother signed the
paper because she thought it was the least worse choice,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she added, ``we thought it would be a
thousand-year reich.'' &QL;

<P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merhav said that she and her son Zvi had recently decided
to demand either the land or comparable compensation from Haider
and the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of the Baerental to Haider raised eyebrows at the time
even among senior Freedom Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   After the court case involving Haider's associate, one unnamed
official was quoted by the Austrian magazine Basta as saying:
``Haider has just two options after this court case and all the
documents that have emerged: Separate himself from his property or
separate himself from the party chairmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider did neither. The feud came just as it was revealed that
Austria's then-president, Kurt Waldheim, had been a Nazi, and
Haider instead accused his own political opponents of orchestrating
a groundless attack against his increasingly powerful Austrian
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the big parties have been unable to find anything
in my private life, the Israeli dirt slingers of the Waldheim
campaign have started coming,'' he said at the time. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The Roifers are not the only Jewish family still awaiting the
return of property confiscated during Austria's Nazi era, or
equitable compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five thousand Austrian Jews died in Nazi concentration
camps during World War II. About 21,000 Austrian Jewish Holocaust
survivors still live around the world, and they have tens of
thousands of claims outstanding against Austria for confiscated
property that is now in the hands of the Austrian state or private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While Germany has largely settled claims for property
confiscated from its Jewish citizens, Austria has returned only a
small fraction of the land, art objects and other valuables already
identified as stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Biblical injunction that murderers shall not be
inheritors,'' said Alissa Kaplan, of the Committee for Jewish
Claims on Austria. &QL;

   VIENNA _ Deep in the mountains of Austria's rural southern
Carinthia region, the Baerental forest extends over 1,600 hectares
(4,000 acres). It is prime timber and hunting land that has helped
build the fortune of its owner, the governor of Carinthia and the
leader of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jewish family that was forced to sell the ``Valley of

sale was illegal and immoral. Now, the family wants justice.

   ``Haider got rich selling my family's wood, and he is in power

   Amid international concern that he is whitewashing Austria's
World War II collaboration with Nazi Germany, Haider began a
political offensive last week, promising to ``take pertinent

Jewish fellow citizens or wiped out their families.''

and given to racially pure Nazi party members.
</P>
<P>
   The Roifers' lush forest was an attractive property, and several
Nazi officials wanted the land. But the Roifers were citizens of
Italy, an ally of Hitler's, and it was only when the Creditanstalt
Bank in Vienna abruptly and for unclear reasons foreclosed on a
long-term loan to Roifer, an Italian Jewish timber merchant from
Pisa, that the family was forced to sell, according to Austrian
press reports, court documents and Nazi-era records.
</P>
<P>
   Roifer came to Austria, but died before he was able to sell the
woods to a friendly local businessman named Max Goetz.
</P>
<P>
   Roifer's widow, Mathilde, asked her brother to try to sell the
land to Goetz, and then fled to Palestine with her three children.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider's great-great-uncle, Josef Webhofer, a local Nazi
official, intervened, and the Roifer family sold him the land at
what the family says was a fraction of its value. The deal was
closed in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian press reports say the Baerental is worth about $16
million today.
</P>
<P>
   A Haider associate sued an Austrian magazine that wrote about
the case in 1986. The suit was over a separate issue, on which he
won. But Judge Doris Treib wrote in her opinion that the way the
Roifer family lost the land was ``clearly scandalous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that this Mrs. Roifer was deprived of this
property by coercion,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence to this effect included a notation by a Nazi forestry
official in Vienna that the legal documents authorizing the sale
were not valid. On the back of the power of attorney papers, he had
written that the power of attorney of ``the Jewish seller,'' Mrs.
Roifer, had expired.
</P>
<P>
   But in twisted legal language that circumvented this problem he
added that ``at the request of the buyer Josef Webhofer,'' a lawyer
named Heinz Bruenner would be unilaterally designated as an
``intermediary for the further selling of the forested estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merhav contends that without a valid power of attorney, the
original sale of the Baerental to Webhofer was invalid. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October 1940, Webhofer bought the Baerental for 300,000
German Reichmarks, equivalent to only a few years' income from the
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Creditanstalt loan was paid off, and in a common Nazi-era
practice of further restricting Jews' access to their property, the
remaining money went to a blocked bank account in Italy that Mrs.
Roifer's relatives could not touch. By the end of the war,
inflation had whittled it down to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sum that was paid was peanuts,'' Mrs. Merhav, a retired
museum curator, said in a recent interview from her home in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Mrs. Roifer returned to Austria to seek
compensation, but the courts refused her. Only in 1954 did she get
anything from Webhofer for her family's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother succeeded in getting something that is worth today
about $120,000,'' Mrs. Merhav said. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not entirely clear, Haider was given the
land as a gift in 1986 by Webhofer's son Wilhelm, and he has argued
that his family obtained it legally.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned in 1989, Haider told the Austrian magazine Profil
that the Roifer family must have done well out of the sale because
it was brokered by ``the Jew Loew from Villach.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Franz Josef Maria Loew, who handled the sale, was
baptized in a Roman Catholic church in Schottenfeld in 1895, Profil
reported. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 950) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merhav last saw the Baerental woods as a small girl, and
says that while the Austrians may have authorized the sale, the
scrawled notes on the power of attorney document show it was
probably illegal even under Nazi law.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Merhav maintains, Josef Webhofer's heirs should return
the land or pay up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to see Mr. Haider,'' Mrs. Merhav said, ``I would
tell him, `Look, you have my land, perhaps illegally. If it is
legal, it is not ethical or moral. The forest was sold to a man
called Webhofer, but morally I should get some compensation.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is, Mrs. Merhav said, a fine line between selling the land
by choice, and being forced to sell it. ``My mother signed the
paper because she thought it was the least worse choice,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she added, ``we thought it would be a
thousand-year reich.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Merhav said that she and her son Zvi had recently decided
to demand either the land or comparable compensation from Haider
and the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of the Baerental to Haider raised eyebrows at the time
even among senior Freedom Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   After the court case involving Haider's associate, one unnamed
official was quoted by the Austrian magazine Basta as saying:
``Haider has just two options after this court case and all the
documents that have emerged: Separate himself from his property or
separate himself from the party chairmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider did neither. The feud came just as it was revealed that
Austria's then-president, Kurt Waldheim, had been a Nazi, and
Haider instead accused his own political opponents of orchestrating
a groundless attack against his increasingly powerful Austrian
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the big parties have been unable to find anything
in my private life, the Israeli dirt slingers of the Waldheim
campaign have started coming,'' he said at the time. &QL;

<P>
   The Roifers are not the only Jewish family still awaiting the
return of property confiscated during Austria's Nazi era, or
equitable compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five thousand Austrian Jews died in Nazi concentration
camps during World War II. About 21,000 Austrian Jewish Holocaust
survivors still live around the world, and they have tens of
thousands of claims outstanding against Austria for confiscated
property that is now in the hands of the Austrian state or private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While Germany has largely settled claims for property
confiscated from its Jewish citizens, Austria has returned only a
small fraction of the land, art objects and other valuables already
identified as stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Biblical injunction that murderers shall not be
inheritors,'' said Alissa Kaplan, of the Committee for Jewish
Claims on Austria. &QL;

In defiance of the theocracy, Iranian women are proving

changed laws on employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women have

<P>
   A generation after it seized power, Iran's revolutionary regime
is deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   It is fractured by intense political divisions, endangered by
economic disorder, discredited by rampant corruption and smothered
in social restrictions no longer acceptable to large sectors of the
changing population.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, the Islamic Republic of Iran often appears
to be at a precipice, its unique theocratic government on the verge
of imploding from internal tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year its domestic drama has played out visibly,
and sometimes violently, in killings by a rogue death squad,
newspaper closures, student unrest, political trials and, as
always, uneasy relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran, often in spite of the theocrats, has begun to achieve
one of the revolution's original goals: empowering the people. For
new social and political movements are blossoming defiantly,
ranging from religious reform and cultural expression to women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   True, the theocratic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, austere form because of
profound internal problems. Yet the driving force behind the
revolution has proven adaptable enough to allow Iranians to get for
themselves what the theocracy has failed to provide. Iran's
increasingly savvy population is taking stands on social issues,
making demands and even defying the theocrats.
</P>
<P>
   _ The First Republic (1979-1989). Iran's revolution was about
more than getting rid of an unpopular leader. After the shah's
ouster, the coterie around Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini gradually
crafted a theocracy instead of a democracy. Human rights were
virtually ignored during the decade-long ``First Republic,'' which
lasted from 1979 until Khomeini's death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The regime's zealots became obsessed with deconstructing the
past and winning converts to their cause, both at home and in the
region. The new state survived only by crushing dissent, spending
its foreign exchange reserves and tapping into fierce, age-old
Persian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, seeds of public empowerment were planted and grew.
The ``construction jihad'' _ carried out by teams of development
experts and builders _ brought progress in the form of new schools,
social services, clinics, electricity, television and roads to the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution particularly excelled in education, in quantity
if not always in quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, only half of Iran's youth between the ages of
six and 24 were literate. Two decades later, the number had grown
to 93 percent _ even though the population had doubled. And
students remained in school longer: The number of university
graduates soared from 430,000 in the late 1970s to more than 4
million in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This success spurred people's expectations of a greater role in
the system and access to new instruments of progress.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Second Republic (1989-1997). During President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's tenure, Iran graduated to realistically dealing with
the present. One might say that the government of God plummeted
back to earth _ with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   The new leadership initially promoted physical reconstruction of
the nation, economic reform and a diplomatic thaw. But without the
Ayatollah's authority, longstanding political divisions deepened
and paralysis set in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a brief try at privatization, including reviving the
monarchy's stock market, the promise of change remained largely
unfulfilled. In the end, the regime's blatantly manipulative
tactics kept it from achieving its goals, instead spawning
corruption, deepening debt and social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the very policies that Rafsanjani introduced to
win back the support of a war-weary public inadvertently
jump-started the process of the people's empowerment. The regime
sporadically tolerated cultural freedoms and relaxed some of its
social restrictions. It also facilitated a consumer spending spree
on imports by making credit available.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world soon flooded back in, through satellite
dishes, videos, computers and textbooks full of ideas. From that
point on, the tide of information could no longer be controlled,
regardless how hard Iranian conservatives and clerics tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Second Republic also overlapped with the end of the Cold
War, which Iranians felt deeply because of their shared border with
the Soviet Union. The collapse of Soviet rule _ in a country with
superpower resources _ sent a powerful warning about the
vulnerability of revolutionary regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iran's upheaval was part of global change, including the
demise of communism in Europe, white rule in Africa and military
dictatorships in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's theocracy came to recognize that it was endangering its
own agenda by ignoring the state's real problems _ for example, its
``population policy.'' In the 1980s, millions of women had obeyed
the theocrats' dictate to breed a new Islamic generation that would
defend the revolution. In seven years Iran's population jumped from
34 million to more than 50 million; it is now 70 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the clerics soon realized that soaring population numbers
were more likely to undo the revolution than to save it. So they
introduced one of the world's most extensive family-planning
programs. Every form of birth control, from condoms and pills to
sterilization, became free.
</P>
<P>
   Today all couples have to undergo and pass a family-planning
course before obtaining a marriage license. Thousands of women
mobilized by the Health Ministry have gone door-to-door to explain
the necessity of birth control. Clerics, preaching the benefits of
small family size, have issued decrees approving everything from
intrauterine devices to vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Third Republic (1997 to present). In the 1997 presidential
election, which had the highest turnout since the Iranian people
endorsed revolution, 70 percent of Iran's voters spurned the
theocrats' candidate of choice. Instead they elected a dark-horse
cleric named Mohammad Khatami, a former minister of culture and
Islamic guide who was purged in 1992 for ``liberalism'' and
''negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The election marked the burgeoning of what is by now a very
public fight for empowerment. The outcome of the Iranian elections
will at least partly reflect the degree of Khatami's success in
restoring the rule of law, fostering a civil society (two of his
campaign pledges), and wresting power from the religious
superstructure _ the theocratic part of Iran's system _ that limits
the government's powers.
</P>
<P>
   But more likely, Iran's future will be decided by the newly
energized popular forces that made Khatami's election possible in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Even clerics who have held high office and intellectuals who
were proteges of the Ayatollah Khomeini are now challenging the
religion's basic precepts as well as the specifics of theocratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   For example, all of Tehran was engrossed last autumn in the
trial of Abdollah Nouri, a cleric and editor of the newspaper
Khordad, who served during the Third Republic as vice president,
interior minister and Tehran city councilor. The Special Court for
the Clergy charged him with multiple counts of ``insulting'' Islam,
the prophet Muhammad and the Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, a close supporter of President Khatami, had run articles
in Khordad that questioned everything from the Islamic concept of
eye-for-eye justice to the clergy's automatic right to hold power.
At his trial, he astonished Iranians by denying the court's right
to judge him: ``I totally reject the court, its membership, and its
competence to conduct this trial, and any verdict you reach will
have no legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Nouri was sentenced to five years in prison.
His newspaper was banned, although his staff defiantly pledged to
launch another publication _ the new way of getting around forced
closures.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nouri, Mohsen Kadivar, a popular young cleric and professor
put on trial for ``disseminating lies and disturbing public
opinion'' by advocating the separation of political and religious
institutions, rejected the clergy's right to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being convicted and receiving an 18-month sentence,
Kadivar gained celebrity status. Posters of him were plastered all
over Tehran. Students held a candlelight vigil in the hills near
Evin prison, where he was being held without bail. Chanting
``freedom of thought, forever, forever,'' they released doves as a
symbol of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the world around it, Iran is still undergoing a profound
transformation. More internal turmoil lies ahead, as the
revolution's early passions are replaced by hard-earned pragmatism,
and as arrogance gives way to realism among many sectors of Iranian
society.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the government of God is being forced to cede to
secular statecraft _ and to empower Iranians.
</P>

<P>
   A generation after it seized power, Iran's revolutionary regime
is deeply troubled.
</P>
<P>
   It is fractured by intense political divisions, endangered by
economic disorder, discredited by rampant corruption and smothered
in social restrictions no longer acceptable to large sectors of the
changing population.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, the Islamic Republic of Iran often appears
to be at a precipice, its unique theocratic government on the verge
of imploding from internal tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year its domestic drama has played out visibly,
and sometimes violently, in killings by a rogue death squad,
newspaper closures, student unrest, political trials and, as
always, uneasy relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iran, often in spite of the theocrats, has begun to achieve
one of the revolution's original goals: empowering the people. For
new social and political movements are blossoming defiantly,
ranging from religious reform and cultural expression to women's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   True, the theocratic regime that seized power in 1979 is
unlikely to survive in its current, austere form because of

<P>
   Iranian women are by far the most politically active in the
Persian Gulf and are among the most empowered in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 200 women ran for the 270-seat parliament and 14 won.
In 1997, four women registered to run for the presidency. Although
all were disqualified by the Council of Guardians that vets
candidates, the decision was not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Khatami's stunning upset victory in the 1997
presidential election, in which 70 percent of the voters said no to
the hard-line conservative candidate, would not have happened
without the female vote. And as president, Khatami appointed a
female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 5,000 women ran in local elections, and 300 won. Today,
more than 40 percent of university students are female, as are
one-third of faculty members. Thousands of women educated after the
revolution work as engineers, doctors, scientists, lawyers and even
clerics. More than 340 directors-general in government ministries
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of
books and magazines published by women only. Women have become
painters, authors, designers, photographers, movie producers,
directors, stars and sculptors crafting ``anatomically correct''
female figures (otherwise known as nudes).
</P>
<P>
   A fierce women's movement was not what the theocrats had
intended to see as characteristic of Iran's Islamic revolution.
Their original goal was more akin to gender apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, the regime, in one way or another,
dismissed almost all women who earlier had risen to positions of
importance. A former female education minister was executed for
promoting ``prostitution'' among girls.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's severe intentions were reflected in the new
Islamic dress code and the lowering _ to age 9 _ of the minimum age
at which women could be married. The new constitution also removed
critical women's rights in divorce and child-custody battles.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, many of the country's restrictions on women
still border on the bizarre:
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman may have an equal vote in parliament or equal powers
among the vice presidents, but her testimony in court carries only
half the weight of a man's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can head universities and publish newspapers but cannot
leave the country without their husbands' written permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can act in plays and movies alongside men, but they
cannot sing in public or ride in the same section of a public bus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iranian women have proven irrepressible. In
defiance of the theocracy, they are putting their imprints on
diverse aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1990s, pressure from women changed laws on
employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women packed a courtroom
to protest child-custody laws after the brutal death of an
eight-year-old girl. She had weighed only 35 pounds and suffered a
fractured skull, two broken arms and burn marks over her body at
the hands of her father, a drug addict with a criminal record and a
documented history of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic tradition allows a mother to keep a daughter until the
age of seven and a son until the age of two; full custody then
switches to the father. In 1998 Parliament revised the law to
stipulate that a child could no longer be awarded to an unfit
father, defining the custody qualifications in a way that could
often disqualify men.
</P>
<P>
   Women have challenged other male bastions as well. Thousands of
women broke a long-time barrier preventing females from attending
male sporting events when they poured into Tehran's stadium to
greet the Iranian soccer team after it qualified for the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also playing sports. Tehran alone has 85 women's
basketball teams in five leagues. Only 10,000 women engaged in
intramural sports on the eve of the revolution. Today, 2 million
participate in soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis, handball,
skiing, aerobics, fencing, judo, shooting, volleyball, rowing,
horseback riding, gymnastics, golf, table tennis, karate, tae kwon
do and even water-skiing. This, despite the slightly absurd
waterproof coats and scarves women must wear to demonstrate
``modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   And women have forced the theocrats to acknowledge their
official participation. At the 1996 Olympics, for the first time, a
female athlete led the Iranian team onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The new activists are as distinct as their political
environment. The most outspoken women are no longer necessarily
Westernized or upper-class elites, but have emerged from within the
revolution. Many are from traditional families, clerical circles
and rural areas _ none of which had previously produced female
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Women's publications have been brazen on reform issues. ``Zan''
(Woman) _ which the theocrats banned in 1999 _ was a newspaper
published by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Rafsanjani, and a member of parliament. It editorialized against
child-custody laws, the use of stoning as a punishment, and
``temporary marriage'' _ the practice of contracting a short-term
wife. It ran an expose on the return of prostitution and reported
on a New Year's message sent to the country by the former empress
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Another publication, ``Farzaneh,'' is trying to reconcile more
robust women's rights with the Islamic faith. Its articles have
included ``Human Rights of Women in Islam,'' ``A History of Silence
and Debates Today,'' ``How to Proceed'' and ``The Long Way Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema, which often focuses on women, has led a major
countercultural revolution since the early 1990s. We find female
movie characters who are challenging the status quo, plots that
focus on the shortcomings of the Islamic system and dialogue that
extends the boundaries of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Dariush Mehrjui, the father of modern Iranian cinema, wrote a
quartet of films _ ``Banoo'' (1992), ``Sara'' (1993), ``Pari''
(1995) and ``Leila'' (1997) _ about the professional and personal
plight of women in Islamic society. Each ended with the lead female
character defying convention or leaving her husband to head out on
her own _ a radical move in a society where women must get written
permission to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who spent five years in the shah's jails, was
known in the 1980s for ardently religious and pro-revolution films.
But his seventh film, ``A Time to Love,'' was a controversial tale
_ with three endings based on three perspectives _ about a married
woman who pursues a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Makhmalbaf's teen-age daughter Samira made her film
debut with ``The Apple,'' the true story of an illiterate man who
had locked his 12-year-old twin daughters at home since infancy,
for fear that the girls' purity would be spoiled by strange men's

<P>
   Iranian women are by far the most politically active in the
Persian Gulf and are among the most empowered in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 200 women ran for the 270-seat parliament and 14 won.
In 1997, four women registered to run for the presidency. Although
all were disqualified by the Council of Guardians that vets
candidates, the decision was not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Khatami's stunning upset victory in the 1997
presidential election, in which 70 percent of the voters said no to
the hard-line conservative candidate, would not have happened
without the female vote. And as president, Khatami appointed a
female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 5,000 women ran in local elections, and 300 won. Today,
more than 40 percent of university students are female, as are
one-third of faculty members. Thousands of women educated after the
revolution work as engineers, doctors, scientists, lawyers and even
clerics. More than 340 directors-general in government ministries
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of
books and magazines published by women only. Women have become
painters, authors, designers, photographers, movie producers,
directors, stars and sculptors crafting ``anatomically correct''
female figures (otherwise known as nudes).
</P>
<P>
   A fierce women's movement was not what the theocrats had
intended to see as characteristic of Iran's Islamic revolution.
Their original goal was more akin to gender apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, the regime, in one way or another,
dismissed almost all women who earlier had risen to positions of
importance. A former female education minister was executed for
promoting ``prostitution'' among girls.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's severe intentions were reflected in the new
Islamic dress code and the lowering _ to age 9 _ of the minimum age
at which women could be married. The new constitution also removed
critical women's rights in divorce and child-custody battles.
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, many of the country's restrictions on women
still border on the bizarre:
</P>
<P>
   _ A woman may have an equal vote in parliament or equal powers
among the vice presidents, but her testimony in court carries only
half the weight of a man's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can head universities and publish newspapers but cannot
leave the country without their husbands' written permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women can act in plays and movies alongside men, but they
cannot sing in public or ride in the same section of a public bus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iranian women have proven irrepressible. In
defiance of the theocracy, they are putting their imprints on
diverse aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-1990s, pressure from women changed laws on
employment, divorce and maternity leave. Women packed a courtroom
to protest child-custody laws after the brutal death of an
eight-year-old girl. She had weighed only 35 pounds and suffered a
fractured skull, two broken arms and burn marks over her body at
the hands of her father, a drug addict with a criminal record and a
documented history of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic tradition allows a mother to keep a daughter until the
age of seven and a son until the age of two; full custody then
switches to the father. In 1998 Parliament revised the law to
stipulate that a child could no longer be awarded to an unfit
father, defining the custody qualifications in a way that could
often disqualify men.
</P>
<P>
   Women have challenged other male bastions as well. Thousands of
women broke a long-time barrier preventing females from attending
male sporting events when they poured into Tehran's stadium to
greet the Iranian soccer team after it qualified for the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Women are also playing sports. Tehran alone has 85 women's
basketball teams in five leagues. Only 10,000 women engaged in
intramural sports on the eve of the revolution. Today, 2 million
participate in soccer, basketball, swimming, tennis, handball,
skiing, aerobics, fencing, judo, shooting, volleyball, rowing,
horseback riding, gymnastics, golf, table tennis, karate, tae kwon
do and even water-skiing. This, despite the slightly absurd
waterproof coats and scarves women must wear to demonstrate
``modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   And women have forced the theocrats to acknowledge their
official participation. At the 1996 Olympics, for the first time, a
female athlete led the Iranian team onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The new activists are as distinct as their political
environment. The most outspoken women are no longer necessarily
Westernized or upper-class elites, but have emerged from within the
revolution. Many are from traditional families, clerical circles
and rural areas _ none of which had previously produced female
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Women's publications have been brazen on reform issues. ``Zan''
(Woman) _ which the theocrats banned in 1999 _ was a newspaper
published by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Rafsanjani, and a member of parliament. It editorialized against
child-custody laws, the use of stoning as a punishment, and
``temporary marriage'' _ the practice of contracting a short-term
wife. It ran an expose on the return of prostitution and reported
on a New Year's message sent to the country by the former empress
of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Another publication, ``Farzaneh,'' is trying to reconcile more
robust women's rights with the Islamic faith. Its articles have
included ``Human Rights of Women in Islam,'' ``A History of Silence
and Debates Today,'' ``How to Proceed'' and ``The Long Way Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian cinema, which often focuses on women, has led a major
countercultural revolution since the early 1990s. We find female
movie characters who are challenging the status quo, plots that
focus on the shortcomings of the Islamic system and dialogue that
extends the boundaries of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Dariush Mehrjui, the father of modern Iranian cinema, wrote a
quartet of films _ ``Banoo'' (1992), ``Sara'' (1993), ``Pari''
(1995) and ``Leila'' (1997) _ about the professional and personal
plight of women in Islamic society. Each ended with the lead female
character defying convention or leaving her husband to head out on
her own _ a radical move in a society where women must get written
permission to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who spent five years in the shah's jails, was
known in the 1980s for ardently religious and pro-revolution films.
But his seventh film, ``A Time to Love,'' was a controversial tale
_ with three endings based on three perspectives _ about a married
woman who pursues a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Makhmalbaf's teen-age daughter Samira made her film
debut with ``The Apple,'' the true story of an illiterate man who
had locked his 12-year-old twin daughters at home since infancy,
for fear that the girls' purity would be spoiled by strange men's
gazes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie revolved around the gradual exposure of the girls _
almost mute, unschooled and both physically and mentally disabled _
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the film to make this point: All it takes to imprison
many, many women is one man,'' Samira told reporters when the film
opened in New York in 1999. ``What I noticed about those two girls

want to be free, and if they try, they burst out with a lot of
energy.''

   __ A new study raises questions about the influence of
``vanishing veterans.'' __
</P>
<P>
   .....................................................
</P>
<P>
   Nestled within view of the Potomac River, the Pentagon is
flanked to the north and south by the Memorial and 14th Street
bridges, spans that connect the Defense Department with its
political patrons in Congress across the water on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Not marked on any map is another link that also provides an
important connection between the two institutions: military
service. Lawmakers who have donned a uniform, especially those who
served in combat, are widely regarded as providing an important
bridge of understanding between the world of professional
politicians and the professional military.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 30 years, lawmakers from the World War II
generation have moved on, and the abolition of conscription has
resulted in fewer lawmakers who span the political-military divide.
This trend has caused handwringing and analysis for a few years by
many observers concerned that, with fewer veterans, the federal
legislature may not adequately oversee and guide the U.S. armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study by William Bianco, a political science professor
at Pennsylvania State University, concludes that military service
does not have a notable impact on a legislator's voting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If the decline of military veterans in Congress is leading to
significant changes in defense policy, Bianco found, its effects
are indirect and generally through changes in legislative agendas
or in the quantity and kinds of information available to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the decline of lawmakers with military experience has
been much discussed, this study found that Congress now has an
unexpectedly low number of members who have served in the armed
forces compared to veterans in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Does military experience matter? ``I think that's a fair
question,'' Bianco said, in a recent interview. ``If you look at
what a lot of veterans are saying, they are very concerned that a
Congress without veterans would behave differently than a Congress
with veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianco examined the trends of military experience in the House
and Senate from 1789 to 1999, closely looking at partisan
differences in military experience during the last century. He also
analyzed the impact of veteran status on select military votes
during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bianco concluded, ``The gross effect that veterans are going to
vote differently on military-affairs issues, broadly defined, just
doesn't show up in the data.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Vanishing Veterans: The Decline in Military
Experience in the U.S. Congress,'' found ``no evidence that the
absolute decline or emerging underrepresentation of veterans have,
by themselves, had a significant impact on the kinds of policies
emerging from Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper was co-authored with Air Force Lt. Jamie Markham, then
a Harvard undergraduate ROTC student, as part of a study conducted
by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies' ``Project on the
Gap Between the Military and Civilian Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran status, Bianco and Markham found, has ``at best a
modest'' impact on vote decisions and policy outcomes. This, the
authors argue, doesn't mean that the decline in the number of
lawmakers who have served in uniform has no impact on votes. ``What
it suggests is that this effect, if it exists, is primarily
indirect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianco acknowledged that this argument implies that by the time
a bill gets to the House or Senate floor for a vote, veterans are
forced to go along with non-veterans. ``But if the agenda was truly
being skewed one way or the other, you could expect veterans to
break away from non-veterans on most votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only place you see that is on bills like the `don't
ask, don't tell' (policy on homosexuals in the military), and even
there the effect isn't shocking. It's not like all the veterans are
on one side of the issue and the non-veterans are on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinning of military veteran ranks in Congress has been
severe over the last 50 years. In 1971 more than 75 percent of
House members had military experience compared with 25 percent in
1999. The Senate has seen a similar decline, although it began
later and was a bit smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the House and Senate over the last generation has
been more or less evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats.
However, the decline of lawmaker veterans of the military has not
been as dramatic on the committees that deal with defense issues,
which ``continue to have a high percentage of veterans,
facilitating their role as information suppliers,'' according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   This includes lawmakers on the House Armed Services, House
Veterans Affairs, Senate Armed Services and Senate Veterans Affairs
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 100 years, the two party caucuses have had roughly
the same percentage of military veterans. While Republicans have
generally maintained a slight advantage _ a few percentage points _
the study noted: ``Surprisingly, the largest differences are
observed in the contemporary Senate, where Democrats have a better
than 10 percentage-point advantage over Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger trend toward fewer lawmakers with military experience
may be viewed as a statistical correction, Bianco said, because for
decades during the Cold War, Congress had a higher percentage of
veterans when compared to the general population. And while Bianco
found that Congress today is underrepresented by those with
military experience compared to the general population, the
Congress of the early 1900s was even more so.
</P>
<P>
   With an all-volunteer, professional military, the number of
lawmakers who will have saluted a commander is expected to continue
to dwindle. Without universal conscription, Bianco found, an
individual with a high education level and high socioeconomic
status is less likely to serve in the military than one with less
education and lower income.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's happening in Congress,'' the Penn State professor
said, ``is that it's been drawing from the same group over time _
that group is much less likely to have served (in the military) in
the past, and much less likely to have served relative to the whole
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers with military experience certainly bring a unique
perspective and familiarity with many defense issues that Congress
must address. However, these veterans by no means have a lock on
what is required to understand the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this very cherished belief about how military service
educates people,'' Bianco said. ``They learn about getting together
with a group of people that you don't necessarily like and learn
about patriotism and shared sacrifice. And while I'm certain the
military does that for some people _ and you can get it other ways
too _ it's not inevitable. People don't all come out of the
military as egalitarian internationalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An Air Force colonel told me that his feeling on this was that
two years of flipping burgers at an air base in Texas doesn't teach
you much about national security. We all make a big deal about Bill
Clinton not being a veteran. But remember,'' Bianco said, ``that
Sam Nunn, one of the most respected defense influentials of the
last generation, is not a veteran.''

INHERITING THE WORLD: AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORMAN LEVINE  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
 ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY 
 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past hundred years, the United States has had three great
debates over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 to 1917, President Wilson led the country into World
War I to make the globe ``safe for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1949, America mobilized against Soviet communism,
and George F. Kennan devised the ``containment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the nation prepares to select its first president of the
21st century, it has entered its third great debate, and the
question, baldly put, is this: Now that we have inherited the
world, how shall we rule it?
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake in the outcome of this debate is nothing less
than the peace and prosperity of all Americans in the coming
century. Fortunately, America is at peace at the moment, but with
the demise of the Soviet Union as the second-greatest superpower,
many areas of instability and threat have surfaced on international
waters. Terrorism, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons to rogue states such as Iraq, Iran and North
Korea, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism have brought a series of
mortal challenges to America's doorstep. The United States must
redefine its global role once again, for that act of
self-definition is vital to the security of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it is only every four years, at the time of the
presidential election, that Americans come to face these
life-and-death issues for themselves and for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in which this discussion takes place are uniquely
different from the 1914-17 and 1947-49 periods. Today, because of
its victory over Politburo totalitarianism, the United States
stands alone as the Earth's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus, based on a bipolar standoff between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has imploded, and in the place
of this consensus a bewildering diversity of opinions has emerged
from the Washington foreign policy elites on how to manage Pax
Americana.
</P>
<P>
   These voices can be grouped into four categories, two
conservative and two liberal.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the two camps are the Conservative Moralists and
the Conservative Realists. On the left, the two camps are the
Liberal Moralists and the Liberal Realists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dupont Circle area in Washington, D.C., is the miracle mile
of the foreign policy research establishment. Within the 20036 ZIP
code, it is only a five-minute walk among the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Madeleine Albright's alma
mater), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the
American Enterprise Institute. This is contested turf, a brutal
scrimmage line, for this ZIP code is a kind of foreign policy
football field in which Republican and Democratic advocates block
and tackle fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed Establishment casual, comfortable in a blue woolen
sweater, Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, told ``The Arizona Republic'' in January,
``The United States must be more assertive in advancing the
enlargement of democracy around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and fellow conservative Bill Kristol, editor of the
influential journal the ``Weekly Standard,'' coined the phrase
``benevolent American hegemony'' as a flashcard for their views on
U.S. foreign policy. (``Hegemony'' is code for ``we're in
charge.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kagan and Kristol are the leading exponents of what we will call
the school of Conservative Moralists. A deep strain of moralism
runs through their thinking, because they are unflinching in their
belief that democracy should be the universal form of government,
and they do not shy away from the fact that it may be necessary to
intervene in the affairs of other sovereign states if that is
necessary to bring them the American idea of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A DAPTING WILSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kagan denies it, the Conservative Moralists are
indebted to the idealism of Woodrow Wilson. One part of Wilsonian
thought was to convince the world of the superiority of democracy,
and this is the part that Kagan and Kristol follow. Another part of
Wilson's thought was the belief that national interests should be
sacrificed to a League of Nations, and both Kagan and Kristol
reject this part.
</P>
<P>
   The school of Conservative Realists, whose most distinguished
practitioner is Henry Kissinger, rejects the moralism of Kagan and
Kristol. All the members of the realist school acknowledge that
democracy is the most desirable form of government, but they deny
that the United States has the missionary purpose of converting the
entire planet to democracy. For this camp, the proper end of
American diplomacy is the preservation of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and like-minded policymakers are realists in the sense
that they see the world as made up of competing, self-interested
nations. For them, diplomacy is a jungle. In the spirit of Ronald
Reagan, this group is skeptical about international organizations,
although they see their usefulness. They also draw a line in the
sand between internationalism and the preservation of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Realism is a doctrine that favors unilateral action
to defend the national self-interest of the United States. It
doubts the effectiveness of multilateral action _ for example, the
U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which is widely acknowledged
to be a failure. The members of this school argue that the
multinational United Nations never has demonstrated its ability to
efficiently carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Straight and elegant, her mind as sharp as a quarterback in a
fourth-and-one-situation, Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations under Ronald Reagan and now a professor at
Georgetown University and senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, disagrees with the Kagan-Kristol School. A strong voice
within the conservative movement, Kirkpatrick doubts that democracy
can be spread through interventionist methods.
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN'S WAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan, whom I admired as a great president,''
Kirkpatrick said, ``understood the sanctity of national
independence. The U.N. is a useful tool. All international
organizations are useful tools. I am not opposed to the U.N. But
one principle that Reagan stood by, and that I stand by, is that
the U.S. must never surrender its sovereignty or national
self-interests to any international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy agenda of the Republican Party is made up of
both Conservative Moralists and Realists. Gov. George W. Bush
himself stands squarely in the faction of Conservative Realism.
Many members of the realist school, including Condoleezza (EDITORS:
CORRECT) Rice, Elliot Abrams, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz
(EDITORS: CORRECT) (all of whom held high foreign policy positions
in either the Reagan or Bush administrations), are currently
advisers to the present Bush presidential campaign. John McCain is
also a Conservative Realist, and one of his foreign policy advisers
is Henry Kissinger. Neither the Conservative Moralists nor Realists
are isolationists.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal Establishment also fields a team within the 20036
ZIP-code playing field, and the expertise of the Brookings
Institute is certainly playoff quality. Although it is primarily a
research center for scholars from all over the world, and as such
its public image must be as objective, the Woodrow Wilson Center,
yards away from the Dupont Circle, currently is headed by Lee
Hamilton, who presented to ``The Republic'' the arguments of the
Liberal Moralists.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat and former member of Congress, Hamilton was chairman
of the House Foreign Relations Committee. Stately, and possessed of
a typical Hoosier friendliness, Hamilton said, ``The Republicans
are too quick to defend unilateral intervention. Even though
international organizations are imperfect, America must learn to
work in cooperation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   CARTER LEGACY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political heritage of the Liberal Moralists grows out of the
unusual alliance among Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   From Wilson, the Liberal Moralists take the ideas of the
dissemination of democracy, as well as a commitment to collective
security and internationalism. From Jimmy Carter, they borrow the
dogma of universal human rights, which includes the rights of
women, children and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Vietnam served as a bloody lesson that the arrogant,
unilateral exercise of U.S. power can produce the diplomatic
isolation of the United States. Like the Conservative Moralists,
Liberal Moralists also advocate an expansive role for democracy and
the capitalist system. Unlike both the Conservative Moralists and
Realists, the Liberal Moralists are suspicious of unilateral
intervention as a means of disseminating democracy and human
rights. Liberal Moralists prefer to act within multilateral
institutions, such as the United Nations. For example, Liberal
Moralists favor humanitarian intervention under the umbrella of the
United Nations. The American involvement in Kosovo is presented as
a model of humanitarian intervention, for in this case the United
States became engaged to prevent the continued slaughter of
Kosovars, but under the aegis of the multilateral United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that globalization was one of the dominant
tendencies of the last decade of the 20th century, Liberal
Moralists are free-traders. A large corporatist faction exists
within Liberal Moralists, because multinational corporations see
the opportunity to harvest huge profits from the
internationalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Realists speak the language of national self-interest
and not the tongue of democratic moralism. Like the Conservative
Realists, their brethren the Liberal Realists take a dim view of
the idea that the purpose of American diplomacy is the conversion
of the globe to democracy. They also view the goal of international
relations as the preservation of American nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their conservative brethren, however, Liberal Realists
perceive contemporary international relations as multipolar. They
stress the importance of the United States' working in harmony with
multilateral organizations because they see the danger of causing a
reaction against the American imperium. If the United States were
to pursue a unilateralist course of action, the Liberal Realists
argue, this would result in the undesirable development of an
``anti-hegemonist'' camp _ the alliance of Russia, China and Iran
to halt American primacy.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON OPPOSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent members of the Liberal Realist camp are three
academicians: Professors Michael Mandelbaum and Robert W. Tucker
(emeritus) of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies and Professor Ronald Steel of the University of
California-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   True to their belief that America must show great restraint
before exercising unilateral action, the Liberal Realists opposed
the Clinton policy of NATO expansion. Mandelbaum's book ``The Dawn
of Peace in Europe'' is the classic statement against the need for
NATO enlargement on the grounds that it would drive Russia and
China together. Tucker's book ``The Imperialist Temptation''
criticized President Bush's Operation Desert Storm because it
represented U.S. overreach, extending U.S. responsibilities from
Western Europe, the original site of the American-Soviet standoff,
to the Persian Gulf, a colossal stretch of American national
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonian foreign policy is an outgrowth of Liberal Moralism.
Although there are significant differences in terms of their
foreign policy, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley are members of the
Liberal Moralist wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The grand foreign policy debate of the new millennium, the
search for the Second Coming of George F. Kennan, is essentially an
in-house dialogue among inhabitants of the Washington policy think
tanks. During the Kosovo entanglement the American people were
activated by TV war imagery to think about America's role in the
world, but Kosovo is over, and Americans again have turned their
gaze inward. It is Social Security, medical insurance, education
and taxes that consume their interest in this election year and not
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Norman Ornstein, a specialist on Congress at the American
Enterprise Institute, pointed out, ``63 percent of the House of
Representatives were elected after the fall of communism.'' The
amount of money spent on agencies in the U.S. government dealing
with foreign affairs has been cut by Congress. The amount of money
given to international organizations also has been diminished. It
is truly a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Congress is isolationist,'' Ornstein suggested,
``it is rather that Congress is insular. Domestic needs have taken
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a terrorist act of great bestiality, unless the
TV screen can show decapitated bodies and mangled limbs, Americans
will elect their first chief executive of the new century on issues
relating to homosexuality and abortion rather than on this
transformative moment of how the U.S. colossus should behave in the
world after it inherited this wondrous sphere.  &QL;

<P>
   If Mexico's presidential election were held today, the man who
would win by a landslide is Francisco Labastida, the ruling party's
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whose polls one believes, Labastida would win by
anywhere from eight to 15 percentage points, or slightly below 45
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The runners-up would be the more conservative Vicente Fox,
attracting about 35 percent of the electorate, and third-time,
left-of-center contender Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a bit above 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given Mexico's terribly complicated electoral system, the ruling
PRI _ or Institutional Revolutionary Party _ would also probably
gain a solid victory in the race for mayor of Mexico City, the
second most powerful political job in the country. It would also
gain an absolute majority in the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies
and the State Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, which has won all of Mexico's presidential races since
its founding in 1929, has been challenged to mount a
corruption-free election on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in November Labastida won the first contested primary
ever held in the PRI's history. Of late, some are surprised that
even in a ``free and fair'' contest, the candidate closest to
President Zedillo and the establishment came out the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this equivalent of a landslide are many and
complex. When the PRI is united and essentially happy with its
candidate, the ``aparato,'' or party machinery, steamrolls
everything in its path, placing every available political resource
at his service.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, from the president of the Republic down to the last
precinct captain or schoolteacher, and including state governors,
cabinet ministers and ministry delegates, bishops, military
commanders, businessmen, labor leaders and peasant organizers gets
down to work and does his or her job.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they flood the country with propaganda, raise money by
the truckload, bring out the vote and find the missing votes
wherever they may be _ legally or not, ethically or not,
effectively or not.
</P>
<P>
   This is all done thanks to the symbiotic relationship between
government, state and political party. It is the heart of the
Mexican system and was never limited in scope to mere electoral
fraud, no matter how important that may have been on numerous
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   When the PRI finds itself with a candidate it does not like _ as
in the case of Carlos Salinas in 1988 _ or is divided as has
occurred in a dozen state elections over the past decade, the
machinery can slacken or even turn against the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But if the opposition is weak and divided, and the PRI avoids
fractures and pitfalls such as economic crises, outbreaks of
violence or major corruption scandals, the ``aparato'' will do
whatever it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   If perchance the opposition to the establishment is deeply
divided, as is now the case, and spends as much time and money on
in-fighting as campaigning, any temptation the machinery would feel
to bolt or ``throw'' the election is quickly mitigated by the
certainty of victory.
</P>
<P>
   If one adds to all of this another factor _ i.e., the inertia
behind 70 years of history, custom and habit, whereby Mexican
elites, including those in Washington, the Church, the old
political class and the business community prefer to deal with the
devil they know _ the incumbent party becomes virtually unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Herein, though, lies the key to the only, remote hope of the
opposition's chances of turning the tables and still squeaking out
a narrow win in July, despite the huge odds against it.
</P>
<P>
   There are solid grounds for thinking that if the major
opposition parties can transform the election into a referendum on
the perpetuation of the political system, and into a plebiscite on
PRI rule, that would force voters to cast their ballots not for one
candidate or another, but rather for change or continuity. It would
force people to vote either for the end of 70 years of PRI
domination or for its continuation. And if that focus could be
achieved, then a small possibility exists for the opposition to
win.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases where such a referendum has taken place, under
waning but still persistent authoritarian rule, the NOs have
overcome highly adverse circumstances. The premise for this of
course lies in the belief, to which certainly not all Mexicans
subscribe, that despite Mexico's great advances in the past decade
with its democratization process, the old system remains intact and
can only be defeated through a people's referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that more Mexicans want change, and wish to usher in
an era of alternation in power, than are willing to vote for any
one challenger. Were the opposition to succeed in framing the
election in these larger terms, it conceivably could win.
</P>
<P>
   All the moreso, if the three-way race could be transformed into
a two-man contest, with opposition voters seeking to strengthen the
value of their ballots by shifting toward the stronger Fox and away
from Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is both a highly conservative nation and one that seeks
change earnestly. It is a country that has made great strides in
recent years in building democratic procedures for transferring and
competing for power, as well as one where arguably the world's
oldest authoritarian regime is still standing.
</P>
<P>
   It is, finally, a society sundered by lacerating inequalities
and fractures, the political manifestations of which are rarely
visible. Given these contradictions, movement is infrequent, costly
and painful _ as well as rarely foreseeable. Such is the case
today.

and fractures, the political manifestations of which are rarely
visible. Given these contradictions, movement is infrequent, costly
and painful _ as well as rarely foreseeable. Such is the case
today.

<P>
   On Tues., Jan. 25, I had to travel from New York to Boston,
braving one of the worst ice storms in history. Since the airports
were closed and trains stood motionless, blocked by newly
accumulated white snow mountains on the rails, I had to make the
trip in a van driven by one of my sons.
</P>
<P>
   Javier is a reliable and expert driver. But the truth is he was
as terrified as I. The trip, which usually takes no more than four
hours, took us eight, most of which we spent driving behind very
slow moving trucks that were distributing tons of salt on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure, though, was well worth our effort because outside
of Vernon, Conn., we found one of those stories that reflect, by
themselves, the fragilities of the American empire.
</P>
<P>
   We had already visited several gas stations in search of hot
coffee but come to accept the fact that in that terrible minus-20
degree climate, we could find only frosty beverages. Over and over
we came upon those vending machines full of iced-cold Coca-Cola,
Sprite, Diet Coke and all the other colorful cans of those bubbly
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   It jogged me into recalling the few facts I knew about that
giant global corporate power: It sells about 85,000 million liters
of beverage per day to the people of 160 countries and earns annual
profits in excess of $500 million. There are Coca-Cola vending
machines in the Saudi Arabian deserts, in the treacherous mountains
of Albania and at the foot of the Great Wall of China.
</P>
<P>
   The company's logo, traced with elegant calligraphy, is today
one of the indisputable symbols of the North American realm. John
Stith Pemberton, the legendary inventor of this soft drink, was a
druggist in Atlanta who also sold iced syrups and cough tonics. In
1886, at age 51, Pemberton created a chemical mix that, he thought,
would really quench the thirst of his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even though only three people in the world are privy to
the exact formula, its two main ingredients are well known: the
extract of the nut of the cola and the tea obtained from the leaves
of the coca.
</P>
<P>
   Hence its name: Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor is rounded off with other vegetable substances, a
little caffeine and sugar. Since the liquid was also medicinal, the
syrup had an infinitesimal amount of cocaine (about one part to 50
million parts). Nevertheless, in 1929 a national debate on
addiction led to the elimination of even the slightest trace of
this substance.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with its thousands of bottlers and concessions around the
world, it is still one of the most prosperous corporations on the
planet. During the past year, however, there were several
disturbing signs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales dropped steeply in Germany and Japan _ two of the five
countries in the world with the highest Coca-Cola consumption _ and
in the recent past they almost collapsed in the shaky economies of
Russia and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas N. Daft, the new president, heard the voices of alarm
among his shareholders and decided to do something radical to stop
the downward slide.
</P>
<P>
   And here we must turn back to Friendly's, where it was about 7
p.m. and we were relaxing, trying to straighten the kinks out of
our muscles. Suddenly, we heard a man sobbing _ the sound of
sadness was as disturbing as anything could be.
</P>
<P>
   The man was about 40 years old, dressed in an elegant gray suit,
necktie and starched shirt. He had a stiff leather briefcase, a
scarf and an overcoat: light clothing for weather such as we were
having that night.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden I recognized the man. He was Aurelio Sanchez
Cos, a Galician Spaniard, the son of a fisherman, who had left his
country in 1975 and traveled to Switzerland. Years back I had
shared a flight with him from Madrid to Buenos Aires. And I clearly
remembered that, on that airplane, he was feeling very proud of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   For he had finished his university studies in marketing and was
working at the Coca-Cola Co.'s Iberian division, where he was
earning $3,000 per month, a huge salary. He had set his life's
goal: to be fluent in English and then try to conquer one of the
golden jobs at the company's headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something, man?'' he told me at some point in the
conversation. ``I don't have blood in my veins. I have Coca-Cola,
undiluted and without bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   At Friendly's, I waited until the sobs died down a bit and
approached Sanchez Cos, asking, in Spanish, if I could be of any
help.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a few moments to recognize me, but after a short
pause he did.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that he had arrived in Atlanta in 1994 and ever
since then ``everything had been wonderful.'' He had an American
wife and two sons, and a couple of his fishermen uncles lived in
Maine. Sometimes, he admitted, Atlanta seemed a bit soulless and
alien: a place where you lived in a groove, without friends or
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Coca-Cola is there and, well, you know, it has always been
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Jan. 24, Aurelio had been informed that the
company fired him. He was one of 6,000 employees the new CEO
considered redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the courage to tell my wife,'' he said. ``I
packed a few clothes, phoned her and told her my uncle was sick and
wanted to see me in Maine. I then climbed in my Japanese van and
drove through the storm, to nowhere. Do you see how white
everything is outside? That's my life now: a blind desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon in Boston I would see his sorry tale confirmed in the
newspaper. I read that nearly half of the workers at Coke
headquarters in Atlanta were no doubt shedding tears as bitter as
those of Aurelio Sanchez Cos, and that many others were expecting
to receive the same terrible news. What had befallen them was not
poverty, but something worse: a sense of injustice and personal
failure without a chance to recoup.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, during the Nuremberg trials, in Vietnam and
throughout our modern history, that peanut-shaped bottle has been a
symbol of untouchable American happiness. But now, nothing seems
safe.
</P>
<P>
   The American empire seems more prosperous than ever, as
President Bill Clinton told us recently, but here and there you can
see fissures, water and ice needles that fall on the people and
make them cry.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   WIS-BACON (Wittenberg, Wis.) _ Sin is in, gastronomically
speaking. Which is why I found myself pulling up to Nueske's
Hilltop Farm, about 65 miles west of Green Bay, at midmorning one
crystalline day in January, with the car's digital thermometer
stuck at 5 implacable degrees below zero. I was there in pursuit of
postgraduate studies in bacon. Chefs everywhere are reaching for
real bacon, with its deep, smoky flavor, to jump-start their oyster
stews and their terrines, their collard greens and their roasted
birds. Fatty, allegedly artery-clogging bacon, which a few years
ago stood at the head of the diet cops' hate list, is suddenly back
in fashion. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   BOIL-IN-BAG (Undated) _ David Bouley was in his mad scientist
mode, sealing foie gras in plastic bags, inserting temperature
probes, consulting time-temperature charts. He was showing off
$30,000 worth of new technology in the kitchen at Danube,
technology that has turned him into the American king of
boil-in-bag food. And he was as excited about his new toys as a kid
with a chemistry set. Last week, throughout a lunch of food cooked
in the bags _ beef cheeks, salmon, veal shank, artichokes, zucchini
_ he kept popping up in the dining room with little plastic
packages filled with other experiments. By Marian Burros.

<P>
   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Staan Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.

   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL;

you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the

   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the

   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing

   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to

Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front

intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a

InterSquid.

machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is

<P>
   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can eventually send the child off to college with a new
laptop, with three years of cheap computer experience behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And a lesson in saving money. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (HELPFUL 500-WORD SIDEBAR FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

<P>
   A cork in the ocean, that has been New Zealand during the past
few years, bobbing around on the waves that rebound from Australia
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand dollar has tumbled, the electorate has thrown
out its conservative government, and the stock market is becalmed
as the mania for global investing sails by.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealanders have actually lost money in their market over the
past three years, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index has
surged almost 90 percent since December 1996. Even neighboring
Australia's stock index has climbed 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As buyers snapped up telephone stocks around the world, Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand (which trades as an ADR on the NYSE) managed
only a 1.2 percent gain in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Investors aren't discriminating against small countries here.
Enough Portugal Telecom stock has been bought to drive up its ADR
by 17 percent this past year.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's decision on Nov. 27 to vote in a new, left-center
government, led by Prime Minister Helen Clark, hasn't helped
matters. The currency lost more ground against both the yen and the
dollar, and foreign investors began demanding higher interest rates
from New Zealand borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Left-center governments such as those led by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have presided over
prosperity, and even Canada's Liberal Party, which has driven the
Tories nearly to extinction, enjoys a nice economy, so what gives?
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, not all left-center governments are the same,
especially in their relations with central banks. Independent
central banks are more trustworthy, and this calms inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prudently followed former Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin's advice to ``shut up'' and let Alan Greenspan do what he
wants. (The latter's success has been so grand that presidential
candidate John McCain suggests that if Greenspan dies we put
sunglasses on him, prop him up, and let him continue to run the
Federal Reserve!)
</P>
<P>
   Blair's first important official act was to grant the Bank of
England independence, so it could raise interest rates without
first begging politicians for permission.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder's left-center German government, on the other
hand, hasn't been so wise, often butting into the European Central
Bank's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For this, and other sins, the market knocked down the value of
the euro by about 15 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clark's new government in New Zealand resembles
Schroeder's more than Clinton's or Blair's. The Labor Party and its
coalition partner (the Alliance) slammed the New Zealand central
bank during the election campaign, suggesting that money policy is
the root of all evil.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's first official act was to send her new finance minister
to persuade the excellent central-bank chief Donald Brash to loosen
up his policies.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended with a wishy-washy agreement to ``seek to
avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates, and the
exchange rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly dangerous words, for the market would rather the
government keep out and let Brash do his job. Additional worries
about regulatory and tax policies add to the market's doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any good news? Well, New Zealand is hosting the
America's Cup this month. Also, the economy is actually recovering
nicely from the Asian flu it caught in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Growth should reach almost 3 percent this year, led by exporters
who look forward to shipping more lamb chops, lumber, and fish all
over the world. A cheaper currency should make such goods more
attractive to foreigners and spur the economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   If only the government would shut up, 2000 could be a pretty
good year. &QL;

 By JIM JUBAK  
 c.2000 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What will happen when the spigot gets turned off? You have to
ask, because it has been wide open, and it can't stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   The money spigot was opened last year because of Y2K. To make
sure that there was enough cash to sustain any run on the banking
system caused by millennial fears, the Federal Reserve flooded the
economy with cash and credit in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alan Greenspan and company have to figure out a way to
quickly cut back on the flow and sop up the excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Move too slowly and the central bankers could create the
inflation they so want to avoid. Move too quickly and the economy,
which is already absorbing a series of interest-rate hikes from
1999, might stall.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how wide did the Federal Reserve open the spigot? In the
last three months of 1999, it increased its assets by about 30
percent. The Fed adds to its assets by buying Treasury bonds in the
open market. The dollars the central bank uses to pay for those
bonds add to the amount of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Measures of the U.S. money supply are notoriously inexact, but
it is clear that the Fed's actions have increased the amount of
cash in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In November alone, M-3, the broadest measure of the amount of
money in the economy, grew by about 18 percent on an annualized
basis. The annualized rate of growth in the first six months of the
year? Less than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such a large increase in the money supply would push
interest rates down as more money chased a limited supply of bonds.
(That would make the price of a bond go up _ and the yield on the
bond go down as a percentage of the price.)
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans would become cheaper, leading to an additional
expansion of credit. Consumers would spend more, since interest
rates would be low and credit easy to get. Stock prices would soar
as investors found themselves able to take out larger margin loans
on easier terms.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no one knows exactly which change in money supply
will produce which effects in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked as though the money flowing out of the Federal
Reserve and the associated easier credit for buying financial
assets played a role _ perhaps the largest role _ in driving the
major stock-market indexes to record highs in December.
</P>
<P>
   And the easy availability of money could be part of what fueled
consumer spending in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Or these effects could just be coincidence. The Fed doesn't
really know, and now it has to make further adjustments. That's why
it now seems that the Fed, which has been so deft at doing neither
too much nor too little over the past few years, may be in real
danger of hitting either the gas or the brake too hard, and sending
the economy spinning off the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed only slowly closes the money spigot and cautiously
decided to let the rate hikes of 1999 work, rather than hiking
again when the board of governors meets this month, the stock
market could climb even higher and the economy could turn even
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   That's surely troubling to a Fed that has repeatedly called
recent stock prices irrational and that considers economic growth
above 3 percent a year inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Fed dries up the river of cash too rapidly, by
selling bonds in order to take dollars out of circulation and by
raising interest rates in February, it could slow the economy too
quickly, too dramatically. That would be particularly damaging if
the economy is already slowing because of past rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the stock market into a correction poses its own danger.
Pricking the market bubble could set up a negative feedback loop.
Falling stock prices could undermine consumer confidence and
spending, slowing the economy and depressing stocks even more.
</P>
<P>
   The months ahead are shaping up as the biggest challenge the Fed
has faced since the global financial crises of August and September
1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the world's financial markets almost reached
meltdown, but the Fed took decisive action to head off that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing the Fed right now might be tougher than that
one. In 1997, it had a good blueprint for heading off a financial
crisis. In 2000, it isn't clear what the bankers should do.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, should be able to track the response to the
Federal Reserve's action or inaction very precisely. From last May
through December, the bond market was stuck in a trading range:
Whenever bond investors got nervous about inflation or the dollar,
they would send bond prices down far enough to take yields up to
about 6.3 percent on the 30-year U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   That yield was always attractive enough to bring new buyers into
the market _ and their money would drive the yield back to about 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks of the year, though, bond yields pushed
through the previous top and reached 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If, in 2000, bond yields move up but establish a new trading
range not too far above the one of 1999, investors can then
conclude that the Fed's policy is draining money out of the economy
at a rate that's neither too fast nor too slow.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the bond market hasn't settled into a trading range
in January _ or if it shoots up before showing signs of settling _
then the danger that the Fed has overreacted one way or another has
increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, running the world's most powerful central bank is
really no fun at all. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   What will happen when the spigot gets turned off? You have to
ask, because it has been wide open, and it can't stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   The money spigot was opened last year because of Y2K. To make
sure that there was enough cash to sustain any run on the banking
system caused by millennial fears, the Federal Reserve flooded the
economy with cash and credit in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alan Greenspan and company have to figure out a way to
quickly cut back on the flow and sop up the excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Move too slowly and the central bankers could create the
inflation they so want to avoid. Move too quickly and the economy,
which is already absorbing a series of interest-rate hikes from
1999, might stall.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how wide did the Federal Reserve open the spigot? In the
last three months of 1999, it increased its assets by about 30
percent. The Fed adds to its assets by buying Treasury bonds in the
open market. The dollars the central bank uses to pay for those
bonds add to the amount of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Measures of the U.S. money supply are notoriously inexact, but
it is clear that the Fed's actions have increased the amount of
cash in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In November alone, M-3, the broadest measure of the amount of
money in the economy, grew by about 18 percent on an annualized
basis. The annualized rate of growth in the first six months of the
year? Less than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such a large increase in the money supply would push
interest rates down as more money chased a limited supply of bonds.
(That would make the price of a bond go up _ and the yield on the
bond go down as a percentage of the price.)
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans would become cheaper, leading to an additional
expansion of credit. Consumers would spend more, since interest
rates would be low and credit easy to get. Stock prices would soar
as investors found themselves able to take out larger margin loans
on easier terms.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no one knows exactly which change in money supply
will produce which effects in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked as though the money flowing out of the Federal
Reserve and the associated easier credit for buying financial
assets played a role _ perhaps the largest role _ in driving the
major stock-market indexes to record highs in December.
</P>
<P>
   And the easy availability of money could be part of what fueled
consumer spending in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Or these effects could just be coincidence. The Fed doesn't
really know, and now it has to make further adjustments. That's why
it now seems that the Fed, which has been so deft at doing neither
too much nor too little over the past few years, may be in real
danger of hitting either the gas or the brake too hard, and sending
the economy spinning off the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed only slowly closes the money spigot and cautiously
decided to let the rate hikes of 1999 work, rather than hiking
again when the board of governors meets this month, the stock
market could climb even higher and the economy could turn even
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   That's surely troubling to a Fed that has repeatedly called
recent stock prices irrational and that considers economic growth
above 3 percent a year inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Fed dries up the river of cash too rapidly, by
selling bonds in order to take dollars out of circulation and by
raising interest rates in February, it could slow the economy too
quickly, too dramatically. That would be particularly damaging if
the economy is already slowing because of past rate increases.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.
</P>
<P>
   The actual accumulation, however, would be $942,692 _ nearly
twice as much. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using Jarrett's software and checking all 44 of the 30-year
periods, I found that actual experience beat average historical
performance 64 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Three things. First, most of the planning tools we use are
virtually useless.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we'll probably do better accumulating money than we
expect.
</P>
<P>
   And, third, we'll probably do worse in retirement, so spending
needs to be managed with great care. &QL;

<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL;

<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL;

<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL;

   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.
</P>
<P>
   The actual accumulation, however, would be $942,692 _ nearly
twice as much. &QL;

   Three things. First, most of the planning tools we use are

<TEXT>
<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.

<P>
   Pros: Reverse English accent factor. Popular among his peers.
Miramax will have him out stumping for the film.

needed all it could get. Cruise Oscar long overdue. And, oh yeah,
it's the best acting he's ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Character so obnoxious, voters may actually hate him. Some
undoubtedly hate movie, may not watch it all.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Cons: Well, maybe people who resent an African-American
character defined by condescending stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Maybe. Some will want to see if the big guy cries

</P>
<P>
   Cons: His movie was ignored in most major categories.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Chances are about as good as his character's. &QL;

 &HT;    (ital)``As Mr. Clinton heads into the eighth and final year of
his presidency, he is a blur of motion _ but he is also very alone.
His only child is away at college. His wife has moved out to start
a career of her own. His vice president is on the road seeking to
become his successor. Left behind, at least, is Buddy, the
Labrador, who now spends all night with the president when Hillary
Rodham Clinton is away.''(end ital) __ The New York Times, Jan. 19,
2000
 &HT;    Strange.
 &HT;    Strange that my best days here at the house should be his
saddest. Look at me, right here at his side, every night, in the
master-bedroom bed, and this whole place to ourselves now.
 &HT;    No more ``Hillary'' _ kind-but-oh-so-stern,
get-down-off-of-there-this-instant-Mister! Hillary. And no Chelsea;
where's Chelsea?
 &HT;    Just him and me and the nightlong play of his heavy hands upon
my head, and such a good view of wherever this is that we live with
all the white buildings glowing among the trees like, well,
behemoth and delicious-looking bones. Just him and me, finally, and
yet now he hardly ever wants to play.
 &HT;    What's wrong?
 &HT;    (ital)Head tilt.(end ital)
 &HT;    I should know. I'm his Buddy. Buddy is all that I am:
``Bud-dy,'' that simple, two-beat tug on my heart with which he
long ago hooked me, when I was only 3 months, flopping around on
the South Lawn beneath the great loom of him and his lilting,
crackly voice, issuing, with a long, upraised finger, those first,
memorable commands: ``Buddy, sit! Buddy, stay!''
 &HT;    ``Commander.'' ``Commander and Chief.''
 &HT;    I've heard him called this. He's the alpha. I'm sure of that.
But to me he is, above all else, a deeply familiar, visitable
scent. How should I describe it? Sun-dried hay with unmistakable
traces of cooked beef and pickle. That's what I miss most now.
There's a new tincture of worry and sorrow about his essence. He's
not himself, not one with his scent. I can no longer follow him.
 &HT;    The bedroom light is still on. It's getting very late. Hillary
would have had this room dark hours ago. He misses her, I think.
Nothing stirring now out in the house's hallways except the faint
shuffle of security feet and an occasional gash of radio static.
Down with his book, up with the phone again.
 &HT;    The fourth call tonight. Blab, blab, blab, and on and on, rivers
of blab that my brain hasn't nearly enough indents and folds to
absorb but for meaningless, flyaway pieces: ``Gore.'' ``Budget.''
``Barak.'' ``State of the Union.'' ``Legacy.'' ``Lame duck.''
 &HT;    (ital)Head tilt.(end ital)
 &HT;    What lame duck? Where? I'm the Labrador. I'll retrieve him. Is
it me? Have I displeased him? If I was to go get my tennis ball
right now and drop it directly into the lap of his sadness, would
that be what he wants?
 &HT;    ``Hey, Buddy.'' His hands again, stroking my ears, fast and
needy, even as he goes on talking, his long fingers playing my head
for a worry bead, all that worry, a whole wobbly world of it,
emptying down through the length of me. Has he more worries than
other masters? Is he like the others of you?
 &HT;    ``Syria.'' ``Assad.'' ``Chappaqua.'' ``Legacy.'' ``Lame duck.''
 &HT;    I know what's wrong. We're leaving here soon, aren't we? I can
sense such things, the about-to-happen, even when he means just to
go out for the night, all night these days, the big whoosh and
whine of his whirlybird's blades not sounding again until the early
morning hours, finally lifting me away from the fond fuzz of my
tennis ball for the sound of his footfall.
 &HT;    We're leaving here. For good. I know it. His body has a far
deeper lean to it than that of his other departures. He keeps going
about the house these days, checking the rooms as though looking
for something. What could it be?
 &HT;    I've checked them all. That's my job. To sniff out the furniture
for any signs of revolt, to explore even the unfurnished, orphaned
spaces, so that he can be more secure in them, can sit back in his
chair and do his job, issue his commands, me curled at his feet in
the Oval Office, watching his finger in the air, thinking the whole
world must be sitting, must be poised to stay for him for now.
 &HT;    That's it, isn't it? After all this time, he's about to leave,
wondering who is still listening to him, who has ever really
listened. He has that same steely look now that he gets when I
don't obey.
 &HT;    Blab and blab and blab on: ``Republicans!'' ``Congress!'' ``My
agenda!'' ``Health care!'' Slam goes the phone.
 &HT;    I'm tired. Where is sleep? He hardly sleeps anymore, always
worrying about what he'll leave behind. So many layers and tones it
has, his world. Too many-sided, his brain. It keeps working even in
his sleep, in the dreams that I guard as devotedly as I do his
days, dreams often as riled as my own when I'm chasing something,
chasing so hard that my paws flip faintly across this bed and my
barks bubble up in puffball trails of woofs.
 &HT;    There he goes, finally drifting off now, but still faintly
talking: ``Hillary.'' ``Chelsea.'' ``Legacy.'' ``Lame duck. ...''
 &HT;    Where? Just point, and I'll retrieve him.

made him one of the best _ and most controversial _ athletes of our
time. Seven years after leaving the pro tennis circuit McEnroe is
still at it _ and not just on the court in seniors matches. He has
taken his swagger to the broadcasting booth, where he has drawn a
lot of attention, most of it good; last year, he was nominated for
an Emmy. And in February he becomes captain of the Davis Cup team.

   These may be lonely and wistful times in the White House, but
the First Dog has never had it so good. In this article, Buddy, the
Labrador retriever, muses on his expanded role now that Bill
Clinton has headed into the eighth and final year of his
presidency, with Chelsea, his only child, away at college; Hillary,
his wife, in New York running for the Senate; and Al Gore, the vice
president, on the road seeking to beat George W. Bush.

   Ha Jin's first novel, ``Waiting,'' the story of a Chinese doctor
who wants to end his arranged marriage so he can marry a more
modern woman, recently won a National Book Award. It was a mere 11
years after Jin began writing seriously in English. In the 50-year
history of the awards, only two other writers who weren't native
English speakers have taken home the fiction prize: Isaac Bashevis
Singer and Jerzy Kosinski.

   John McEnroe, at age 40, has lost little of the intensity that
made him one of the best _ and most controversial _ athletes of our
time. Seven years after leaving the pro tennis circuit McEnroe is
still at it _ and not just on the court in seniors matches. He has
taken his swagger to the broadcasting booth, where he has drawn a
lot of attention, most of it good; last year, he was nominated for
an Emmy. And in February he becomes captain of the Davis Cup team.

&HT;     EX-PRISON OFFICIAL DEFENDS LIMITED VIEWS OF EXECUTION CHAMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The former warden of San Quentin Prison
testified that the public and the press are barred from seeing
condemned inmates strapped to a gurney and connected to a lethal
intravenous pump because it might appear guards use excessive force
or create a spectacle if inmates ``blow a vein'' and spurt blood.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arthur Calderon maintained that the state Department of
Corrections policy is not meant to cover up prison errors or
control public knowledge and opinion about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention was never to influence the media one way or
another,'' Calderon testified Monday before U.S. District Judge
Vaughn Walker of San Francisco. The policy is intended only to
ensure executions are carried out in a secure way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came in the first day of trial in a civil lawsuit
brought by two nonprofit news organizations that are challenging
the policy at San Quentin in Marin County. The groups are the
California First Amendment Coalition, and the Society of
Professional Journalists' Northern California chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature switched from the gas chamber to lethal
injection as a more humane method of execution in 1996. The next
execution, of Darrell Rich, convicted of multiple murders in Shasta
County, is set for March 15.
</P>
<P>
   The correction department's policy allows reporters and a dozen
chosen witnesses to watch the executions from the prison's
observation room, but only after guards leave the execution chamber
and the warden orders the lethal chemicals to start flowing through
the intravenous tubes connected to each of the inmate's arms.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections department contends the limited view is
necessary to protect the identity of the guards.
</P>
<P>
   The media groups contend that the policy violates the public's
right under the First Amendment to observe state executions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should have a full view of the process,'' said Alan
Schlosser, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of
Northern California, which is representing the groups.
</P>
<P>
   That view should begin about 20 minutes earlier than the prison
policy allows, when the inmate is first brought into the execution
chamber, Schlosser said. The public needs the additional access to
get a sense of the inmate's state of mind, how guards treat the
inmate and whether lethal injection is a humane means of execution,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations have suggested that guards could protect
their identity by wearing surgical masks or helmets.
</P>
<P>
   But prison officials told the court Monday that masks would
create additional security risks.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon testified that even though four guards lead the inmate,
whose hands are chained to his waist, into the execution room, the
prisoner still might be able to pull the mask over the guards' eyes
during a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that there have been no instances of inmates
resisting guards during past executions.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that there was no retaliation when the
press and public were allowed, under a since-vacated court order,
to see guards bring in Keith Daniel Williams, who was executed May
3, 1996, for murdering three people in Merced County.
</P>
<P>
   Under current policy, prison officials would close curtains on
the execution chamber window if an inmate ``blew a vein'' and
sprayed blood, Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a significant amount of blood, and we as a
department don't want to risk further traumatizing the witnesses,''
Calderon said.

   WIS-BACON (Wittenberg, Wis.) _ Sin is in, gastronomically
speaking. Which is why I found myself pulling up to Nueske's
Hilltop Farm, about 65 miles west of Green Bay, at midmorning one
crystalline day in January, with the car's digital thermometer
stuck at 5 implacable degrees below zero. I was there in pursuit of
postgraduate studies in bacon. Chefs everywhere are reaching for
real bacon, with its deep, smoky flavor, to jump-start their oyster
stews and their terrines, their collard greens and their roasted
birds. Fatty, allegedly artery-clogging bacon, which a few years
ago stood at the head of the diet cops' hate list, is suddenly back

technology that has turned him into the American king of

with a chemistry set. Last week, throughout a lunch of food cooked
in the bags _ beef cheeks, salmon, veal shank, artichokes, zucchini

LASSE HALLSTROM 
(``The Cider House Rules'')
<TEXT>
<P>
   Background: Third nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Prior experience will help him sincerely fake his
appreciation for the actual winner in this category.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: No Directors Guild nomination, no win.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Category's most surprising nominee will have to content
himself with the hoopla and the parties. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPIKE JONZE &QL; 
(``Being John Malkovich'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Directors Guild of America nomination. First Oscar
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Directed year's most inventive film. A master prankster,
people might vote for him just to see what he'd do at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Year's most inventive film might be a little too inventive
for some tastes. Movie wasn't nominated for best picture, either.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Probably won't win, but his mere presence should make
the ceremony much more fun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MICHAEL MANN &QL; 
(``The Insider'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Directors Guild of America, Golden Globes
nominations. First Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Quantum leap in artistic maturity. Kept nearly three
hours' worth of arcane blab about science, legalities and corporate
ethics gripping.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Writer-director twisted truth to achieve much of that
effect. The mass audience didn't care anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Could win, but that's hard to believe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAM MENDES &QL; 
(``American Beauty'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Won Golden Globe (drama), Los Angeles Film Critics,
Directors Guild of America nominations. First Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Impressive sense of pacing, tonal balance, visual
composition and storytelling _ and it's only his first movie.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Wasn't the year's only outstanding first-timer. More than
a whiff of condescension at work here.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Convinced the public that his movie was both
entertaining and had something to say. Oscar shouldn't be any
harder to sell. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN &QL; 
(``The Sixth Sense'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Directors Guild of America nomination. First
Oscarnomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Directed category's most popular film.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: His writing achievement !ital!(love that twist ending!)
tends to overshadow his directorial work.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: In two competitive categories, may go home
empty-handed. But then, that $10 million check Disney gave him for
his next movie might provide some consolation. &QL;

   George W. Bush is a born-again Protestant who says Jesus Christ
is the philosopher who most influenced him. John McCain is a
born-again Protestant who testifies that his faith helped him
survive a POW camp. Al Gore is a born-again Protestant who says he
frequently asks himself ``W.W.J.D?'' And Bill Bradley is a
Protestant who, though he refuses to discuss his faith, belonged to
the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and evangelized his basketball
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant monopoly on this year's major presidential
candidates may seem an aberration. John F. Kennedy's election
supposedly cracked the religious wall in presidential politics, and
the overt prejudice that barred Catholics, Jews and Mormons from
national elective politics has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Jews, who used to obsess about the first Jewish president, no
longer think about the issue. Presidential campaigns have become as
ecumenical as a Unitarian seder. Since JFK, candidates have been
Mormon (Orrin Hatch), Jewish (Arlen Specter), Eastern Orthodox
(Michael Dukakis) and Catholic (Ted and Bobby Kennedy, Bruce
Babbitt, Pat Buchanan and -- surprise -- Alan Keyes, among others).
</P>
<P>
   The president on the TV show ``West Wing'' is even Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But life is not imitating art. Though non-Protestants comprise
at least 35 percent of the American population, Kennedy remains the
only one ever elected president. And of the 14 major party nominees
since Kennedy's death, only Michael Dukakis was not a Protestant.
(Barry Goldwater's father was Jewish, though Goldwater was not.)
And there are good reasons to believe that the Protestant monopoly
will persist.
</P>
<P>
   America has not returned to the bad old days of know-nothingism
and anti-Semitism. The Protestant monopoly no longer stems from
prejudice. Americans insist they would vote for a presidential
candidate of almost any religious background. In 1937, 46 percent
said they would vote for a Jewish presidential candidate, and 47
percent said they wouldn't. In 1999, 92 percent said they would
vote for a Jew, and only 6 percent wouldn't. In 1958, 27 percent of
Americans said they would not vote for a Catholic. In 1999, only 4
percent said they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Though folks probably pretend to be more tolerant than they are,
the virulent anti-Catholicism that cost Kennedy 2 million votes has
vanished, as has most anti-Semitism. No one would dream of hinting
that a Catholic president would take orders from the pope, as some
did in 1960. Mario Cuomo says he ``never even considered the
possibility'' of anti-Catholic prejudice when he was pondering a
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Recent non-Protestant candidates didn't fail because of
religion. Hatch was dreary. Specter was a pro-choice Republican in
a pro-life party. Ted Kennedy never recovered from Chappaquiddick.
Bobby Kennedy was murdered. Buchanan was too vitriolic.
</P>
<P>
   The free pass does not extend to all religions. Seventeen
percent of Americans won't vote for a Mormon, the same as in 1967,
the last time Gallup surveyed about Mormons. Gallup does not poll
about Islam or other religions, probably because not even optimists
believe a Muslim could be elected president now.
</P>
<P>
   As for atheists, forget it. Only 49 percent of Americans would
vote for an atheist presidential candidate _ compared to 59 percent
who would vote for a gay one.
</P>
<P>
   If prejudice isn't blocking a Catholic or Jewish presidency, why
hasn't there been one lately?
</P>
<P>
   First, evangelicals are a huge obstacle to a non-Protestant
Republican presidency. Evangelical Protestants comprise one-quarter
of the population, they favor Republicans by 2-to-1, and they are
concentrated in the Southern states that are the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the strength of evangelicals and the concentration of
the party in the South, it would be very difficult for a Catholic
to get the Republican nomination for president,'' says Catholic
University politics professor John White.
</P>
<P>
   This constituency is one reason why Bush _ not a Northern
Catholic such as John Engler of Michigan, Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin, George Pataki of New York, or Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
_ is the Republican governor running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Demography also damages the presidential prospects of Catholic
and Jewish Democrats. Jews and Catholics populate the Northeast,
but since the Dukakis debacle, the Democratic establishment has all
but abandoned Northeasterners as serious presidential candidates,
concluding that they are too liberal to succeed nationwide. This
eliminates the most promising Jews and Catholics from presidential
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two easiest groups to elect president,'' says University
of California, San Diego professor Sam Popkin, ``are Northeastern
Republicans and border state Democrats'' _ lefty Republicans and
righty Democrats _ virtually none of whom are Catholic or Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion undermines Catholic presidential candidates. A Catholic
candidate's abortion position, no matter what it is, would incite
far more anger than the same position taken by a non-Catholic. Most
Catholics are Democrats and are pro-life, but a pro-lifer can't win
the Democratic nomination. (Witness the ostracism of former
Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey.) And a Democratic Catholic candidate
who was pro-choice would be at odds with a noisy and powerful
church hierarchy and might lose some of the Catholic vote on which
Democrats depend.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican Catholic would have to be pro-life, and that would
bring its own difficulties. When a Protestant such as Bush says he
opposes abortion, most Americans assume that he won't do much about
it. If a Catholic pol said the same thing, voters might believe
that he would act on it. In a general election, pro-choice but
otherwise Republican voters would turn out heavily against a
pro-life Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   (Jewish candidates would be similarly lassoed by Israel. A
Christian candidate's position on Israel hardly interests anyone. A
Jewish candidate's position on Israel would polarize everyone who
has even the slightest opinion about it. But there is no
``Protestant'' issue that could trap a Protestant candidate.)
</P>
<P>
   Money handicaps non-Protestant candidates. Catholics, Mormons
and Jews are less networked than Protestant candidates. (The
Kennedys are the exception.) Dukakis raised millions from the
Greek-American community but lacked access to the old-line and
corporate cash that fed George Bush. George W. Bush got the nod
over the Catholic governors in part because he could raise millions
more than they could.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential monopoly also continues because of the style of
religion in American politics favors Protestants. Americans demand
public professions of faith from their presidential candidates.
Religion serves as a proxy for morality. As the wall between church
and state has crumbled, candidates have felt more obliged to
discuss their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Such God talk never occurred a generation ago. ``It was
inconceivable that Nixon or Eisenhower would talk about their
personal religion, but it is becoming de rigueur that a candidate
do that today,'' says Notre Dame history professor John McGreevy.
</P>
<P>
   This religious revelation benefits Protestants. Protestantism is
America's normal religion, practiced by 60 percent of the
population. Americans are more familiar with Protestant language
and concepts than Jewish or Catholic ones.
</P>
<P>
   More important, profession of faith is itself a Protestant idea.
The foundation of evangelical Protestantism is ``testimony'' about
your discovery of Christ. Such public testimony is anathema to Jews
and Catholics, who almost never talk about their personal
relationships with God.
</P>
<P>
   Protestantism is individualistic, while Judaism and Catholicism
are communal. A Protestant presidential candidate can speak about
her beliefs in personal terms without seeming to impose them on
others. Protestantism is an individualist faith fit for an
individualistic culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholicism and Judaism are ``we'' religions. Protestant
language tends to be personal and nonjudgmental. Catholic language,
by contrast, insists on absolute communal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic and Jewish candidates must choose either of two
approaches. One is to avoid talking about their faith. Dukakis
didn't even nod at our civic religion. He would have lost anyway,
but his relentless secularism undoubtedly cost him votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, though a Protestant, is hurting his campaign by
rejecting religious talk. Black voters, who tend to be religious,
are a core Democratic constituency, and Gore is wooing them by
riffing constantly about his religious journey. Political analysts
say that one reason Bradley may be polling so poorly among blacks
is that he refuses to discuss his faith.
</P>
<P>
   The other choice for Catholic and Jewish candidates is to speak
of their faith and hope it works. Some Catholics, notably Pat
Buchanan, have alienated voters with coercive, collective rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Catholic can only get elected president by talking like a
Protestant,'' says John Green, director of the University of
Akron's Bliss Institute.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, none of the obstacles to a Catholic or Jewish
president is insurmountable. But collectively, they block most
potential candidates from even considering a run, and they cripple
those who make the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would have to find a fairly conservative Catholic or
Jew, who's not from the Northeast, who is pro-choice but also
publicly religious, who is comfortable talking about personal
faith, and who is connected to lots of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would have to find a well-connected Catholic who can
thrill Southern evangelicals with his conservatism but won't scare
away moderates with his strong pro-life views. Good luck!
</P>
<P>
   There is a final way a non-Protestant could become president.
Either party might name a Catholic, Jewish, or Mormon vice
presidential candidate. After eight years as second fiddle, a
Catholic veep would be well-positioned for a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   But that backdoor to the White House may be the only door open
to Catholics, Jews and Mormons for some time.

&HT;     TOP MILITARY OFFICER URGES CLINTON NOT TO DELAY MISSILE
DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, urged President Clinton Tuesday to stick to his
plan to decide this summer whether to deploy a defense system
against long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton made the recommendation despite an internal Pentagon
study that on Monday called for a delay in the decision since there
are serious questions about whether such a system could be built by
2005, its current target date.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the joint chiefs told defense writers he was
``comfortable with the June deadline'' that the administration has
set for the Pentagon to make a recommendation to Clinton on the
system's feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that while the system of computers, tracking radars
and interceptors may face significant technological hurdles, the
missile threat from ``rogue'' nations such as North Korea justifies
the schedule and the system's multi-billion dollar price tag. In
the past he has also cited U.S. concerns over the possibility of an
accidental nuclear launch by Russia's aging missile arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the tight schedule for the U.S. defense system,
Shelton said, ``There have been those who have argued, `Don't rush
to failure.' We don't considering it rushing to failure, but we do
consider it rushing. We are on a fast track, one that carries a
very high degree of risk in terms of getting it right,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Under current plans, the June recommendation will be made by
Defense Secretary William Cohen after consulting with Shelton and
other senior defense officials. Clinton will then decide this
summer whether to move ahead with deployment of the so-called
National Missile Defense System.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to approve, the system would be targeted for
deployment by 2005. But that decision would require Russia to
accede to changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which
forbids both nations to develop such a system, or force the United
States to withdraw from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Pentagon has conducted two tests of the system.
One succeeded last fall while the other, conducted Jan. 18, failed.
An additional test is tentatively scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's top weapons tester, Philip E. Coyle, in a report
Monday to Congress and Cohen, criticized the decision schedule,
saying it puts ``undue pressure'' on the project's managers.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle, director of operational testing and evaluation, said the
current timetable would force the Pentagon to make its
recommendation to Clinton before results from the third test can be
fully assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Such rapid decision-making historically ``has resulted in a
negative effect on virtually every (weapon) development program,''
Coyle wrote in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to spend $12.7 billion on the effort over the
next five years. Coyle's report says that the total cost over 20
years would be $26.6 billion.

  (For release Sun., Feb. 20)

<P>
   Amtrak began all-electric train service between New York and
Boston at the end of January, paring 45 minutes off the time for
the old part-electric, part-diesel trip, bringing it down to 3
hours 59 minutes. As a way of traversing 231 miles, it is still no
world-beater, and in fact, a 1941 timetable shows the Merchants
Limited running from Grand Central to South Station in only 16
minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   But today's relevant question is not how this rail trip compares
with the glamorous lost past of railroading, but with the scheduled
one-hour air-shuttle trip, if the time needed to get out of and
into the center of both cities is added in. To do this, a
colleague, Tim Bralczyk, and I set out on a race on Feb. 4, the
first Friday of the new service. We were both served Green Mountain
coffee, but otherwise our experiences diverged in the Northeast
Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   The current all-electric rail trip, which Amtrak calls the Acela
Regional service, does not use the svelte new trains that have the
design buffs agog. These are due later _ how much later, an Amtrak
spokesman could not say; it depends when the builders get the bugs
out. Today's Acela service, two trains in each direction, morning
and evening, uses humbler electric locomotives and spottily
rejuvenated rolling stock. These trains are all-reserved, meaning
everyone can sit down, but are otherwise amenity-free.
</P>
<P>
   Tim got a reservation aboard the 8:35 a.m. Acela Regional out of
Penn Station, due in South Station, Boston, at 12:34 p.m.; that one
minute, presumably, enables Amtrak to say ``less than four hours.''
I got a ticket for the Delta Shuttle out of La Guardia Airport's
Marine Terminal, aiming for the 8:30 a.m. We agreed to use public
transit at both ends, and planned to meet for lunch near the State
House on Boston Common. Tim reserved the 5 p.m. return Acela train
and I aimed for the 4:30 p.m. Delta shuttle out of Logan. We
correctly presumed that Friday afternoon would represent the time
of maximum pressure.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold dry day, with a fast track and two experienced
contestants, the air trip retained downtown-to-downtown honors
easily. Fog, blizzard or air-controller problems might easily have
reversed it. Here are some details of our venture.
</P>
<P>
   Tim left Union Square on the BMT at 7:50 a.m. and arrived at
Penn Station at 8. The first call for Acela Regional, Train 130,
arriving from Washington, was at 8:20. Business class, where Tim
was sitting _ no more first or club class _ was at the rear, behind
the cafe car. ``Train pulls out at 8:37 a.m.,'' Tim wrote. ``No
food service at the seat, no paper. Conductor says that will change
in future.'' (A week later, Amtrak said that free papers and
beverages were available in business class.)
</P>
<P>
   ``P.A. system barely audible,'' Tim wrote. ``One passenger
complains he's worried he won't hear his stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, there are not a lot of stops: Stamford, New Haven and
New London, Conn.; Kingston and Providence, R.I.; Route 128, Back
Bay and South Station in Boston. A conductor wearing the badge Sal
Alfone told Tim that near Kingston, the Acela gets up to 110 miles
an hour but that on the sections of track shared with the New Haven
division of Metro-North, the maximum speeds permitted are 70 to 79
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The big time saving comes with improved track and re-engineered
grade crossings that enable the trains to take the 105-odd miles
across Connecticut at a much steadier clip than before. About 20
minutes is saved, however, in New Haven, where electric engines no
longer need to be swapped for diesel.
</P>
<P>
   Tim went to the cafe car and bought himself an egg sandwich,
orange juice and Green Mountain coffee for $6. The fancy coffee was
described by the cafe car server, Tony Sanders, as part of the
revamping of the train. Tim thought the coffee was so good, he went
back for another and was glad to learn seconds were free.
</P>
<P>
   But someplace there, No. 130 lost time. Though it was only two
minutes late out of New Haven, it made it into South Station at
12:50, 16 minutes late. Tim took the T Red Line two stops to Park
Street and hiked up the Common, arriving for lunch at 1:15. Elapsed
time, Union Square to Beacon Street: 5 hours 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ever anxious about getting to La Guardia, I boarded the No. 7
Flushing train in Times Square at 7:10 a.m., but subway and buses
were in the groove. ``To Jackson Hts. stop on No. 7,'' my notes
say. ``7:37, onto Q-47. Arrive Marine Terminal 8 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With my ticket already in hand, and with an armload of free
newspapers and magazines, I was the first passenger onto the B-727.
I took a comfortable exit-row seat. The plane pushed back from the
terminal on schedule at 8:30 a.m., but was in line behind 11
others.
</P>
<P>
   In the air at 9 a.m., I was dealt a six-ounce orange juice, a
brown bag with a yellowish bagel, minute containers of light cream
cheese and jam product and four cough drops. Added to this was the
paper cup of Green Mountain coffee. I could not finish it before we
reached Logan's Terminal A at 9:35.
</P>
<P>
   The free No. 22 Massport bus to the T rapid transit system
leaves every 8 to 10 minutes, according to the information clerk.
It got me to the Airport stop on the Blue Line at 10:10 a.m., where
I walked onto a Bowdoin-bound train as it pulled in. I changed to
the Green Line at Government Center, aka Scollay Square, and rode
one stop to Park Street, where a church clock was chiming 10:30
a.m. I hiked up the hill to the State House. Elapsed time, Times
Square to Beacon Street: 3 hours 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, Tim and I traded tales. Tim said his seatmates were
executive types who plugged their laptops into the outlets under
the windows, read or napped. A few tables with power outlets were
staked out by passengers who did not appear to be holding business
meetings. Cell phones are usable on the train without restriction.
Tim saw a few in use on the way up, more on the way back. But
business class comes with no free meal, which one got in
first-class on the premium Boston trains a few years ago. The phone
booth in the business-class car is the only other extra, and it's
not free.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the air shuttle, the actual flight time was too brief for
a lot &QC; of work: the man next to me scanned a newspaper and then made
out his expense account. No one used the seat-back phones that I
could see, although people trotted off the plane with cell phones
to ear.
</P>
<P>
   For the return trip, Tim started out from the Museum of Fine
Arts, took the commuter line at Ruggles for the seven-minute trip
to Back Bay, where he boarded the Acela immediately at 5:05 p.m.
The train was short on comfort. ``Cafe car late in opening _ not
until Providence due to late delivery of supplies,'' his notes say.
``Business car much more crowded than a.m. train. Cafe car line
went halfway down aisle of adjoining car on the coach side.
Announcements were made asking people to delay trip to cafe until
the line went down. Car was way too hot. Conductor said she would
have to go outside at the next stop to adjust the temp. It got a
little better but still too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   The man next to Tim him on the train, he said, was writing a
television script on his laptop. ``I tried not to look,'' he said,
``but he wrote `commercial break,' so I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 133 was on time into Penn Station at 9 p.m. Tim was back at
Union Square at 9:20 p.m. Elapsed time, Ruggles to Union Square: 4
hours 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I boarded the Green Line of the T at Boylston at 3:20 p.m.,
traveling to Airport and boarding the Massport bus at 3:47 p.m. I
got to the Delta counter at 3:59, just after the closing of an
early extra section of the 4:30 shuttle. I boarded the regular
section at 4:11 p.m., and we were in the air at 4:45. I got a
basket with crackers, a sliver of cheese and other odds and ends. I
drank a bottle of spring water and put the basket in my backpack.
</P>
<P>
   The plane got through thick clouds to land at La Guardia at 5:35
p.m. I boarded the empty Q-47 bus at 5:50 p.m. Along the way I was
joined by a crowd of ebullient students. We all piled off at
Roosevelt Avenue, and I got aboard the E train at 6:20. Elapsed
time to Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street, 3 hours 35 minutes.
(Remarkably, this exactly matched the time it took to get to
Boston.)
</P>
<P>
   My shuttle ticket for a weekday round trip, bought from a travel
agent five days in advance, cost $230. Tim's morning trip, an
off-peak ticket in business class, cost $76. His afternoon return,
business class again, but a peak-hour ticket, cost $91, for a total
of $167. He paid $6 for breakfast and didn't eat on the way home.
My two snacks were free. In Acela coach class, which also must be
reserved, the morning off-peak ticket would have cost $56 and the
afternoon peak-hour ticket $71, for a total of $127 round trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that Amtrak charges higher fares on Friday
and Sunday afternoons across the board. A New York-to-Boston ticket
on a slow train on Friday afternoon or evening costs $59, rather
than $50, so the price of saving 45 minutes of train travel is $12
rather than $21.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the morning Acela Regional trains in both directions
between Washington and Boston run only Monday to Friday. The
higher-fare 5 o'clock trains are offered daily. Stephen
Taubenkibel, an Amtrak spokesman, said that more fast trains would
be phased in. By May, he said, there will be three round trips a
day, and by summer, six a day. Added amenities will come with the
new equipment, he said, when there will again be first class as
well as business class.

OLIVE OIL REPLACES BUTTER AND MAKES FOR A SIMPLE BATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a tradition of baking with olive oil:
focaccia, most pizza dough and some breads rely on it. But olive
oil, a fat that is among the most healthful imaginable, is unusual
in sweet baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising, because the flavor of extra virgin olive oil
is a powerful and welcome addition to sweet and savory cookies, the
type that are best nibbled with a glass of sweet wine. Even in
traditional sugar cookies, olive oil works if you use one with a
milder flavor, like a pure or light oil.
</P>
<P>
   I began making cookies with olive oil a few years ago, when the
fear-of-fat movement was at its peak. It served as an alternative
to the many recipes that used margarine or shortening, the
hydrogenated fats that are now considered riskier to your health
than butter. I also substituted olive oil in cookies that called
for tasteless oils like corn. I still do it because there are times
when I want the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil is not butter, of course, and you will never get that
incomparably tender crumb when using it in cookie dough. But olive
oil does produce cookies with a caky interior and nicely crisped
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike solid fats, olive oil requires neither melting nor
creaming. This makes putting together a batch of cookies as simple
as making pancakes: you mix together the dry ingredients, then the
wet ones, combine the two, and drop them onto a cookie sheet
(dropped cookies are always easier than rolled cookies, and the
only real sacrifice is appearance). The entire process takes less
time than preheating the oven.
</P>
<P>
   You can use olive oil in many batters for dropped cookies,
essentially substituting it measure for measure for butter,
although you may need to cut back on other liquids in the recipe.
But it would not work in shortbread-type cookies.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite cookies made with olive oil take advantage of the
slightly peppery flavor of most good extra virgin oils, which I
enhance with a little black pepper and complement with rosemary,
fresh or dried. Instead of milk, I use red wine for the liquid,
either something fruity like pinot noir or zinfandel. The batter
contains a fair amount of sugar, so the cookies are sweet but with
an elusive complexity that most people, including children, seem to
like.
</P>
<P>
   For a more traditional cookie, I use a lighter oil and follow a
relatively standard recipe, adding vanilla and replacing the red
wine with milk. Although the taste is not buttery, it is subtle and
not offensive the way cookies made with shortening or margarine can
be.
</P>
<P>
   But the cookies with rosemary and pepper have a more
sophisticated flavor and, served with a sweet wine like a vin
santo, are good as an alternative to biscotti. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OLIVE OIL COOKIES WITH RED WINE AND ROSEMARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups flour
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary, or { teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   } cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   { cup olive oil, plus a little for cookie sheet
</P>
<P>
   } cup, or a little more, dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Combine the dry ingredients.
Beat the eggs with the olive oil and wine. Use a rubber spatula to
stir the liquid mix into the dry one, until well combined. If the
mixture is stiff, add a little more wine.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drop mix by rounded teaspoons onto a lightly oiled cookie
sheet, and bake 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let
cool a couple of minutes, then remove the cookies to a rack to cool
further.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 4 dozen cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Olive Oil Sugar Cookies: Omit the pepper; the rosemary is
optional. Increase the sugar to 1 cup. Use milk in place of red
wine, and add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the mix. Bake as above.

VATICAN AND PALESTINIANS SIGN AGREEMENT ON CHURCH'S STATUS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Vatican on Tuesday signed an agreement with the
Palestine Liberation Organization that would protect freedom of
religion and the legal status of Christian churches in a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also underlines the ``inalienable national
legitimate rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before John Paul II met with Yasser Arafat in the
Vatican, their representatives signed a document that, among other
things, jointly stated that ``unilateral decisions and actions
altering the specific character and status of Jerusalem are morally
and illegally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who plans a pilgrimage to holy sites in Israel and
Palestinian-controlled territories in late March, Tuesday accepted
an invitation from Arafat to add Jericho to his schedule, which,
like Bethlehem, is under Palestinian control. It was Arafat's ninth
visit with the pope, who has never concealed his sympathy for the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Paul II once again expressed the solidarity of the Holy
See for the Palestinian people, who are still waiting to see their
legitimate aspirations realized,'' Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, said after the pope's meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Israel responded to news of the agreement by accusing the
Vatican of interfering with its peace effort with the Palestinians.
In a statement the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, ``Israel
expresses great displeasure with the declaration today in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said, ``The inclusion of Jerusalem and other
issues connected to the negotiations on final status in an
agreement signed by these parties is an intervention in the
negotiations between the Israeli and the Palestinians and we are
sorry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has long criticized Israel's annexation of East
Jerusalem, and, worried about the security and status of Christian
holy sites, has lobbied for the city to be granted a special,
internationally-guaranteed status. The Israeli government, which
views Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, has repeatedly ignored
previous Vatican calls for such status.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The wording on an internationally-guaranteed statute for such
status for Jerusalem reads as a reproach to the Israeli government
and a reaffirmation of the Vatican's support for a Palestinian
state. But it also seeks to bind Palestinian leaders to recognize
the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Article five states, ``The PLO recognizes the freedom of the
Catholic Church to exercise her rights to carry out, through the
necessary means, her functions and traditions, such as those that
are spiritual, religious, moral, charitable and educational.''
</P>
<P>
   Article seven commits Palestinian law to respect ``the legal
personality of the Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the document merely puts in writing what has been
Vatican policy since Rome established official relations with the
Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1994. By formally lending
its moral authority to the Palestinian cause, however, the Vatican
secured commitments on legal rights and religious freedom from an
eventual Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic concession
that the Holy See has not succeeded in reaching with Muslim
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the midst of a sudden impasse in talks between Israeli
and Palestinian officials over the conditions for Palestinian
statehood, however, the agreement added pressure to an already
tense Mideast stand-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing for the Holy See to have its own views, but
quite another to sign an agreement with one of the parties involved
in direct peace negotiations,'' Aharon Lopez, Israeli ambassador to
the Holy See, said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``dismayed'' by what he viewed as interference in
ongoing negotiations, noting that its preamble, which includes the
demand for international guarantees on the status of Jerusalem,
``deals with issues that are at the core of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Church experts argue Israel had forced the Holy See's hand by
making no provisions to safeguard church property and rights in its
previous agreements with the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel itself made this agreement inevitable by creating a
legal vacuum,'' the Rev. David Maria Jaeger, a canon law professor
who advises the Vatican on Middle East affairs, explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Israel ceded part of its territory, it left all civil
matters and religious affairs in the hands of the Palestinian
authority. It therefore became necessary to make a maximum effort
to ensure standards within Palestinian polity.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also appears to reflect Vatican concerns that if
and when Israel cedes more territory to the Palestinians to secure
a long-term settlement, responsibility for Christian property will
be handed over first, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an underlying assumption among many experts close to
the Vatican that Israel intends to transfer control of holy places
in Jerusalem to the Palestinians,'' a Vatican observer noted. ``It
is the cheapest currency that can be paid to the Palestinians;
Israel takes no real interest in the control of church affairs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Vatican, which established formal diplomatic ties with
Israel in 1993, was alarmed and infuriated by a recent Israeli
decision to allow Muslim leaders in Nazareth to build a mosque next
to the Basilica of the Annunciation, which is built on the site
where tradition says the angel Gabriel told Mary she would bear the
son of God.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth is the largest Arab town in Israel, where Muslims
greatly outnumber Christians, but the basilica is one of the most
revered shrines of the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to visit Nazareth in March, but church
officials have not yet reconciled themselves to the mosque, or the
Israeli government's decision to overlook the arguments of local
Catholic leaders and the Vatican.

<P>
   Peppers release their heat in many ways, whether in a straight
drive like cayenne or a consuming explosion like a jalapeno. The
Aleppo pepper is more seductive, exuding a mellow, earthy warmth
that seems to expand rapidly, then slowly dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   When sprinkled over roasted potatoes, the deep red waxy flakes
of the Aleppo, a pepper that comes from Syria, do not just add
flavor; they change the potatoes. Behind their pure nutty flavor,
there is smokiness and a little spice. With carrots, the pepper
underlines the vegetable's sweetness with its own raisin-like taste
_ and that lingering heat. It is like paprika, but much more
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Aleppo refers to red peppers in the capsicum family that are
grown, partly dried and coarsely ground around the city of Aleppo.
Other peppers from nearby regions look the same, but the Aleppo
flavor is distinct, just as the flavor of prosciutto di Parma is
distinct from other cured pork.
</P>
<P>
   As alluring as it is, Aleppo pepper has managed to elude most
chefs and home cooks. Restaurants serving Syrian and other Middle
Eastern food, like Zaytoons in Brooklyn, Moustache in Greenwich
Village and Layla in TriBeCa, do not even use it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the chefs who have discovered it can't seem to put it
down. Floyd Cardoz of Tabla uses Aleppo pepper in a number of
dishes, often blended with cayenne and chilies from India and New
Mexico. Its mild, rich heat is in the pan-roasted lobster glazed
with Goan curry and in the tomato curry sauce served with a raviolo
of spinach and sheep's milk ricotta. It even finds a place in a
warm Cheddar fondue with cumin.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Goldstein, a San Francisco chef who has written cookbooks,
is another devotee of Aleppo pepper, and like Cardoz, she is not a
purist about it. She often simply uses it in place of other dried
red peppers for a richer, smokier aroma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have the choice of using hot paprika or a
paprika-cayenne combination, that's the time to use it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleppo pepper is sold in most good spice shops, like Adriana's
Bazaar at Grand Central Market, (800) 316-0820, and Kalustyans, 123
Lexington Avenue, (212) 685-3416. It is also sold online at
www.worldspice.com. The price is usually around $2 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pepper called Maras comes from just over the border in
Turkey. It looks the same as the Aleppo _ bright red, flaked and
moist from a small addition of salt _ but is a tad hotter. Urfa,
also from Turkey, is darker and smokier, with a deeper, dried-fruit
aroma. Sometimes these peppers are not even packaged with specific
names. Maras and Aleppo may simply be labeled Middle Eastern
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Aleppo is used in a spread called muhammara, in which the coarse
powder is diluted in oil and water, then mixed with bread crumbs,
ground walnuts, lemon juice and pomegranate syrup, and eaten like
hummus, with flatbread. It is also used to season meat fillings,
legumes and salads.
</P>
<P>
   But you can use it like any other dried red pepper. It can be
sprinkled over sweet potatoes with a little coarse sea salt and
olive oil before roasting them. Aleppo blends well with other
spices, too, like toasted and ground cumin and coriander for
coating pieces of carrot before roasting or braising. The light,
thin flakes cling well to vegetables, fish and meats and work well
with other spices as rubs or in marinades.
</P>
<P>
   Aleppo's sweetness and soft heat is especially good with sweet
vegetables like tomatoes and eggplant. One way to see this is to
char eggplants and puree them while warm with garlic, olive oil and
lemon juice, adding a touch of Aleppo at the end. The pepper
underscores the smokiness of the eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   As Cardoz points out, Aleppo has one quality that few other
dried red peppers have: you can add it to a finished dish and not
worry about the sharpness overwhelming it. ``If you add almost any
other chili pepper at the end of cooking, it hits you in the
throat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleppo has a roasted, finished flavor, so you can simmer white
beans with onion, garlic and herbs, then sprinkle in the pepper to
taste, rather than having to guess how much to add at the start.
</P>
<P>
   Its restraint is built in. And so is its charm. It's sweet,
smoky and a tiny bit bitter _ a pepper that creates its own layer
of flavor, quite unlike any other. &QL;

A GLOSSY COAT OF MISO ADDS FLAVOR TO A STEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the seventh of eight columns by Tadashi Ono, the chef at
Sono in Manhattan. They are written with Mark Bittman.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the last few years, fish marinated in miso has
become a popular dish in restaurants all over town. It is not hard
to understand why. The preparation is instantly appealing: the miso
transforms the texture of the fish while adding an intriguing
interplay of sweet, salty and tangy flavors.
</P>
<P>
   But equally popular in Japan, and hardly ever seen here, is meat
glazed with miso. Miso is, of course, the delicious Japanese paste
made from fermented soybeans and sometimes other grains like rice
and barley.
</P>
<P>
   It is intensely savory, as powerful a flavoring as Parmesan. But
you wouldn't want to use it in a marinade with meat; you don't want
to permeate the flesh with flavor as much as complement it. A glaze
for pan-grilled steaks seems an ideal way to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Miso, it turns out, works perfectly in place of long-cooked meat
stock. It provides the same depth of flavor, but with almost none
of the effort: a package of miso is one of the great convenience
foods.
</P>
<P>
   The glaze begins with aromatics softening in butter _ garlic and
shallots, in the French style, but ginger as well _ and continues
with a reduction of red wine. Its character is transformed by two
ingredients: mirin, Japanese sweet cooking wine, and toban djan,
Japanese chili-bean paste.
</P>
<P>
   (Both are sold at Asian markets, but you can substitute equal
parts water and honey for the mirin and a spicy Asian chili paste
for the toban djan.) I prefer country-style miso, which is made
with rice and soy; it is medium-bodied and slightly sweet (or use
half light and half dark miso).
</P>
<P>
   When you top a cooked steak with the glaze and run it under the
broiler, it becomes glossy, quite sweet and a little crisp _
perhaps comparable to the most sophisticated ketchup you could
imagine. Because I chop the aromatics rather than mince them, they
remain somewhat chunky and a little crunchy, giving the glaze
additional texture.
</P>
<P>
   With the steak, I serve a simple seared, unseasoned eggplant,
which can be used to mop up the delicious juices from the meat and
glaze. It has the creamy texture that you usually look for when
cooking eggplant, but without a lot of oil or stirring. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEEF WITH MISO-CHILI GLAZE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pound eggplant (preferably 4 very small eggplants)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peeled and finely chopped ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon toban djan or other chili paste
</P>
<P>
   } cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons mirin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons country-style miso, or a mixture of light and dark
miso
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 6- to 8-ounce steaks, preferably rib-eye, sirloin or hanger
steaks (or filet mignon)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped chives
</P>
<P>
   1. Slice the eggplant { to 1 inch thick, and make \-inch
crosshatch patterns on both sides of each slice. (If you are using
small eggplants, cut them in half the long way and make a \-inch
crosshatch pattern on the flesh side.) Preheat the oven to 450
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan, and turn the
heat to medium-high. When butter foams, add the shallots, ginger
and garlic, and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds; don't let the
vegetables become too soft. Stir in the chili paste, and cook,
stirring, 30 seconds or so, until the mixture is uniformly colored.
Add the wine, and reduce, stirring occasionally, until pasty but
not dry. Stir in the mirin, and cook until most of it is absorbed.
Stir in the miso until well blended, dark and glossy. Turn the heat
to a minimum, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. Put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet, and
turn the heat to medium high. Add the eggplant (skin side down with
the small ones), and cook until it begins to brown. Turn the heat
down a bit and cook 2 minutes, then place in the oven for 5 minutes
or so, until tender.
</P>
<P>
   4. Meanwhile, put the remaining butter and oil in a large
skillet, and heat over a high flame for one minute. Season the
steaks with salt and pepper, and sear them on both sides until rare
to medium, according to taste, about 2 to 3 minutes a side. Set
aside in a warm place, and turn on the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   5. Stir any of the liquid that has accumulated around the steaks
into the miso sauce, then glaze the steaks generously with the
sauce. Run the steaks under the broiler until the sauce bubbles and
begins to burn a little bit, about 2 minutes. Serve the steaks with
the eggplant, and garnish with chives.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

BARBERAS WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Years ago, I stumbled on the perfect everyday red
wine: barbera. Its combination of sweet fruit and buzz-saw acidity
made it a delicious and versatile companion for robust foods like
pasta and tomato sauce or a broiled steak, yet it was pleasingly
untannic and would not overwhelm more delicate fish or chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, I was only discovering what has been known for
centuries in the Piedmont region of Italy, where barbera, the most
widely planted grape, is the vino da tavola. The region has its
special wines as well, Barolos and Barbarescos, made from the
nebbiolo grape, wines that show their wonders only after long _
sometimes very long _ aging.
</P>
<P>
   But barberas show their wonders daily, because the joy of
barbera is its delicious accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera has always been inexpensive, but these days some
winemakers are aging the wine in small oak barrels in an effort to
give it greater complexity and long-lived structure. Such a
personality change, of course, means sticker shock: I've seen wines
like those selling for more than $50.
</P>
<P>
   These dressed-up wines can be interesting and occasionally
excellent, but for the most part they strike me as pretentious and
silly, like wearing pressed jeans and shined work boots.
</P>
<P>
   The Piedmont also makes another everyday wine, dolcetto, which I
usually find softer and less pleasing than barbera, partly because
it is far less acidic. The high acidity is one of barbera's
virtues, allowing the wine to stand up to assertive foods like
tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the acidity is too aggressive, yielding wines that are
harsh and vinegary. When properly balanced by the fruit, however,
barberas are sweetly inviting and endlessly pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   The best barberas usually come from Alba or Asti, but not
always. Sometimes they don't even come from the Piedmont like the
Martilde below, which is produced in Lombardy, in Oltrepo Pavese.
</P>
<P>
   These six wines are listed in order of preference. &QL;

COURT ORDERS RELEASE OF MEDICAL REPORT ON PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a decision extending Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
enforced stay in England, the High Court on Tuesday ordered Britain
to disclose a doctors' report on his health to four countries
seeking his extradition to face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential report prompted Home Secretary Jack Straw to
say in January that he was inclined to end the ailing 84-year-old
former dictator's 16-month house arrest in England and let him
return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, High Court Judge Maurice Kay supported the
government's decision to keep the medical report secret, and
Pinochet's chances of getting his wish to leave promptly appeared
so secure that a Chilean air force ambulance plane was sent to
England to pick him up. But the decision Tuesday made an imminent
departure unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's unanimous ruling of a three-judge panel came in
response to a challenge by six human rights groups and the
government of Belgium. It entitles the four countries _ Spain,
Switzerland and France in addition to Belgium _ to study the
medical report ``under conditions of strict confidentiality'' and
report their impressions back to Straw. The Home Office said those
reports must be submitted by 5 p.m. Feb. 22. The rights groups did
not get access to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever there were a case in which the integrity of the
international justice system needed to be demonstrated, a case
calling for the highest standards of transparency and fairness,
this is it,'' explained Lord Justice Simon Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``simply not satisfactory'' that such a critical
document be withheld from the parties with a legitimate interest in
pursuing the case. The four countries have formal extradition
requests to try Pinochet on torture charges dating from his rule of
Chile between 1973 and 1990, during which more than 3,000 people
died or disappeared.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justice John Dyson agreed, saying fairness required disclosure
because of the ``enormity of the alleged crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown noted the months of legal and judicial maneuvering over
whether Pinochet, who is a member of Chile's senate, would face
charges and said: ``It is high time the decision was taken. Senator
Pinochet has spent quite long enough in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The report in question was compiled by four medical specialists
from Britain asked by the Home Office to examine Pinochet after his
own doctors said his health was worsening. He was said to be
suffering from diabetes and to have had several small strokes in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11 Straw released the results of the examination,
conducted six days earlier, and said he was inclined ``to take the
view that no purpose would be served by continuing the present
extradition proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was the ``unequivocal and unanimous conclusion
that following recent deterioration in the state of Senator
Pinochet's health, which seems to have occurred principally during
September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial,
and that no change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
   When challenged to make the details public, Straw said that he
was bound by a pledge of confidentiality he had made to Pinochet.
Brown said Tuesday that the public interest ``outweighs any
contrary private interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was based on the desire of the countries to determine
whether the infirmities were only physical or whether they would
affect Pinochet's ability to understand the charges against him and
direct his own defense. They argued that without seeing the
document itself they couldn't make that judgment and mount a
meaningful challenge to Straw's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Nicholls, the British lawyer who leads Pinochet's defense,
accepted the court's declaration and said he hoped the promised
confidentiality would be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Straw said earlier that he would not resist the order of the
court, and Tuesday the Home Office said that he would await the
reports from the four nations Feb. 22 and make his decision on
whether to let Pinochet go ``shortly after then.'' Even with a
positive decision from Straw at that point, however, the general's
departure would not be assured as the countries could lodge an
appeal.

   ``This ruling is a victory for fairness, transparency, the rule
of law and Pinochet's victims,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director
of Human Rights Watch, one of the groups that brought the legal
challenge. ``It means that a decision on whether or not he is in
fact unfit to stand trial will be made on the basis of a full
review of the evidence and be decided in a court of law in
accordance with proper medical and legal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its conclusion, the case has already resulted in a
fundamental change in international law that allows the prosecution
of dictators and leaders of repressive regimes by courts in
countries where the alleged abuses did not occur. This came about
when Britain's highest court, the Law Lords of the House of Lords,
turned aside the general's claim that he could not be tried for
acts during the time that he was a head of state under the
principle of sovereign immunity.

<P>
   TEHRAN _ A mostly male crowd of university students packed a
small auditorium the other afternoon, their eyes fixed on a woman
meticulously covered in a black chador.
</P>
<P>
   Jamileh Kadivar had come to seek their votes as a candidate in
parliamentary elections Friday. When the questions and answers
began, the students took her to task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ayatollah Khomeini opposed giving women the right to vote.
What is your opinion?'' a student asked Mrs. Kadivar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ayatollah Khomeini at first did not support the right to vote
because of the political climate at the time,'' she replied. ``He
didn't want the shah to be able to use this against him. But later,
he encouraged women to be politically active and to run for
Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   As Iran's most popular female politician, Mrs. Kadivar is
routinely forced to maneuver through the minefield of being a
feminist and an Islamic activist, of which she is both. But she is
familiar with such predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   When she was growing up in the southern city of Shiraz, home to
Iran's great poets, artists and thinkers, she was awarded a
national prize as one of the country's brightest students.
</P>
<P>
   But accepting the award meant appearing on national television
without a head scarf. It was when the shah was in power and veils
were discouraged. She refused instead to give up her veil and
forfeited her prize.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as an adult involved in Iranian politics, life has only
grown more complex for Mrs. Kadivar, who finds herself at the
center of one of Iran's leading political families.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last year, her brother, Mohsen Kadivar, was sent to
jail for 18 months for his writings on religion and the state that
challenged the legitimacy of Iran's Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, her husband, the minister of culture and Islamic
guidance, Ayatollah Mohajerani, narrowly escaped impeachment by
conservatives in Parliament angry with his liberal policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become used to all this chaos,'' Mrs. Kadivar said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuchehr Kadivar, Mrs. Kadivar's father and a retired
schoolteacher, said he taught his children to be good Muslims and
to develop intellectually, even when such values were frowned upon
in Iran under the shah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamileh gets her independence from her mother,'' said Kadivar,
an affable man who travels by bus every two weeks from Shiraz to
visit his son in Evin prison in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife decided at some point during our marriage that she
should get a university degree,'' he said. ``So she left to study
at Tehran University while I stayed in Shiraz and raised our
children. This was very taboo behavior in Iran and we were
ostracized by our community.''
</P>
<P>
   In the parliamentary election, personality politics dominates
the scene. The brother of President Mohammed Khatami is a leading
candidate and is also running as a member of Parliament from
Tehran. And the brother of one of Iran's prominent dissident
clerics, Abdullah Nouri, is also a strong contender.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri is serving a five-year sentence for violating Islamic
principles and questioning the legitimacy of Iran's system of
supreme clerical rule. He was the leader in the race for a Tehran
seat, but was imprisoned by a conservative clerical court.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president's brother, Mohammed Reza, Jamileh Kadivar
will surely benefit from her family name.
</P>
<P>
   During her university campaign stop, students were asked what
they knew about her. ``I will vote for her because I admire her
family, especially her brother, Mohsen Kadivar,'' a young man named
Reza said. ``He is a great hero in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Kadivar was a progressive theologian and popular teacher
in the seminaries. When he was sent to jail, students across Iran
protested to demand his release.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kadivar's association with her husband, however, is more
problematic to her election bid.
</P>
<P>
   Mohajerani, whose ministry is responsible for the increased
press freedom Iran has experienced in recent years, is under
constant attack by conservatives for allowing newspapers to
criticize the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of his reformist allies believe he has
failed to adequately defend journalists and newspaper editors who
have gone to jail for exercising press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three men made me who I am,'' Mrs. Kadivar said. ``My husband,
who was my teacher when I was in Shiraz, my father and my
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comment reflects the personality of a woman who represents
the ``new Iran,'' a country striving to be modern while keeping its
traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I want to send to voters is that the new
Parliament must be in harmony with President Khatami's policies,
because the current Parliament is not,'' Mrs. Kadivar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new Parliament should force institutions in the state to
be accountable to the constitution. A civil society needs strong
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   If reformers capture a majority in the expanded 290-seat
Parliament, they will push to sever the conservative clerical
establishment's hold on institutions such as the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives today have used the courts as a political weapon
to block Khatami's reforms, such as freedom of expression and
social liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of reliable independent opinion surveys, it is
impossible to gauge the direction of the elections Friday. Many
contests are expected to go to a second-round runoff in several
weeks. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thomson Corp. said Tuesday it would sell its
remaining newspapers except for its flagship Toronto daily, The
Globe and Mail, completing its reorientation from a publisher to an
information provider for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to sell these newspapers in order to more
sharply focus on technology-driven information and solutions for
businesses and professionals which have global potential,'' said
Richard Harrington, the Thomson Corp. president.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would keep The Globe and Mail because its
``Internet sites, broadcast assets, multimedia capabilities and
renowned business-to-business content'' make it ``a strong fit with
our financial-information group.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding, Thomson has transformed itself several
times, starting as a remote Canadian radio station in the 1930s and
becoming a Fleet Street publisher, travel company and energy
business at various times before entering the financial-information
sector in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Previous spates of newspaper divestitures occurred in 1995 and
1996 as the company shifted its attention to products that depended
more on subscription fees than advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 of the 55 U.S. and Canadian daily newspapers put up for
sale on Tuesday have circulations in excess of 50,000, and the
entire Thomson Newspapers division had sales of about $810 million
in 1999, less than 14 percent of the company's overall $6 billion
of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although small relative to the rest of the company, the division
is profitable, Thomson said, with 1999 earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its newspaper chain in the United States was the fourth-largest
there, according to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the dailies, there are 75 less-frequently published
papers and 400 specialty products and services, including an
interest in a newsprint company and syndicated materials.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted favorably to the announcement, lifting the
company's stock to 46.25 Canadian dollars ($31.73) at midday on
Tuesday, up 4.80 dollars from the Monday close. The shares remain
below their peak last year of 51 dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not identify potential buyers but said it
expected to sell the papers by the end of this year and would use
the proceeds to reduce its long-term debt, which was approximately
2.5 billion Canadian dollars at the end of 1998. Goldman, Sachs
Group Inc. was retained as an adviser for the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture does not include publications of the Thomson
Financial division, including International Financing Review and
American Banker.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns such operations as First Call Corp., one
of the leading aggregators of analysts' earnings estimates, and the
legal information provider West Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   A potential purchaser is Hollinger Inc., a rival Canadian
publisher controlled by Conrad Black, whose newspaper empire also
embraces Britain, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hollinger has previously purchased properties divested by
Thomson, but a spokesman was noncommittal about its interest in the
remaining papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that we're in a major acquisition mode, but we've
always known that newspaper properties generally only rarely come
up for sale, so it behooves you to look at them,'' Peter Atkinson,
Hollinger vice president and general counsel, told Agence
France-Presse. &QL;

 &HT;    HOW TO CLAIM HOLOCAUST-ERA INSURANCE BENEFITS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Holocaust survivors and heirs who believe they are
eligible for outstanding insurance claims from that era may now
begin applying for settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims
announced Tuesday that for the next two years it will process
applications for insurance policies issued between 1920 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
working with several national and international Jewish
organizations, established the commission as a central source for
information, investigation and payment of outstanding Holocaust-era
insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide to claiming the benefits:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who should file?
</P>
<P>
   A. Any individual or heir to an individual who was a policy
holder or beneficiary of a policy issued between 1920 and 1945
should file a claim. There is no charge for filing a claim, and it
is not necessary to obtain a lawyer. The deadline to file a claim
is Feb. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you file?
</P>
<P>
   A. Those who believe they are eligible can request a claims
packet by:
</P>
<P>
   1. Writing to the International Commission, P.O. Box 1163, Wall
Street Station, New York, N.Y. 10268
</P>
<P>
   2. Visit the International Commission Internet site at
www.icheic.org
</P>
<P>
   3. Call toll-free 1-800-957-3203
</P>
<P>
   4. Contact your state insurance commissioner (a list can be
found at www.naic.org)
</P>
<P>
   5. Contact local Jewish organizations (more than 10,000
organizations worldwide have information regarding the claims
process.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. What documents are needed to prove the claim?
</P>
<P>
   A. While it is not necessary to have documentary evidence to
prove that there once was an insurance policy, it is helpful. The
claimant should have some indication that the policy did exist,
such as:
</P>
<P>
   _ Calendars or other items displaying the name or logo of an
insurance company
</P>
<P>
   _ Diary entries reflecting policy payments
</P>
<P>
   _ Premium receipts
</P>
<P>
   _ Private correspondence mentioning insurance coverage
</P>
<P>
   _ Correspondence with an insurance company or agent
</P>
<P>
   _ Recollections regarding visits to an insurance agent, visits
to the company's office, or medical examinations in connection with
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, birth certificates, family histories, death
certificates, or photographs may also be helpful in evaluating and
processing claims.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which insurance companies are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A. Five international insurance companies and their subsidiaries
are working with the International Commission:
</P>
<P>
   _ Allianz AG (German)
</P>
<P>
   _ Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. (Italian)
</P>
<P>
   _ AXA (French)
</P>
<P>
   _ Zurich Financial Services (Swiss)
</P>
<P>
   _ Winterthur Leben (Swiss)
</P>
<P>
   Q. What if the claim is not with one of these companies?
</P>
<P>
   A. The International Commission will send claims relating to

   NEW YORK _ Thomson Corp. said Tuesday it would sell its
remaining newspapers except for its flagship Toronto daily, The
Globe and Mail, completing its reorientation from a publisher to an
information provider for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to sell these newspapers in order to more
sharply focus on technology-driven information and solutions for
businesses and professionals which have global potential,'' said
Richard Harrington, the Thomson Corp. president.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would keep The Globe and Mail because its
``Internet sites, broadcast assets, multimedia capabilities and
renowned business-to-business content'' make it ``a strong fit with
our financial-information group.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding, Thomson has transformed itself several
times, starting as a remote Canadian radio station in the 1930s and
becoming a Fleet Street publisher, travel company and energy
business at various times before entering the financial-information
sector in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Previous spates of newspaper divestitures occurred in 1995 and
1996 as the company shifted its attention to products that depended
more on subscription fees than advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 of the 55 U.S. and Canadian daily newspapers put up for
sale on Tuesday have circulations in excess of 50,000, and the
entire Thomson Newspapers division had sales of about $810 million
in 1999, less than 14 percent of the company's overall $6 billion
of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although small relative to the rest of the company, the division
is profitable, Thomson said, with 1999 earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its newspaper chain in the United States was the fourth-largest
there, according to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the dailies, there are 75 less-frequently published
papers and 400 specialty products and services, including an
interest in a newsprint company and syndicated materials.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted favorably to the announcement, lifting the
company's stock to 46.25 Canadian dollars ($31.73) at midday on
Tuesday, up 4.80 dollars from the Monday close. The shares remain
below their peak last year of 51 dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not identify potential buyers but said it
expected to sell the papers by the end of this year and would use
the proceeds to reduce its long-term debt, which was approximately
2.5 billion Canadian dollars at the end of 1998. Goldman, Sachs
Group Inc. was retained as an adviser for the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture does not include publications of the Thomson
Financial division, including International Financing Review and
American Banker.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns such operations as First Call Corp., one
of the leading aggregators of analysts' earnings estimates, and the
legal information provider West Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   A potential purchaser is Hollinger Inc., a rival Canadian
publisher controlled by Conrad Black, whose newspaper empire also
embraces Britain, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hollinger has previously purchased properties divested by
Thomson, but a spokesman was noncommittal about its interest in the
remaining papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that we're in a major acquisition mode, but we've
always known that newspaper properties generally only rarely come
up for sale, so it behooves you to look at them,'' Peter Atkinson,
Hollinger vice president and general counsel, told Agence
France-Presse. &QL;

&HT;     GRAND JURY SEEKS RECORDS ON SAN FRANCISCO CONTRACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHUCK FINNIE and LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal grand jury has subpoenaed records of
Mayor Willie Brown's meetings with a long list of contractors and
officials who are the focus of an FBI probe of suspected city
contracting abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena marks the first time that federal investigators
have mentioned the mayor by name in their probe of alleged criminal
wrongdoing in a program that steers city contracts worth millions
of dollars to minority-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the subpoena, which was served on the mayor's office Jan. 31,
the grand jury demanded records of all meetings, phone calls and
video teleconferences since 1995 between Brown and:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ron Tutor, whose Tutor-Saliba Inc. is lead contractor on the
massive $2.4 billion airport reconstruction project now under way.
In the early 1980s, Tutor was implicated but not charged in a
scheme to subvert the city's minority contracting program through
the use of phony front companies, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlie Walker, a trucking contractor and longtime friend of
the mayor. In 1984, Walker was imprisoned for bilking the city's
minority contracting program, but he has obtained more than
$800,000 in new city contracts since Brown was first elected mayor
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stephen Besser and his wife, Jacqueline Besser, Brown friends
from Los Angeles who have emerged as a powerful new force in public
contracting in San Francisco, winning a share of $102 million in
municipal deals. The grand jury is scrutinizing how a consulting
firm run by Jacqueline Besser obtained a $3.68 million contract to
run a city parking garage, the subpoena indicates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott-Norman Mechanical, a tiny Hunters Point company that won
$56 million in airport construction contracts by claiming to be a
minority-owned business. According to records filed in a 1998
lawsuit, the company is actually controlled and financed by a
white-owned company in San Leandro.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena also sought records of meetings involving mayoral
aide Jonnie Robinson. She advises Brown on minority contracting
issues, as well as other officials including Marivic Bamba, who
heads the city's Human Rights Commission, which administers the
minority contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the grand jury asked for records of Brown's meetings
with 22 different business executives and city employees and 16
different companies that have sought contracts with the city.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury ordered the mayor's office to deliver the records
to the federal courthouse on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Brown declined comment, press secretary Kandace Bender said. In
the past, the mayor has urged full cooperation with the federal
probe.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Tutor said his company has complied
with all the city's contracting rules and had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the FBI probe, saying, ``It seems to have a life
of its own. It would be humorous if it wasn't so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has declined to be interviewed. The Bessers, Bamba and
Robinson didn't return a reporter's phone call.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, minority- and women-owned businesses
certified by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission as local and
economically disadvantaged qualify for bid preferences.
Construction companies on large public projects also must meet
affirmative action goals by using certified companies as
subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, FBI agents have been conducting a
wide-ranging city contracting investigation. No one has been
charged with wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI agents have turned up unannounced at the Human Rights
Commission, the airport and a long list of other departments,
seeking city documents regarding companies that have been awarded
hefty city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the FBI even shut down the commission offices for the
weekend, reportedly in response to fears that staffers were
shredding documents being sought by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also has subpoenaed more than a dozen people,
including airport director John Martin, to testify.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents and interviews, one focus of the probe is
Walker, a campaign contributor and former law client of Brown. In
1984, he was convicted of abusing city minority contracting
programs through the use of an illegal front company, but after
Brown was elected mayor, the commission gave Walker permission to
participate in the program again.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also has sought records on Tutor, whose Sylmar-based
company is among the biggest contractors in the nation. Tutor has
made political donations to Brown and last year, amid reports that
the proposed 49ers football stadium project was facing cost
overruns, the mayor declared that Tutor had offered to do the job,
which was once estimated at $525 million, for $75 million under
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Tutor also has a long association with Walker. A state appeals
court said in 1985 that Tutor himself had participated in the
affair that sent Walker to prison _ a scheme to subvert the city's
minority contracting program by steering contracts to a front
company. However, Tutor was not charged with wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also sought records regarding Scott-Norman Mechanical,
whose president, Al Norman, has been imprisoned on convictions for
murder and assault, according to public records.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city attorney contended in a lawsuit that
Scott-Norman had illegally obtained $56 million in airport
subcontracts by claiming to be minority-owned.

 &HT;    Former POW chairs McCain's Ohio team
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ David Ford, the volunteer chairman of Sen. John
McCain's presidential campaign in Ohio, may lack the political
credentials of Gov. Bob Taft and the other bigshots lined up behind
Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the March 7 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, from the Newark-area in Licking County, has a bond with
McCain, however _ unlike any Bush has with his Ohio supporters,
including Taft, chairman of Bush's Ohio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1973, both McCain and Ford were prisoners of war in
North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has got 30 days longevity on me,'' Ford said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``And I told him he can keep every one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford retired from the Air Force in 1984 as a lieutenant colonel.
He never had been involved in politics _ that is, until McCain's
campaign called last November and asked him aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first comment was `I know nothing about politics.' They
said, `You know how to organize.' I can do that, absolutely,'' said
Ford, who was navigating and taking pictures on an unarmed
reconnaissance aircraft when shot down in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know what he was getting himself into. If the campaign
was for anybody but McCain, he would be second-guessing himself,
said Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is the only exception,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 64, first heard of U.S. Navy pilot McCain from other
prisoners who tapped messages to one another on the walls of their
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, other prisoners rejected offers by the North
Vietnamese to be released early; but they weren't tortured like
McCain, whose father was commander of U.S. Forces in the Pacific at
the time, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the North Vietnamese) were trying to force John out
because of the embarrassment it would cause his father... I'll tell
you one thing. I'm glad I didn't have to face what he did,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and McCain met when the peace agreements were signed and they
were released from their cells. McCain was characteristically
irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we just slammed each other because we were both
Irish,'' said Ford. ``He calls me the shanty Irishman. I call him
the lace curtain Irishman. I told him how much I thought of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford agrees with McCain's politics. Perhaps, more importantly,
he said he believes in his character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never known John to tell a lie in his life,'' said
Ford, who has stayed in touch with the Arizona senator over the
years, through military reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, Ford has been working full time, without pay, to
build a network of McCain supporters throughout the state. He
estimates McCain's team now has about 1,000 volunteers, organized
in Ohio's 19 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's national co-chairman, U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine,
R-Cedarville, has provided invaluable help, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign will be the start and end of his own
political career, said Ford. He has gotten to know some political
heavyweights who ask him about his own aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To continue playing golf in the summertime,'' he tells them.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When she first saw the man she would marry, Deborah
Lemieux was a little intimidated. Here, late at night in a trendy
Manhattan restaurant, stood this rugged young guy in a sharp suit,
his craggy facial features decorated with a black eye. ``She
thought I was a mobster,'' Claude Lemieux recalled, smiling across
the kitchen table at his wife of five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big old bear,'' Deborah Lemieux said. ``People think
he's so tough. But he's so easygoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others might offer different opinions of Lemieux, a Devil again
for the second time in his 15-year career, traded back from
Colorado earlier this season. He makes a strong impression. Among
his friends are Wayne Gretzky, the hockey legend who retired last
season, and Scott Gomez, the star rookie whom Lemieux mentors.
Lemieux has a few detractors, too. Last week, John Muckler, the
Rangers' coach, taunted Lemieux after the Devil was ejected from a
game following a fracas with Brian Leetch.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran coach, Scotty Bowman of Detroit, once jumped
from a bus to berate Lemieux; the player was walking with his wife
and carrying his infant son in a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux often brings out the worst in others. In Sunday's
victory over San Jose, the Sharks' Jeff Norton hit Lemieux over the
back of the head with a stick. Norton was ejected, and Monday was
suspended for four more games.
</P>
<P>
   Other players have cursed Lemieux, bruised him with their elbows
and beaten him bloody with their fists, not necessarily without
provocation. He has been accused of biting an opponent's hand and
drinking from an opposing goalie's water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Deborah Lemieux said her husband ``sometimes gets his
feelings hurt,'' Claude said emotions should stay at the rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say `Don't you hate this guy or that guy?''' Lemieux
said. ``You don't hate. You just dislike. How can you hate someone
you don't even know? If you have any Christian belief, it's not OK
to hate anyone. But there are a lot of players out there who
dislike how I play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are counting on Lemieux as they try to regain the
Stanley Cup, five years after he helped the franchise win its only
championship. Going into Tuesday night's home game against
Philadelphia, they have the National Hockey League's best record
(35-15-6-4). Lemieux has 18 goals and he usually improves in the
postseason. Headed toward unrestricted free agency and his 35th
birthday this summer, Lemieux should be motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Along with distracting opponents in the Devils' cup run of 1995,
Lemieux scored 13 goals in 17 games to win the Conn Smythe trophy
as the tournament's most valuable player. He also played for cup
winners in Montreal in 1986 and Colorado in 1996. Although hockey's
etiquette of militant humility discourages even a vain player to
admit it, Lemieux is a straw to stir the drink.
</P>
<P>
   A right wing known for frequent and accurate shooting, Lemieux's
game also includes tenacious checking. More than most players, he
plays his best hockey under pressure and in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview at his rented home in northern New
Jersey, Lemieux discussed his reputation, his boyhood in Quebec,
his empathy for victims of misfortune outside hockey, his religious
beliefs, his singing voice (he sang a love song to his wife at
their wedding), his management ambitions and his thoughts on a
rugged sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to hit somebody as hard as you can,'' Lemieux said.
``If he's shaken up, or, if he's going to miss a shift or two, or
he's worrying he's going to get hammered again, then you've done
your job. You'll whack somebody sometimes, maybe just give a guy a
slash, maybe fifteen seconds of little shooting pain. That takes
him off his game.''
</P>
<P>
   He never intends to break bones, Lemieux said, but it happens
and one of these plays gave many people their strongest impression
of Lemieux. Against Detroit in the 1996 Western Conference finals,
Lemieux checked the Red Wings' Kris Draper, who fell face first
into the boards. The impact shattered Draper's face and left him
bleeding and prone on the ice, a ghastly scene.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, when Lemieux's Avalanche visited Detroit for
the first time, Lemieux's blood was running down the boards after
the Red Wings' Darren McCarty pummeled him in an attack of
vengeance. The game featured 11 fights before a howling mob of
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit fans, and many in Colorado, feel that the Red Wings
overtime victory that night during the regular season led to their
overthrow of the Avalanche as champions later, in the playoffs.
Some said Lemieux lost face that night, figuratively, for not
putting up a stronger fight against McCarty. Instead, Lemieux just
covered up, a reaction that may have provoked Muckler to say last
week that Lemieux ``fights like a girl'' and ``couldn't punch his
way out of a paper bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux remembers the night well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really bad,'' he said. ``We were getting faxes from
Detroit threatening my life. I had to go in under a fake name. I
had a security guy sleeping outside my room in the hotel, following
me wherever I went. It got out of control. I wasn't prepared for
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   He fought McCarty again the next season and gave as well as he
got. But Lemieux's detractors say this was too late. And Lemieux
comes well short of apologizing for what he did to Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the first guy to break his face,'' Lemieux said of
Draper. ``He won't be the last. I broke my face before. It's a very
physical game. A lot of people get hurt. It's just a mean game.
Just a little bit of a crazy game we play.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   By this time, the conversation had moved from the kitchen to the
living room of the big, old, handsome house. Among Lemieux's
neighbors are Dr. John McMullen, the owner of the Devils, and Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. Lemieux's wife sat next to him and their
children climbed from the floor to the couch to their parents'
laps. Brendan, almost 4 years old, and Claudia, 2{ , negotiated the
division of a small bag of crunchy cereal with Claude as referee;
the children put handfuls of food in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of his childhood in Mont-Laurier, a small town three
hours outside of Montreal. Lemieux was one of four children, the
oldest son. One younger brother, Jocelyn, also played in the NHL.
Another, Serge, was born with cerebral palsy and has been severely
handicapped and institutionalized most his life.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Gabriel, drove a truck, taking wood to paper
mills. Sometimes, he would be gone for days, but he took his oldest
son on some overnight trips. ``I loved every bit of it,'' Lemieux
said. ``I would sleep on the floor of the truck or with a big
pillow by the door. I would help him change flat tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get in big winter storms and all the truckers would get
together by the side of the road and park for hours and talk and
stuff. Knock on wood, my dad never had any bad accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   But others did, and Lemieux said his father always stopped to
help motorists in distress. Lemieux said he does the same thing.
His empathy extends beyond the highway. When high school students
were killed and wounded in a shooting spree last year in Colorado,
Lemieux and his teammates visited Denver area hospitals the next
day and beyond. Similarly, when a girl's mother died in a traffic
accident, Lemieux befriended her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way you are brought up, the values you are given as a
child, this is what you are going to carry when you get older,''
Lemieux said. ``That's what I want to give my kids. You give a
helping hand and you shall receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad worked six days a week and even if he came in late on
Saturday, he would be the first one up to cook the whole family a
big breakfast on Sunday morning. That was a religious day in our
home. After breakfast, we would go to church. We were Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father didn't take me golfing, he didn't take me skating.
He didn't know how to skate. But he taught me everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's main residence is now in Southern California, a few
doors from the Gretzkys. Some hockey people find Gretzky and
Lemieux unlikely friends. Gretzky, from Ontario, frequently won the
Lady Byng trophy for sportsmanship. Lemieux, a Quebecer who learned
English as an adult, may never contend for the Lady Byng. But they
got to know each other as Canada Cup teammates in 1987. After
Lemieux's first marriage ended in a difficult divorce, he and his
second wife became close to Gretzky and his wife, Janet Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Their children play together and the adults work out at the gym.
The men share the same agent, Michael Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look up to him for a lot of things,'' Lemieux said of
Gretzky. ``He's just a dedicated husband and a great role model.''
</P>
<P>
   A picture of Gretzky and Lemieux hangs on the wall in the house,
not far from pucks mounted on plaques to commemorate milestones in
Lemieux's career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another bond, a different kind, is with Gomez, a 20-year-old
from Alaska. They play on the same forward line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes it all in,'' Lemieux said of Gomez. ``His parents are
quite far from here. They are worried about their kid being out
twenty minutes from New York City. I had great talks with his dad
and I said `Just don't worry. I'll look after him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Lemieux just listens to his young linemate.
``Sometimes it's just good to empty your bag,'' Lemieux said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux and Gomez personify the Devils' generation gap. This
causes a rift, Lemieux said, only for locker-room music. ``I like
the music back with the Bee Gees and Billy Joel and Elton John,''
he said. ``And the young guys can't really relate to it. But I say,
`When you've played 15 years, you can pick the music.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux has a musical background. His sister, Carole, sang
professionally in Quebec and sometimes Claude would accompany her.
He also sang in church, particularly around Christmas. When Claude
and Deborah Lemieux were married in the Bahamas, he sang ``Have I
Told You Lately That I Love You?'' ``I was pretty proud of
myself,'' he said. ``But I was nervous. I was a wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day, he said, he would like to sing the American and
Canadian anthems at a sports event. But his next career will not be
in music and probably not in coaching. What about general manager?
``I think I could be a good GM,'' Lemieux said. ``You've got to be
able to judge talent, then attach the numbers to that talent, make
decisions and make trades. It would be a good challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sight to imagine: Lemieux in a suit, physical wounds
healed, sitting behind a desk, making deals, encouraging some
people, consoling others, chewing guys out. General managers
sometimes hurt feelings and they take lots of criticism. They make
and break careers. The good ones have a thorough knowledge of the
sport, an understanding of human nature, a taste for the fray and a
thick skin.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was beautiful. Calvin Klein had wrangled two of
the biggest stars, Gwyneth Paltrow and Julia Roberts, for his front
row on Friday night. Other designers had celebrities, even bona
fide examples of royalty, but they did not compare to what Klein
had. And what were these two star catches doing throughout most of
the show? They were chuckling and talking and beaming their
250-watt ceramic smiles ... at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Not at Klein's new clothes at all. Oh, every so often Paltrow,
back to being a blonde and dressed in jeans and a turtleneck, or
Roberts, in some kind of blousy Pucci-looking top with bare legs,
strappy high heels and painted toenails, would look up and try to
focus on the action, as if to say, ``Now we must concentrate.'' But
then one would lean in, whisper, and the sorority sister chatter
would resume.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments when one suspected that maybe Klein himself
was bored with the action. Out drifted models in A-line wool skirts
with blouson mock-turtleneck tops in stretch chiffon, slim jackets
and peacoats in leather or mulberry and spruce wool tweed over
matching cropped trousers with boots. Where last season Klein made
a statement with python in shades of taupe and pastel blue, this
season it was alligator in deep wine or black.
</P>
<P>
   Everything looked refined, wearable, even (to use a threadbare
term) modern, but it was all without enthusiasm, and certainly
without that spark that makes one designer's alligator skirt or
cashmere mock turtleneck stand out from the next's.
</P>
<P>
   That was the dispiriting thing about the New York fall 2000
collections, which ended Friday _ to see so many designers crowding
and snapping like piranhas around the same few morsels of ideas.
The New Luxury. Eighties Chic. In her program notes on Friday,
Donna Karan described ``a world of luxury.'' Matt Nye called his
collection ``Gulfstream Society,'' after the jet, and used such
potentially queasy terms as ``Beluga'' and ``G-IV'' to describe
ordinary pants and sweaters. Zang Toi said his show was ``all about
luxury and glamour,'' then sent out models looking like Ivana
Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not even mention original _ does anyone have a fresh idea?
A cynic looking at Klein's placid collection of suits and
self-consciously relevant cropped pants would be tempted to say,
``Well, why bother to do anything different, when everybody knows
the money's in jeans and underwear?'' But who's the real cynic?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy in the fashion business to lose one's perspective.
People could be rioting in the streets, running naked through the
Conde Nast building, but if there's a fashion show scheduled ...
</P>
<P>
   Despite an impromptu strike by photographers over a shortage of
space, and a carload of guests who were trapped for an hour in an
elevator at 550 Seventh Avenue, Karan's show went on. The
collection was cool if somewhat predictable. It opened with a
rib-textured coat in black double-faced wool that fanned in a
circle from the waist and was closed with a thin patent-leather red
belt. The effect was eye-catching, and that was what Karan
intended: to stun you with graphic simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulders of Karan's tops and fitted coats were small and
trim, with draping around necklines and a splash of volume through
the hips. A brown alligator shell, hinting of tough motorcycle
leather, flirted with a black wool A-line skirt, while sturdy
tweeds, in halter and strapless dresses, sparkled with tiny beads.
</P>
<P>
   Karan mentioned in her notes that the collection was inspired by
a trip she had made last year to India and Nepal, and went on to
say somewhat fervently about the colors and sense of serenity she
had observed that ``while the global splendor of the millennium eve
forever blurred the lines between East and West, these were the
inspirations that spoke to my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   It would require a stretch of the imagination to see to what
exactly, apart from lovely hues of red and violet, Karan brought
back with her. The structured jackets, the close-fitting halter
tops, did evoke a picture of calm, but it was the same sense of
urban sophistication she has always known. Which isn't such a bad
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Kerrigan didn't trek to Nepal. She probably didn't even
have time to get to New Jersey, now that she's a creative
consultant to Tommy Hilfiger's women's lines. But all right.
Kerrigan's collection for her Daryl K label, which closed the New
York shows, was as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan sent out just 30 looks, yet each attempted to say
something fresh in the chaotic, downtown language that only a few
big-league designers have mastered. Cropped pants with boots for
Kerrigan? That was last season's look, judging by the fact that
Kerrigan's assistants, and not her models, were wearing them at her
show.
</P>
<P>
   This time she showed a sexy, dressed-up urban cowgirl look _
well, cowgirl isn't exactly the right word for Kerrigan's black
suede skirts cut in panels that seemed to twist around the body,
her lanky shearling coats, her ruffled Victorian cotton shirts or
her low snakeskin boots on saucy Sabrina heels. But the collection
did convey something of a renegade attitude with a knowing sense of
modern sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   And it's interesting that Kerrigan made no statements about
glamour, even ironic ones, and yet by simply showing a black silk
and velvet bomber jacket snuggled over a flaring suede skirt, with
those great pseudo-cowgirl boots, she let you know she knew what
was up, and what was cool.
</P>
<P>
   As the week wound down, the casualties seemed to pile up. Vera
Wang showed the kind of minimalist clothes _ black nylon skirts,
zip-front gabardine jumpsuits _ that camp followers of Jil Sander
love, but that don't create a special niche in the market. On
Friday, Ralph Rucci put on a good show that emphasized cut and seam
detail in cashmere and wool tunics and skirts, but it would have
helped if he had had a stylist to loosen up the monochromatic looks
and the spiky couture hair.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting front and center at the Matt Nye show was John
Fairchild, the former chairman of Women's Wear Daily, and his wife,
Jill. Their son, Stephen, a fashion pro, recently became Nye's
partner and co-designer. ``I feel like I'm sitting next to Saint
Laurent's mother,'' said Patrick McCarthy, the current chairman of
Women's Wear.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooking the show's flaky airplane theme and the occasional
nods to Saint Laurent tailoring and style (those tilted fedoras
seemed to come winging from the Saint Laurent men's wear show in
Paris last month), the collection of classic sportswear separates
in black, camel, gray and white was an improvement over Nye's
previous ones. A plush women's peacoat in a scallop pattern looked
smart, but Nye and Fairchild will have to do more than add flourish
to Matt Nye women's wear. They will have to define what it is
first.
</P>
<P>
   What stands out from the New York shows? Ladylike dressing, full
skirts, the return of tights (now with stiletto sandals), rich
colors, modified ethnic chic, society-page suits, and that old
saying, ``Never throw anything away.''

`AMERICAN BEAUTY' CAPTURES EIGHT NOMINATIONS IN WIDE-OPEN OSCAR
RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ ``American Beauty,'' a vinegary comedy about
suburbanites whose lives are so askew that they seem to have turned
dysfunction into an art form, came away with the most Academy
Awards nominations Tuesday, but it was a close call. Share the
wealth seemed to be the theme of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' drew eight nominations, including best
picture, best actor (Kevin Spacey), best actress (Annette Bening)
and best director (the British stage veteran Sam Mendes in his
movie debut). But right behind, with seven nominations each, were
``The Insider'' (including best picture, Russell Crowe for best
actor and Michael Mann for best director) and, in something of a
surprise, ``The Cider House Rules'' (including best picture, Lasse
Hallstrom for best director and Michael Caine for best supporting
actor). And right behind them was the surprise hit ``The Sixth
Sense,'' with six nominations (including best picture, and both
writing and directing by M. Night Shyamalan).
</P>
<P>
   No single film dominated the nominations, and there were no
clear favorites in any of the leading categories, meaning that this
year's Oscars will be the most unpredictable of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it tells us that we have more good movies this year,
and that no one is viewing one movie as sort of arbitrarily so much
better than the others,'' said Scott Greenstein, chairman of USA
Films, which had two multiple nominees Tuesday, Mike Leigh's
``Topsy-Turvy'' with four and Spike Jonze's ``Being John
Malkovich'' with three.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who got three nominations, for writing, directing and
producing ``The Insider,'' said he was heartened by the variety of
films recognized. ``I think it's a year in which studios based in
Los Angeles have financed and released some very, very interesting
pictures,'' he said. ``The quality of pictures this year is really
stunning. I think it says a lot about the industry. It says
something good about the culture in general.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a handful of surprises. Sean Penn won an unexpected
best actor nomination for playing a brilliant but unlikable jazz
guitarist in Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown.'' Denzel Washington
was nominated as best actor in ``The Hurricane,'' the only
nomination for that film, which many expected to do quite well in
the awards. Anthony Minghella's ``Talented Mr. Ripley'' received
five nominations but, despite predictions, none for best picture or
best director. ``Toy Story 2'' drew just one, for a Randy Newman
song. And Milos Forman's ``Man on the Moon,'' with Jim Carrey
playing the comedian Andy Kaufman, drew no nominations whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth film to get a nomination for best picture was ``The
Green Mile,'' the director Frank Darabont's adaptation a Stephen
King supernatural thriller set on death row; it drew a mixed
response from critics but has proven a sizable hit with audiences.
Michael Clarke Duncan was nominated for best supporting actor in
the film, playing an angelic inmate with odd healing powers.
</P>
<P>
   The top acting nominations went pretty much according to
predictions. Richard Farnsworth, 79, the former stuntman who
starred in David Lynch's ``Straight Story,'' won the fifth
nomination for best actor, while the four actresses who joined
Bening in that category were Hilary Swank (``Boys Don't Cry''),
Janet McTeer (``Tumbleweeds''), Julianne Moore (``The End of the
Affair'') and Meryl Streep (``Music of the Heart''). Streep now
ties Katharine Hepburn's record for most nominations, with 12 to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting actress nominations went to Toni Collette in ``The
Sixth Sense,'' Angelina Jolie in ``Girl, Interrupted,'' Catherine
Keener in ``Being John Malkovich,'' Samantha Morton in ``Sweet and
Lowdown'' and Chloe Sevigny in ``Boys Don't Cry.'' In addition to
Caine and Duncan, supporting actor nominations went to Tom Cruise
in ``Magnolia,'' Jude Law in ``The Talented Ripley'' and Haley Joel
Osment in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominated directors were Mendes, Jonze, Hallstrom, Mann and
Shyamalan.
</P>
<P>
   The word spread early Tuesday morning from the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Science's headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard in
Beverly Hills, where the academy's president, Robert Rehme, and
Dustin Hoffman, a two-time Oscar winner, read the nominees to a
live television and Internet audience. Publicists ran from the
auditorium to make eagerly awaited cell-phone calls all over the
world, though most of the nominees acknowledged they were listening
live to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Swank was in her dressing room on the set of her new film, ``The
Gift,'' outside Savannah, Ga., when her husband called and held the
phone up to their television set at home. They listened together.
``I have tried not to expect anything in life,'' she said. ``That
way you're always pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie was on the set of a film in Mexico having her makeup
applied when more than a half-dozen people from the crew came in.
``They walked in very casually, but I knew what it meant,'' she
said. ``It was really exciting.'' Jolie, the daughter of an Oscar
winner, Jon Voight, said she was very much looking forward to the
Academy Awards ceremony, to be held on March 26 at the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles. ``I think it's going to be fun,'' she
said. ``I think I went once with my dad when I was little, but I
don't remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth was on his ranch along Bonita Creek just outside
Lincoln, N.M., watching it all on television. ``I'm really quite
excited about it,'' he said. ``I had a Golden Globe nomination,
though I didn't win it. But I got to thinking I might have a chance
at this one.''
</P>
<P>
   John Irving, the novelist, was nominated for best adapted
screenplay for ``Cider House,'' based on his own book. ``It's been
a very emotional day,'' he said. ``I couldn't even talk to Lasse
earlier this morning because we were both so moved by the response
the film had received.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom said he hoped that the film's seven nominations would
attract an even larger audience. ``Cider House'' promises to be one
of the films helped most by Tuesday's nominations, since it is just
beginning its wide theatrical release. Miramax intends to
capitalize on the nominations by putting it into many more theaters
in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beyond fine,'' Hallstrom said. ``Really, it was beyond
even my secret expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   As the most-nominated film, ``American Beauty'' is the de facto
favorite in the Oscar race, though in such a competitive field it
is far from a sure thing. ``When we did this movie, we had no idea
it would have this response,'' Bening said. ``When I saw it, I
loved it. I was moved by it. I thought, `Oh my goodness, it's very
good.' But I had no idea it would have this kind of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey said he ``had been down this road a couple of times
before,'' so he had been prepared for bad news. ``I was ready for
it not happening,'' he said. But he said he was not surprised that
the movie did as well as it did in the nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honest film,'' he said. ``It may deal with issues that
a lot of people are labeling dark. But I think there is some kind
of spirit to this film that is quite unique, and I suspect that a
lot of people recognize the emotional terrain that this film
reaches for.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey was conducting telephone and television interviews during
breaks from filming and said he was hoping to get a few minutes to
make some personal calls. ``I want to call Sam Mendes,'' he said.
``And I wish my mother would get off the phone, so I could talk to
her.''

MAN KILLS HIMSELF IN EXPLOSION IN TIANANMEN SQUARE, CHINESE
REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ An explosion in Tiananmen Square on Tuesday afternoon
was set off by a suicidal farmer who was a psychiatric patient,
according to the police and the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer died on the scene and a tourist from South Korea was
slightly injured by the blast at about 4 p.m., the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently trying to head off speculation about the explosion in
the politically symbolic square _ the site of recent demonstrations
by members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement _ the
authorities released information with unusual speed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement handed out to reporters within two hours of the
blast, police identified the dead man as Li Xiangshan, from Hubei
province in central China. The statement said Li deliberately set
off the explosion to kill himself and that he was previously known
to authorities because he had come to Beijing four times before to
make appeals to the country's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The man's motives were not specified, nor was his psychiatric
history, and there was no way to independently verify the police
description. An officer on the scene told reporters that the man
was not a follower of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The square itself was closed off as police searched the site for
debris. The blast did not cause a visible crater and the evening
lowering of the national flag on the north end of the square, a
popular attraction with Chinese tourists, continued as usual.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the vast square is the Great Hall of the People,
where the national parliament will convene in March. The square
also holds the Mao Tse-tung mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional precedents in China in which aggrieved or
mentally unstable people have exploded suicide bombs to draw
attention to their plights. But there have also been several
unexplained bomb explosions around the country in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, bombs exploded in a shopping center and a bus in
central Beijing, by some reports killing two people. The cases have
not been solved, although security agencies reportedly blame Uighur
separatists from the western region of Xinjiang.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been four years in the making, and cost
Microsoft something like $8 billion to produce. Now, Windows 2000,
the software giant's latest offering, is ready to make its debut.
</P>
<P>
   But will it sell? The question, for a company that is in a very
complex political, commercial and technological environment, is if
its new product will sell enough to justify the expense of its
development, and the expectations of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, can Windows 2000 underpin the company's
future as its management hopes? That question, more than the
antitrust case which the U.S. and state governments have brought,
may determine the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Though the launch of the new products has attracted less of the
hyperbole that was previously given to Windows 95, Microsoft will
spare no expense in trumpeting its latest baby at the Windows 2000
Expo in San Francisco and other worldwide launch events this
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 is a bet-the-ranch product for Microsoft,'' chief
financial officer John Connors told investors at a recent
conference. ``It is the fundamental core of our programming effort
for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has talked about increasing revenue growth from 18
to 25 percent, largely on the back of the new product.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's other products, like SQL Server and
Microsoft Exchange, depend on making Windows 2000 a success.
Indeed, in the future it isn't too much of an exaggeration to say
that the system is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware manufacturers are gearing up to cash in on its launch,
as is everybody else from retailers to the publishers of guides.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the money that will make investors look very hard
at the new product. It is two years over deadline, it is one of the
largest and most complex software projects ever, with more than 30
million lines of code, and it is in the market sector that the
company most needs to nail down, quickly and securely.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest in the family of Windows operating
systems. It is the heir to Windows NT, the company's professional
tool, and comprises four separate products: Windows 2000
Professional, for business desktops and laptops; Windows 2000
Server, a network operating system, and Windows 2000 Advanced
Server, targeted at e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year will come Windows 2000 Datacenter, aimed at
the high end of the business market.
</P>
<P>
   None of them is aimed primarily at home users now running
Windows 98 or 95; Windows Millennium, also due later this year, is
aimed at them. Indeed, upgrading from either to Windows 2000 is
problematic and some applications will not work.
</P>
<P>
   The higher up the market, the more competition Microsoft has. It
has been dogged by complaints about scalability _ the ability to
expand to handle larger tasks _ and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of instability that is irritating when doing a little
word processing and surfing the Web for fun is lethal for companies
which depend on the Internet for their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company has aimed to deliver greater reliability,
better performance and more support for newer technologies, and
from most of the product reviews seems to have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how quickly and to what degree its latest
offering is taken up.
</P>
<P>
   A study by World Research forecast that 40 percent of desktops
would use the software by January of next year. But another, by
Survey.com, estimated that MS would actually lose market share to
Unix in some key sectors _ especially servers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals, like Novell, Oracle and Sun, have used the
delays with Windows 2000 to fill the gap.
</P>

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been four years in the making, and cost
Microsoft something like $8 billion to produce. Now, Windows 2000,
the software giant's latest offering, is ready to make its debut.
</P>
<P>
   But will it sell? The question, for a company that is in a very
complex political, commercial and technological environment, is if
its new product will sell enough to justify the expense of its
development, and the expectations of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, can Windows 2000 underpin the company's
future as its management hopes? That question, more than the
antitrust case which the U.S. and state governments have brought,
may determine the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Though the launch of the new products has attracted less of the
hyperbole that was previously given to Windows 95, Microsoft will
spare no expense in trumpeting its latest baby at the Windows 2000
Expo in San Francisco and other worldwide launch events this
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 is a bet-the-ranch product for Microsoft,'' chief
financial officer John Connors told investors at a recent
conference. ``It is the fundamental core of our programming effort
for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has talked about increasing revenue growth from 18
to 25 percent, largely on the back of the new product.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's other products, like SQL Server and
Microsoft Exchange, depend on making Windows 2000 a success.
Indeed, in the future it isn't too much of an exaggeration to say
that the system is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware manufacturers are gearing up to cash in on its launch,
as is everybody else from retailers to the publishers of guides.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the money that will make investors look very hard
at the new product. It is two years over deadline, it is one of the
largest and most complex software projects ever, with more than 30
million lines of code, and it is in the market sector that the
company most needs to nail down, quickly and securely.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest in the family of Windows operating
systems. It is the heir to Windows NT, the company's professional
tool, and comprises four separate products: Windows 2000
Professional, for business desktops and laptops; Windows 2000
Server, a network operating system, and Windows 2000 Advanced
Server, targeted at e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year will come Windows 2000 Datacenter, aimed at
the high end of the business market.
</P>
<P>
   None of them is aimed primarily at home users now running
Windows 98 or 95; Windows Millennium, also due later this year, is
aimed at them. Indeed, upgrading from either to Windows 2000 is
problematic and some applications will not work.
</P>
<P>
   The higher up the market, the more competition Microsoft has. It
has been dogged by complaints about scalability _ the ability to
expand to handle larger tasks _ and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of instability that is irritating when doing a little
word processing and surfing the Web for fun is lethal for companies
which depend on the Internet for their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company has aimed to deliver greater reliability,
better performance and more support for newer technologies, and
from most of the product reviews seems to have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how quickly and to what degree its latest
offering is taken up.
</P>
<P>
   A study by World Research forecast that 40 percent of desktops
would use the software by January of next year. But another, by
Survey.com, estimated that MS would actually lose market share to
Unix in some key sectors _ especially servers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals, like Novell, Oracle and Sun, have used the
delays with Windows 2000 to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, while the programmers were slaving
away in Redmond, another system emerged: Linux, the open source
operating system with its roots in Unix which has been
commercialized by companies like Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's share of the server market more than doubled to 17
percent last year from 7 percent in 1997, while Windows NT remained
steady at 36 percent.

A BYOB LESSON FROM BURGUNDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are moments of self-indulgence in the wine trade,'' the
London wine merchant Simon Loftus once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   British understatement to a fault. He was talking about the
Paulee de Meursault, a bacchanal that Burgundy's winemakers treat
themselves to every fall. It is a peculiarly French institution,
but an enterprising New York sommelier and importer attempted to
recreate it in New York on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The name Paulee derives from ``poele,'' the saute pan used to
prepare the grape-pickers' dinner celebrating the end of the
harvest. It has come to signify any postharvest celebration in
Burgundy, and especially the joyous, pull-out-all-the-stops lunch
that the Burgundians throw for themselves every November.
</P>
<P>
   In Burgundy, the Paulee takes place at the end of the annual
Trois Glorieuses, a three-day festival in the little city of
Beaune. Burgundy lovers from all over the world pour in to eat,
drink and, if they are still upright, attend the wine auction to
benefit the Hospices de Beaune, a hospital founded in the 15th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The winemakers and others in the industry gather in the village
of Meursault, about five miles southwest of Beaune, for a long,
long lunch in the cavernous cellars of the Chateau de Meursault.
Each winemaker brings along a dozen or so of his best bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The tables groan under the weight of so much good Burgundy, but
over the long day, all of it is consumed. Guests move from table to
table, toting their bottles and tasting each other's wines. Before
the noon lunch ends around 6 p.m., everyone has sampled _ and
loudly commented on _ 30 or 40 wines. The Paulee, which has been
taking place since the 1920s, is the mother of all BYOB parties.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Paulee was also about a love of wine and a chance
to celebrate that enthusiasm in a laid-back way. But this is
America, so it was also about money.
</P>
<P>
   The main event was for civilians, and well-heeled civilians at
that. It consisted of a Burgundy tasting on Saturday afternoon and
a dinner featuring Burgundy wines on Saturday night, both at the W
New York Hotel in midtown. Cost for both events was $750 a person;
for the tasting alone, $300. Not exactly a down-home party, but it
sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnnes, an importer and wine director of the Myriad
Restaurant Group, which owns Montrachet, a Burgundy-oriented
restaurant in TriBeCa, persuaded some of Burgundy's best winemakers
to come to New York to show their wines and help him recreate this
special affair.
</P>
<P>
   And so there was a party for the winemakers _ they had dinner
together on Friday at Montrachet, where they drank American wine.
They also toured Chinatown on Sunday morning, on bikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday program began with a three-hour walk-around tasting
featuring the wines of the A Team French winemakers, including
Romanee-Conti, the domaines Arlot, Bonneau de Martray, Champy,
Chandon de Briailles, Comtes Lafon, Rene Engel, Henri Gouges,
Lambrays, Polet, Roulot and Roumier.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 18 winemakers was an interloper _ Alain Graillot,
from the Rhone Valley. Johnnes said, ``He's a good guy.'' In fact,
his 1998 Crozes-Hermitage valiantly held its own with the noble
Burgundies.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday tasting had no connection with the true Paulee
tradition. It was a purely American event _ a room full of people
gently elbowing one another out of the way to get at the wines.
Food provided by Montrachet, TriBeCa Grill, Nobu and Heartbeat
complicated the wine sampling: only the most skillful cocktail
partygoers could juggle plate and glass and still get through to
the most popular wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth it,'' said Rusty Staub, the former baseball star
who is a restaurateur and big-time Burgundy fan.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, wines from the same producers accompanied a dinner
prepared by Daniel Boulud of Restaurant Daniel, Remi Lauvand of
Montrachet and Michel Nischan of Heartbeat, the restaurant in the W
New York Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In true Paulee style, guests were encouraged to bring bottles of
their own to share. But sharing was mostly limited to the tables at
which the wines were opened. Even so, some remarkable wines were
available to anyone who wanted to try them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wines at my table were a 1993 Montrachet from Pierre
Matrot; a 1991 Meursault Charmes from Guy Roulot, in a magnum; two
bottles of Corton-Charlemagne, one a 1982 from Bonneau de Martray,
the other a 1952 from Michel Niellon; a 1985 Grands-Echezeaux from
the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti in a methusalem; a 1959 Musigny
from Joseph Drouhin; a 1978 Volnay Clos des Ducs from the Marquis
d'Angerville; and a 1962 Richebourg from Charles Noellat, which for
me was the hit of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the hit was a benefit auction for the Tourette
Syndrome Association that ended the dinner. A lunch for 10 at
Montrachet, with the critic Robert M. Parker and Johnnes as hosts,
went for $20,000; a magnum of Montrachet 1998 from the Domaines des
Comtes Lafon went for $8,000, and a dinner for 12 to be prepared in
the winner's home by Daniel Boulud went for $40,000. Actually, that
bid was a tie. When two bidders reached $40,000, Boulud said he
would do both meals, thus pulling in $80,000 for charity.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Paulee resembled the Meursault version in that it
was flawlessly done and sold out well in advance. But you cannot
buy your way into the Burgundy affair, whereas New York was
accessible to a limited number of people _ about 300 _ with lots of
money or a financial interest in the wine business.
</P>
<P>
   But given the unconscionable prices of top-quality Burgundies,
it may be a long time before the New York event, assuming it
becomes a regular affair, will be anything other than a very
exclusive party.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been four years in the making, and cost
Microsoft something like $8 billion to produce. Now, Windows 2000,
the software giant's latest offering, is ready to make its debut.
</P>
<P>
   But will it sell? The question, for a company that is in a very
complex political, commercial and technological environment, is if
its new product will sell enough to justify the expense of its
development, and the expectations of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, can Windows 2000 underpin the company's
future as its management hopes? That question, more than the
antitrust case which the U.S. and state governments have brought,
may determine the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Though the launch of the new products has attracted less of the
hyperbole that was previously given to Windows 95, Microsoft will
spare no expense in trumpeting its latest baby at the Windows 2000
Expo in San Francisco and other worldwide launch events this
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 2000 is a bet-the-ranch product for Microsoft,'' chief
financial officer John Connors told investors at a recent
conference. ``It is the fundamental core of our programming effort
for the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has talked about increasing revenue growth from 18
to 25 percent, largely on the back of the new product.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the company's other products, like SQL Server and
Microsoft Exchange, depend on making Windows 2000 a success.
Indeed, in the future it isn't too much of an exaggeration to say
that the system is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware manufacturers are gearing up to cash in on its launch,
as is everybody else from retailers to the publishers of guides.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the money that will make investors look very hard
at the new product. It is two years over deadline, it is one of the
largest and most complex software projects ever, with more than 30
million lines of code, and it is in the market sector that the
company most needs to nail down, quickly and securely.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest in the family of Windows operating
systems. It is the heir to Windows NT, the company's professional
tool, and comprises four separate products: Windows 2000
Professional, for business desktops and laptops; Windows 2000
Server, a network operating system, and Windows 2000 Advanced
Server, targeted at e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year will come Windows 2000 Datacenter, aimed at
the high end of the business market.
</P>
<P>
   None of them is aimed primarily at home users now running
Windows 98 or 95; Windows Millennium, also due later this year, is
aimed at them. Indeed, upgrading from either to Windows 2000 is
problematic and some applications will not work.
</P>
<P>
   The higher up the market, the more competition Microsoft has. It
has been dogged by complaints about scalability _ the ability to
expand to handle larger tasks _ and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of instability that is irritating when doing a little
word processing and surfing the Web for fun is lethal for companies
which depend on the Internet for their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the company has aimed to deliver greater reliability,
better performance and more support for newer technologies, and
from most of the product reviews seems to have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how quickly and to what degree its latest
offering is taken up.
</P>
<P>
   A study by World Research forecast that 40 percent of desktops
would use the software by January of next year. But another, by
Survey.com, estimated that MS would actually lose market share to
Unix in some key sectors _ especially servers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals, like Novell, Oracle and Sun, have used the
delays with Windows 2000 to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, while the programmers were slaving
away in Redmond, another system emerged: Linux, the open source
operating system with its roots in Unix which has been
commercialized by companies like Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's share of the server market more than doubled to 17
percent last year from 7 percent in 1997, while Windows NT remained
steady at 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the market has been basically content with the idea of
Windows 2000, but it had a scare at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm, said that one in
four corporations would run into problems with compatibility
between the new system and its existing software. Its advice was to
wait until the company has ironed out the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell Computer, said that
Linux was gaining ground. ``We don't see a massive immediate
acceleration due to Windows 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

   The company faces other key strategic issues this year. There
are still some big questions about Windows Millennium, the consumer

company has scaled back some very large and ambitious plans to
something more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Me, as it is known, is itself a stopgap before the more
advanced product, code-named Whistler, which is due next year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Windows CE (for Consumer Electronics), its
operating system for handheld devices and set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A new version, CE 3.0 is also due this year, but it has been
relatively disappointing so far, and again, MS is by no means alone
in this market. &QL;

<P>
   The company's restructuring, and Bill Gates' shift earlier this
year, are part of a redrawing of Microsoft to adapt to what
analysts call the post-PC age: towards the higher end of the
market, the servers which make the Internet run, and the smaller
devices which power the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In both, Windows gives it a steady but by no means dominant
position, ironically, in view of the antitrust suit that is still
winding through the courts. The difference is that the antitrust
suit, fundamentally, focuses on the past, and on the company's
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The new questions are about its very soul, the technology that
has driven its dominance. &QL;

   They screamed, they cried, they partied, they went back to work
-- and some of them just snoozed.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees for the 72nd annual Academy Awards talked Tuesday
of hearing the news at home, on movie sets, in hotels, at small
pre-dawn gatherings, at a cafe. As would be expected of a field
brimming with first- and second-time nominees, they were bursting
over the good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in my underwear with my wife watching
television,'' said 38-year-old producer Richard Gladstein, whose
``Cider House Rules'' is up for best picture and six other awards.
``I started crying when they mentioned (director Lasse Hallstrom's)
name and she kept telling me to be quiet because she couldn't hear.
I barely heard when they mentioned me, but she started screaming so
loud I figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ball, whose original screenplay garnered one of eight
nominations for ``American Beauty,'' said he was at a small Nichols
Canyon get-together with others involved in the film to watch the
announcement on TV live at about 5:40 a.m. They sipped coffee
instead of quaffing champagne, but it was a celebration
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that I sort of leave my body at those moments,''
said Ball, 42. ``The Golden Globe was a total out-of-body
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Once word got out, screen veteran Richard Farnsworth (``The
Straight Story'') said the phone at his southeastern New Mexico
ranch had been ringing a lot. With yet another call from a
reporter, his wife begged for a moment's patience while the
79-year-old actor took a bathroom break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw heck,'' Farnsworth said. ``It's been a little hectic, but
that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth, a stuntman for 40 years before his Oscar-nominated
role in 1978's ``Comes a Horseman,'' said the David Lynch movie is
the best he ever got to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to do a couple of great ones, but I think it's pretty
darn good,'' he said. ``I hope it mainly starts a trend using older
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngest nominee Haley Joel Osment (``The Sixth Sense'') and
past best supporting winner Kevin Spacey (``American Beauty'') were
getting set for another day's work on ``Pay It Forward,'' being
shot by Mimi Leder in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Chloe Sevigny (``Boys Don't Cry'') was in Germany for the Berlin
International Film Festival when the announcements came. ``When I
found out, I was sleeping off jet lag in my hotel room in Berlin
when Julianne Moore, with whom I worked in 'Map of the World,'
knocked on my door and told me the great news.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore had her own reason to celebrate with her best actress
nomination for ``The End of the Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really thrilled to be nominated,'' Moore said in a
statement. ``I am so proud of 'The End of the Affair.' It was a
role I never expected to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer, known best for her London and New York stage work,
heard about her best actress nomination for ``Tumbleweeds'' near
her London home. ``I was having lunch in a little cafe around the
corner from home. A friend phoned me from L.A. I couldn't believe
(the announcement) was so early. I'm delighted, of course. I hope
it means more people will go see the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law, a first-time nominee for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
and Meryl Streep, taking her 12th nomination for ``Music of the
Heart,'' both spoke of being ``over the moon'' after hearing the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, picking up his fifth Oscar nomination for ``The
Cider House Rules,'' said, ``The (best supporting actor) category
this year is so tough it's like getting an Oscar just to be
nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tom Cruise, who celebrated by sleeping in. He was
happy about his nomination for best supporting actor for
``Magnolia'' once he wiped the sleep from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I woke him up this morning,'' his spokeswoman, Pat
Kingsley said shortly after 9 a.m. ``He was so groggy, but I
congratulated him. I just called his house again and he isn't up
yet.''

   1. THE PROTESTANT MONOPOLY ON MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, by
David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant monopoly on this year's major presidential
candidates may seem an aberration. John F. Kennedy's election
supposedly cracked the religious wall in presidential politics, and
the overt prejudice that barred Catholics, Jews and Mormons from
national elective politics has disappeared. But although
non-Protestants comprise at least 35 percent of the American
population, there are good reasons to believe that the Protestant
monopoly will persist. The backdoor to the White House may be the
only door open to Catholics, Jews and Mormons for some time.

   Comparisons between George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush often
dwell on their significant differences. Yet watching W.'s

them are. Like father, son is prone to read his cue cards verbatim.
``Message: I care,'' was his dad's classic line, uttered in New
Hampshire in 1992. W. has an eerily similar, and similarly comical
way of telling you what he wants to do, instead of actually doing
it.

   The ``push-poll'' controversy that has consumed the media for
the past week misses the point. Every campaign poll that asks about
an opponent's flaws is a push poll. Its purpose is to figure out
how to push voters away from the opponent _ if not through the
telephone, then through the television.

   Both parties sold access to candidates and party officials in
1996 in exchange for large soft-money donations. But because the
Democrats possessed the White House and its fund-raising potential,
and because the president and vice president were personally
involved in the fund raising (and because the Republicans control
the investigative powers of Congress), the Clinton-Gore campaign
came under more scrutiny than the Dole-Kemp campaign. Several of
the criticisms are aimed directly at Gore.

A LIVELY LOOK AT THE STAFF OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In France, a baguette weighs 250 grams and a flute only 200.
Ancient Pompeii had more than 40 bakeries, whose style of domed
oven is still used for hearth-baked breads. Powdering wigs with
flour-based cosmetics was prohibited during famines in the 17th and
18th centuries. And phallus-shaped breads were once baked for
weddings in parts of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some tidbits in Bernard Dupaigne's ``History of
Bread'' (Abrams, $60), a 256-page study that is both extensive and
lively. It is lavishly illustrated with drawings and photographs
showing breads and how they are baked around the world and
reproductions of artworks like ancient mosaics and sculptures and
paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Diego Rivera and Roy
Lichtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Dupaigne, a professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris,
covers not only the history of bread and the types of bread found
throughout the world, but also most aspects of home and commercial
bread-baking. The book has chapters on the cultivation and milling
of grain, types of ovens, bread and politics, the symbolism of
bread in religion and culture and how bread has evolved in the
industrial era.
</P>
<P>
   A running theme is how people throughout history have labored to
upgrade from brown bread to white _ in ancient Greece; in Rome
(where, the book says, panis palatius was the white bread of the
aristocrats); during the Middle Ages, when the finest grade of
flour was reserved for the nobility; and in the Roman Catholic
Church, where communion wafers are made with only the whitest,
silkiest flour.
</P>
<P>
   The book was first published in France, and it has a French
bias. Twice as much space is given to bread in Paris, including
well-made rustic breads revived by bakers like Lionel Poilane, as
to the history of bread in the United States. And much of the
American history is incomplete. But to Dupaigne's credit, he
mentions the American bread renaissance and the triumph last year
of the Americans over 12 other teams in a world bread-baking
competition in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the 20 recipes at the end, he might have been
overreacting to the demand for white bread, which he deplores
because most natural nutrients are stripped from white flour. A
majority of the recipes call for whole wheat flour, even those for
classics like Alsatian or Austrian kugelhopf and French fougasse,
which are traditionally baked with white flour.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are credited to Camille Le Foll, but the book could
have done nicely without them. Several are seriously flawed. The
proportions of flour and liquid are often off, and most recipes are
very heavily yeasted, some calling for nearly four packets for five
cups of flour.
</P>
<P>
   A walnut-raisin bread made with whole wheat and rye flour was a
leaden disaster; the whole wheat cheese bread recipe included an
impossibly large amount of grated cheese, and a saffron loaf called
for half a pound of butter, incorrectly listed also as one stick.
The saffron bread was made with cake flour, unusual for bread
because it has less gluten than all-purpose or bread flour, but the
result was surprisingly good, almost cakey, and excellent toasted
or with cheese.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to baking, it would be better to consult books by
authorities like Amy Scherber, Charles Van Over and Bernard Clayton
and just keep ``The History of Bread'' on a coffee table for
worthwhile browsing.

 &HT;    Teens, adults are bombarded daily with images that can lead to
long-term health problems
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When most people see a cupboard full of food, they
see just that _ food.
</P>
<P>
   But when people with eating disorders see the same cupboard,
they may see opportunities for control, for a meaningful
relationship or for a way to feel loved.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5 million people suffer from eating disorders in
America, and anorexia nervosa (starving oneself) and bulimia
nervosa (bingeing and purging) are the most common. Both can lead
to long-term health problems and even death, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into eating disorders from the outside, it's easy to ask
why anyone would starve herself to death. It's easy to think it's
ludicrous to consume and then vomit entire meals. It's easy to
think that eating disorders are about food.
</P>
<P>
   It's more difficult to understand that they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of a lot of environmental and psychological
factors,'' said Julie Clark-Sly, psychologist and co-clinical
director for the Orem, Utah-based Center for Change, a treatment
center for women with eating disorders. ``In treatment, therapists
focus on food and eating, and that never works. It has to focus on
emotional issues, and it's challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   People develop eating disorders for different reasons, Clark-Sly
said, but many are either consciously or unconsciously unhappy with
some of the most important relationships in their lives _ with
themselves, with their family and with God.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year after ending treatment for bulimia and anorexia,
19-year-old Amanda Meador of Waco says she still has trouble loving
herself and feeling worthy of love from others.
</P>
<P>
   Although she can't pinpoint the exact causes of her disorder or
when exactly it started, Meador said she hated herself for as long
as she can remember. As a child, classmates and swim team members
teased her about her size. In high school, she felt like she had to
compete with other girls with pretty hair or fashionable clothes.
When she was 17, she started starving herself and making herself
throw up after meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like myself,'' Meador said. An eating disorder ``is
about wanting to be somebody that you're longing to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt good about herself when people complimented how she
looked, but then she couldn't stop. She liked being in control.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Weston, a columnist for Girl's Life magazine, said
adolescents naturally want to find ways to control their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some girls who don't feel like they have control of their
lives will say, `If I stop eating, my life will change and I'll be
in control,''' she said. ``Preteens can't have full control of
their lives because they're not autonomous. Controlling what they
eat or digest is a very primitive but powerful, as well as
wrong-headed, approach to having control,''
</P>
<P>
   Young women are bombarded with magazine and television images of
sexy and slim women, which give them unrealistic standards for
their body, Weston said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark-Sly said she is starting to see children as young as 10
and 11 years old struggling with eating disorders. This indicates a
need for parents to encourage their children to develop healthy
self-esteem at a young age, she said. But parents are not to blame
if their children develop eating disorders, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Montaner, Amanda Meador's mother, said she knows first-hand
how parents are put between a rock and a hard place when it comes
to helping them develop healthy self-images. Montaner said she
wanted Amanda to be happy, so she encouraged her to lose weight if
it made her feel better about herself. They even went on diets
together. But Montaner never dreamed her daughter would develop an
eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gives you a rule book,'' Montaner said. ``It's like,
you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Wortman said parents need to remember that much of children's
self-esteem is based on their confidence and how much they are
supported and loved by their primary family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people get the idea that they will be loved more if they
lose weight, they're sunk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical psychologist and motivational coach Randi Wortman, who
on Wednesday and Thursday will moderate national teleconferences
about how to encourage girls to feel better about themselves, said
parents should not emphasize their own weight and shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're overemphasizing body shape and sizes, your children
will do the same and only take it further,'' she said. Emphasize
eating nutritiously and exercising as healthy lifestyles instead,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important is a daughter's relationship with her
father, Clark-Sly said, because girls pick up signals about how the
male population will perceive her from her dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a father's very critical, it's obviously going to have an
impact on his daughter,'' she said. ``Men are either going to be a
role model or a mirror or window of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Meador said she was never close with her father, before or after
her parents' divorce when she was 13 years old. He wasn't a bad
person, she said, he was just busy so she never felt like she could
get his attention.
</P>
<P>
   Meador is focusing her attention on a new relationship now, one
with her fiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not care what I look like. He loves me for who I am,''
she said. ``It's hard because I don't even love me sometimes for
who I am. He knows how to love.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, eating disorder patients view God the same way
they view their parents. Clark-Sly and her colleagues at the Center
for Change studied spirituality in their own patients and published
their findings in the Journal of Treatment and Prevention in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, they say that eating disorder patients often
struggle with a negative image of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating disorder patients tend to perceive God much as they
perceive their parents,'' they wrote. ``When patients experience
their parents as rejecting, critical, controlling, angry,
devaluating or shaming, they often project the same characteristics
onto God.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark-Sly said she believes a spiritual healing is essential for
any addiction because people lose a sense of connection with God
and then lose their own well-being and sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the fundamental level, even with people who don't
believe, the ones who have had the most effective (treatment) are
those who find a spiritual base for themselves and spiritual value
in more than a worldly dimension,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark-Sly described eating disorders as a vicious circle in
which sufferers want help and need help, but they feel they must
push people away. And when they finally want help, it's expensive
and hard to find. Few insurance companies cover eating disorder
treatments, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their personal experiences, Montaner and Meador have
taken on the task of educating others and of trying to get better
treatment for eating disorder sufferers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Montaner organized efforts to recognize National Eating
Disorders Awareness Week this week in Waco, and Meador will tell
her story at a public forum on Feb. 21 at the Providence Pavilion
Auditorium at Providence Medical Center. The forum will be from 7
to 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Wortman said she wishes society would change its message that
``thin'' equals ``good.'' But she said that's as unrealistic as
trying to achieve a supermodel's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to educate our children about the genetic basis for
the natural diversity of human shapes and sizes,'' she said. ``More
importantly, (we need to teach them) it's what's inside, who they
are as a person, that they're loved and valued and contribute to
society in so many ways; that body shape is irrelevant.''

 &HT;    WASTE, ABUSE IN GOVERNMENT IS GROWING WORSE, REPUBLICANS SAY
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five years after the Republicans took control of
Congress with promises to combat government waste, the House Budget
Committee reported Tuesday that abuses in federal programs persist
and ``in some cases are growing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have moved from the era of deficits to surpluses, some
have lost sight of the fact that virtually every government agency
is plagued by serious mismanagement problems,'' committee chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio, said in a written overview.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-page study, titled ``Reviving the Reform Agenda,'' rounds
up many of the most notorious examples of waste and mismanagement
that have been uncovered by various federal watchdog agencies since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich has said he hopes the catalog of improper payments,
abuses, fraud and program duplications will be the basis for a
major new congressional campaign to monitor and overhaul federal
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems highlighted:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon's accounting system is so sloppy that in 1998 it
lost track of 105 airplane engines, six harbor craft worth $873,000
apiece and a $1 million missile launcher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal housing projects are often ``nests of violent crime''
that contribute to the deterioration of neighborhoods. At a Fort
Worth, Texas, public housing project, a resident who organized a
children's assistance group was later found to be a drug peddler.
In Washington, D.C., two public housing projects were known in 1998
as the largest open-air heroin and crack cocaine markets in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   _ The food stamp program continues to be a magnet for abuses,
despite new computer cards that have been touted as a way to reduce
fraud. In Beaumont, Texas, two people were convicted of exchanging
electronic benefits for crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, who canceled a news conference Tuesday that was to kick
off his waste-fighting revival, plans a hearing Thursday when U.S.
Comptroller General David Walker is scheduled to provide a list of
targets for cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The budget chairman faces challenges as he tries to pump new
life into the reform effort, especially with the prospect of big
budget surpluses. Moreover, Kasich's panel can publicize the
problem, but the responsibility for overseeing federal programs
falls to various other congressional committees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, congressional resolve to fight waste often seems to
waver. The Senate Budget Committee held a hearing last month to
look at waste, but members consumed much of the session defending
pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste,
blamed both the ``intransigence'' of the Clinton administration and
lax monitoring on Capitol Hill for the lack of progress in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have done a better job at oversight,'' he said of
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Schatz argued that the federal government has made
progress in two areas, overhauling welfare and the Internal Revenue
Service, since the Republicans took over.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he welcomed the Kasich report, Schatz said, ``Any time
you communicate these ongoing problems, it offers the opportunity
to do something about them.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ While Indonesia begins to investigate some
military officers accused in last year's violence in East Timor,
the people who live in that devastated territory are unable to
arrest or jail even local thieves and robbers.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations arrived on a
visit here Tuesday and congratulated Indonesia for moving ahead
with possible indictments of senior officers including the former
military chief, Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
   But in East Timor itself, which Annan is to visit Thursday,
there are no local police officers, no local laws or justice system
and only the first rudimentary courts and trainee judges. The one
tiny jail left standing in the capital, Dili, can hold just 45 of
the most serious criminals, mostly killers and rapists.
</P>
<P>
   Other offenders in the increasingly unruly territory, one
official said, ``are just being told not to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six months after rampages by local militias _ armed and
backed by the Indonesian military _ East Timor remains at what
foreign aid officials there call ``ground zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Widespread destruction and the killings of hundreds of people _
about 250 bodies have been exhumed so far _ followed a vote on Aug.
30 by the former Portuguese colony to break away from Indonesia
after 24 years of military occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The violence seemed to be intended in part to make
rehabilitation of a free East Timor as difficult and expensive as
possible to the local people who rejected Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a period of emergency in which we lack
everything _ houses, food, health care,'' said Jose Alexandre
Gusmao, the territory's de facto leader, last week. ``We have to
rebuild every school and equip it; we have to rebuild every
hospital and equip it.'' Only a handful of teachers and doctors
remain in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   For the huge majority of the population who lost their homes,
there are almost no building materials available. If they were, few
people could afford to buy them. And if they did, no property or
tax records have survived to prove their claims to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique event for the U.N. and for the international
community because all other U.N. activities have involved dealing
with existing institutions, however difficult they may have been,''
said one experienced U.N. official. ``This is a place with no
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the spokesman for the U.N. mission
that is administering East Timor until it is ready to try to stand
on its own, said it might be years before that day comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full independence for East Timor would depend on how much has
been accomplished, which means things like having a central
payments office, a central fiscal authority, a new civil service, a
minimum level of rehabilitation and reconstruction,'' he said.
``You need to have an electricity grid that is in place, a water
system, a health system, an education system so that a new country
will not start from below zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite pledges by donor countries and international lenders of
$522 million in reconstruction aid, the relief effort is only
beginning, partly because of the bureaucratic procedures of both
the World Bank and the United Nations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The slowness of foreign aid _ and the jobs it would generate _
is contributing to restlessness and discontent that is causing
crime and gang wars.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with growing challenges to law and order in the absence of
any local police force, the United Nations has so far deployed just
460 international police officers out of a planned force of 1,610.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in East Timor also worry about what they call a
``culture of dependency'' in which residents become listless and
passive. Seeing the busy, well-equipped aid workers going about
their work, and still overwhelmed by the outpouring of
international concern, many people expect everything to be done for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen reports where material arrived in a village and
people stand around and ask the U.N. to build their house,'' said
one U.N. official in Jakarta, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``In other cases I've seen reports of people refusing to plant rice
after they have been given the seeds because they are afraid that
if they plant it they won't receive free food from the World Food
Program.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more discontent is reported to come from the fact that the
economy of East Timor remains virtually defunct. Some 80 percent of
East Timorese are estimated to be unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   When 7,000 applicants gathered in a stadium a month ago to apply
for 2,000 jobs offered by the U.N. administration, peacekeeping
troops had to be called in to quell a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are angry that their applications were rejected because
of their lack of skills,'' a U.N. official was quoted as saying.
Most of the jobs required some knowledge of English.
</P>
<P>
   When the East Timorese political leader Jose Ramos-Horta, who
has been living abroad, told the crowd that he was ``ashamed'' to
see the violence, a man interrupted him, shouting, ``We stayed here
and fought for 24 years, but those who traveled around the world
and learned English are now getting all the jobs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Poor and desperate, East Timor has at least been freed of most
of the terror that consumed it last year. But in the neighboring
Indonesian territory of West Timor, intimidation by remnants of the
militias continues in camps that house 110,000 or more people from
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   During their rampage, the militias, in a bizarre program of
depopulation organized mainly by the Indonesian military, drove an
estimated 750,000 of East Timor's 880,000 people from their homes,
according to U.N. figures. Well over 200,000 of these were forced
across the border into the west.
</P>
<P>
   Some 136,000 of those people have now returned to East Timor.
Those who remain are a mix of militia families and supporters,
genuine refugees who are still afraid to return and terrorized
hostages who continue to be abused by the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, said there had been a new
surge of violence against these people.
</P>
<P>
   Some who wish to return home are being intimidated, he said, and
some are being kidnapped from buses as they head toward the border.
In addition, he said, some aid workers have been barred from
entering the camps and have been intimidated in their work in the
border area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of East Timorese are effectively being held hostage
by the very same militias that drove them from their homes in the
first place,'' said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human
Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The violence and destruction of recent months has brutalized
people on both sides, and aid workers say that in the absence of a
legal system, vigilante justice has spread in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that suspected members of the militias and
other people returning from West Timor are being interrogated and
beaten by local groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demands for justice are so high that it is not at all
clear that the judicial system here, which is brand new, is going
to be able to cope with it,'' said Sidney Jones, director of the
human rights unit of the United Nations administration in East
Timor. ``Can you imagine the backlog these poor people face?''
</P>
<P>
   For these homeless, hungry, traumatized people, the moves to
investigate Indonesian generals are a distant abstraction, Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the inadequacy of East Timor's justice system
is frustrating a visceral hunger for some form of justice among its
people.
</P>
<P>
   When a foreign official tried to explain the process of
international justice at a recent community meeting, Jones said,
``Someone in the crowd stood up and said, `Yes, but it wasn't an
Indonesian general who burned my house.'''

LASSE HALLSTROM 
(``The Cider House Rules'')
<TEXT>
<P>
   Background: Third nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Prior experience will help him sincerely fake his
appreciation for the actual winner in this category.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: No Directors Guild nomination, no win.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Category's most surprising nominee will have to content
himself with the hoopla and the parties. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPIKE JONZE &QL; 
(``Being John Malkovich'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Directors Guild of America nomination. First Oscar
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Directed year's most inventive film. A master prankster,
people might vote for him just to see what he'd do at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Year's most inventive film might be a little too inventive
for some tastes. Movie wasn't nominated for best picture, either.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Probably won't win, but his mere presence should make
the ceremony much more fun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MICHAEL MANN &QL; 
(``The Insider'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Directors Guild of America, Golden Globes
nominations. First Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Quantum leap in artistic maturity. Kept nearly three
hours' worth of arcane blab about science, legalities and corporate
ethics gripping.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Writer-director twisted truth to achieve much of that
effect. The mass audience didn't care anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Could win, but that's hard to believe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAM MENDES &QL; 
(``American Beauty'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Won Golden Globe (drama), Los Angeles Film Critics,
Directors Guild of America nominations. First Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Impressive sense of pacing, tonal balance, visual
composition and storytelling _ and it's only his first movie.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: Wasn't the year's only outstanding first-timer. More than
a whiff of condescension at work here.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Convinced the public that his movie was both
entertaining and had something to say. Oscar shouldn't be any
harder to sell. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN &QL; 
(``The Sixth Sense'')
</P>
<P>
   Background: Directors Guild of America nomination. First
Oscarnomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pros: Directed category's most popular film.
</P>
<P>
   Cons: His writing achievement !ital!(love that twist ending!)
tends to overshadow his directorial work.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: In two competitive categories, may go home
empty-handed. But then, that $10 million check Disney gave him for
his next movie might provide some consolation. &QL;

&HT;     SOME DEMOCRATS SEEK TO SWAY S.C. GOP PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   IRMO, S.C. _ In decline for decades as Republicans flex their
muscles in this conservative southern state, South Carolina
Democrats are weighing whether participation the state's open
Republican primary might be to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats might vote for Texas Gov. George W. Bush or Sen.
John McCain of Arizona simply because they like one of the
Republican candidates. That doesn't mean the Democratic voters
wouldn't support their party's nominee in November.
</P>
<P>
   Other South Carolina Democrats might vote for McCain or Bush to
help one of them win the Republican nomination on the theory that
their GOP choice would be easier for the Democratic nominee to
defeat in November.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent Democrat has told party loyalists to vote in this
Saturday's Republican primary for McCain because he would be the
easiest for the Democratic presidential nominee to beat in
November. Another prominent Democrat is telling Democrats no, it's
Bush who is the weaker candidate, so Democrats intent on propping
up the fortunes of either Vice President Al Gore or former Sen.
Bill Bradley should vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And still other Democrats are chagrined at the prospect of
Democrats influencing the Republican Primary. They argue that
Democrats should stay home Feb. 19 and hold their fire for their
own party's March 9 caucuses, though the law would allow them to
vote in both primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Alice-in-Wonderland world of cross-over fever,
where a vote for a Republican _ Bush or McCain _ might be a vote to
help a Democrat in November.
</P>
<P>
   The whole back-and-forth might easily be relegated to the domain
of political slapstick, except for the fact that Democrats and
independents, if they turn out in significant numbers, have the
potential to swing the primary.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll that shows Bush leading McCain in
South Carolina 49 percent to 42 percent also shows Democratic
cross-over voters preferring McCain over Bush 61 percent to 27
percent. Independents also favor McCain 54 percent to 36 percent,
according to the poll. But Republicans favor Bush 59 percent to 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated dynamics of the South Carolina GOP primary make
the potential Democratic and independent votes the wild cards of
the race. Simply put, if these voters turn out in significant
numbers Saturday, McCain could well emerge the winner of the
state's 37 convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat urging his party to support McCain is Todd
Rutherford, a state house representative who is urging Democrats to
vote for McCain because of Rutherford's view that McCain would be
easier for Bradley or Gore to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford's comments caught Bush's eye. `Obviously, we're
worried about people coming in on the Democratic side'' and voting
for McCain, Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The state does not ask for party identification as part of
registering to vote, so the exact numbers of each party's adherents
are unknown. By most estimates, Republicans, Democrats and
independents each represent one-third of the electorate, with the
state leaning more Republican in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina elected a Democratic governor, Jim Hodges, last
year. But it also went for Republican presidential candidate Bob
Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Tuesday, Rutherford said that with Bush and McCain
running neck-and-neck in the polls, Democrats voting for McCain
might no longer be the wisest idea.
</P>
<P>
   `They're bashing each other's guts in and as the dynamics of the
race tighten up, Bush looks worse and worse,'' Rutherford said.
`The goal was to mix things up.'' Now, he added, votes for McCain
may serve only to make a suddenly strong candidate stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state chair Dick Harpootlian said in a local
television interview Monday night that any Democrat contemplating a
vote in the Republican primary should vote for Bush, because he
views Bush _ not McCain _ as the most vulnerable GOP nominee in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic leaders from around the state said they were
telling party members to stay away from the polls Feb. 19 and
instead focus on the party's own March 9 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   `It offends me'' that some Democrats are encouraging the
cross-over vote, said Mike Addison, party chairman in Anderson
County. `It offends me because these people are not thinking about
the Democratic agenda. John McCain is a conservative Republican,
not a Democrat. Why would a Democrat vote for a conservative
Republican?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Democratic maneuvering Tuesday, Bush called such
goings-on `junior high politics.''
</P>
<P>
   `That's a cute tactic on their part,'' Bush said with a smile.
Open primaries were designed to attract the widest variety of
voters to party candidates, not for `gaming in the system,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Glad, a political science professor at the University of
South Carolina, said that if McCain draws Democrats on Saturday, it
will be because they genuinely are attracted to him _ even if they
intend ultimately to vote Democratic in November.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't see a lot of people doing it because they want a weaker
Republican candidate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospect of Democrats voting for McCain,
McCain's South Carolina spokesman Dan McLagan said: `Anyone who
wants to vote for John McCain, we welcome their vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they're doing it because they see him as easier for
Bradley or Gore to beat?
</P>
<P>
   `I can't imagine anyone thinking that because it's clear McCain
is the tougher competitor for the fall,'' he said.

`PLATO PAPERS': HEY, YOU GOTTA BE PHILOSOPHICAL, PLATO
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Ackroyd has written notable literary biographies,
including those of William Blake and T.S. Eliot, and a number of
novels of originality and intellectual sparkle. His new novel,
``The Plato Papers,'' shows some of the usual Ackroydian conceptual
originality but is nonetheless not a success. It is difficult to
understand how a writer of Ackroyd's proven talents could produce a
book as anodyne and inconsequential as this one.
</P>
<P>
   Ackroyd's new book is an ostensibly philosophical fantasy about
a character named Plato who lives in the London of the distant
future. The Plato of the title is a public orator in his society of
the Fourth Millennium, circa 3700, and he spends his time
reflecting, usually mistakenly, on past eras, especially what he
calls The Age of Mouldwarp, a long stretch of centuries that
includes our own.
</P>
<P>
   Doubting his findings, Plato manages to voyage to the past world
that is his chief interest after discovering that Mouldwarp exists
in a cave hidden underneath the London that he knows. When he
returns to his own society to reveal his discovery of a parallel
underground world, he is charged with ``corrupting the young by
spinning lies and fables'' and is put on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ackroyd, in other words, winks at the reader with references to
the history of classical philosophy: Plato, for example, discovers
Plato's cave, the world of shadows whose inhabitants believe they
dwell in the world of reality. Still, while ``The Plato Papers''
does make you wonder what the hidden message may be, it fails to be
interesting as narrative, satire or philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as one of the several enthusiastic blurbs that adorn
the dust jacket would have it, Ackroyd has intended a Swiftian
commentary on the creation of myths and beliefs about ourselves and
others. But while one reads ``The Plato Papers'' expecting some
scorching or learned light to illuminate our consciousness,
Ackroyd's message seems both contrived and trite. He has not so
much executed a fully imagined work of fiction as produced a series
of coyly underweight fragments that do not a vision make.
</P>
<P>
   He alternates supposed public orations by Plato with comments
about him by a small group of characters with dreamy names like
Sidonia, Madrigal and Ornatus who have known him since they were
all schoolmates at what they call ``the Academy.'' The early
portions of the book have some wit to them, especially Plato's
misconceived analyses of the literary fragments that have survived
from our time to the 37th century.
</P>
<P>
   He offers a kind of literary-critical analysis, for example, of
a book called ``On the Origin of Species,'' which he attributes to
Dickens and characterizes as ``a comic masterpiece'' in which the
putative Dickens lampoons the ``eccentric hypothesis'' of a
character known as ``the naturalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato's lesson on that book lampoons literary scholarship. It
illustrates the ease with which historical fragments can be woven
into a tapestry of somebody else's misunderstanding, and Ackroyd
continues on this theme until it becomes tiresome. His Plato
creates a glossary of terms of the Mouldwarp era that contains
entries like:  &UR; ``rock music:  &LR; the sound of old stones'' and  &UR; ``see
red:  &LR; to see into the fire at the heart of all things.'' Ackroyd
also provides similar riffs on Edgar Allan Poe and Alfred
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Then Plato enumerates the various ages in human history: the Age
of Orpheus, the Age of the Apostles, the Age of Mouldwarp and so
forth. Aside from being less intellectually compelling than his
glossary of Mouldwarp expressions, this historical division has the
further fault of being inconsistent with this novel's overall
concept. It is strange that Plato would not know Charles Darwin
from Charles Dickens but that he would know the detailed story of
Orpheo and Eurydice.
</P>
<P>
   Plato's longest commentaries have to do with Mouldwarp, the
present time, which came to an end when the population destroyed
itself in a general conflagration. ``They had never understood that
they were engaged in acts of magic, and that their universe was an
emanation of the human mind,'' Ackroyd's Plato says. ``Then the sun
went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mouldwarp was eventually replaced by a soggy sort of polis, a
city resembling ancient Athens in some ways whose boundaries nobody
ever crosses and that is illuminated by a mystical human light.
Plato, having learned of his own errors of judgment regarding
Mouldwarp, challenges the conventional wisdom of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever considered that our lives are a form of dream
and that it is time to awake?'' Plato asks the judges who preside
at his trial. ``What if we are being dreamed by the people of
Mouldwarp? And what if we were dreaming them? What if the divine
human had never woken and all the ages were part of the fabric of
his sleep?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, one wants to ask, what if? Nothing that Ackroyd presents in
this mercifully slender work makes us care very much one way or the
other.

   The potato cake at Monkey Bar is a study in simple luxury:
tender layers of potato and melting Gruyere, beautifully bound by
mahogany bands of bacon. The dish shows craftsmanship worthy of a
Shaker table, sturdy yet elegant in its countrified way, and is
thoroughly satisfying. You hardly notice the steak alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon can do that. At its best, bacon provides a complex
mingling of the crisp succulent fat, the toothsome lean, and a
woodsy fragrance. And lately, in the hands of chefs who have
learned to fine-tune its attributes, bacon is being dressed up for
dinner, and proudly so.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs are using bacon the way Andrew Chase, the chef at
Monkey Bar, does in his potato cake, to strike a handsomely bold
chord. Others coax subtle grace notes from it _ chefs like Eric
Ripert of Le Bernardin, who uses it to add shadowy richness to his
pan-roasted salmon with red wine lentil sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, chefs are taking bacon seriously, and they're fussy
about what they buy. None use the ordinary packaged sliced
supermarket bacon. Instead, they seek out high-quality dry-cured
bacon, sometimes double-smoked or smoked over applewood or hickory.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs insist on bacon that contains no nitrites, and others
buy it from farms that raise their pigs without hormones or
antibiotics. They are connoisseurs of the many varieties, and are
passionate about their selections.
</P>
<P>
   Like many chefs, Chase prefers bacon with strong flavors, like
the hickory-smoked Jugtown Smokehouse brand he gets from
D'Artagnan. He also buys assertive, meaty bacon from Kurowycky, a
Polish meat market in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   Ripert uses a double-smoked applewood bacon. ``I want the
intense smokiness even when I use a small amount,'' he said. ``To
eat plain, I prefer French bacon, because the meat has better
flavor, but in a dish, when you want the smoky taste, American
country bacon is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, including Ripert, are using bacon in fish dishes, relying
on it to add a smoky dimension. Paul Sale, the chef at Icon, even
uses smoked salmon cracklings as a kind of seafood bacon with
pan-seared arctic char.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie Dufresne, the chef at 71 Clinton Fresh Food, started using
bacon from Nueske's Hillcrest Farm, in Wisconsin, on the
recommendation of his meat supplier, and it's now the only kind he
uses.
</P>
<P>
   He dices it in an artichoke ragout to serve with monkfish, and
adds it to a creamy onion tart. ``It has a real strong smoke, so
sometimes I blanch it first,'' he said. Blanching moderates the
salt and smoke, and is often done when dishes require a more subtle
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   At Eleven Madison Park, Kerry Heffernan serves garbure, a French
vegetable soup, with big, lusciously caramelized slabs of bacon
parked right on top. He has hit on a sophisticated combination of
unsmoked French-style bacon and, for pungent contrast, Jugtown's
hickory-smoked bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The new Guastavino's in the Bridgemarket has two very different
dishes wrapped in applewood bacon from Vermont: cabbage rolls
stuffed with pork and veal, and sweetbreads roasted in a brick
oven. Applewood bacon imparts a hint of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Several restaurants, including L'Actuel, Mercer Kitchen and
Seppi's, are baking the traditional Alsatian flamiche, a tart
similar to pizza and topped with strips of bacon and slices of
onion. For his tart, Stephane Buch-hlozer, the chef at L'Actuel,
likes the meatiness of smoky Black Forest bacon, a variety that's
cooked and smoked and is sometimes eaten like ham, without
additional cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The French word for bacon is lard, or lardons for the dicings of
it. The word is derived from the Latin laridum, or bacon fat. For
centuries, a salt-cured and smoked piece of the pig sustained
families throughout the winter. For many it was the only meat
available, hence the English word, larder, for pantry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the term bacon defies simple definition. It refers
neither to a single cure nor to a single cut of meat. It can be
butchered from the belly, flank, butt or loin. The curing with salt
and often sugar and spices can be dry, as in most high-quality
bacon, or wet.
</P>
<P>
   Though American bacon is usually smoked (or injected with
artificial smoke flavoring), Italian rolled and peppered pancetta
and some kinds of Hungarian, German and French bacon are not
smoked. Some bacon is air dried.
</P>
<P>
   With so many different varieties, it pays to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Pancetta is extremely popular among chefs, who crisp it as a
meaty underpinning for a sauce in which the rendered fat also
becomes a component. It's also popular to use in sandwiches like
the grilled swordfish club at Quantum 56, or in side dishes like
the grits at Jack's Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Tasso is Cajun bacon with a forceful spice cure; it makes a
brash statement in stuffings and stews. Irish bacon tends to be
quite meaty, almost as lean as Canadian-style bacon, which is more
like cured pork tenderloin. Some types of bacon, including Black
Forest, are cooked as well as smoked. Bacon like this is often
eaten in Europe on a platter of charcuterie.
</P>
<P>
   There are succulent Hungarian bacons that are cured and then
deep-fried, or are ruddy with a coating of paprika. Gypsy bacon,
which is spiced and blackened with pig's blood before smoking,
needs no cooking and offers a delicious change of pace on an
appetizer platter of cured meats.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarians deep-fry nubbins and meaty scraps of bacon into
irresistible snacks. They also enjoy chunks of flavored bacon cut
from a slab to eat with crusty bread and slices of raw onion or _
as Peter Szucs, the owner of Yorkville Packing House on the Upper
East Side, described _ with whole cloves of raw garlic. For
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh bacon is not cured at all. Scott Bryan, the chef at
Veritas, buys baby pigs from a farmer in Vermont, butchers them and
browns slabs of the fresh bacon, or pork belly, to accompany a
first course dish with apples and lentils.
</P>
<P>
   It's similar to a main course that Alain Ducasse serves in his
Michelin three-star restaurant in Paris: it consists simply of
potatoes cooked slowly in earthenware with fresh bacon that becomes
meltingly tender and darkly glazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a country dish, the most rustic you can get,'' he said.
``It's a challenge for some, and it's really for a bacon lover.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some think bacon deserves to be its own essential food
group, it breaks two current dietary taboos: fat and salt. (A thin
slice of bacon, fried, has about 35 calories and 100 milligrams of
sodium.) And many chefs are surprised that many people readily
indulge anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange thing,'' said Ripert of Le Bernardin. ``People
are against fat and meat, but when it comes to bacon it's
different. Bacon doesn't scare anyone.'' &QL;

<P>
   8 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly butter a 10-inch
cast-iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pat potatoes dry on paper towels, place in a bowl and season
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. Line skillet with bacon slices, starting each in the middle
of the pan and arranging them like spokes of a wheel and slightly
overlapping. Let ends hang over edge of pan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Arrange one-third of potatoes in pan in an even layer. Top
with half the cheese. Add half the remaining potatoes, then the
rest of the cheese, then the rest of the potatoes. Fold overhanging
bacon strips back over top. Place on lowest rack in oven and bake
45 to 50 minutes, until potatoes offer no resistance when pierced
with point of a sharp knife. Use a spatula to compress cake a few
times during baking.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cool cake on a rack for a few minutes. Place serving plate
over cake and invert. Serve in wedges.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8-12 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buying good bacon does not have to involve a trip to a specialty
food shop. Most supermarkets carry slab bacon in addition to the
commercial presliced kind, either at the butcher counter or
prepackaged in the meat department.
</P>
<P>
   Country-style slab bacon is usually dry cured and smoked over
wood or corncobs, although some New England bacon is given a wet
cure with maple syrup. In either case, the result is a denser bacon
that does not melt away in the pan, and delivers a memorable
smokiness with a good balance of meat and crackling fat.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to judge its quality is by the fat, which should be
firm and satiny, not wet or spongy. The firmer the fat, the less it
will curl as it cooks. Thin-sliced bacon will be crisper than the
thick.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the curing and aging, the lean, meaty part can
range from pale pink to almost mahogany. Nitrite-free bacon is
brown, and has a shorter shelf life than bacon made with
preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon can be frozen, but it can turn rancid after a couple of
months. And, in addition to reheating coffee, bacon may be the best
reason to own a microwave oven, in which strips brown spectacularly
well.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the basic slab bacon, there's a world of variety. Here
are some good sources for exploring: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BALDUCCI'S 424 Avenue of the Americas (9th Street) in Manhattan,
N.Y., sells six kinds of plain and peppered bacon from American
smokehouses, slab and presliced; also pancetta, Canadian bacon and
Schaller &AMP; Weber double-smoked, $3.99 to $7.99 a pound.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEAN &AMP; DELUCA 560 Broadway (Prince Street) carries eight kinds
of bacon, including hickory-smoked, double-smoked, Black Forest,
Irish, preservative-free and pancetta, $6 to $12 a pound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LES HALLES 411 Park Avenue South (28th Street) has unsmoked
French-style slab bacon, smoked, slab bacon and veal bacon, $3.50
to $6 a pound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YORKVILLE PACKING HOUSE 1560 Second Avenue (81st Street), sells
traditional Eastern European varieties of bacon, including
Hungarian smoked; garlicky black Gypsy-style; double-smoked; cooked
and smoked; cooked and deep-fried; spicy paprika-coated; fatty
salted double-smoked farmer's bacon; and deep-fried bacon pieces
and cracklings for snacking, $3.99 to $7 a pound. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some mail-order sources for high-quality country-style bacon
include EARLY'S HONEY STAND Box 908, Spring Hill, Tenn. 37174,

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A familiar New York landmark, the ramshackle
pipe-and-canvas TKTS booth at the northern end of Times Square,
will be transformed into a bright red grand staircase that will
provide visitors to the city with front-row seats to one of the
best shows in town.
</P>
<P>
   The stairs will rise gently from the base of the statue of
Father Duffy, for whom the TKTS traffic island is named, and reach
a height of 16 feet. The new sales booth for marked-down theater
tickets will be tucked beneath the high end of the stairs. After
buying a ticket, theatergoers will be able to sit on the steps,
bask in the sun and take in the ever-changing public theater that
is Times Square itself.
</P>
<P>
   The design, by the Australian architects John Choi and Tai
Ropiha, was announced Tuesday by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Construction is to begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The existing TKTS booth, an aging trailer adorned with bright
red initials, was installed in Duffy Square 27 years ago. It sells
more than $1.7 million in discount tickets annually and is operated
by the Theater Development Fund, a nonprofit performing arts
organization. In June the fund said it would sponsor a design
competition to replace the old booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will add some beauty and some usefulness,'' said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Choi, 28, and Ropiha, 36, both of Sydney, had visited New York
just once before coming to the city to receive their $5,000 award
for the design. They said they had based their impressions of Times
Square on films, magazines and television coverage of New Year's
Eve celebrations. ``We were reacting to the visual buzz,'' Ropiha
said, ``and tried to create a strong singular image in contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted something quiet that would act as a foil to all that
energy,'' said Choi.
</P>
<P>
   The staircase will be made of red resin planks. The TKTS logo,
which is under copyright to the Theater Development Fund, will be
emblazoned in black letters about five feet tall on the east and
west sides of the structure. The ticket-buyers line will snake
along the sidewalk around the statue of the Rev. Francis Patrick
Duffy, the Roman Catholic priest, army chaplain and World War I
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Jack L. Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater
Development Fund, said of the competition: ``We wanted an image
that was up-to-date and elastic and not so ad hoc. We were looking
for something that had cleverness, visual economy and force.''
</P>
<P>
   The new design also had to provide a few more sales windows than
the current eight and offer reasonable comfort for the ticket
sellers within the artificially lit, no-frills space. The Theater
Development Fund is also considering adding a public bathroom. The
project is expected to cost as much as $2 million, to be raised by
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Prizes went to other designs selected from among 683 entries
from 31 countries. The jury was made up of architects, designers,
officials representing the Times Square business improvement
district, and theater industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   Second prize went to Thomas Phifer, a New York architect in
association with the local engineering firm Ove Aup. His design
calls for a raked glass roof extending over the entire square as
well as over the statues of Father Duffy and George M. Cohan, who
is also commemorated in the square. A raised platform will include
concealed heating and air conditioning ducts for the comfort of
ticket buyers as they wait.
</P>
<P>
   Third place was shared by Piero Lissoni Associates, a group of
16 architects from Milan who proposed a minimalist box with a
translucent wall etched with a ghostly logo and with L.E.D. panels
inlaid into the pavement, and Leo Mieles, a Toronto architect who
proposed a performance space on the roof. There were four honorable
mentions: Rahman Polk and Byron Terrell of Chicago; Mauk Design of
San Francisco; Lippincott and Margulies of New York; and U-Arc
Studio of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much room for an entirely radical solution,''
said Raymond Gastil, executive director of the competition's
organizer, the Van Alen Institute, a civic organization committed
to improving the public realm through architecture. ``But the
entries say a lot about the raw energy and talent that's out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The range of the designs was considerable, from a booth
conceived as twin green crystals to a three-dimensional rendition
of Mondrian's painting ``Broadway Boogie Woogie.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Weiss, a New York architect who served on the jury,
remarked on ``the outpouring of innovation'' reflected in the
design entries. An exhibition of the top designs and 32 other
entries will open Thursday at the Van Alen Institute, at 30 West
22nd Street. The institute has arranged for 200 more images to go
on display Wednesday at the Urban Center at 457 Madison Ave.,
between 50th and 51st Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a new TKTS booth did not go off without a hitch.
No sooner was the competition announced than the Coalition for
Father Duffy protested the very existence of the booth in Duffy
Square. Maj. Gen. Joseph A. Healey, co-chairman of the coalition,
wanted to ensure that any new booth would not stand taller than
Father Duffy. He rallied his membership, ``vets from Buffalo to
Montauk,'' he said, who inundated the mayor's office with more than
7,000 postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the coalition was thus allowed to view the
winning entries in advance of the announcement and to meet with
Giuliani ``to make sure we didn't make a flap'' at the official
announcement, Healey said. He added that he liked the winning
proposal. ``The statue is singularly placed and totally visible and
identifiable within a very busy setting, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Choi and Ropiha will soon return to Sydney and their jobs as
designers at Hassell, one of Australia's largest architectural
firms. While visiting this week, they said, they did attend a
couple of plays but never waited in line at TKTS: the Theater
Development Fund supplied them with tickets.

WHAT TO CALL IT WHEN CHEFS BOIL IN BAGS: CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   David Bouley was in mad-scientist mode, sealing foie gras in
plastic bags, inserting temperature probes, consulting
time-temperature charts. He was showing off $30,000 worth of new
technology in the kitchen at Danube, technology that has turned him
into the American king of boil-in-the-bag food. Last week, through
a lunch of food cooked in the bags _ beef cheeks, boiled beef,
salmon, veal shank, artichokes, zucchini _ he kept popping up in
the dining room with other experiments in plastic packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind people saying David Bouley does boil-in-the-bag
food,'' he said, proudly displaying bags of foie gras, creme
anglaise and veal stuffing for ravioli. ``Not if it means it's
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempted as one is to snicker at the thought of a multistar chef
who is known as a perfectionist dropping plastic bags of food in
boiling water like a home cook with Stouffer's chipped beef, the
proof of the pudding is in the eating or, in this case, in the beef
cheeks and artichokes. For certain foods, the technique actually
produces superior flavors and textures, so it doesn't bother Bouley
one bit that he charges more than $30 for an entree that began its
trip to the dining room in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley may not be the only chef who has embraced the cooking
technique created by the French in the 1970s as ``sous vide''
(under vacuum). Chefs like Rocco DiSpirito of Union Pacific and
Douglas Rodriguez, who will be at the new Unico, are practicing
less sophisticated forms of it. But in New York, he has the newest
system with the greatest number of gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   The method, widely used in Europe to process foods for
supermarkets and in restaurants, never caught on here. It involves
slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed pouch, placed either in an oven
into which steam is pumped or in a water bath, followed by quick
chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Sous vide was invented by Georges Pralus, a former chef who now
runs a school in Lyon, France, for his neighbor Pierre Troisgros of
the three-star restaurant Troisgros in Roanne. The idea was to find
a cooking method to reduce the loss of fat when a piece of foie
gras is sauteed, and they succeeded. Less waste, more profit. It
also works for a lot of other ingredients that benefit from long
slow cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The method makes tough meats tender without drying out the
surface, as is often the case with braising. And it keeps
ingredients like poultry from drying out when roasted. Unlike
steaming or boiling, sous vide concentrates flavors because the
food takes on no additional liquid. It helps vegetables and fruits
retain their clear, bright flavors while their texture changes from
raw to gently cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the vacuum packaging, the system keeps foods fresher
longer, and that means they can be stored for as long as three
weeks under refrigeration. But Bouley wants to make it clear that
this is not the reason he is a champion of sous vide. Danube is,
after all, an expensive restaurant, not a supermarket. He is doing
it, he said, because he thinks the process makes the food taste
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slower cooking doesn't change the texture of the food as
much,'' he said. ``The meat retains more collagen, so there's less
shrinkage, but for us it's about flavor and texture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouley insists that sous vide is only one preparation step.
``You don't ever finish a dish this way,'' he said, as he pulled
packages of foie gras out of the refrigerator. ``It's basically
just another technique.''
</P>
<P>
   He applies it to foods on the Danube menu like beef cheeks,
which are sauteed before they are put in the bag, then teamed with
vanilla-glazed turnips, carrots cooked in carrot juice with orange
zest and spaetzle.
</P>
<P>
   He sautees artichokes in butter after they are cooked in the
bag. The foie gras is simply removed from the bag, sliced and
served on a bed of baby arugula with pepper cress and a pistachio
oil dressing. A few things at Bouley Bakery, around the corner, are
also cooked sous vide.
</P>
<P>
   When the system arrived in this country about 15 years ago, it
was greeted as a food preparation revolution, more important than
freezing, which changes the texture or flavor of food and not for
the better.
</P>
<P>
   Once the food is in the bag, a temperature probe is inserted in
the food through a special tape, which immediately reseals the
hole, to assure that the interior reaches the proper temperature
for flavor, texture and safety. Submerging in chilled water follows
to stop the cooking so the food can be held.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem with this brave new cooking method. Sous
vide requires the precision of a scientific experiment because the
bags are vacuum sealed. If anything goes wrong, like too high a
temperature during storage, there is a possibility, however remote,
of botulism, a toxin that can be fatal. The Federal food code
permits sous vide in processing plants but not in restaurants,
except under certain conditions. Those regulations took the air out
of the sous vide balloon for restaurants, and by the end of the
1980s the buzz had died down. In the United States almost all sous
vide products are produced in commissaries for chain restaurants,
hotel chains and the like because they can control the process
better.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley was not deterred. He spent two weeks at the Pralus school
studying sous vide. He first saw it in 1981, at Joel Robuchon's
three-star restaurant, Jamin in Paris, where he was working. When
the equipment was installed at Danube, Pralus came to New York to
teach the staff how to use it. As the New York City Health
Department requires, Bouley has adopted a Federal program called
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points to make sure the times and
temperatures for cooking and holding are followed and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, who can give a 60-minute lecture on the technology,
experiments with his new toy every day, trying different fruits,
vegetables, fish, meat and sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs who boil in a bag use abbreviated methods and less
expensive equipment. Michel Richard, the chef and owner of
Citronelle in Washingon, has an American-made Cryovac machine. It
vacuum packs and seals its own plastic bags, which are approved for
cooking. He cooks veal shank with vegetables and seasonings in the
bags and occasionally capons and lamb shanks. He cools the veal
shank overnight and then puts it on a rotisserie for a crisp crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very slow cooking, and there is more concentration of
flavor,'' he said. ``If I braise it, it's not an even cooking
process. If I poach it, there is too much liquid. But this way when
I eat it, I can't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who will become the executive chef at Unico in late
spring, thinks the simpler Cryovac version of sous vide is ``the
most important piece of equipment to come along in the last five
years.'' He uses it for several dishes and reheats slices of
braised boneless oxtail and their sauce in Cryovac bags to keep the
slices from falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   At Union Pacific, DeSpirito cooks chicken, pheasant and
partridge in a primitive version of sous vide, which he developed
himself. Breasts are double wrapped in ordinary plastic wrap, then
quickly sealed in an oven, which he insists is hot enough to seal
the plastic but not hot enough to melt it. He then cooks it in
water in a jury-rigged fish poacher. Before combining the breasts
with sauces, he sears them. Even birds that ordinarily sacrifice
moistness for a crisp skin are succulent and deeply flavored.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sweetness does emerge in slow cooking,'' DeSpirito said. He
is considering buying the Cryovac system.
</P>
<P>
   At Danube last week, the artichoke hearts were a revelation:
they had a pure taste with none of the acidity that comes from
soaking in lemon water to keep them from darkening, and they were
free of that characteristic brassy aftertaste. Salmon fillet and
beef cheeks were both meltingly tender but not falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley is already looking at another technique that Pralus is
promoting: a four-part gizmo that turns a microwave oven into a
steamer. A microwave oven in David Bouley's kitchen? Mon Dieu.

   FLENSBURG, Germany _ This is a formal country. Herr-This.
Frau-That. No first names. Bone-breaking handshakes, humor with the
lightness of a large dumpling, and lace curtains guarding the coy
privacy of every home.
</P>
<P>
   Germany certainly looks demure. It often looks dull. But there
are surprises. Like the explicit advertisements for phone sex that
inundate television. Or the naked men and women wandering through
Berlin's Gruenewald and Tiergarten in the summer. Or the chancellor
and foreign minister with eight marriages between them.
</P>
<P>
   Or indeed the renowned ``Sexagon'' on the outskirts of this
northern German town, where the prim receptionist sits at a desk
overlooking shelves stocked with lingerie, erotic videos and an
astounding array of ointments, attachments and devices designed to
bring some extra pizazz to the primal urge.
</P>
<P>
   This six-sided building (nobody would be so prosaic as to call
it a ``hexagon'') is the world headquarters of Beate Uhse
International, a company that went public on the Frankfurt exchange
last May, offering stock certificates adorned with a curvaceous
nude flanked by two young women in high heels and red underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first erotic corporation to go public in this
country, and the offering was hugely oversubscribed,'' said Uhse,
the 80-year-old founder of the company that has accompanied the
unbuttoning of Germany like no other. ``I wanted to raise the money
to penetrate new markets in the United States and Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   At an age when many successful entrepreneurs might consider
unwinding, Uhse is preparing to build on her rapid conquest of the
formerly communist eastern part of Germany in recent years by
bringing her stores and catalogs to all of Europe and attacking an
American market she sees as ``basically so conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 brought together western
free-marketeers and eastern communists. But it was not only
divergent ideologies that abruptly mingled. So, too, did diverse
sexual mores.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelmingly secular, sexually liberal eastern state where
other forms of divertissement scarcely abounded joined a western
state that was certainly open by American standards in its approach
to sex and nudity, but where the influence of churchgoing
conservatives had not entirely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A result has been occasional pitched battles on Baltic beaches.
Westerners complain about their naked compatriots from the east.
Easterners retort with the contemptuous term of ``Textilstrand'' to
describe beaches where bathing suits _ or ``textiles'' _ are used.
</P>
<P>
   Another result has been the reinforcement of the cultural
triumph of Uhse, who began her business in 1946 selling leaflets
explaining the rhythm method of contraception. In the rubble of
post-war West Germany, nothing better was on offer.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the post-Cold War chaos of what was East Germany,
she moved fast. Trucks full of her catalogs and goods headed east,
where the reception was enthusiastic. Letters poured in thanking
Uhse; they described how her products were discussed among friends
over meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the West, my goods became widely used, but they were hardly
the subject of dinner-time chat,'' Uhse said. ``But in the east, I
quickly saw that people were much more open about sex.'' The
company now has 2 million clients in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of sexual attitudes and behavior, Germany has become
an extremely open society,'' said Max Kaase, a sociologist. ``The
former East Germany was hung up about many things, but not sex. And
it was incorporated into a western society where the revolts of the
1960s and a fall in religious observance had already changed many
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those revolting in the 1960s were Gerhard Schroeder and
his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, who have since notched up
four marriages each. Their style has helped give vogue to a long
word, ``Lebensabschnittgefaehrte,'' one of those assembled jewels
of German lexicography, which literally means ``companions through
a slice of life.'' In other words, temporary partners.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the divorce rate has accompanied a steep decline in
churchgoing and religious observance. In the 1950s, about 60
percent of Germany's Catholics identified themselves as intensely
involved with the church. That has now fallen to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among Germany's Protestants _ the country is divided more or
less evenly between the two religions _ the fall has also been
steep, although from a much lower level. Where 29 percent of
Protestants said they were strongly religious in the 1950s, only 9
percent say they are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Church used to be the main opposition to me,''
said Uhse, whose company sells over 7,000 erotic or pornographic
products in stores scattered throughout the country. ``It
encouraged people to declare themselves offended by me and bring
lawsuits. But I fought the cases and they all eventually died.''
</P>
<P>
   Her large office contains a sort of potted photographic history
of a Germany she has seen move from a society so conservative that
sale of a condom to an unmarried couple was illegal to one where
almost-naked women fill television screens and beg viewers to call
them on numbers invariably heavy on the number ``sechs'' (six).
</P>
<P>
   The photographs show Uhse as a pilot during World War II (her
childhood hero was Charles Lindbergh), as a young businesswoman
being introduced to Willy Brandt, and as a corporate leader with
the shares that electrified the bourse last year. From strife
through socialism to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Kaase, the sociologist, said he first became aware of Uhse in
the 1950s, when he was a young man. ``To buy a condom in Germany
then was really something you wanted to keep to yourself,'' he
said. ``And I learned about this woman you could write to, and she
would send you a package. Millions of Germans did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that company sales have now risen to $100 million,
Uhse rivals the tennis player Steffi Graf as the best-known woman
in Germany, her Museum of Sex is an important tourist attraction in
Berlin, and rivals like ``Dr. Mueller'' in Germany or ``Pabo'' in
the Netherlands have been acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she says, comes the United States, a place where the
proposal for a Museum of Sex in New York put forward by two
entrepreneurs named Alison Maddex and Dan Gluck has recently caused
outrage. And Uhse is shocked by ``a puritanical streak that is much
stronger than in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of how to succeed in the American market is now under
way. But Uhse had already decided on two things. She will not use
the name ``Beate Uhse'' because, she said, nobody in the United
States can pronounce it. ``And,'' she added, ``I will get myself an
extremely good lawyer.''

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE INTERNET SUMMIT PLEDGES TO STEM CYBER ATTACKS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet security leaders, called to the White
House by President Clinton to discuss last week's attacks against
several popular Web sites, pledged Tuesday to share their data as
part of a broad effort to suppress future assaults.
</P>
<P>
   After an hourlong meeting with Clinton, the industry officers
pledged ``to establish a mechanism for the systematic and protected
coordination of information regarding cyber attacks,
vulnerabilities, counter-measures and best information security
practices'' in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from reaching, with government prompting, a new industry
security accord, the chief purpose of the summit seemed to be an
effort to bolster trust in e-commerce, a white-hot sector of the
U.S. economy, and to public dampen fears of a possible Internet
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Clinton told reporters shortly before the meeting
began, ``it's a source of concern. But I don't think we should
leave here with this vast sense of insecurity. We ought to leave
here with a sense of confidence that this is a challenge that was
entirely predictable. It's part of the price of the success of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't analogize (the cyber attacks) to Pearl Harbor,''
the president added. ``We are all here, we are going to figure out
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanking Clinton in the Cabinet Room were 29 industry, trade
group, academic and privacy representatives. They included Peiter
Zatko, a reformed hacker re-cast as a security consultant, who is
widely known by his Internet name of ``Mudge.'' With his long brown
hair hanging down on his chest, he stood apart from the more
conventional technology mavens.
</P>
<P>
   Another long-haired participant, Whitfield Diffie, corporate
information officer of Sun Microsystems, tapped away on his laptop
as the meeting began.
</P>
<P>
   Diffie said he told Clinton the hacking incidents pointed up the
global nature of the Internet, a fact that means nations need to
work together to ensure the security of individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw were a whole lot of computers taken over,'' Diffie
said. ``I said to the president, 'This is as though you lost an
election because a lot of people voted against you, and they didn't
even know they voted.' As a politician, he could really relate to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Harris Miller, president of the Information
Technology Association of America, said his group is looking at the
antitrust laws and the federal Freedom of Information Act to see
whether it ``would be appropriate and necessary'' to change laws so
data could be shared without risking prosecution or public
disclosure of valued proprietary secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hope that if we identify those, we'd be able to work with
the administration and the Congress to get those impediments
removed,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he lauded the government-industry partnership to combat
cyber-crime, John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, was
unable to offer assurances that the White House had security
systems in place that could repel at its own public Web site the
kind of ``denial of service'' attacks that struck the Internet last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we shouldn't overstate the problem. We can't
understate the problem,'' Podesta told a reporter. ``So I think
that anything I could say in answer directly to that question
probably would just throw out a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a computer believed to have been used in last week's
attacks was seized by federal agents, Hillsboro, Ore., Police Sgt.
Allen Zaugg, head of a group of officers trained for high-tech
cases, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is now analyzing that computer, which was seized within
the last two days from a home business in the Portland, Ore., area.
Its owner apparently was unaware that the unit was used to stage
the attacks.

 &HT;    Lush world awaits through gateway
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Feb. 17.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During a recent icing of the region, I was staring out
my back window, watching the blue jays and grackles and cardinals
flit around the bright red nandina berries. The colors of the
berries and the birds were the liveliest in the garden on that
bleak February day, standing in bold relief against the dull,
fallen foliage, the gray branches and trunks, the browned green of
zapped shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I was reminded: Be careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of my gardening buds, I had whined about our
multiple mild winters, complained about how the mosquitoes and the
bugs and the germs were flying and running roughshod over us and
our gardens, biting and eating at will.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we sniffed, it just isn't natural to have so many warm
days in months that are supposed to be cold.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the cold came to Dixie, and it was amazing how quickly
gardeners got cabin fever. February always is the cruelest month
for dirt-diggers, whose pent-up urges have been frozen for weeks;
this is that in-between month, that time of pre-spring when we
really start to tap our feet and search the ground for hints that
help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   It is. And its name is flower show. Across the nation, halls and
centers bloom with color and hope and ideas, bursting into bloom
like waves of wildflowers. For some of us, the exhibitions recall
the ``wish books'' back in the day when we country folks would sit
around the fireplace thumbing through Sears catalogs, lusting after
the latest summer shirts and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In that wish-book world, we always were well-dressed,
comfortable financially and in every other way _ just as when we
stroll through the wish-book world of flower shows, we create in
our mind-gardens the most perfect spaces, verdant, inviting.
Pest-free.
</P>
<P>
   How apt that the Southeastern Flower Show (WednesdayFeb. 27)
here in Atlanta chose as its theme ``Through the Garden Gate.'' Our
strolling and wishing and gardening in our heads is, in some ways,
taking a peek into space still unknown, enjoying the anticipation
of what grows beyond _ assured of its loveliness, or at least its
interest and intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us hasn't been pleasured by a glance or stare through
someone else's gate? The physical structure both invites and
forbids, creating intimacy and trepidation at the same time. What
magnetic mystery surrounds the gate. For 10 years, I have never
failed to appreciate my own gate, a wooden one with an eye-high,
shoebox-size opening that is partly covered with ornamental metal.
After a decade, I still cannot resist looking in and out each time
I pass.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through the gate _ and appreciating being looked at
through it _ amounts to flirting. You get a taste of what you think
you want. But not too much. Call it romancing the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Maya Angelou, who knows a lot about both gardening and flirting
_ not to mention writing and performing _ talked with sadness and
passion about flirtation's demise when I visited her Winston-Salem,
N.C., home in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a terrible landscape, with very few images of
romance,'' Angelou said in her sweet, heavy voice, languidly
sipping scotch. ``We have sticklike figures of lust sometimes.
Maybe even passion, but passion without compassion is not
romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bring back that fading feeling of romance, she urged, because
without it we risk spiritual death _ an unnatural demise, she said,
adding that we can avoid dying spiritually through the simple and
complex act of flirting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tonality, which informs the other person'' that
you're flirting, she said. ``It's a wonderful thing. It enriches
every gathering, so that old women can say things of nice, teasing
intent to young men, not meaning for it to ever go any further, but
everybody gets a good laugh out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, everyone gets a good lift from it.
</P>
<P>
   To flirt is to live, to enjoy the rush that comes when you peek
through the gate, imagining the lovely richness to come. When
warmth arrives to stay awhile, greenness bursts forth from the
sweet-smelling earth, and blooms cover us, again.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, satellite images showed a comma-shaped curl of
clouds over the eastern Pacific on course toward California. The
jet stream disturbance creating the cloud feature will come ashore
Wednesday, bringing windswept rain to much of central and northern
California. Local flooding is likely, especially in regions where
soils are saturated from recent rains. As the moist plume of air
impacts the higher terrain of interior California, it will cool,
setting the stage for prodigious snowfall over the Sierra,
primarily above 3,500 feet. Snow will spread eastward to many of
the west-facing mountain slopes of the central and southern Rockies
later Wednesday and Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered snow showers will accompany a weak
low-pressure system crossing the Northeast Wednesday. A light
accumulation of snow is possible from northwestern Pennsylvania to
Maine. As warm air is drawn into the circulation of the low
pressure, snow showers will mix with and change to rain showers
near the Northeast seaboard. Behind the low, brisk winds from the
northwest will direct colder air into the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm weather will continue to cover a large area
from Texas to the Southeast on Wednesday. Amid ample sunshine
afternoon temperatures will approach 70 degrees from near Dallas to
Atlanta. Eighty-degree readings will be common across Florida.
Elsewhere, generally dry conditions will cover the Great Plains,
though patchy light snow will affect western sections late in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Money in the Bank
</P>
<P>
   Precipitation that falls in California in the cool season must
meet water needs during the long, dry summer. Since most of
California's reservoirs are located in the north, much of the
winter rain that comes to southern California adds little to the
water supply. Thus, the success of the rainy season is judged by
how much snow falls in the mountains. Snow is like money in the
bank, piling up interest in winter, with the principle running off
slowly starting in spring. This past week, a large deposit was made
to the bank as over five feet of snow have buried parts of the
northern Sierra.

   They screamed, they cried, they partied, they went back to work
_ and some of them just snoozed.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees for the 72nd annual Academy Awards talked Tuesday
of hearing the news at home, on movie sets, in hotels, at small
predawn gatherings, at a cafe. As would be expected of a field
brimming with first- and second-time nominees, they were bursting
over the good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in my underwear with my wife watching
television,'' said 38-year-old producer Richard Gladstein, whose
``Cider House Rules'' is up for best picture and six other awards.
``I started crying when they mentioned (director Lasse Hallstrom's)
name, and she kept telling me to be quiet because she couldn't
hear. I barely heard when they mentioned me, but she started
screaming so loud I figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ball, whose original screenplay garnered one of eight
nominations for ``American Beauty,'' said he was at a small Nichols
Canyon get-together with others involved in the film to watch the
announcement on TV live at about 5:40 a.m. They sipped coffee
instead of quaffing champagne, but it was a celebration
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that I sort of leave my body at those moments,''
said Ball, 42. ``The Golden Globe was a total out-of-body
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Once word got out, screen veteran Richard Farnsworth (``The
Straight Story'') said the phone at his southeastern New Mexico
ranch had been ringing a lot. With yet another call from a
reporter, his wife begged for a moment's patience while the
79-year-old actor took a bathroom break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, heck,'' Farnsworth said. ``It's been a little hectic, but
that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth, a stuntman for 40 years before his Oscar-nominated
role in 1978's ``Comes a Horseman,'' said the David Lynch movie is
the best he ever got to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to do a couple of great ones, but I think it's pretty
darn good,'' he said. ``I hope it mainly starts a trend using older
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngest nominee Haley Joel Osment (``The Sixth Sense'') and
past best supporting winner Kevin Spacey (``American Beauty'') were
getting set for another day's work on ``Pay It Forward,'' being
shot by Mimi Leder in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Chloe Sevigny (``Boys Don't Cry'') was in Germany for the Berlin
International Film Festival when the announcements came. ``When I
found out, I was sleeping off jet lag in my hotel room in Berlin
when Julianne Moore, with whom I worked in `Map of the World,'
knocked on my door and told me the great news.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore had her own reason to celebrate with her best actress
nomination for ``The End of the Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really thrilled to be nominated,'' Moore said in a
statement. ``I am so proud of `The End of the Affair.' It was a
role I never expected to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer, known best for her London and New York stage work,
heard about her best actress nomination for ``Tumbleweeds'' near
her London home. ``I was having lunch in a little cafe around the
corner from home. A friend phoned me from L.A. I couldn't believe
(the announcement) was so early. I'm delighted, of course. I hope
it means more people will go see the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law, a first-time nominee for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
and Meryl Streep, taking her 12th nomination for ``Music of the
Heart,'' both spoke of being ``over the moon'' after hearing the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, picking up his fifth Oscar nomination for ``The
Cider House Rules,'' said, ``The (best supporting actor) category
this year is so tough, it's like getting an Oscar just to be
nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tom Cruise, who celebrated by sleeping in. He was
happy about his nomination for best supporting actor for
``Magnolia'' _ once he wiped the sleep from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I woke him up this morning,'' his spokeswoman, Pat
Kingsley, said shortly after 9 a.m. ``He was so groggy, but I
congratulated him. I just called his house again and he isn't up
yet.'' &QL;

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's next, extra-early election returns? Easy access to
missile-launching codes at the Pentagon?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even ... gasp! ... announcing the winners of the Oscars
before the envelopes are ripped open? Heck, nobody would even have
to watch the pageantry!
</P>
<P>
   Nope, that type of Armageddon is never gonna happen, said
officials at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,
claiming that an Internet's sneak-peek list of Oscar nominees was
nothing more than a ``bogus'' series of educated guesses _ and a
mistake-laden series at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list of nominations is maintained in strict secrecy by
PricewaterhouseCoopers,'' read a prepared statement from the
academy. ``Anyone claiming to have access to the actual nomination
list is lying.
</P>
<P>
   Academy officials declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The sneak-peek list appeared on Harry Knowles' ``Ain't It Cool
News'' Web site about 24 hours before the academy released the
official list of nominees Tuesday morning. When the nominations
were announced Tuesday, it was revealed that Knowles had gotten all
20 acting nominees and four of the five best picture nominees.
</P>
<P>
   So is Mr. Ain't-It-Cool a psychic? A hacker extraordinaire?
</P>
<P>
   Neither, said the Austin, Texas-based Knowles, who claimed the
information came directly from an unprotected academy server
attached to www.oscar.com, the academy's Web site. The information
included detailed background on the ``nominees'' listed, and
appeared to be in the format that the academy uses when it compiles
its lists that are distributed to news media.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles listed up to eight nominees in most categories, many of
which included the five finalists. Any Web-savvy surfer could have
tapped in and checked out the resource he used, Knowles added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fan of the site wrote me and Matt Drudge at the same time,
saying, `Hey, maybe you want to take a look at this,''' said
Knowles. ``I took a look, started making some calls, made sure that
it was an academy server, and it was.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: When the actual nominations were announced Tuesday
morning, it became clear that Knowles' information contained
several mistakes. Spike Jonze, a best director nominee for ``Being
John Malkovich'' wasn't on the Ain't-It-Cool list. Neither were the
writers of the film ``Election.'' Five of the seven ``Cider House
Rules'' nominees were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well,'' said Knowles, whose Web site Tuesday carried an
explanation and directions on how to access the early list he
printed.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, he figures that the information was a best guess
warm-up by the people who run the Oscar Web site in preparation for
the actual release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually much happier it was wrong,'' Knowles said. ``I
was trying to figure out a way to burn down the academy for not
nominating Spike Jonze. To see him on the actual list was a
complete pleasure.'' &QL;

oil industry in Texas wailed and gnashed its teeth and the Texas

prices are way up there _ $30 a barrel on Monday _ and the

be permanently retired. (Hight, Austin American-Statesman). WITH

MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES: WHODUNITS AND HOW THEY DID 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the introduction to his hefty new anthology, ``The Best
American Mystery Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin), Tony
Hillerman takes on Edmund Wilson, whom he calls ``America's most
portentous literary critic'' of the 1940s, for dismissing the whole
mystery genre as beneath comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hillerman, himself an award-winning mystery
writer, dissents from the taste of Jacques Barzun and Wendell
Hertig Taylor, authors of ``A Catalogue of Crime'' (1971), for
``tales of ratiocination,'' entertaining puzzles unadulterated by
pretensions to social significance or realism.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ``great Raymond Chandler'' as his model, Hillerman
makes a mild case that viewing the mystery as an intellectual
exercise is too constraining, that a detective yarn can be a
vehicle for social comment as well as for literary quality. So in
his accommodating pages the reader encounters both unassuming
puzzle makers like Jacques Futrelle (``The Problem of Cell 13,''
1905) and Ben Ray Redman (``The Perfect Crime,'' 1928) along with
renowned murder-tale weavers like Dashiell Hammett and James M.
Cain and personages like Willa Cather, William Faulkner and
Flannery O'Connor, who are not often classified as being mystery
writers of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   So catholic a view, though inviting in its way, makes life a
touch too easy for the anthologist. Part of his job, after all, is
to define what he is up to, and his choices constitute a
definition. If he is arguing for the literary value of the mystery,
then the mere puzzle, a concoction whose characters perform in the
service of an intriguing plot, must fall short. But if works of
literary weight do find their way into his selections, then he is
likely to be straining the limits of his jurisdiction, which,
remember, is ``mystery stories.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's not be too fussy. While the reluctance of Hillerman
and his series editor, Otto Penzler, to draw firm lines between
puzzles and literature, between horror tales and adventure stories,
fudges arguments over categories, their book offers pleasures
aplenty, from Hemingway's masterpiece of mood and dialogue, ``The
Killers,'' to Ring Lardner's enduring ``Haircut'' to Damon Runyon's
swell ``Sense of Humor.'' Classify them as you will.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics attribute literary worth to practitioners like
Chandler and Hammett (before he gave up his mind to Lillian
Hellman), but if this anthology demonstrates anything it is that
the vintage private-eye genre is worn beyond repair. Hillerman
reminds us that Chandler gained considerable influence in the
1940s, both among writers and in college English departments. His
1944 essay ``The Simple Art of Murder'' was a call for defiance of
the traditional British mystery story. It churned up enthusiastic
re-evaluations of the American pulp genre.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is represented by ``Red Wind'' (1938) and Hammett by
``The Gutting of Couffignal'' (1925). Both are eminently readable,
far superior, for example, to such big-name contributions from
their eras as John Steinbeck's ``The Murder'' (1933) and Pearl S.
Buck's ``Ransom'' (1938), which fail in the basic job of being
mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   But just as yesterday's revolutionary proclamations turn into
tomorrow's formulas, the private-eye sorties have for years been
foiled by their own central convention, notably the tough,
sentimental, deep-down-decent hero with his snappy cracks. The
pulpish characters have long since begun to seem like self-parody.
(From Chandler: ``She just stood and looked at me, a long, lean,
hungry brunette, with rouged, thick black hair parted in the
middle, a mouth made for three decker sandwiches, coral-and-gold
pajamas, sandals _ and gilded toenails. Under her ear lobes a
couple of miniature temple bells gonged lightly in the breeze.'')
</P>
<P>
   The third member of America's private-eye triumvirate, Ross
Macdonald, is described in the book's fond biographical note as
offering complex mysteries leavened with social or political
concern, but the story dredged up here is just a routine Lew Archer
yarn.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the editors' refusal to market nice distinctions,
this anthology makes its own comment on changing styles. Hillerman
and Penzler, who have scarcely an unkind word for any practitioner
more adroit than ErleStanley Gardner, are inadvertently exposing
the staleness of the whole hard-boiled enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the works here lay claim to literary aspirations, but
there is at least one that demonstrates that a good mystery can run
deep. The quiet power of Susan Glaspell's 1917 story, ``A Jury of
Her Peers,'' lies in a conversation between two country women about
a third woman suspected of killing her husband. Clues are revealed,
but they are incidental to the revelation of the imprisoned lives
that draw the three women together. ``A Jury of Her Peers'' is
evidence that a mystery plot is no bar to literary accomplishment,
though that is too high a bar for many to surmount.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for superior mystery writing that keeps its
eye strictly on target, try Cornell Woolrich's ``Rear Window.''
Sure, you've seen the Hitchcock movie, but the 1942 original
demonstrates how a clever premise, a smartly paced plot and
intelligent writing can hold a reader's attention and appreciation
even without Grace Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the second half of ``The Best,'' which carries us
from the 1950s through the '90s and includes such well-known
contributors as John D. MacDonald, Patricia High-smith and Stephen
King, would have awakened Edmund Wilson's esteem for their calling.
The old-fashioned whodunit along with the art of detection seem to
be in particular jeopardy these days, gunned down by accounts, with
a veneer of psychology, of pathological killers causing havoc.
</P>
<P>
   But readers willing to settle for professionally wrought
diversions should find pleasure in Stanley Ellin's Poe-like tale of
vengeance, Evan Hunter's sharp look at a first offender's final
encounter with the police and Robert L. Fish's droll puzzler about
a wager with a twist. And for sheer humor, not much evident in this
collection, there is Donald E. Westlake's ``Too Many Crooks,'' a
risible account of the tribulations of a likable burglar caught
amid hostages, police and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Though I cannot join in the editors' Chandler worship and found
too many of their selections soft at the center, I wound up these
800-odd pages accepting their proposition that mysteries come in
many respectable guises, whether as puzzles, romps, chillers,
social comment or, very occasionally, literary endeavors, and
sorting them out does not seem to be worth the trouble. So forget
about what certifies a true mystery and enjoy the skill, ingenuity
and surprises that the species, however described, offers. The only
distinction that matters in so happily free-ranging an endeavor is
whether the story works.

FOR FORTSON, IT'S JUST BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Danny Fortson woke up in his Salt Lake City hotel room Tuesday
and he was still a Boston Celtic. He was still a hired hand on the
SS Pitino _ the organization he aptly described as a sinking ship
when he was traded away six days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But what must it have been like for Fortson to walk on the Delta
Center court Tuesday night in the traditional green uniform? He was
representing a team that just shipped him out of town and was
forced to take him back. Did he really want to take a charge from
Karl Malone for the greater good of the Boston Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a basketball player,'' Fortson said early Tuesday, trying
to sound professional. ``This is a business. I'm not going to ever
stop playing basketball and playing it hard. That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice attitude for a guy who already knows his team doesn't want
him anymore. It's sort of like going to the prom with a girl after
learning that she'd been angling to go with another boy. Kind of
takes some of the magic out of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   This has happened before in professional sports. In 1976, Joe
Rudi and Rollie Fingers spent a night in Red Sox uniforms, only to
be returned to the Oakland A's per order of commissioner Bowie
Kuhn. In '71, the Patriots traded Carl Garrett to the Cowboys for
Duane Thomas. Garrett came back and played for the Patriots when
the inimitable Thomas couldn't come to terms with New England.
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to have heard coach Rick Pitino's pep talk before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)We're all in this together, gang. All for one and one for
all. Give it your best for the Celtic family. Let's go out and win
one for Thanksdad Gaston!(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Pitino no doubt tossed the ball to Fortson and let him lead the
charge through lines of cheerleaders and flaming hoops. Just like
John Belushi carrying the torch for Delta House, exhorting, ``Let's
do it!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I exaggerate. The boola-boola stuff worked well for Little
Ricky at Kentucky, but it must be hard to inspire a guy to take one
for the team when you've already traded his butt out of town.
</P>
<P>
   What a week for Fortson. He was in his Greater Boston apartment
last Wednesday when his agent called and told him he'd been traded
to the Toronto Raptors for a couple of cheese sandwiches (Alvin
Williams and Sean Marks). So instead of going to the New Garden,
Fortson flipped on his TV and watched his former teammates lose to
Larry Bird's Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he flew to Toronto, had a physical, and told the
Toronto media, ``Hey, you've got a winning record. I was in Boston,
we're 21-28, and the ship is sinking pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement hardly qualified as a news bulletin, but it came
back to haunt Fortson the next day when Williams failed his Celtic
physical and the trade was voided.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the All-Star break, Fortson had no contact with his
old/new/old teammates until Monday when he flew on the Celtics'
charter to Utah. They let him have it pretty good and he apologized
for the loose lips on sinking ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made an unprofessional statement,'' he said Tuesday. ``I'm
only 23. I'm a young guy. I try to be as professional as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked with Minnow captain Pitino at Monday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business,'' said Fortson. ``I understand. He don't hold
no grudge against me and I don't hold no grudge against him. And I
know that everybody in the NBA is tradeable except five or six
guys. I had a good year last year and got traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is kind of funny. I really didn't think I was
going to be around these guys, but I'm glad I did come back. Now I
can get some numbers in case something does happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   He's gone. Maybe before the Feb. 24 trading dealine, or maybe
over the summer via free agency. Fortson was a top NBA rebounder
with Denver last year, and the Celtics traded Ron Mercer to get
him. But the new rules have put Fortson in foul trouble. Antoine
Walker can't move to the No. 3 spot to create enough minutes for a
rebounding forward. Fortson went into the game averaging 5.9 points
and 5 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the way it is,'' he said. ``It's not hard for me.
My thing is basketball. I go out and play hard no matter if the
jersey I'm wearing is green or yellow. If I wasn't in the NBA, I'd
be playing in pickup games at the YMCA.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no trades and no sinking ships at the Y. But there's
no big money, either. This is business and that's why Fortson was
in Celtic green, elbow-to-elbow with Karl Malone in Utah.

 &HT;    The Political Ticker: Wider voter access _ the yeast of
democracy
 &HT;    EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A legal challenge that sought to block Saturday's South Carolina
Republican primary _ an action that began last month as a bit of
political mischief _ was dropped after the state GOP agreed to open
every available polling place in the state, including those in
heavily Democratic and black areas that were closed in previous
years. As a result, more than 1,500 polling places will be open,
compared with about 800 in 1996. The increased access in
non-Republican areas could make voting easier for Democrats and
independents, many of whom have said they are leaning toward John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Harder on `soft money'
</P>
<P>
   Taking up John McCain's big issue just before Tuesday night's
key debate in South Carolina, George W. Bush rolled out a campaign
reform plan that would ban corporate and union ``soft money''
donations and block lobbyists from giving to lawmakers while
Congress is in session. McCain called the proposal ``a joke,''
because it would still allow wealthy individuals to give unlimited
amounts of soft money, or donations for political party activities.
``How can you call it reform, when it doesn't stop soft money?''
McCain said. Now that John McCain has sworn off negative
advertising, he wants to make sure voters know it. ``His decision
to run purely positive campaigns shows he's a man of confidence,''
says a woman in a radio ad that began airing Tuesday in South
Carolina. ``John McCain has elevated the race for the presidency
back to where it should be,'' says one man. The ad doesn't mention
that less than a week ago McCain was tossing as much mud as his
opponent, saying that Texas Gov. George W. Bush ``twists the
truth'' like President Clinton. Now that he's back on the high
road, McCain hopes voters will forget he ever left.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush wants voters to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice choice
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was endorsed by the nation's top abortion-rights group,
which has abandoned its neutrality in the Democratic presidential
contest in hopes of ending questions about Gore's mixed record on
abortion. Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, appeared with Gore at a
Washington hotel to deliver the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters teammate
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley got a lift in his home state of New Jersey from a
meeting of the Eastern Region of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, representing locals in 13 states from South Carolina to
Maine. He earned a standing ovation during the speech in Atlantic
City by calling for a ban on companies replacing striking workers.
A floor motion to endorse Bradley was roundly approved, even though
the overall Teamsters organization has not issued an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering look at McCain
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney said the labor federation was
correct to endorse Al Gore, even amid talk of some rank-and-file
support for John McCain. ``We're confident that the endorsement was
the way that a significant majority of our members wanted to go,''
Sweeney said at a gathering of union leaders in New Orleans.
Separately, Andrew Stern, president of the Service Employees
International Union, said that enough of his union's members have
been interested in McCain that the union considered officially
recommending him as an alternative to Gore for its Republican and
independent members.
</P>
<P>
   Crossover quandary
</P>
<P>
   The two Republican rivals, running neck and neck in the final
days before the South Carolina primary, are pleading with
independents and Democrats to show up and provide victory's edge.
``I ask you, I beg you,'' John McCain beseeched a lunchtime rally
in Greenwood, ``whether you're Republican, Democrat, Libertarian or
vegetarian, get out and get your friends out.'' Crossover voting is
permitted in South Carolina, and Bush confessed that he fears
Democratic crossovers might hurt him on Saturday. ``I just don't
want Democrats coming in to vote against me because they think my
opponent will be easier to beat in November,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Casting net for a nominee
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's weekend of ``wrestlemania'' is turning to
talk of nominating a Republican, John McCain, in the presidential
race as Reform Party leaders search for instant stability and
credibility. ``He sounds more like a Reform Party candidate than
anyone else running,'' said Rhode Island chairman Victor Moffitt.
``He would be a perfect candidate for our party.'' McCain said he
would accept the Reform nomination _ but only after he had won the
Republican nomination as well.
</P>
<P>
   A `boldness' push toward Super Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   Visiting his native state Missouri for the second time in a week
_ and just 22 days before the Super Tuesday primaries _ Bill
Bradley said his plans for health care, education and gun control
go far beyond what Al Gore proposes. The difference between the
two, Bradley said in Kansas City, is the difference between
boldness and timidity.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know what what we think of the media
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has discovered a new way to demonize John McCain:
link him to the news media. Battling McCain's swell in the polls
and the so-called ``media swoon'' that surrounds him, Bush now
suggests in speeches that a victory by McCain, and the
campaign-finance reform that could result, would empower the media
to pick future presidents. ``If we restrict the individual
participation,'' Bush said in South Carolina, ``guess who's going
to be making the decision? TV and newspapers. I don't particularly
like my chances if they make the decision. I like when the people
are all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Nip and tuck to the wire
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is seen by likely voters in South Carolina's
Republican primary Saturday as less influenced by special interest
groups, while George W. Bush is seen as more likely to carry out a
conservative agenda, says a new poll. A new Los Angeles Times poll
shows the race in a virtual dead heat: Bush by 42-40 percent. The
poll (3 percentage point margin of error) included 55 percent
Republicans, 27 percent independents and 18 percent Democrats in
its sample of 1,047, the same breakdown as those who voted in
state's 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The wages of negativity
</P>
<P>
   Negative advertisements seem to be effective _ in helping the
candidate being attacked. The Los Angeles Times poll showed that 70
percent of the Republicans surveyed said they had seen negative
campaign advertisements. But 64 percent of that group said the ads
made them react more negatively to the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Big ad blitz in California
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before California's presidential primaries, the
Republican candidates are launching aggressive television
advertising efforts. John McCain began advertising Friday in Los
Angeles and expanded to the rest of the state on Tuesday. George W.
Bush opened his California effort Tuesday. Both campaigns declined
to provide ad budgets or specific markets where the ads will run.
Bush's effort will cost more than $1 million in coming days.
McCain's is certain to cost less.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget Libertarians
</P>
<P>
   Harry Browne thinks government has been a flop, and he wants to
do away with most of it. So he's running for president. The
Libertarian presidential candidate announced his second bid for the
White House. The 66-year-old investment adviser from Nashville,
thinks government has failed. His solution: a 12-step program that
eliminates income taxes, Social Security, the war on drugs, federal
welfare and a lot of other things Washington does. Browne contends
the climate is ripe for his insurgent message.

`BEAUTY' LEADS BUNCHED-UP OSCAR PACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' looked good to Oscar Tuesday, emerging with
eight nominations to lead the field in the 72d Oscar derby _ but
not by much in a bunched-up year with no top-heavy favorites. ``The
Cider House Rules'' and ``The Insider'' got seven nominations each.
``The Sixth Sense,'' perhaps karmically, got six.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the best-picture nominees are more relevant than
usual this year. All but one are linked to sociopolitical issues.
``American Beauty'' depicts a suburban American dream curdling in
family dysfunction. ``The Cider House Rules'' has a
pro-abortion-rights component. ``The Green Mile'' is an
anti-capital-punishment film. ``The Insider'' goes after big
tobacco. Only ``The Sixth Sense,'' with its story of a boy haunted
by ghosts, is not tied to current events.
</P>
<P>
   In another sense, though, the best-picture nominees represent a
tilt toward the conventional and the safe. After a few years of
demonstrating openness to new ways of filmmaking, the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts &AMP; Sciences largely bypassed films with a wide
appeal to younger audiences. These range from the highly original
``Being John Malkovich,'' with its Alice in Wonderland treatment of
celebrity culture, to ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' an edgy
throwback to the sleek Hollywood glamour of old, but with a young
cast and a felonious protagonist. Nominating the song ``Blame
Canada'' from ``South Park'' will go only so far to accommodate the
anti-establishment sentiments of younger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The likely square-off in the best-actor category figures to be
between Kevin Spacey's diamond-brilliant suburbanite in
self-destruct mode and Denzel Washington's strongly internalized
performance as railroaded boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The
Hurricane.'' Also making the cut are Russell Crowe's whistle-blower
in ``The Insider,'' Richard Farnsworth's determined old-timer in
``The Straight Story,'' and Sean Penn's commitment-phobic jazzman
in ``Sweet and Lowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The question in the best-actress contest is whether Hilary Swank
can extend her triumphal march through the critics' awards as a
girl dangerously imitating a boy in ``Boys Don't Cry.'' The other
nominees are Annette Bening's wired suburbanite in ``American
Beauty,'' Janet McTeer's loose-cannon single mom in
``Tumbleweeds,'' Julianne Moore's conflicted Englishwoman in ``The
End of the Affair,'' and Meryl Streep's dedicated violin teacher in
``Music of the Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the toughest race to call is the best-supporting-actor
category. The nominees are Michael Caine's humane orphanage doctor
in ``Cider House Rules,'' Tom Cruise's macho motivational speaker
in ``Magnolia,'' Michael Clarke Duncan's death-row inmate with
supernatural powers in ``The Green Mile,'' Jude Law's golden boy in
``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' and Haley Joel Osment as the boy who
sees the dead in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie's charismatic sociopath in ``Girl, Interrupted''
gives the best-supporting-actress category the closest thing the
entire Oscar derby has to a heavy favorite. Also contending in this
category are Toni Collette's anguished mom in ```The Sixth Sense,''
Catherine Keener's edgy entrepreneur in ``Being John Malkovich,''
Samantha Morton's mute waif in ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' and Chloe
Sevigny's small-town romantic from the wrong side of the tracks in
``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the slate of best-director nominees parallels the
best-picture candidates, but not totally. Nominated are Sam Mendes
(``American Beauty''), Lasse Hallstrom (``Cider House Rules''),
Michael Mann (``The Insider''), and M. Night Shamalayan (``The
Sixth Sense''). Although ``The Green Mile'' was nominated, its
director, Frank Darabont, was bypassed in favor of Spike Jonze,
whose ``Being John Malkovich'' was shut out of the best-picture
category.
</P>
<P>
   These discrepancies can be accounted for by the fact that each
discipline within the Academy nominates its respective slates.
Directors nominate directors, actors nominate actors, etc. But the
entire membership of approximately 5,300 determines the
best-picture nominees. Not surprisingly, given the membership
overlap, the Academy's directing slate closely parallels that for
the Directors Guild of America awards. The only difference is that
the guild nominated Darabont while the Academy chose Hallstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Screen Actors Guild award candidates closely
parallels the Academy picks. The best-actress slates are identical.
The SAG chose Jim Carrey and Philip Seymour Hoffman in place of
Academy nominees Penn and Farnsworth. The supporting-actor list is
identical except for Chris Cooper being given the nod over Law. The
only difference in the respective supporting-actress lists is
Morton (Academy) displacing Moore (SAG). The Directors Guild awards
and SAG awards are considered the most accurate harbingers of the
Oscar vote.
</P>
<P>
   As for questionable omissions, one can point to, in addition to
the ``Being John Malkovich'' best-picture snub, the lack of
recognition afforded several outstanding performers, most notably
Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose work in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
``Magnolia,'' and ``Flawless'' has drawn praise from many quarters.
Equally, one can question the almost perennial omission of the
sterling Chris Cooper, who added much to ``American Beauty' and
``October Sky.'' And clearly Matt Damon's opportunist in ``Mr.
Ripley'' did not charm the Academy.
</P>
<P>
   It even can be argued that Moore was nominated for the wrong
film, that her work in ``An Ideal Husband,'' ``Magnolia,'' and ``A
Map of the World'' surpassed that in the well-crafted but
unremittingly soggy ``End of the Affair.'' Such other innovative
and venturesome films as ``Election,'' ``Magnolia'' (except for
Cruise), and ``Topsy-Turvy'' are relegated to long-shot status in
the screenplay categories.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of omissions, the Academy stuck to what now amounts to
a tradition of refusing to recognize America's most important maker
of nonfiction films for the last decade, Errol Morris. His current
film, ``Mr. Death,'' is nowhere to be seen on a list of
best-documentary nominees that includes the deservedly popular
``Buena Vista Social Club'' and four others: ``Genghis Blues,''
``On the Ropes,'' ``One Day in September,'' and ``Speaking in
Strings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to scope out the foreign film category, since
only one of the nominees has as yet been distributed _ Pedro
Almodovar's superb ``All About My Mother.'' The other nominees:
``Caravan'' (Nepal), ``East-West'' (France), ``Solomon and Gaenor''
(United Kingdom) and ``Under the Sun'' (Sweden). The Oscars will be
dished out Sunday, March 26, and televised on ABC.

COUNTING ON THE CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's poetic when the Statue of Liberty inscription asks after
the huddled masses. But when the Census Bureau asks, too many
people don't answer. The national head count _ which informs major
decisions such as where federal dollars go and how legislative
districts are drawn _ falters.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the bureau with three jobs: convincing people that
the census is important, guaranteeing their information will be
kept private, and cracking down on the growing problem of
undercounting people, including the homeless, undocumented
immigrants, children, transients, and those in jails, nursing
homes, and convents.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough to sell confidence in the government. But the census
has a good record. During World War II, when the Census Bureau was
asked for the names of Japanese-Americans, the bureau, in the words
of Boston regional director Arthur Dukakis, said, ``No way.'' The
answer was the same during 1950 White House renovations, when the
Secret Service asked for information about people in a neighborhood
where President Truman was planning to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has hired an advertising company and will run paid
ads and public service announcements nationwide. More impressive
are its partnerships with community organizations around the
country to promote the census.
</P>
<P>
   One local partner is the Massachusetts Immigrant &AMP; Refugee
Advocacy Coalition, which will hold a summit of leaders next week
to discuss outreach in the immigrant community. The coalition is
also appealing to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
suspend raids while census data is being collected.
</P>
<P>
   The INS will be issuing guidelines for the census soon. There
are few specifics, but officials say that, within limits, the INS
will probably ``minimize any activity'' that could disrupt
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Given the $7 billion cost of the census, this kind of
cooperation from community and government agencies is invaluable.
It should help make the 2000 Census more successful and pave the
way for even more accurate counts in the future.

KOHL'S PARTY FINED $21 MILLION IN FINANCING SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Formally rebuking Helmut Kohl, the speaker of the
German Parliament on Tuesday imposed a devastating $21 million fine
on the former chancellor's Christian Democratic party for accepting
illegal financing.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, announced by the Social Democratic speaker, Wolfgang
Thierse, is the largest in the history of the federal republic and
amounts to a direct challenge to the existence of the party that
has governed this country for most of the postwar years.
</P>
<P>
   Matthias Wissmann, the treasurer of the Christian Democratic
Union, said the party's ability to compete would be ``badly
damaged'' and announced that the party would challenge the ruling
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Democracy is the only mass conservative movement in
Germany. The party's travails have raised widespread concern at a
time when the attraction of the extreme right has been illustrated
by the rise of Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party financing law applies to all parties equally,''
Thierse said Tuesday. ``Respect for the law is the basis of our
democracy. There are no provisions in the law for words of honor,
especially when they are in violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement amounted to an extraordinarily direct rebuke of
Kohl, who has insisted that his ``word of honor'' precludes him
from revealing the names of the anonymous donors who gave him the
$1 million he has admitted taking illegally when he was chancellor
from 1982 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German constitution, the basis of the postwar
construction of a country governed by the rule of law after the
ravages of Nazism, the sources of party financing must be revealed.
Kohl has in effect placed himself above the constitution to which
he repeatedly swore allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff between the two men was imbued with added drama by
the fact that Thierse, a Social Democrat like Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, is an East German who lived most of his life under
communism before Kohl acted decisively to achieve unification in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The absorption of the east by the west has always been portrayed
in Germany as the triumph of a western system, based in the rule of
law, over an arbitrary and cruel communist apparatus in which
individual rights were flouted.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Thierse's zeal evidently reflects his personal outrage
at Kohl's apparent contempt for the values that the West German
victory was supposed to represent. ``All people are created equal
before the law,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the $1 million that Kohl has admitted accepting for
the party, the Christian Democrats have acknowledged receiving tens
of millions of dollars in illegal payments, some from hidden bank
accounts in Switzerland, some from anonymous donors. The party
branch in the state of Hesse has appeared most guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, 69, has recently disappeared from public view and has not
appeared in Parliament since November. He was forced to resign as
honorary chairman of the Christian Democrats last month and is
under mounting pressure to give up his seat in Parliament and to
quit the party altogether.
</P>
<P>
   His domestic humiliation after distinguished achievements
internationally has prompted repeated comparisons with the fate of
Richard Nixon, but as yet Kohl appears determined to fight his
accusers and to remain in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a deputy chairman of the party, Christian Wulff, said
it might be necessary to sue Kohl in order to guarantee the
financial survival of the party. But whether to proceed will
require a sensitive political decision because the ``chancellor of
German unification'' remains a popular figure among some Christian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Merkel, the general secretary of the Christian Democrats,
said that the party would solicit donations from its 600,000
members and other supporters to meet its financial needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad day for German Christian Democracy,'' she said.
``We deserve no pity and do not expect any from the public.'' The
party has already canceled one of two scheduled national congresses
this year and is considering scaling back its lavish new
headquarters in Berlin in order to save money.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel is one of a younger generation of Christian Democrats who
have been outraged by Kohl, and she has emerged as a possible
replacement for the current party leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, who
has himself admitted taking illegal cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fine announced Tuesday, about $18 million must be paid by
March 20. The balance will be retained from money that would have
been transferred to the Christian Democrats this year under the
German system that provides for state funding of political parties.
Private contributions supplement this state funding.
</P>
<P>
   Thierse suggested that further fines could follow. ``There are
still many questions to be answered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acted Tuesday under a law that gives the speaker of the
Parliament the power to punish a party for accepting undeclared _
and therefore illegal _ financing. For each mark a party receives
illegally, three marks in state support may be deducted.
</P>
<P>
   Because Thierse decided on a fine that was severe but well below
the amount he might theoretically have imposed, it was unclear on
what basis the promised Christian Democratic legal battle against
the penalty would be fought.

<P>
   Tuesday's decision by the Irish Republican Army to withdraw from
formal talks on disarmament has damaged prospects for a permanent
political settlement in Northern Ireland. While the IRA refusal to
give up its weapons means that the Northern Irish Assembly will
have to remain in suspension, the British and Irish governments
need to maintain the momentum in other areas covered by the Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important of these is the Patten report, which
outlines a program to change the name and the character of the
predominantly Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary into a
nonsectarian Northern Ireland Police Service. The report should be
implemented without delay.
</P>
<P>
   The police will be sorely tested now that the peace process is
deadlocked. This was evident Tuesday when a major highway near
Lurgan was shut following a bomb scare. Police officials said they
feared an IRA split in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The latest statement comes four days after the IRA seemed ready
to make concessions on the issue of disarmament. Perhaps the curt
IRA refusal to work with the decommissioning panel was intended to
keep the movement united.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IRA, instead of talking about peace, denounces the
British government and the Ulster Unionist Party for attempting to
seek a ``military victory'' via decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British secretary of state has reintroduced the Unionist
veto by suspending the political institutions,'' the IRA said. But
the participation of the Ulster Unionist Party, largest in the
North, is essential to the success of the Good Friday Agreement.
Without a gesture on decommissioning, this party will not remain in
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments need to work closely now to
salvage the Good Friday Agreement. Unionists will have to decide
whether they wish to give the IRA a veto over the development of
political institutions that hold the promise of ending the
conflict. The IRA needs to consider whether retention of weapons is
worth the loss of lasting peace.

TREASURY PRICES DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities were down moderately
Tuesday, after a stronger-than-expected gain in industrial
production raised investor concern of further interest rate
increases by the Federal Reserve in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond fell 8/32 to 100 4/32, while its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.24 percent, up from 6.22
percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, financial markets traded in fairly narrow ranges
ahead of Humphrey-Hawkins testimony from Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve chairman, on monetary policy and the state of the
economy to Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries initially fell after the government reported that
industrial production rose 1 percent last month, while economists
had expected a 0.6 percent increase. Production rose 0.4 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``Against a background of a booming economy and an extremely
low employment rate of 4 percent, the Federal Reserve is expected
to tighten interest rates once again at its March 21 Federal Open
Market Committee meeting in order to preemptively guard against
potential inflationary pressures in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Fed was likely to maintain upward pressure on
interest rates until definitive signs of a more moderate pace of
growth emerge. ``In point of fact,'' Fine said, ``the current
spread between the two-year Treasury note and the federal funds
rate is a clear indication that the bond market is looking for an
additional 50 basis points of Fed tightenings, with a glint of
possibly more beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the main event of the week will undoubtedly be the Fed
chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on Thursday, statistical
releases will continue to highlight the torrid pace of economic
growth. Fine noted that industrial production surged a much
greater-than-expected 1 percent in January, led by very strong
advances in the production of motor vehicles, computers,
communications equipment and semiconductors. And this spurt in
production resulted in an advance in capacity utilization, which
rose 0.5 percent to a level of 81.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   January housing starts, to be released Tuesday, are likely to
fall from a jump in December, but Fine said that the current trend
in housing activity to date has shown only scant signs of decline,
and certainly is not suggestive of any imminent sharp slowdown in
overall economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Another important indicator will be Friday's release of the
consumer price index, the most quoted and perused inflation
measure. While inflation must still be characterized as benign
despite the 2.7 percent rise in the consumer price index last year,
the energy sector bears watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the structure of the American economy and behavioral
patterns regarding energy costs have changed relative to the
past,'' said Fine, ``the fact remains that rising energy costs have
not yet woven their way in the overall price structure, and while
the impact today may not be what it once was, it nevertheless
should not be dismissed.''

PEACE IN PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pain surrounding the death of Providence police officer
Cornel Young Jr. grows more acute each day. ``I wish it were me
laying in the ground right now,'' says Patrolman Michael Solitro,
one of two Providence officers who shot and killed the off-duty
Young on Jan. 28 after mistaking him for an armed suspect. ``I
really wish it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest suffering of all is endured by Young's parents.
Major Cornel Young Sr., the victim's father and the department's
highest-ranking black officer, asks only for an independent
investigation of his son's death. Foolishly, Rhode Island officials
have ignored that request.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors focus singlemindedly on the technical
aspects of their case. But they can't escape its symbolic power.
Many minority residents believe that Young's death was rooted in
the same police mindset that leads to random highway stops of black
drivers _ racial profiling. Even if the shooting proves justified
within the dangerous and confusing parameters of police work, many
citizens won't believe the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The unwillingness of Rhode Island Attorney General Sheldon
Whitehouse to seek independent observers from the ranks of national
black law enforcement officials undermines the chance to build
trust. That trust is as important as the quality of the evidence
presented to a grand jury. Without it, the risk is great that
nothing will be learned.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Edward Flynn, the former chief of the Chelsea Police, now
chief of the Arlington County Police in Virginia, thinks often
about the perils of police work. He sees a profession that is a
historic ``flashpoint for racial and social divisions.'' That's why
he sat down with his officers, in calm times, to work out a
straightforward mission statement. It reads, in part: ``We pledge
to focus our energies on smart policing strategies based on
probable cause, the judicious use of police discretion, and
partnerships with the community, while rejecting any tactics even
partly based on assumptions about race or ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Providence officials will need to find their purpose before they
find peace.

TV NOTES: WHITE AND MALE ON `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been made of that fact that the contestant pool on
America's most popular show, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' has been heavily skewed toward men.
</P>
<P>
   Less has been made of the fact _ though the show's producers are
keenly aware of it _ that while ``Millionaire'' has had a few women
make it into the contestant's chair opposite Regis Philbin, no
African-Americans have made it that far.
</P>
<P>
   Only three black entrants have even made it to the panel of 10
prospective contestants who go to the studio in New York to compete
for a chance to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   The show's executive producer, Michael Davies, said Tuesday that
he was ``incredibly frustrated'' that the system for picking
participants on the show had not yielded more black contestants. He
added that he might eventually change the selection process in some
way so that white men would not be so dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this show is pretty close to perfect television, but
what keeps it from being perfect television is that it does not
completely reflect American society,'' Davies said. He cited
comments by one recent female contestant who suggested that, as he
put it, ``The game appeals to the relentless competitiveness of
white males and their interest in trivia.''
</P>
<P>
   He was concerned enough about the phenomenon to have Philbin
address it. On the Feb. 1 show, Phibin made an appeal for ``a
little more diversity,'' saying ``everyone out there who has
thought about being on the show who isn't a white male, dial that
800 number and let's get into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the appeal has not led to any African-American's being
selected for the show.
</P>
<P>
   The show is not nearly as popular among black viewers as it is
over all. The show's rating in African-American households, 9.5, is
about 36 percent lower than the show's national average. That
rating in African-American households is still reasonably strong;
``Millionaire'' is just behind the top 20 shows in those
households. (Each rating point is worth 121,000 homes in that
group.)
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between the rating in black homes and the national
average makes it that much more likely that people seeking to
appear on the show will not be black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a little chicken-and-egg thing going,''
Davies said. ``Once we do get a contestant a lot of this may
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The system of choosing contestants begins with viewers calling
an 800 number and answering three general-knowledge questions.
About 240,000 people a day have been calling.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, about 2 percent move to the next round, in which a
small percentage are chosen through a random drawing. Those people
go through a second round of questions that narrows the group down
to 10 who are invited to the set in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said he was reluctant to change the system but conceded
that he might have to. ``The on-air appeal was a last ditch effort
before we do a thorough re-examination of the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has had his staff (three of whose members in the
contestant-selection department are black) ensure that ``for every
question about Tennessee Williams there's one about Langston
Hughes; for every one about Peter Frampton there's one about Ice-T
and Ice Cube.''
</P>
<P>
   Final Answer: Ratings
</P>
<P>
   The presence of ``Millionaire'' has made ABC a prohibitive
favorite to win the current February sweep rating contest. And the
network is all but a shoo-in to win for total number of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the contest that both ABC and NBC consider most
important, for viewers from 18 to 49, NBC is putting up a real
fight, so much so that each network is calling up reserves and
secret weapons in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has already added three extra editions of ``Millionaire,''
and NBC executives have said that ABC will simply add as many as it
needs to ensure a sweeps win. But ABC seems to be getting at least
slightly reluctant to throw ``Millionaire'' into every breach,
perhaps not wanting to exhaust its appeal and perhaps because it
would like to win without having its victory credited solely to
``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is using expensive box office hit movies like ``Liar Liar''
and ``Ransom,'' running the films twice in the same week to fill
weak spots on its schedule. NBC is relying heavily on what has
become that network's truly golden oldie, the police drama ``Law
and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   That series, hotter than it has ever been, had another high
rating last week, helped NBC nose past ABC for the week among the
18-to-49-year-old viewers (even with three ``Millionaires''
broadcast).
</P>
<P>
   NBC has already spawned a second weekly dose of positive ratings
from ``Law and Order'' in the spin-off ``Special Victims Unit,''
which has been edging toward hit status on Friday nights. This week
NBC is going for a triple header of ``Law and Order,'' with the
usual edition tomorrow night followed by a special cross-over
edition of ``Law and Order'' on Friday night at 9 whose story will
be completed on ``Special Victims Unit'' at 10.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is also showing a lack of faith in the new comedy ``Stark
Raving Mad'' by pulling that series this week on Thursday and
inserting a repeat of ``Frasier'' at 9:30 p.m. NBC wants to
maximize the lead-in to ``E.R.'' which expects a big payoff on its
plot line, which left two of its characters near death last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although NBC is still discounting any chance to beat ABC this
month, it has one unpredictable weapons left: the mini-series ``The
10th Kingdom,'' which will run 3 of its 5 parts inside the sweep
period. NBC seemed to be sending a message by scheduling it so deep
into the sweep. But some early reviews have been good. If it is an
unexpected hit, NBC might yet force some more ``Millionaires'' out
of ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schulz
</P>
<P>
   In other significant ratings stories from last week, ``60
Minutes'' had its best rating in a year because of a snap decision
by its executive producer, Don Hewitt, to replay a profile of
Charles Schulz the day the news of his death broke.
</P>
<P>
   And A&AMP;E made a record of its own with its commissioned edition
of the detective series ``Poirot.'' The first of two new
``Poirots,'' called ``The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,'' was the
highest-rated ``Poirot'' episode ever on that network.

TRUSTING THE BIG DIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional critics of Boston's Central Artery project feel
blindsided by the sudden $1.4 billion addition to the project's
estimated cost. Still, there is no reason to take back federal
money already approved.
</P>
<P>
   By rights, Washington should even contribute part of the
additional cost, as the major overruns connected with this crucial
interstate highway project are amply justified.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress and the Federal Highway Administration will
understandably have no interest in putting treasure where they have
no trust.
</P>
<P>
   So it is up to Governor Paul Cellucci and Turnpike Chairman
James Kerasiotes to give assurances that there will be no more
billion-dollar surprises and that the state will do what it takes
to complete the work.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci did little to advance that cause Tuesday with the
release of a jerry-built $1.46 billion finance plan. While the
proposal would have the state provide more than the turnpike _ a
healthy change from the original position that the turnpike would
do it alone _ the figures still do not engender confidence. Only
$60 million would come from accelerated toll increases, while the
rest would rely on accounting strategies and massive borrowing _
some of it extending 50 years. Passing the burden on to our
children is bad enough; passing it on to our grandchildren makes no
sense at all. By then, they may be borrowing funds to maintain the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The equitable way to raise most of the money needed for the
Artery and other road projects around the state is to increase the
state gas tax. Until that or another credible proposal is approved,
officials in Washington and Boston will continue to express
legitimate doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the Senate Ways and Means Committee approved only a
month's funding for the project in an effort to force a remedy. At
the same time, it advanced planning for the surface restoration,
reminding everyone that this project will provide enormous benefits
above ground and below, if Cellucci can earn the trust to do it
right.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: L'Amie Donia's Dishes Warm Winter's Hearth   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Rabbit with Whole Grain Mustard is a rustic dish
created by Donia Bijan, chef/owner of L'Amie Donia in Palo Alto.
Few cooks have such deft hand with these hearth-warming dishes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She calls her food  &LR; a la bonne femme &LR; , which translates to warm,
nurturing combinations such as the rabbit. The generous use of
mustard and rosemary certainly isn't subtle but they add a burst of
flavor that's just right on cool, damp nights. The dish is served
with pasta so that none of the delicious mustard and rosemary sauce
will go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   As you'll discover, Bijan cooks the type of food that you just
can't quit eating. But if you find yourself with leftovers, it also
warms up well for another meal.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, Bijan also cooks other robust dishes such as
a delightful tongue salad; rich onion soup; house-made charcuterie;
skate in brown butter; and coq au vin. Little wonder she's
considered by many to be the best chef on the Peninsula.

SECRETS OF SUCCESS

<P>
   &UR; _ The mustard and rosemary. &LR;  Some cooks might be tempted to
skimp on these two very assertive ingredients, but that would be a
mistake. When smoothed with cream and combined with the rabbit and
pasta, the flavors mellow.

<P>
   &UR; _ The liver. &LR;  Although it's optional, this addition adds a
rich, earthy flavor to the dish.

 &LR; ROAST RABBIT WITH WHOLE-GRAIN MUSTARD SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 rabbit livers, cut into 1/4-inch pieces (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole-grain mustard
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   5 roasted garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds fettuccine, or other pasta of choice
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

</P>
<P>
   In the same skillet, saute the livers until browned, about 3 to
5 minutes. Transfer the livers to a plate and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Completely coat the rabbit pieces with 1 cup of the mustard.
Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the rosemary. Gently pour the wine
around the rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Bake uncovered until the rabbit is tender, about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the rabbit to a platter. Tent with foil to keep warm.
Pour the pan juices into a large saucepan. Place over high heat and
boil until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Whisk in the cream,
roasted garlic, the remaining 1 cup mustard and 2 tablespoons

   Reduce heat and simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat
the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until
tender but still firm to the bite. Drain. Add the pasta to the pan
with the mustard sauce. Toss to coat.

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods. 
 
 BEST WAY: Roasting Garlic   By Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Garlic is generally chopped, minced, or pressed
and sauteed or simmered to provide distinctive flavor and aroma,
but roasting garlic mellows its flavor. We tested 15 methods of
roasting garlic to determine which was best.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In our tests, we used various oven temperatures. We roasted
whole untrimmed heads of garlic, whole heads of garlic with the
tops trimmed off and garlic that had been separated into cloves. We
also roasted the garlic wrapped in foil and with no wrapping, as
well as on top of the stove. We even tried a ceramic garlic
roaster/baker.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning, we drizzled each medium-size head of garlic
with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. In the first test _ the oven at 275
degrees _ we roasted six heads: whole and untrimmed, whole and
trimmed, and separated into cloves. Each version was roasted
wrapped and unwrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Most Chronicle Food staff members liked the spreadable
consistency of the trimmed whole head roasted in a foil packet.
However, a few thought the garlic flavor was too mild.
</P>
<P>
   A higher oven temperature _ 400 degrees _ produced better
results. This time, the individual, unpeeled and wrapped cloves
were the favorite, with the whole, wrapped head a close second.
Both versions had a spreadable consistency and sweet, mellow
flavor. But one staff member felt the garlic was too mild. The
taste for the bulb's pungency, it seems, is a highly personal one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. (You can also bake it at 350
degrees, if roasting something else at that temperature, as in the
rabbit recipe on this page.) Separate 1 medium-sized head of garlic
into cloves, removing the outer loose, papery skin but leaving the
cloves unpeeled. Center the cloves in the middle of a piece of
double-thickness aluminum foil. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil
over the cloves and fold the ends of the foil together securely,
forming a small packet. Roast 30 to 40 minutes, or until the cloves
are soft. Squeeze the pulp into a small bowl. Makes about 2
tablespoons.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; APPEALING ALTERNATIVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If oven space is unavailable or you need your garlic in a hurry,
pour about 3 tablespoons of olive oil into a small saute pan over
medium-low heat. When oil is hot, add separated, unpeeled cloves
and cook, turning occasionally, until softened, about 15 to 20
minutes. The oil should cover a third or more of the cloves. These
cloves had good, balanced garlic flavor with some nutty overtones.
</P>
<P>
   A second alternative is to use a ceramic garlic roaster/baker.
Following the instructions, we soaked the ceramic baker, put in a
trimmed garlic head drizzled with olive oil, and placed the baker
in a cold oven. We turned the oven on to 350 degrees and left it in
for one hour. We were pleasantly surprised at the good results _
very similar to the Best Way without having to deal with the
individual cloves.

FULL-FARE PASSENGERS ON TWA FLIGHTS TO GET MORE LEG ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is becoming a blessing to the knees of frequent fliers
everywhere, a third major airline will announce Thursday that it
will expand leg room for coach travelers who pay full fare.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines will formally unveil its First Up program
which guarantees a first-class seat for anyone who buys a full fare
domestic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is the third major carrier in recent months to make
overtures of pampering coach passengers with more leg room. Full
paying coach passengers, usually business travelers, are the
keystone to financial stability of the industry, aviation
specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The full paying coach passenger is finally getting the
attention that they deserve for all the money that they pump into
the industry,'' said Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation
Institute at George Washington University. ``They pay the bulk of
salaries and it is time they were honored for their sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   As consumer gripes rise _ the US Department of Transportation
received a record number of complaints in 1999 _ and politicians
murmered about a passenger bill of rights, the airline industry
began to respond to customer complaints by opening up cabin space.
</P>
<P>
   Last year United Airlines, the world's largest airline,
announced its Economy Plus program by expanding the seat pitch _
the distance between seats _ from 31 inches to 35 or 36 inches _ on
the first six to 11 rows of coach on its fleet. Full paying coach
passengers and frequent flyers who rack up 25,000 miles a year,
were eligible for the spacious seats.
</P>
<P>
   And this month American Airlines, the nation's second largest
airline, said it would spend some $70 million to remove more than 6
percent of the seats on its aircraft and give every seat in coach
more legroom. On MD-80s, for example, it would mean ripping out two
rows of economy seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a response to more people flying than ever before
and the number of complaints increasing as well,'' said Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   And, with an industry plagued by overcapacity, the reduction of
seats may be healthy to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very positive revenue thing for American
because the industry is in a period of very prolonged expansion and
capacity is growing faster than demand,'' said Jenkins. ``This is a
very nice way to ratchet down capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schlachter, manging director of marketing programs at
St. Louis-based TWA, said First Up is designed to entice passengers
to fly first class rather than settle for a little extra leg room.
</P>
<P>
   The program is available on all flights connecting through the
airline's St. Louis hub, and on domestic nonstops from New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport, and on two daily nonstops
from Boston to San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from my mother who said `did you see that
American is pulling out two rows of coach?','' Schlachter said.
``Well, this is a way of differentiating ourselves from the other
airlines by offering more than a little extra space.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA, Schlachter said, has an average of 20 first-class seats on
its narrow body aircraft. ``Our capacity is what enables us to make
this offer.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA was ranked as the domnestic airline with the best on time
performance for 1999, and airline officials predicted First Up will
help win back customers who have stopped flying the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this has the ability to attract people to come back
and try us,'' said Schlacter. ``Our research shows that if a person
has not flown TWA in four years, they have a negative opinion of
us, but their opinion is favorable if they have flown us in less
than four years.''

 AT THE SOURCE: Going Nuts Over a Crop   Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 ESCALON, Calif. _  Farmers' markets, says Gilbert Van Mourik, saved
his skin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He and his wife, Joanna, could barely make ends meet, raising
four children on a 35-acre farm in San Joaquin County, and growing
mostly almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1989, they decided to join the trend of taking their
produce to market themselves. It proved to be one of the best moves
they ever made. It's a 21/2-hour trek from Escalon to the three
downtown San Francisco farmers' markets _ Tuesday and Saturday at
Ferry Plaza, Wednesday at Civic Center _ but it guarantees the
family a decent return on their investment in cash and labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Van Mourik says with a chuckle, ``we can pay the
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The product that especially helped boost the bottom line is
flavored almonds, which constitute about 15 percent of their crop.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's market stand resembles a healthy candy store:
roasted almonds, of course, but also the best-selling orange honey
almonds, honey cinnamon, garlic-onion (second most popular),
hickory, plain honey with a touch of salt, and raspberry.
</P>

   The raspberry ones, Van Mourik admits, are artificially
flavored, but the orange almonds are the genuine article, flavored
with orange rind and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The almonds, processed in a professional kitchen near the
orchar the mainstay of the family business, although the Van
Mouriks also grow and sell walnuts, pistachios, peaches and
nectarines, and are just starting to cultivate table grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Van Mourik says his operation does not qualify for organic
certification, ``but we have changed a lot; there is hardly anymore
spraying being done.'' He still uses commercial fertilizer because
he says the natural stuff _ manure _ contains too much salt for
almond growing.
</P>
<P>
   Van Mourik learned a great deal about the chemistry of farm
practices working for a Shell agricultural research facility in
Modesto for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Van Mouriks were born and raised in Rotterdam, Holland's
second-largest city and one of Europe's busiest sea ports but
hardly a farming stronghold. However, toward the end of World War
II, Van Mourik's family sent their children to the countryside
since the city was the target of heavy bombing raids. Here the
little city boy discovered plowing and sowing and raising animals.
``I learned to milk cows _ everything. And it got in my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he eventually became an iron worker and ship builder, Van
Mourik returned to farm country whenever he could. When he
emigrated to the United States, he and his wife went to Los
Angeles, but found the city not to their liking. They made their
way north to San Joaquin County, where they started their farming
career with 15 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the appeal of rural life, the area had another draw
for the immigrant couple: It is home to a large Dutch community.
Some families, Van Mourik reports, have been in the area since
World War I and have firmly established old-country traditions.
``In Ripon (13 miles from Escalon), there are five large Dutch
churches,'' he says, and, on the culinary side of culture, ``there
is even a fellow who makes Gouda cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Van Mourik almonds are sold at the downtown San Francisco &LR; 
 &LR; farmers' markets for $5 for plain roasted, $6 for flavored. &LR;

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: Labeling Issue Gains Momentum for Inclusion on 
 November Ballot   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Supporters of an initiative that would require all
genetically altered food sold in California to carry identifying
labels should be out in force at farmer's markets and grocery
stores during the next couple of weeks. They're hoping to collect
413,000 signatures by the end of the month to get the initiative on
the November ballot.
<P>
   If the proposal becomes law, California would be the first state
to require manufacturers to identify packaged foods containing
crops or animals that have undergone certain DNA modification or
have had transplants of genetic material from other species.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma Valley organic farmer Robert Cannard, who is leading the
petition drive, admits the effort has a certain quixotic quality to
it. As of last week, less than 200,000 signatures had been
collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a constant stream of envelopes with one or two
petition sheets on it that show up in the mailbox every day,'' he
says. ``It's a horse race and I hear it's been 20 years since an
all-volunteer effort has made it onto the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative asks that the phrase, ``Produced With Genetically
Engineered Ingredients,'' be printed just above the product's
ingredient list. How the law would be enforced, what it would cost
manufacturers and when it would go into effect would be hashed out
by the legislature and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Cannard says, efforts like California's and similar
petition drives that are just starting to sprout in Washington and
Oregon will eventually lead to a federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the petition doesn't qualify for the ballot, Cannard is
philosophical about the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way, at least we've been getting this into people's
awareness and consciousness.''

   &UR; Salmonella Rates Drop &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention credits an effort
to educate people about the dangers of raw or undercooked eggs for
a big drop in the rate of salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued earlier this month, the CDC said the
percentage of salmonella cases contracted by consuming raw or
undercooked eggs dropped by more than one-third between 1996 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers aren't sure why, the egg-related salmonella
infection rate jumped in the 1980s and '90s from 0.6 cases per
100,000 people in 1976 to 3.6 in 1996. But the rate fell to 2.2 per
100,000 from 1996 to 1998. Still, because cases often go
unreported, no one is sure how many people contract salmonella
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps and
chills. Most people recover quickly, but the illness can be highly
toxic or even fatal for infants, the elderly and those with
weakened immune systems.

IRA BREAKS WITH PEACE PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Accusing Britain of using the peace process to achieve
a military victory, the Irish Republican Army Tuesday broke off
contact with the international commission overseeing the disarming
of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant statement blaming the British government and Ulster
Unionists for the current crisis, the IRA also said it was
withdrawing offers it had made to the commission, including its
willingness to eventually put its weapons ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   While not entirely unexpected, the IRA's statement marked the
latest setback to the peace process, which was dealt a severe blow
last Friday when Britain suspended the power-sharing government in
Northern Ireland just 72 days after it was inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes as the British and Irish governments, partners in
promoting the peace process, seek to heal a growing rift over the
significance of the IRA's pledge to eventually disarm. Dublin
officials thought the IRA's last-minute pledge last Friday to put
its weapons ``beyond use'' if certain political conditions apply
was enough of a concession to avert suspending the power-sharing
government.
</P>
<P>
   But British Secretary of State Peter Mandelson triggered the
government suspension despite Dublin's appeals, saying the IRA's
offer was still too vague to prevent the Ulster Unionists from
walking out of the assembly and collapsing it. Mandelson said
suspension was preferable to outright collapse.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, are scheduled to meet Wednesday in an attempt to
repair that rift and get the two governments back on the same page
as they try to get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the IRA focused its criticism on Britain with
what it called London's biased siding with the Ulster Unionists,
who represent most Protestants in Northern Ireland. It said
Mandelson had ``reintroduced the unionist veto by suspending the
political institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a compromise hammered out last November by George
Mitchell, the former US senator from Maine, the IRA agreed to enter
into disarmament talks only if the political institutions created
under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 were put in place. The IRA
said the suspension of the power-sharing assembly and cross-border
authorities that gave Dublin a say in the affairs of Northern
Ireland ``has changed the context in which we appointed a
representative to meet with the (disarmament commission) and has
created a deeper crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA statement continued: ``Both the British government and
the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party have rejected the
propositions put to the (disarmament commission) by our
representative. They obviously have no desire to deal with the
issue of arms except on their own terms. Those who seek a military
victory in this way need to understand that this cannot and will
not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he was disappointed by the IRA's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is a time when all channels need to be kept
open,'' he said. ``What was on the table had real potential and
people will be sad it could not be worked on and developed in the
way that is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he reluctantly signed the papers which restored
direct rule from London because the IRA had refused to specifically
commit itself to disarming. He said he wanted to avert a walkout by
Ulster Unionists over the weapons stalemate which would have
collapsed the Belfast assembly and made it more difficult to start
up again.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament commission, headed by Canadian Gen. John de
Chastelain, had said the IRA's commitment ``holds out the real
prospect of an agreement which would enable it to fulfill the
substance of its mandate,'' meaning that the IRA would rid itself
of weapons by May.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's representative to the commission, which sources
identify as Brian Keenan, a member of the IRA's 7-member ruling
Army Council, outlined to the commission ``the context in which the
IRA will initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond use,
in a manner as to ensure maximum public confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mandelson, while praising the IRA's commitment to eventually
disarm as a basis on which to build the confidence necessary to
reestablish the power-sharing government, said it remained too
vague and too conditional.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: You Can Lick Haagen-Dazs, but You Can't Beat It   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  After all those Valentine's Day chocolates, do you
need a chocolate fix of the low-fat variety? Chocolate sorbet may
fill the bill. But some are more satisfying than others.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted six chocolate sorbets, which ranged in fat
from 0 to 2 grams. One brand far outranked the others. Panelists'
major complaints were that many of the sorbets had either a burned
chocolate flavor or not enough flavor. Grainy texture was another
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's favorite was  &UR; Haagen-Dazs &LR;  (1 pint, $3.09-$3.29 at
many supermarkets). All of the panelists raved about the chocolate
flavor, describing it as creamy and well balanced. The panel also
liked the smooth, silky texture. All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Rankings dropped significantly after first place, but the best
of the rest was  &UR; Safeway Select &LR;  (1 pint, $2.69 at Safeway).
Panelists were split on this sorbet. Some liked the chocolate
flavor, but one described it as tasting ``raw and uncooked.'' Some
panelists also found the texture too grainy. Two would buy it, two
might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to  &UR; Ben &AMP; Jerry's Devil's Food &LR;  (1 pint,
$3.19-$3.29 at many supermarkets), which featured swirls of dark
and light chocolate sorbet. One panelist thought the two chocolate
flavors were well balanced, but two detected strong notes of
vanilla that tasted artificial. Three tasters also complained about
a grainy, gummy texture. Three might buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Double Rainbow &LR;  (1 pint, $2.59-$3.39 at many supermarkets) came
in fourth. Three panelists liked the intense chocolate flavor, but
one said it was ``ruined by the bad texture.'' One panelist liked
the appearance, but described the flavor as ``poor.'' One would buy
it, one might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Cascadian Farms and 365 (Whole Foods
brand), but they ranked too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Lynne Bennett, California Culinary graduate; John
P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin, culinary director,
Center for Culinary Development; Lesli Neilson, Chronicle staff
writer; and Roland Passot, chef-owner of La Folie in San Francisco
and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park. All products are tasted
blind. &QL;

 WINE POTPOURRI: Is It Too Old or Just Right?   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Back in the days of romantic winespeak, it was
common for an ardent wine lover to proclaim, ``Wine is a living
thing,'' meaning there's something alive inside a bottle of wine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wine is great, but not that great. Chemical changes, in concert
with oxygenation, do occur with most wines, causing them to either
improve or deteriorate. The specific chemical alterations of a
wine, in barrel or bottle, are involved and complicated. And
although oxygen is essential in the development of wine, it is only
when the limits are exceeded that oxygenation becomes a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few people age wine more than a couple of years. This is
especially true for white wines, although certain Rieslings and
Chardonnays will age. The question for the wine consumer is whether
the young and fresh wine is preferable to the aged, oxidized wine.
</P>
<P>
   An oxidized white wine is easier to see than an oxidized red
wine. Excessive exposure to air will cause the color of a wine to
turn brown. This advanced stage of oxidation sometimes is called
Maderization, or when a browning wine resembles in color a wine of
Madeira. An oxidized or Maderized wine will smell musty and might
have a woody taste if excessive oxygenation has occurred because
the wine was left too long in barrel or cask.
</P>
<P>
   Red wines also will ``go over the hill,'` but usually it's more
difficult to tell by sight. Tilting a half-full glass of red wine
so you can see a thin edge of wine allows a truer assessment of the
color. Youthful red wine is purple-red or a bright ruby color. With
age, the edges of the wine take on an orange to yellow-brown tint,
eventually a brick-red color. Brick is old but healthy; brown is
old and decrepit.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet Sauvignon, like the 1995 Napa Cabernets in The
Chronicle's Wine Selections (see box, this page), are wines that
will take bottle aging  &LR; if  &LR; they have the right stuff.
Sledge-hammer tannins usually are so brutal they never soften or
allow the wine's fruit to come through. An age-worthy red wine also
needs plenty of primary fruit and good acidity. The balance you
hear so much about is fruit-tannins-acidity together in a
harmonious package.
</P>
<P>
   So when does a Cabernet need a cane? The best answer lies within
the individual taster. Soft fruit, supple tannins and an elusive
sweetness are nectar to some people, while others will say the wine
has lost its edge.
</P>
<P>
   Red wines periodically listed on this page as ``Collector's
Wines'' are ones that have a few years of bottle age and are either
holding on their drinking plateau, or will improve further with a
few more years in the bottle.

   &UR; Another Mystery Shattered &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the great pleasures of life is traveling through Ireland
and ending each day in a cozy pub with a pint of drawn Guinness
stout. Dark and mysterious with a thick dense head that looks like
chocolate whipped cream, Guinness is the liquid staff of life, at
least in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes a report from the University of New South Wales
in Sydney, Australia, that claims to answer the nagging question of
why the bubbles in a glass of Guinness go down instead of up.
</P>
<P>
   Using computational fluid dynamics software from Fluent Inc., in
Michigan, a research team simulated the motion of the bubbles and
discovered that most do move upwards. But liquid rising in the
center of the glass moves toward the wall of the glass and turns
downward, dragging bubbles with it. I was never good at physics and
the full explanation made my head hurt.
</P>
<P>
   I am happy the researchers solved that mystery, but now they
need to discover why, when you stamp the name of the pub in the top
of the head of a pint of Guinness, the name is still clearly
visible when the full head is resting on the bottom of the empty
glass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sydney Competition &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many people consider wine a food, and while that may be a
stretch for some, most would agree that the best setting for wine
is with food. But to taste more than 200 wines with food is a
logistical challenge successfully pulled off by just one wine
competition _ the Sydney (Australia) International.
</P>
<P>
   I was among the panel of judges from four countries that tasted
more than 1,220 entries from 15 countries. The entries were
eventually narrowed to 200 from which the top 100 wines were
selected. This was my second Sydney International and it was a
grueling but valuable learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   Competition Director Warren Mason and his wife, chef Jacquie
Mason, are now taking the Top 100 Wines from the competition on the
road to other cities in Australia and then to New Zealand, London
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Masons and the Top 100 Wines from the Sydney International
Wine Competition will be exhibited at Campton Place Hotel in San
Francisco on May 9, followed by a Degustation Dinner on May 10.

   Vermouth is a fortified white or red wine flavored with a
mixture of aromatic herbs, spices and fruits. The word vermouth is
from the German wermut, the name of a plant known as wormwood in
English. Since wormwood has a bitter taste, vermouth is usually
served as an aperitif. Besides wormwood (or more likely now,
quinine), vermouth is also made with gentian, angelica root,
centuary root, cloves, nutmeg and orange peel.
</P>
<P>
   White or dry vermouth is usually less sweet than red vermouth.
Among the most common brands are Italian vermouths from Martini &AMP;
Rossi, Cinzano and Stock, plus Noilly Prat, the excellent French
dry vermouth. Noilly Prat over ice with a twist of lemon _ now
there's a refreshing aperitif.

   &UR; All in a Name &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Napa's Joseph Phelps Vineyards is dropping the Vin Du Mistral
name from its Rhone-style wines because of consumer and wine trade
confusion over the name. Phelps also produces Le Mistral, a blended
red wine similar to the Rhone red wine Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Phelps
will continue to produce a full line of Rhone-style wines.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Lasagna Bubbles into the Limelight  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Happily, I have rediscovered lasagna. This
wonderful old classic has become a frequent visitor to my table.
The dish has gotten such an enthusiastic response, that I've had to
stop and wonder what's so different about lasagna? Then I figured
it out.
<P>
   Unlike spaghetti, lasagna noodles share the limelight with lots
of other ingredients: fresh vegetables, meats or poultry, special
cheeses and rich sauces. The dish is an intricate choreography of
different textures and flavors. It's like a fine work of art: it
takes time to create, but the end result is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who cooks even occasionally has some pasta in the pantry.
And not just spaghetti. The range of pasta available now is
boggling. There is orzo (rice-shape pasta), shells of different
sizes, linguine (``small tongues''), capellini (``fine hairs''),
farfalle (``butterflies''), fettuccine (``ribbons''), rigatoni
(large grooved pasta tubes), penne (``quills'') and on and on. We
seem to have adopted the Italians' passion for pasta.
</P>
<P>
   All this aside, lasagna is in a class by itself.
</P>
<P>
   I have made lasagna with both the ``oven-ready'' noodles and the
old-fashioned kind that must be briefly cooked in boiling water
before using. I think the regular noodles work best; they tend to
have a nicer texture.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Eggplant Lasagna is an appetizing combination of
eggplant, tomato sauce and cheese. Serve it with a very small
parsley salad, made with just the leaves, dressed with a little
vinegar and olive oil, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; EGGPLANT LASAGNA
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   9 lasagna noodles, about 1 pound (regular, &LR;  not &LR;  ``oven-ready''
lasagna)
</P>
<P>
   1 globe eggplant (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   21/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   4 roma tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 pint large-curd cottage cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Using your fingers, spread a
thin layer of olive oil in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 4 or 5 quarts of water into a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons
salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. When the water boils, add 1
lasagna noodle at a time to the water. When all the noodles have
been added, gently stir so they don't stick together. Reduce the
heat a little, but keep the water boiling. Boil for 10 minutes.
Using a fork, pull out a noodle and test it. If it seems soft and
pliable, the noodles are done.
</P>
<P>
   Drain off the water. Fill the pot with cold water and, using
your fingers, move the noodles around in the water so they are not
stuck to each other.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the vegetables:  &LR; Slice off and discard the stem of
the eggplant. Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise. Cut each half
eggplant lengthwise into 3 long slices. Then slice the 3 long
strips into strips 1 inch wide. Holding the strips together, cut
crosswise into 1-inch cubes. Spread the cubes out and sprinkle with
a little salt; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the stem and roots of the onion. Peel off the papery
skin. Cut the onion in half from top to bottom. Cut each half into
4 or 5 slices. Keeping the slices of each half stacked, cut the
stack crosswise into about 5 strips. Still holding the cut half
onion, chop each half into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces. Spread out the
onion pieces and season lightly with salt. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the papery outer skin from each garlic clove. Chop each
clove into small pieces and add to the onion.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out and discard the core of each tomato. Slice the tomatoes
in half lengthwise. Place the halves cut-side down on a cutting
board and cut into small cubes. Spread them out and season lightly
with salt. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet. Tilt the
pan so the oil coats the bottom. Place over medium-high heat and
add the eggplant, onion, garlic and tomatoes. Cook, stirring
constantly, for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly
cooked. Add about 11/2 cups of the tomato sauce, stir to mix well,
and cook for a couple of minutes longer. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Assembly: &LR;  Put 3 lasagna noodles side-by-side in the oiled
baking dish. Spoon a layer of vegetables over the noodles. Spread 1
cup of the cottage cheese over the vegetables. Top with 3 more
lasagna noodles. Repeat layering vegetables and cottage cheese. Top
with the remaining 3 lasagna noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil into the remaining
1/2 cup tomato sauce and spread evenly over the lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 40 minutes. The lasagna is done when the eggplant is
soft. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the optional Parmesan over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 generously.

 THE WORKING COOK: Indulge in Chicken-Noodle Soup Aromatherapy  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Taking refuge recently from some biting, stormy
weather, I lingered in a Thai noodle house in the Tenderloin,
unable to tear myself away from the warming tom yum gai. The
fragrance of galanga, kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass streaming
out of the soup bowl lifted my spirits more than any aromatherapy
treatment ever could.
<P>
   The classic combination got me in the mood to create this week's
30-Minute Main Dish _ Chicken Noodle Soup with Lemongrass and
Coconut Milk. It is a bowl full of rice noodles waiting to be
slurped up, and the broth, though rich with coconut milk, has a
citrus tang and a fragrance all its own. Best of all, it combines
elements of various Thai soups without requiring visits to five
different markets for ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Another warming winter dish is  &LR; Pasta e Fagioli &LR;  _ ``pasta and
beans.'' This version takes just 20 minutes to make.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't pasta in the al dente sense, but rather a pasta that
sits in a big pot on the back of the stove until Mamma calls
everyone in for dinner. The dish is a scaled-down minestrone,
although not as soupy, combining beans, garlic, olive oil, rosemary
and a pinch of red pepper flakes with the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid of letting the pasta get soft; it's supposed to
be about the same texture as the beans. And be sure to use
good-quality olive oil; because of the dish's simplicity, this
basic ingredient adds crucial nuances of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Jambalaya, today's third dish, is another soupy classic. This
one, with sweet shrimp and spicy sausage, borrows from various Paul
Prudhomme recipes. Although it takes a while to simmer, the actual
preparation is straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The dish is a perfect antidote for the winter dampness. So if
it's not raining when you make it, freeze some for the next time
the skies do open up.

30-MINUTE MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP WITH COCONUT MILK &AMP; LEMONGRASS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces rice stick noodles, broken into large pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless chicken breast, cut into 1/2 x 1-inch fingers
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 stalks lemongrass
</P>
<P>
   1-inch knob fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 quart chicken broth (low-salt)
</P>
<P>
   1 (15-ounce) can coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce

<P>
   1 cup bean sprouts + more for garnish
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs cilantro

hot water. Let soak while you prepare the other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Place the chicken in a bowl; drizzle with the soy sauce and stir
to coat the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Using the side of a large knife, pound the bulbous ends of the
lemongrass. Cut off the thin ends if necessary to make them fit
into a large stockpot. Peel and finely mince the ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a stockpot; add the lemongrass and ginger and
saute until fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes. Increase heat to
medium-high and add the chicken pieces. Saute, stirring constantly,
until the chicken just turns white, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, lime juice and fish sauce.
Bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the rice stick noodles and add them to the pot. Simmer
until the noodles are completely soft and the chicken is cooked
through.
</P>
<P>
   Remove and discard the lemongrass. Add the bean sprouts and heat
through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve in large bowls. Garnish with cilantro and additional bean
sprouts.

   PASTA E FAGIOLI
</P>
<P>
   Meaning simply ``pasta and beans,'' this easy version of the
traditional Southern Italian dish is meant to be soft and soupy.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound medium pasta shells or other cup-shaped pasta
</P>
<P>
   2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini or great Northern beans (or 3 cups
cooked)
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 large sprig rosemary
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus oil to drizzle on top
</P>
<P>
   Large pinch hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Before starting preparation, begin bringing a large pot of
liberally salted water to a boil for the pasta. When the water
boils, add the pasta, and begin cooking, stirring often. Allow it
to cook until softer than al dente but not falling apart. Drain,
reserving 2 cups of the pasta water.
</P>
<P>
   While the pasta cooks, drain and rinse the beans. Crush the
garlic and finely chop the rosemary needles.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add the garlic,
rosemary and pepper flakes; cook until the garlic is just golden,
about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the beans and increase the heat to
medium-low. Stir in 1/2 cup of the pasta water and season with salt
and pepper. Simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally and
crushing about half of the beans with the back of a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Return the pasta and the remaining 11/2 cups of the pasta water
to their large pot and add the beans. Bring to a boil, then remove
from the heat, cover and let sit for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a drizzle of olive oil.

   JAMBALAYA
</P>
<P>
   I used various recipes from Paul Prudhomme's ``The Prudhomme
Family Cookbook''(Morrow, 1987) as a basis for this easy version of
a New Orleans classic.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds cleaned medium-size shrimp
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   9 (about 4 pounds) andouille sausages, cut in half lengthwise
then sliced diagonally into bite-size pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 large onions, diced
</P>
<P>
   3 red bell peppers, diced
</P>
<P>
   3 green bell peppers, diced
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 (28-ounce) can chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   9 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   3 cups white rice
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Toss the shrimp with the cayenne, salt and black pepper; set
aside in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large stockpot. Add the sausage and brown over
medium-high heat, turning as necessary. Remove the sausage with a
slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the onions and saute for 5
minutes. Add the bell peppers, garlic and bay leaf and saute for 5
minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Add the tomatoes and browned sausage; bring to a simmer. Reduce
heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add 3 cups of the stock and bring to a simmer, scraping the
bottom of the pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15
minutes. Repeat with another 3 cups of stock and simmer another 15
minutes. After adding the last 3 cups of stock, simmer uncovered
for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rice and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and
cook until the rice is just tender, about 20 minutes. Add the
shrimp and remove from the heat. Cover and let sit for 10 minutes.
Stir thoroughly. If the shrimp are not completely cooked, put the
pot back on the heat and simmer a minute or two, stirring
constantly, until the shrimp just turn pink.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corporation announced Tuesday that it has
received ``several indications of interest'' from potential buyers
of the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst announcement said the company was reviewing the
proposals from the prospective buyers. The announcement didn't
identify the prospective buyers or indicate how long the review
process would last.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday marked the deadline that Hearst set last month for
prospective buyers to make their interest known.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marks the latest development in efforts by
Hearst to find a buyer for the Examiner as part of a plan announced
last Aug. 6 for Hearst to purchase the San Francisco Chronicle and
sell the Examiner. If no qualified buyer appeared, Hearst indicated
it would merge the two newspapers and close the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials promised staff members they would not lose
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice and the California attorney
general are reviewing the proposed merger to determine if it
complies with anti-trust laws. The San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, which has said it wants to preserve both newspapers,
also is examining the plan.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, the Examiner and the Chronicle were
morning rivals. But in 1965, the newspapers entered into a joint
operating agreement (JOA) under which the Examiner switched to
afternoon publication. The newspapers maintain separate news staffs
and compete for stories, but the companies share printing and
business operations and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Such arrangements were later authorized by the Newspaper
Preservation Act of 1970, a federal law aimed at preserving
newspapers that would be forced to close without relief from the
expense of head-to-head competition.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco JOA expires in 2005, but last year the owners
of the Chronicle Publishing Co. decided to sell all the company's
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department must approve the sale of the Chronicle to
Hearst. A decision is pending.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, Hearst announced that it was expanding its offer to
sell the Examiner. The expanded offer included the newspaper's
office building, delivery trucks and a printing plant, and set
Tuesday as the deadline for prospective purchasers to indicate
their interest.

BACON GETS ITS SIZZLE BACK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, N.D., S.D., Wis., Ky., N.C., Tenn., Va., Calif., La.,
Texas and Canada)   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WITTENBERG, Wis. _ Sin is in, gastronomically speaking. Which is
why I found myself pulling up to Nueske's Hillcrest Farm, about 65
miles west of Green Bay, at midmorning one crystalline day in
January, with the car's digital thermometer stuck at 5 implacable
degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   I was there in pursuit of postgraduate studies in bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs everywhere are reaching for real bacon, with its deep,
smoky flavor, to jump-start their oyster stews and their terrines,
their collard greens and their roasted birds. The bacon
cheeseburger has turned into a fast-food icon (Burger King alone
buys more than five million pounds of bacon a year), and the
high-protein, sugar-busting diet faddists applaud bacon binges.
Fatty, allegedly artery-clogging bacon, which a few years ago stood
at the head of the diet cops' hate list, is back in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   I love bacon. Sizzle! Pop! My mother used to insist on Rath's,
which was packed, as I recall, in Waterloo, Iowa, but Rath's is no
more. What most supermarkets sell these days is more liquid than
solid, a consequence of injecting curing agents into the meat with
needles to speed the process. It shrivels pitifully in the skillet
and tastes mostly of chemicals. It does not even have the alluring
aromas of the bacon of my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Nueske's bacon started showing up in a few stores in
Washington, where I live, I was startled. We found it first at the
Safeway on Wisconsin Avenue (known to Beltway types as the Social
Safeway) and then, to our astonishment, at the little Korean-owned
market on our street corner in Georgetown. The sweet, thick slices
held their shape as they crackled on the stove. They tasted pure,
porky and intensely smoky. Best of all, they didn't pucker your
mouth with saltiness.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to go whole hog here, but Nueske's struck me as the
beluga of bacon, the Rolls-Royce of rashers. It makes a memorable
BLT, one of the supreme inventions of American short-order cookery,
and its crunchiness provides an ideal counterpoint to the richness
of calf's liver or shad roe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It was invented, or might have been, for breakfast bacon and
eggs, which my wife, Betsey, allows me (and herself) a morning or
two a month. It is one of those food products, I have discovered,
that is known to and cherished by chefs across the country, if not
to most home cooks _ a product of a fine rural smokehouse, a modern
place using old-fashioned methods that turns out bacon worth
throwing caution to the winds for, at least once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   This is bacon that cries out for a revival of those
half-forgotten comfort foods of the 1950s like cheese dreams
(open-faced grilled cheese sandwiches with slices of tomato and
crisscrossed bacon slices on top) and traditional English savories
like angels on horseback (oysters wrapped in strips of bacon,
skewered with toothpicks and then broiled) or devils on horseback
(in which the oysters are supplanted by pitted prunes).
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   There are other high-quality American bacons on the market,
smoked with hickory or corncobs, flavored with red pepper or
molasses or even cinnamon. Some are sweeter, some saltier. They
come from the Ozarks, from New England and from the upper South _
mainly Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. An
enterprising California mail-order operative named Dan Philips has
started a Bacon of the Month Club: a pound or so of a different
bacon each month for $140 a year (through the Grateful Palate,
888-472-5283, or on the Web at www.gratefulpalate.com). None of
them, rest assured, bear any resemblance to the wan, watery product
that dominates the supermarket shelves. When I bring home the bacon
these days, it's usually Nueske's, so I thought I'd better try to
find out why it tastes the way it does.
</P>
<P>
   Two Nueske brothers, Robert D., 52, and James A., 50, run the
place. Their great-grandparents, Jim told me, came to Wisconsin
from Prussia in 1882, settling near Wittenberg, a village named for
the city in Germany where Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the
door of the castle church, touching off the Reformation. Like all
the other immigrants hereabouts, they brought spicing and curing
formulas with them, and quickly built a smokehouse.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until the Depression that R.C. Nueske, the
brothers' father, started marketing bacon, sausages, hams and
smoked turkeys, peddling them from a panel truck at the little
resorts across northern Wisconsin. It was not until the present
generation _ and Jim Nueske's devilishly effective country-boy
salesmanship _ that the Nueske brand (pronounced NOO-ski) spread
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hillcrest Farm raises no pigs of its own. This is dairy country.
Instead, it buys pork bellies, the fatty flaps that lie across the
pig's ribs, from hogs raised to its specifications in Iowa, North
Dakota, South Dakota and Canada. ``Here in Wisconsin,'' said Jim
Nueske, who was dressed in a baseball cap and a work shirt
emblazoned with Green Bay Packers logos, ``we're meatheads among
cheeseheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The hogs whose bellies are bound for Nueske are fed a
larger-than-normal percentage of barley, along with corn, and are
slaughtered at certain weights, Nueske explained, to minimize
fattiness without destroying the taste. The brine in which the
bellies are soaked is simple _ sugar, as little salt as possible
and several sodium compounds, among them sodium nitrite, which are
included as preservatives and flavorings. Sodium nitrite content is
regulated by the Agriculture Department, and Nueske bacon contains
only 4 percent of the permitted maximum. It could be eliminated
altogether, which might be marginally healthier, but nitrites
provide some of the characteristic bacon flavor, and the only
nitrite-free bacon I have sampled tasted more like roast pork.
</P>
<P>
   The slabs of bacon spend about 24 hours in the brine, as much as
1,800 pounds to each yellow plastic vat. But the key to the flavor
and consistency of Nueske bacon, unlike some country bacons, which
are cured with dry rubs, lies in the smokehouse and not in the
curing tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Most bacon is smoked in stainless-steel machines, fired with
sawdust, that do the job in four to six hours; Nueske uses 16
steel-lined concrete-block smokehouses, heated by open fires of
applewood logs, and keeps the meat over the coals 20 to 24 hours.
The bacon goes in on special racks fitted with wheels, 80 sides at
a time, about 16,000 pounds a day. It emerges lean and
cordovan-colored, ready to be hand-trimmed and then machine-sliced,
roughly 18 one-eighth-inch slices to a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to render most of the fat here and not in the
frying pan,'' Nueske said as he led me on a tour of the plant.
``For that, and for maximum flavor, you have to finish at very high
temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   A pound of most run-of-the-mill raw bacon produces as little as
a quarter to a third of a pound of cooked bacon; Nueske shoots for
about three-quarters of a pound, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While bacon consumption in restaurants is rising, consumption in
American homes is still dropping. Harry Balzer of the NPD Group, a
market research firm near Chicago, said 47 percent of all Americans
cooked bacon at home in 1984, but only 34 percent did so in 1999.
Households that use it treat it as restaurants do, as more a
taste-enhancing ingredient than an everyday breakfast meat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nueske is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mostly Kellogg's in the morning,'' he said. ``Bacon
and eggs we save mostly for the weekends.''

 &HT;    Bush offers campaign finance reform package
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRMO, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday packaged some things
borrowed and some things new and offered it up as campaign finance
reform _ the topic that has highlighted opponent John McCain's
campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that America wants to know is that
ideas and votes are made based upon principle, not on influence,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Bush wants to ban soft money _ unfettered by
federal contribution limits _ that flows from labor unions and
businesses to political parties. McCain, however, also wants to ban
such donations from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The newest part of Bush's package is a ban on lobbyists'
contributions to federal lawmakers while Congress is in session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust most people in Congress,'' Bush said. ``But I think
it's important to have reforms so that the people do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain called Bush's plan a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's proposal is a camouflage and a joke because it
allows soft money contributions from individuals,'' said McCain,
who was campaigning in nearby Columbia, S.C. ``How can you call it
reform if it doesn't ban soft money?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said his view of cash and Congress is different than
Bush's. ``I work there. I'll tell you it's been corrupted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his plan hours before Tuesday night's nationally
televised debate in Columbia. It is the candidates' final scheduled
joint appearance before Saturday's South Carolina GOP primary. Bush
and McCain are running neck and neck in the latest polls.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning campaign appearance in Irmo, Bush insisted he
has been talking about campaign finance reform since last summer
but continues to be asked for a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm officially putting out a plan now so there should be no
question in anybody's mind that I'm now on the record with a plan
that I've been on the record for ever since last summer,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for a ban on lobby contributions during
congressional sessions is patterned on a Texas law that bans all
contributions to elected state officials and lawmakers while the
Legislature is in session. The Texas Legislature meets for five
months every other year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes McCain's soft-money plan leaves loopholes that
labor unions could exploit to continue helping Democratic
candidates. Though his most recent bill did not include it, McCain
said he too favors shutting down the flow of labor soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes a McCain plan that Bush believes would restrict
political advertising by independent groups such as the Christian
Coalition and Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Bush's plan:
</P>
<P>
   Increased limits for donations, which are now capped at $1,000
from individuals and $5,000 from political action committees. He
offered no specific amount, saying only that it should be adjusted
for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on ``rollovers.'' McCain has transferred into his
presidential campaign account about $3 million raised for his
Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Internet to post ``near real-time'' reports of
campaign contributions as they come in. Bush currently does that.
McCain does not.

WITTENBERG: the weekends.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boom in bacon sales has come from its use in sandwiches,
salads, soups, pasta dishes and the like, which put a premium on
flavor. That has opened a lot of doors for Nueske, starting with
grocers and restaurateurs in Milwaukee and Minneapolis in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm selling a flavoring, not bacon as such,'' he told me.
``That's my sales technique. I drop a pound of bacon off, ask the
guy to try it. I don't mention price _ half the time I don't know
the current price _ and tell them I'll be back to check with them
in a week. Then I have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, he hooked enough customers that 20 years
ago the Nueske brothers and their families mortgaged their houses,
their cars and their weekend cottages to build a big new smoking
plant. ``I'm going to give you an opportunity to fail,'' their
cheerful banker told them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from this little town of 1,140 people, Nueske bacon is
shipped to restaurants like the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas,
Balthazar and An American Place in New York, Commander's Palace in
New Orleans, Clio and Olives in Boston, and Pinot in Los Angeles.
It goes into everything from quiche Lorraine to wine-based sauces
for eggs and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Availability through retail channels is spotty, but direct-mail
shipments, based until three years ago in a garage, have taken off,
and Nueske is now sending a million catalogs four times a year.
Available either in standard slices, 18 to a pound, or thin-sliced,
24 to a pound, bacon costs $19.95 for two pounds, or $20.95 for the
same thing coated with cracked pepper. (Orders can be placed by
calling a 24-hour line, 800-392-2266, or at www.nueske.com.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this woman who's worked for us for years,'' Nueske
said over a lunchtime BLT at Al &AMP; Mary's cafe at Wittenberg's main
(and only) crossroads. ``She's 85 now, still going strong. Anyway,
25 years ago, she and I were the shipping department. I wrapped and
she labeled. Our main retail outlet was this place. They'd let us
put some bacon in their soft-drinks cooler, and when people ordered
a BLT or a bacon cheeseburger and asked where they could get that
bacon, why, they'd just point across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, people order the stuff from Japan and Russia and we have
120 people working for us. Who would have thought bacon could do
that?''

 CHRON  
 A Grande Dame Steps Down: Madeleine Kamman _
controversial  teacher, mentor and founder of School for American
Chefs _ 
 conducts her final class  By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; ST. HELENA, Calif. _  &LR; Madeleine Kamman looks squarely at one of the
young student-chefs gathered around her and minces no words about
his menu idea.
<P>
   ``That is not something I will let you put on the table,'' she
says briskly. A few minutes later, she verbally leaps on a student
who thinks a celery root puree might be nice with the quail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please,'' says the cooking teacher in her girlish
French-accented voice. ``Save us this puree business. We have
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight students, all working chefs attending Beringer
Vineyard's School for American Chefs, are nearing the end of two
weeks with Kamman, widely recognized as one of the world's top
cooking teachers. But today's menu-planning meeting seems more like
boot camp than class, with constant unsparing criticism from this
white-haired drill sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   She is, as former students confirm, brutally frank and quick to
find fault. One admiring protege calls her ``mean as a buzzard.''
But like the recipes she so painstakingly balances, Kamman herself
is a complex creation who softens her harsh side with unstinting
generosity, students say. With this last two-week session at
Beringer, the 69-year-old Kamman is retiring from full-time
teaching, leaving students to deciper the ingredients that have
made her such a compelling, controversial figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very tired,'' Kamman says when asked why she has chosen to
step down now. She will continue to write _ a book about chicken is
in the works _ and she may teach the occasional professional class.
But after almost 40 years of teaching _ first to housewives, then
to chefs _ Kamman apparently has convinced even herself, her
harshest critic, that her main work is done.
</P>
<P>
   Former students speak movingly about her impact on them, citing
her rigorous teaching methods, her tasting prowess and her
unrelenting perfectionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``She changed me profoundly as a cook,'' says Mary Etta Moose,
co-owner of Moose's in San Francisco, who studied with Kamman in
France 20 years ago. `'Everything I'd done up to that point was
hopelessly sloppy, not analytical, not sensitive enough, not free
enough.'' Kamman didn't teach students how to replicate dishes,
Moose says; she taught them how to think.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Kamman's classroom methods were out of the
ordinary. Her lessons went well beyond food, says San Francisco
cooking teacher Joanne Weir, one of her closest proteges. She
incorporated history, geography, geology and food science into her
lectures on French cuisine. Long before science writer Harold McGee
was explaining food chemistry in his books, Kamman was guiding her
students through the chemical reactions that take place in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Her recipes have stories, reasons for being that arose out of
culture and the distant past. A lifelong student of history who
reads Rabelais for pleasure, Kamman wanted her students to see food
in a larger context _ to understand, for example, how France's
wartime deprivation drove postwar chefs to embrace excess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is a real teacher's teacher,'' says Weir, who
cites Kamman's ability to make the study of food come alive for her
students. People who work with her come away with the skills to
excite and educate others _ critical talents for professional
chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant'' and ``genius'' are words one hears often when
students talk about Kamman. Her impeccable palate knows when a
sauce needs that squeeze of lemon to make it enhance a wine.
Liberating her students from recipes, she teaches them how to taste
critically _ how to balance flavors through the judicious use of
fat, sugar, acid and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Her demanding standards have stimulated many but sent others
fleeing in fear. ``She scares the hell out of people,'' says San
Francisco cooking teacher Mary Risley. In 1983, Risley was one of
six students studying with Kamman at the French woman's apartment
in France. The three food professionals in the group did fine,
Risley says; the others were reduced to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine Kamman does not tolerate mediocrity,'' says Gary
Danko, the San Francisco chef who studied with her and remains a
close friend. She has trouble with students who don't share her
perfectionism and her large appetite for work. But those who
impress her are adopted for life. She mothers them, mentors them,
responds to their postcards with four-page letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be made of a certain kind of stuff to work closely
with Madeleine,'' Moose says, ``but if you are, it's a wonderful
synergy, and she'll be very hard on you until the day either she
dies or you do. What she expects of Gary when she walks into his
restaurant would seem unreasonable on anybody's chart.''
</P>
<P>
   Danko confirms that his mentor is difficult to cook for.
``You're going to hear exactly what was right or wrong,'' he says.
Nevertheless, he says he considers his former teacher one of his
best friends and the major influence in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Danko began pursuing Kamman in the late 1970s, asking repeatedly
to be taken on as a student and repeatedly being refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally I said to her, `Madeleine, what is the problem? Is it
because I'm a man?' '' recalls Danko, who knew Kamman's reputation
as a feminist. ``She hit the ceiling. She said, `The reason I will
not let you come is that you're a CIA (Culinary Institute of
America) graduate, and you people give me grief.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she called Danko and told him she had a space
for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-born Kamman attributes her outspoken feminism to the
strong women in her family, who ran restaurants and held together
households while their husbands were at war. She had a highly
publicized tiff with Paul Bocuse in the 1970s after he announced
that women belonged in bed, not in the professional kitchen. She
still remembers the exact date his remarks appeared in Newsweek.
According to Danko, Kamman is particularly irked because she
believes that French chefs like Bocuse have stolen their
grandmothers' cooking _ the regional dishes like  &LR; poule au &LR;   &LR; pot &LR; ,
the Sunday boiled chicken, that have traditionally been prepared by
women _ and taken all the glory for it.
</P>
<P>
   Kamman's World War II childhood also transformed her profoundly.
She is famously frugal, with an almost worshipful respect for good
food. ``We did not eat for 41/2 years,'' she recalls, remembering
when the local  &LR; charcuterie &LR;  had only Spam to sell and the bakeries
had only ``straw bread,'' a loaf so coarse and unrefined that many
older people attribute current digestive problems to it.
</P>
<P>
   Moose recalls going to a restaurant with Kamman years later and
being served what the waiter called a  &LR; cassis quenelle &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine tasted it and said, `This isn't cassis; this is
beets.' And the waiter said, `No, madame, it's cassis.' And she
said, `You go tell the chef that Madeleine Kamman says it's
beets.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The chef came out and allowed that he had used just a touch of
beet. And she said, `We lived on beets. It was the only food we
had. I can tell you if there's a teaspoon in a quart.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Kamman married an American, moved to Philadelphia and
started a family. She began to teach cooking classes in the early
1960s and later opened a Boston restaurant that employed her
students. After closing the restaurant, she moved her school to
Annecy, France, then back to New Hampshire. In the late 1980s, she
persuaded Beringer Vineyards in St. Helena to establish the School
for American Chefs, a one-of-a-kind scholarship program for working
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, she taught small groups of hand-picked students at
the Napa Valley winery. Competition was fierce, with sometimes as
many as 100 applicants for eight spots. When this year's class
prepared its graduation dinner earlier this month _ a demanding
menu that included a scallop terrine with oysters and a main course
of quail with chanterelles, chestnuts and Brussels sprouts _
several alumni were on hand for a tribute to their former mentor.
</P>
<P>
   She is proudest, she says, of inspiring so many young
professionals _ ``not inspiring housewives,'' she says, ``although
I have inspired many, but to sway young people who don't know their
own intelligence, who are thrown into a life they didn't know they
were made for, that's a real gas. I'm an educator at heart, I
really am.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to those who would argue that American chefs are better
than ever, Kamman believes there is less good food now than 20
years ago. ``It is just not done properly,'' she insists.
``Techniques are not observed. Tastes are mixed together in a way
that is not reasoned. There are always a few who do extraordinary
things, but not enough. In Europe, in every little village there's
a one-star restaurant where somebody is striving. Here we have too
many restaurants replicating each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In the professional world, Kamman is at least as well known for
her long-running feud with Julia Child as she is for her brilliant
teaching. Child's wild success as The French Chef on television and
in print apparently aggravated Kamman, who couldn't resist pointing
out publicly that Child was neither French nor a chef. ``She said
things she shouldn't have,'' Risley acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine has always spoken her mind and that has gotten her
into trouble sometimes,'' says Tor Kenward, the Beringer Vineyards
executive who helped her launch the school. ``In our culture,
that's always dangerous; in her culture, less so.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see her as egocentric, some as merely self-confident.
Others sense insecurity. ``She isn't settled within her own skin,''
Risley says. Kamman views herself as an often-misunderstood pioneer
_ a trailblazing female chef in America in the 1970s who championed
French women's cooking and fashioned a new approach to culinary
education.
</P>
<P>
   Now with teaching commitments completed, Kamman is about to
become a student again. After two tries _ which is what it took
most students to get into the School for American Chefs _ she has
been accepted into a graduate program in German literature at the
University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``German literature is gorgeous,'' she says ``It's tied to
history so tightly, and I love history so. Obviously, I lived
during the second World War, and it was interesting to see how
things can fall apart and start again in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Any other retirement plans are private, she insists. She doesn't
rule out the possibility of teaching sporadically but says it is
time to make way for the next generation, citing proteges like
Danko and Weir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people coming up are just as good,'' she says. ``Why
should I be in their way and represent an image inferior to what I
am? I could continue and go downhill because I'm too old, but I
won't do that. Quit while you're ahead, while you're in the full
strength of who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir says, ``A long time ago, she gave me this saying that sits
at the side of my desk. She said it was the saying that influenced
her most in life, and she felt I should have it. It's by Einstein,
and it says so much about her:
</P>
<P>
   ``Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from
mediocre minds.''

A FEW SURPRISES IN NOMINEE LISTS STOKE THE FIRE FOR OSCAR NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the Academy Awards tend to get more media analysis than a
presidential election _ and are now preceded by so many
``pre-Oscar'' awards _ the announcement of nominees has become more
and more anti-climatic.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's gala unveiling of the finalists for the 72nd
running of Hollywood's biggest event had more than its share of
modest surprises. Nothing earthshaking to be sure, but an
eyebrow-raiser or two in most of the major categories.
</P>
<P>
   At the top, in the best picture field, there were three jolts:
the unexpected presence of ``The Cider House Rules,'' the film
version of John Irving's coming-of-age in '40s New England novel,
and two occult thrillers _ ``The Green Mile'' and ``The Sixth
Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   All were considered long shots for a nomination _ ``Mile''
because it was relatively underwhelming, ``Cider'' because of its
daring pro-abortion sentiments, and ``Sense'' because of its summer
release date (memories are short in Hollywood) and its lack of big
critical momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Cider'' and ``Sense'' both proved to be unusually
strong across the board, picking up multiple nominations and the
directing nods (for Lasse Hallstrom and M. Night Shyamalan,
respectively) that seemed to have been slotted for Mike Leigh
(``Topsy-Turvy'') and Anthony Minghella (``The Talented Mr.
Ripley'').
</P>
<P>
   The total of seven nominations earned by ``Cider House'' put it
in a tie with ``The Insider'' and just behind ``American Beauty,''
which scored eight. ``The Sixth Sense'' won six nominations: only
one of which _ 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment for supporting actor _
was widely predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The shocker in the best actor category was Sean Penn, whose turn
as the self-centered jazz guitarist of Woody Allen's ``Sweet and
Lowdown'' seized the spot that seemed to be reserved for Golden
Globe-winner Jim Carrey (``Man on the Moon'') or possibly Jim
Broadbent (``Topsy-Turvy'').
</P>
<P>
   Penn did win a Golden Globe nomination in the ``comedy or
musical'' category, but no other significant recognition, and his
presence in this division had much the same impact of last year's
nomination-out-of-nowhere for Edward Norton in ``American History
X.''
</P>
<P>
   The best actress nominees were the least surprising, matching
the Screen Actors Guild nominees to a woman: Janet McTeer
(``Tumbleweeds''), Annette Bening (``American Beauty''), Meryl
Streep (``Music of the Heart''), Julianne Moore (``End of the
Affair'') and Hilary Swank (``Boys Don't Cry'').
</P>
<P>
   In the supporting acting categories, the surprises were Toni
Collette, the traumatized mother of ``The Sixth Sense,'' who was
absent from the list of SAG and Golden Globe nominees; and Jude Law
(``The Talented Mr. Ripley''), who managed to elbow out the more
favored SAG nominee Chris Cooper (``American Beauty'').
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farnsworth's expected nomination for best actor in ``The
Straight Story'' made Oscar history: at six months shy of 80, he is
the oldest person ever nominated as best actor, and his win here
would steal the male senior-citizen Oscar crown from Henry Fonda,
who was named best actor at age 76 for ``On Golden Pond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and
might not have a chance again,'' Farnsworth said in an interview
with The Associated Press from his longhorn cattle ranch in
Lincoln, N.M. To celebrate, Farnsworth planned to go out for a taco
and a martini with an onion Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the record books is Streep's 12th nomination, which
ties her with Katharine Hepburn, and _ since Streep obviously has a
lot of performances left in her, and is nominated every time she
sneezes _ gives her a very good shot at becoming Oscar history's
most nominated performer.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the list, in the technical categories, history also
was made by John Williams' nomination for his ``Angela's Ashes''
score. It's Williams' 39th nomination _ the most of any living
person (but still well short of the record 45 nominations scored by
the late Fox music department head, Alfred Newman).
</P>
<P>
   Also buried in the non-acting nominations are three that have
local interest: an adapted screenplay nomination for former Seattle
resident Jim Taylor (``Election''); a cinematography nomination for
the film version of local author David Guterson's ``Snow Falling on
Cedars''; and a best costume nomination for the Shakespeare
adaptation, ``Titus,'' which was produced by Seattle-based Blue Sky
Productions.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, as the serious Oscar handicapping gets under way,
the front-runners would seem to be ``American Beauty'' for best
picture; its director, Sam Mendes, best director; Denzel Washington
(``The Hurricane'') best actor; Hilary Swank (``Boys Don't Cry'')
best actress; Angelina Jolie (``Girl, Interrupted'') best
supporting actress; Tom Cruise (``Magnolia'') best supporting
actor; and Spain's ``All About My Mother,'' best foreign language
film.
</P>
<P>
   But anything could happen. Washington could suffer from the
ongoing revelations that much of the supposedly true story of ``The
Hurricane'' was invented. Jolie may have turned off conservative
Academy members by talking too openly about her adventurous sex
life, and Oscar voters may not be able to resist giving Annette
Bening an Oscar to go with the Irving Thalberg Award being
presented this year to her husband, Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   However the contest goes, the 72nd Oscars are sure be one of the
more entertaining recent outings since Billy Crystal _ by far the
best of the Oscar hosts of the past decade _ will be returning to
the master of ceremonies spot.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies take place Sunday, March 26, at Los Angeles
Shrine Auditorium, and will be broadcast live beginning at 5:30
p.m.

`KADOSH': A DARK VIEW OF ORTHODOXY IN JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Kadosh,'' an outraged portrait of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish
community in the Mea Shearim quarter of Jerusalem, is so grim that
before it's over what began as a fictionalized expose of a group of
religious extremists has assumed the ominous tone of a
psychological horror film.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by the noted Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai,
is his third in a trilogy that focuses on three major Israeli
cities. Like many of Gitai's other movies it is an innovative if
uneasy hybrid of outspoken essay and clumsily plotted fiction. By
leaving some strands of the story dangling and insisting on a
didactically melodramatic ending, ``Kadosh'' (``sacred'' in Hebrew)
ultimately sacrifices some dramatic credibility while retaining a
disquieting rhetorical power.
</P>
<P>
   From its opening scene, in which Meir (Yoram Hattab), a
brilliant young Talmudic scholar, gives thanks to God in his
morning prayers that he wasn't born a woman, ``Kadosh'' inveighs
against a zealous religious fundamentalism, one of whose central
tenets is a profound and shocking misogyny. At first, the marriage
of Meir and his adoring wife, Rivka (Yael Abecassis), appears
almost idyllic in its tender passion. But as Meir goes about a
typical day of ritualized activities and study of the Torah, it
turns out that he is obsessed to the point of distraction with
being childless after 10 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A marriage without children is barely a marriage at all, his
sect teaches. The cause of that barrenness is assumed to be the
wife's impurity. As Rivka wearily goes through the primitive
cleansing and fertility rituals that she has performed many times
before, the film's increasingly glum tone mirrors her mounting
panic. The bottom falls out of her life when Meir refuses to make
love to her anymore, and her own father, the community's hard-line
rabbi (Yussef Abu Warda), pressures him to abandon her and marry a
younger woman. Exiled to a small, cramped apartment away from her
husband, she falls into a state of grief so profound she stops
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Rivka's rebellious younger sister, Malka (Meital
Barda), is almost as desperate. Although Malka is in love with
Yaakov (Sami Hori), a handsome pop singer outside the Orthodox
community, she is under pressure to marry Yossef (Uri Ran
Klausner), a boorish rabble-rousing fanatic who rattles around
Jerusalem in a sound truck broadcasting millennial screeds.
</P>
<P>
   Their wedding night scene would be the stuff of grotesque comedy
if it weren't so cruel. After hastily removing as few clothes as
necessary, Yossef climbs on the bed, pulls the covers over them and
without so much as kissing his bride, or even looking her in the
face, brutally lunges at her as she screams in agony. Later, when
he suspects her of infidelity, Yossef goes ballistic and viciously
beats her with a belt.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of oppression endured by the women in ``Kadosh,'' of
course, is not limited to ultra-Orthodox Jews. It is just as
virulent among Muslim fundamentalists and extreme sects in other
religions. At its heart is a fear and loathing of sex that
originates largely from a primitive notion of women's bodies as
essentially unclean.
</P>
<P>
   For the men in the sect, the women in ``Kadosh'' are little more
than baby-making machines and household servants whose main task is
to populate the world with as many Jewish extremists as possible.
The goal, declares the rabbi, is for the sect eventually to
outnumber the rest of the population and take over the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Kadosh,'' which opens Wednesday at the Film Forum,
was shot in color, its view of Orthodox Jewish society is so
austere it leaves the impression of a black-and-white movie. The
interiors are bleak, and the conversations among the characters,
especially between Meir and Rivka, punctuated by long, troubled
silences. Even at the end, when the camera surveys the Jerusalem
skyline, the atmosphere is murky and sullen, suffused with a
palpable sense of threat.
</P>
<P>

   WASHINGTON _ Searching for ways to combat Internet attacks,
President Clinton turned Tuesday to America's high-tech leaders,
law enforcement officials and a hacker named Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Although he called last week's successful assaults on several
popular Web sites ``a wake-up call'' to the country, Clinton
downplayed the damage done to Internet commerce and security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an electronic Pearl Harbor,'' he said at a
meeting in the White House Cabinet Room with 29 industry
representatives as well as national security experts and Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should leave here with this vast sense of
insecurity,'' Clinton said. ``We ought to leave here with a sense
of confidence that this is a challenge that was entirely
predictable. It's part of the price of the success of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial idea of the session was to address the problem of
terrorists using cyberspace. But Clinton said a blizzard of
assaults last week that disabled some of the nation's most popular
Web sites _ among them CNN.com, eBay, Yahoo!, Amazon.com and ETrade
_ convinced him that the government needs to focus on protecting
the Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, he promised to provide $9 million in
``start-up money'' for a high-tech security institute to study ways
to improve Internet security. But the president stressed that
security on the Internet should be improved without jeopardizing
the entrepreneurial potential of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to keep cyberspace open and free,'' Clinton
said. ``At the same time, computer networks (must be) more secure
and resilient and we have to do more to protect privacy and civil
liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators think the cyber attacks against the Web
sites were perpetrated by one or more assailants who hacked into
computer systems including those at Stanford University and on at
least two campuses in the University of California system. The
assailants then directed those large, powerful systems to flood the
Web sites with data, causing them to fail for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Companies represented in Tuesday's meeting included America
Online, Yahoo!, 3Com, Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems, MCI
Worldcom, IBM, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett Packard, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant was Mudge, nickname for a member of a
``think tank'' of hackers who are security consultants operating
under the name  &LR; Stake. Mudge refused to give his name, but the
White House released a list of participants that included an  &LR; Stake
representative named Peiter Zatko of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because I know how the people who broke into the
those Web sites think,'' said the long-haired Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   The president emphasized that private industry should lead the
way in solving the Internet security problem with the government
playing only a ``minimal role,'' such as coordinating industry
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The industry security representatives agreed, saying they did
not want a large government presence on the Internet. Instead, they
pledged to share information ``regarding cyber attacks,
vulnerabilities, counter-measures and security practices'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has a lot to do, certainly by example and
education, but the private sector has to drive the security of the
Internet,'' said Charles Wang, chief executive of Computer
Associates International, a business software firm in Islandia,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said, ``Every business on the Internet gets hurt when a
Web site is broken into because it makes people afraid of using the
Internet so it's in the interest of businesses to help each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most participants said the attacks were not
catastrophic, Thomas Noonan, CEO of the Atlanta-based Internet
Security Systems, said they signaled that ``an arms race'' was
under way, pitting the government and computer industry against
cyber-hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan said he told Clinton in the closed-door meeting that it
is next to impossible to stop a cyber terrorist from launching an
attack. ``But what we can do is make sure our systems are not
vulnerable, and we can make sure that our networks are capable of
detecting and responding to any attacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such security capability, which would ensure that U.S.
e-commerce can run smoothly and fend off attacks, will cost up to
$50 billion, Noonan said. ``We have built our new economy on a
vulnerable infrastructure. You'd never build a skyscraper on a
foundation full of holes. But that's just what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan said the group advised the president, ``For God's sake,
lead by example. The government's computers are some of the most
vulnerable out there.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a computer believed to have been used in last week's
attacks was seized by federal agents, according to Hillsboro, Ore.,
Police Sgt. Allen Zaugg, head of a group of officers trained for
high-tech cases. The FBI is now analyzing that computer, which was
seized within the last two days from a home business in the
Portland, Ore., area, a federal official in Washington said,
requesting anonymity. The computer's owner apparently was not aware
the computer was used as part of the attacks, the official said.
The FBI also was seeking to interview several hackers known by
their Internet screen names, including one who calls himself
``mafiaboy'' and another who calls himself ``coolio,'' the official
said.

   LONG-ISLAND-FILMS (New York) _ For me _ a fanatical filmgoer
from an early age _ the real proof that Long Island was nowhere was
that I never saw it in the movies. It obviously wasn't important in
the way New York, London, Paris and Dodge City were. The lonely
exception to the silver screen's general embargo on images of Long
Island was that sequence in ``North by Northwest'' in which the
urbane Cary Grant was kidnapped outside the Plaza Hotel and taken
to a mansion on the North Shore, where he would barely survive an
attempt on his life. All this would change, though, in part thanks
to the rise of independent film, with its fondness for depicting
quirky people in ordinary settings (or, perhaps more to the point,
in cheap locations). By Terrence Rafferty.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ART-DIRECTORS (New York) _ A talk between two of the most
prominent figures in the New York art world, Philippe de
Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
Thomas Krens, the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museun. By
Judith Dobrzynski.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BEACH-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Beach,'' Danny Boyle's film
adaptation of Alex Garland's popular novel, Leonardo DiCaprio is
Richard, a pleasure-seeking backpacker who finds himself alone and
itching for adventure in swinging Bangkok. Richard's vague search
for heaven on earth (with some requisite danger thrown in) leads
him to a secret commune on a remote coastal island that can be
reached only by swimming to its shores. At first, paradise appears
to be everything he has been looking for. Against a backdrop of
perfect sunsets and moonrises, its international brigade of
post-hippie sybarites (so preposterously well-tended that they
resemble the cast of ``Baywatch'' on a Club Med holiday) while away
their days in peppy beachside games of soccer and volleyball.
Utopia only begins to pall after a tragedy reveals Richard's fellow
exiles to be a bunch of selfish party animals willing to sacrifice
lives to keep their pristine enclave a secret. By Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   MIFUNE-FILM (Copenhagen, Denmark) _ ``Mifune,'' is a touching
love story set on an isolated farm in southern Denmark. The film,
by the Danish diredtor, Soren Kragy-Jacobsen, 52, which won a
special jury prize at the 1999 Berlin film festival and is
Denmark's Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film this
year, opens in New York on Friday. By Alan Riding.

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON-BALLET-SCHOOL (Washington) _ It was once a private
home, but now the four-floor white building at the intersection of
Wisconsin Avenue and Porter Street is filled with studios, offices
and dressing rooms. In a way it is still a home, but now to the
Washington School of Ballet, founded in 1944 by Mary Day and Lisa
Gardiner, and the Washington Ballet, founded by Day in 1976. In the
1980s, Choo San Goh, who was the resident choreographer,
transformed the company from a regional ballet troupe into an
internationally respected entity. Goh died in 1987, and after
several successors had come and gone, the company appointed its
present artistic director, Septime Webre, last June. By Kate
Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   JULIO-BOCCO-DANCE (New York) _ Julio Bocca, a dashing star of
American Ballet Theater, did not look himself as he rehearsed in a
mid-Manhattan studio early this month. With his toes turned in, his
back arched and his hands placed on his hips, not a trace of
Albrecht or Romeo could be discerned in his demeanor. While still
jet-lagged from a flight from Buenos Aires and worn from rehearsing
his own company, Ballet Argentina, for its recent performance at
the World Financial Center Winter Garden, he was trying to absorb a
choreographic style as different from Petipa as night from day. And
he had to learn it fast, because last Tuesday he was to make his
Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical ``Fosse.'' By
Valerie Gladstone.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SETLOCK-THEATER (New York) _ The play ``Fully Committed,'' is a
satirical look at a day in the life of a four-star restaurant
besieged by high-powered customers demanding tables. Written by
Becky Mode, a friend of its star Mark Setlock, and directed by
Nicholas Martin, opened to raves in September at the Vineyard
Theater and moved to a commercial run at the 180-seat Cherry Lane
in December. By Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARUSO-2000-MUSIC (Undated) _ Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to hear your favorite Caruso recordings freshened up:
say, with the great tenor's voice, exactly as it was captured by an
acoustic recording horn in the days before microphones, newly
cloaked in the lush timbres of a modern symphony orchestra recorded
in digital stereo? No, of course you haven't. Why would you? Why
would anyone? Yet someone not only did but also suspected that
other people might. Thus we have ``Caruso 2000,'' a production of
the Austrian Broadcasting Corp., released on CD by RCA Victor. By
Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CLASSIC-LYRICS (Undated) _ Composing lyrics in the classic
tradition of American song has always demanded a respect for, if
not slavish adherence to, laws: of form, function, poesy. That's
the fun of it. The challenge. The ideal. We live, however, in the
grip of a music culture that venerates rebelliousness. The
intricacies of lyric writing have thus been reduced to brute
effusion. Worse than a chore, adherence to craft is actually seen
as a sellout. By Barry Singer.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMY-AWARDS (Undated) _ Yet another chapter in pop's latest
bout with adolescence unfolds this week at the 42nd annual Grammy
Awards. The nominee list, as undependable as ever in predicting
music's real history-makers, does crackle with one present
conflict, between the parent figures who run the event and the kids
now paying their allowances. Those kids get on adults' nerves with
their obvious commercial music, but these hit makers, sometimes
unwittingly, are pointing toward pop's future. A likely sweep by
the night's deserving front-runner, Carlos Santana, will reassure
those baby-boomer voters far too old to really understand the
chart-topping teenage nominees like Britney Spears, Christina
Aguilera and those ever-present, thrice-nominated Backstreet Boys.
By Ann Powers.

<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ED-LOGUE-ARCHITECT (New York) _ For many New Yorkers, Ed Logue's
name evokes an era when the quality of urban life was measured by
something more than skyrocketing real estate prices, the banishment
of homeless people from public sidewalks and the glitter of
confetti falling from the sky. The ideal of social equality also
figured in the equation. Logue, born in Philadelphia in 1921, was
among the last of the master planners to practice urban renewal on
an epic scale. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   CREWDSON-PHOTOGS (Lee, Mass.) _ Chaos may lie behind Gregory
Crewdson's work, but you would hardly know it from looking at his
pictures of suburbia, where an eerie calm always prevails. Since
1998, the 37-year-old photographer has been creating a series
titled ``Twilight,'' which now includes 20 meticulously detailed,
richly colored pictures, all taken in and around the outskirts of
Lee, ranging from domestic interiors to landscape views. The
photographs, featuring the local townspeople, are always shot at
dusk. Twelve of Crewdson's most recent ``Twilight'' photographs are
now on view at Luhring Augustine Gallery. By Elizabeth Hayt.

</P>
<P>
   TV-TALK-WALLS (Undated) _ Three years after they became the most
publicized, criticized, scrutinized gay couple in Hollywood, if not
the country, Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche have had enough. Not of
each other. Far from it. They have a new outlook and are eager to
declare, despite predictions that theirs was a relationship founded
on Hollywood-style eccentricity and star madness, that they are
still, as Ms. Heche put it, ``crazy happy'' together. As recently
as last July, when Ms. Heche and Ms. DeGeneres sat down for an
interview in their trailer on the set of ``If These Walls Could
Talk 2,'' the HBO film in which both women have had a prominent
hand, they were still anguished over the lack of enthusiasm their
pairing up had inspired. By Bill Carter.

PURCHASE OF SMELTERS GIVES 2 FINANCIERS CONTROL OF RUSSIAN
ALUMINUM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Financiers with close ties to the Kremlin, Boris
Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich have acquired three important
Russian aluminum smelters in eastern Siberia in deals that would
give them nearly full control over the country's enormous aluminum
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Abramovich is already the principal owner of Sibneft, a leading
Russian oil conglomerate. Berezovsky is widely believed to have a
stake in the company as well, though Sibneft has never confirmed
it. But a company spokesman said on Monday that some of Sibneft's
major shareholders acquired controlling interests last week in the
Bratsk aluminum plant and the Krasnoyarsk aluminum plant from Lev
Cherny, a Russian emigre business executive with extensive
interests in the metals industry, and in Trans-World Metals Ltd., a
British trading company that is heavily engaged in Russian mining
and smelting.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cherny said the sales have almost been
completed, while a Trans-World representative confirmed only that
his company is holding negotiations with Sibneft shareholders.
Those involved declined to disclose the size of the stakes sold or
the value of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the owners of the Novokuznetsk aluminum plant
announced that they had sold their 70 percent stake in the smelter
to LogoVaz, a company controlled by Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk and Novokuznetsk factories together
accounted for about two-thirds of the 3.4 million tons Russia
produced in 1999, its output second only to that of the United
States. The Bratsk plant, which by itself produced nearly 960,000
tons last year, is considered the largest smelter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Sibneft spokesman said the shareholders later this week
would announce their development plans for the smelters they had
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a general trend in Russian industry for
companies to stake out more and more of the economy while they
can,'' said Ivan Mazalov, oil analyst for the Russian brokerage
firm Troika Dialog.
</P>
<P>
   The interim between the tenure of Russia's former president,
Boris N. Yeltsin, and early elections on March 26 proved an astute
time for Abramovich and Berezovsky to act. Oil prices, at the
highest level in nearly a decade, have brought a windfall to
Russian oil companies and helped give the Sibneft shareholders the
resources to acquire the smelters.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding their holdings into aluminum, the Sibneft stock
owners, once part of the Yeltsin inner circle, may be trying to
preserve their influence in the new political cluster around the
acting Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who is the leading
candidate in next month's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidential elections always need money,'' said Aleksandr
Konovalov, head of the Institute for Strategic Assessments in
Moscow, adding, ``Having lots of money means there is more of
chance'' they will be looked at as a source of support before the
election and after.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why Cherny and his business partner, Trans-World,
chose to reduce their holdings in Russian aluminum at a time when
favorable world prices have also helped improve the prospects of
the smelters, which export most of their production.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, investigators with the interior ministry
have been looking into whether Cherny was part of a wide-scale bank
fraud that the police say he used to finance deals with the
smelters in the early days of post-Soviet Russia. Cherny and
Trans-World, through their lawyers, have repeatedly denied
accusations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The business activities of Sibneft and Berezovsky have also been
called into question. Minority shareholders at a Sibneft production
unit have accused company management for years of spiriting away
millions in revenue from the unit into offshore accounts. Sibneft
has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is under investigation by the Swiss prosecutor's
office on evidence that he used two Geneva companies to channel
revenue out of Russia from Aeroflot, the national airline, in which
he owns a stake. He, too, has denied wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1999, creative filmmakers cut a bold path toward the new
century with an outstanding array of inventive, ingenious and
incisive movies.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has
complacently plopped itself down in the middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some deceptive nods toward the new and the daring, the
72nd Annual Academy Awards nominations announced Tuesday were
noticeably biased toward the conventional and the comfortable.
Reports that hackers broke into the academy's database provide a
perfect metaphor for this year's results: It appears as if the
voters, daunted by an uncharacteristic overload of quality cinema,
suffered a mass taste crash.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other explanations why the popular but
pulpy ``The Sixth Sense,'' the overlong and overwrought ``The Green
Mile'' and the soft-pedaling, sentimental ``The Cider House Rules''
aced the truly thrilling likes of ``Being John Malkovich,'' ``Boys
Don't Cry,'' ``Magnolia,'' ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``Three
Kings,'' ``Topsy-Turvy'' and ``Toy Story 2,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   The academy fell into its old habit of recognizing the biggest
box-office hit it could honorably get away with (it's a safe bet
that, except for the gracelessness of Jar Jar Binks, ``Phantom
Menace'' would be on the list). Cozy familiarity powered ``The
Green Mile''; it was a Frank Darabont adaptation of a Stephen King
prison drama _ just like earlier nominations hog ``The Shawshank
Redemption'' _ and it starred Oscar golden boy Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Cider House,'' Miramax bought that one. The distributor
_ which has famously taken out increasingly unprecedented amounts
of campaign ads in the movie trade papers for eventual Oscar
showhorses ``Il Postino,'' ``The English Patient,'' ``Life Is
Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ has been bombarding
voters with ``Cider'' propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Disney division gave its Paramount co-production
``Ripley'' similarly lavish promotion, and that one got blanked in
the best picture race, as did its director (``Patient'' Oscar
winner Anthony Minghella) and subtly mesmerizing star Matt Damon.
But it's also apparent that the dark-hued ``Ripley'' is the kind of
uncompromising work that brought Miramax recognition in the more
independent days of ``The Crying Game,'' ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``The
Piano.'' In recent times, they've won more Oscars with sweeter,
less-radical fare _ and ``Cider House'' is nothing if not the most
conservative abortion-rights movie ever made, in the grand
tradition of softball Hollywood issue pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Cider'' surge sets up an even more expensive replay of
last year's promotional war between Miramax and DreamWorks, when
the Spielberg studio saw ``Shakespeare'' snatch victory from its
front-runner ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The quality gap between
DreamWorks' rigorous current favorite ``American Beauty'' and the
Miramax spoiler is measurably wider this time, but that won't stop
the ad frenzy. This year's real winners? The Hollywood trade
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tying ``Cider'' for second-most nominations (seven,
compared to ``Beauty's'' eight), momentum does not appear to be
with the fifth best picture contender, ``The Insider.'' It could,
however, be building for the film's lead actor nominee, Russell
Crowe. Consider: Designated front-runner Denzel Washington's
historically suspect ``The Hurricane'' gleaned only a single
nomination _ for his performance _ while the chameleonlike
Australian's historically suspect picture maintained much wider
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gotta say, the academy did itself proud with the rest of that
field. Spacey, of course, was a no-brainer. But recognizing Richard
Farnsworth for his delicate ``Straight Story'' work and vocal Oscar
detractor Sean Penn for the substantial achievement of not acting
like Woody Allen in a Woody Allen film earns a quiet but heartfelt
bravo.
</P>
<P>
   As does the academy's refusal, for the second year in a row, to
acknowledge a Jim Carrey caricature. Yes, the voters do appear
biased against the approval-seeking funnyman, but not because he's
a comedian; he just hasn't played a convincingly human character
yet.
</P>
<P>
   However, snubbing Eddie Murphy for his dual role in
``Bowfinger'' _ that's prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   An overview of the acting categories shows a majority (11) of
first-time nominees, some of whom did edgy work in cool films
(``Boys Don't Cry's'' Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny,
``Malkovich's'' Catherine Keener). But there's an overriding safe
pattern to the acting choices. Wise kids (Haley Joel Osment), mutes
(Samantha Morton), self-sacrificing African-Americans (Michael
Clarke Duncan), and accent-throwing Brits and Aussies (Janet
McTeer, Michael Caine, Jude Law, Toni Collette, Crowe) are
long-running Oscar-race stereotypes, regardless of how well-done.
</P>
<P>
   Even the vastly deserving Tom Cruise was probably nominated as
much for being a Hollywood rainmaker as for the intense, lacerating
originality of his ``Magnolia'' ensemble turn. And, really, yet
another nomination for Meryl Streep just for looking like she could
play a fiddle? Nothing like rote academy thinking, abetted by one
of those Miramax campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The director's branch did try to appear hipper than usual by
bestowing four first-time nominations, and two to debutante feature
filmmakers (``Beauty's'' Sam Mendes and ``Malkovich's'' Spike
Jonze). And the writers, as usual, generally made the smartest
choices, though much more so in the original (all gems) than the
adapted (where ``Election'' and ``Ripley'' were finely judged)
division.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of these and a few other bones tossed to those
challenging (``The Matrix's'' technical innovations, a snarky
``South Park'' song), the Oscar race this year, at least at this
point, is looking like it might be another case of hype trumping
artistic merit. There are enough good nominees to prevent this
eventuality, though. As previously noted, many filmmakers made
exciting efforts last year to grow the medium into the 21st
century. The academy has until March 26 to join the parade. &QL;

 &HT;     McCAIN COUNTERS ATTACKS ON HIS ABORTION STANCE   
 &HT;     (EDS: Stands for COLUMBIA-dated item on budget.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRMO, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Tuesday tried to
bolster his anti-abortion credentials in the face of criticism from
abortion foes that he isn't sufficiently zealous, especially
compared with that of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At a question-and-answer session with several hundred voters in
this suburb outside the state capital four days before Saturday's
hotly contested Republican presidential primary, McCain touted his
``17-year pro-life voting record'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain sought to change the discussion by urging all
Republicans, Democrats and independents to go beyond single-issue
voting to weigh his ``vision for the future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been striving to balance his appeal to traditional
GOP voters with overtures to Democrats and Independents who also
can cast ballots in Saturday's GOP primary. The McCain campaign has
identified about 200,000 voters who are frequent cross-over voters
_ a potential windfall in a contest expected to draw a total of
some 375,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to say to you is I hope you'll judge me on my
record; I hope you'll judge me on my commitment to conservative
causes and beliefs,'' McCain told the town meeting. ``But I also
hope you'll make a judgement as to how I can lead this country in
the next century and restore integrity and respect to the
institution of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments followed a question from Allison Lewis, 35, a
pediatric nurse and mother of three who said members of her
born-again Christian church are being showered with mailings from
the Bush campaign and the National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported in Tuesday's editions that the Bush
campaign has launched a telephone campaign critical of McCain's
voting record on abortion that is designed to reach 100,000 voters
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, said he was ``concerned''
about the effort to peel away McCain support with attacks on his
anti-abortion record. ``It's so overwhelming that we're hoping that
there's a backlash to it,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said that she and other members of the Christian Right
have received two separate mailings in the past week that
questioned McCain's stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing from the Bush campaign ``mentioned abortion
specifically'' and showed a baby urging voters: ``Vote for George
Bush, for me,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing from the National Right To Life Committee said that
Bush was ``more conservative Christian Right'' than McCain and that
``he was the candidate to vote for if you were a conservative
Christian,'' Lewis said, adding: ``It was pretty point blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis appealed for McCain to ``help me out here'' and explain to
fellow members of her congregation why they should support him
rather than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's calm, deliberate response made no mention of Bush or
the mailings that Lewis cited. McCain's low-key approach to one of
the hot button issues in South Carolina politics led Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., a key ally who has been accompanying McCain on the
campaign trail, to jump into the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a three-term lawmaker who came to national attention as
a member of the House impeachment team in 1998, rose to his feet
following McCain's response, apologized for interrupting and
quickly declared: ``I'm going to stand up and tell you what I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, labeling himself a conservative and a Christian,
declared: ``What's being done to this man is not a great thing.
There is no difference between John McCain, myself and Gov. Bush on
the life issue.'' Graham said all three support exceptions to any
ban on abortions to save the life of the mother and to end
pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ``pro-life record is being terribly, terribly
misrepresented,'' Graham said. ``You put this trash in the trash
can where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lewis said in an interview that McCain's response to her
question was sufficient to win her support but that she liked the
passion of Graham's reply.
</P>
<P>
   McCain should have been ``just a little more positive,'' Lewis
said. ``I think he'll make a difference for families. I just think
he should stand up more for that. He says those things but I think
sometimes he thinks they're not important.''

OSCAR NOMINATIONS BOOST BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Films that weren't exactly smash hits at the box office
 &UR; _ &LR;  ``The Cider House Rules'' and ``The Insider''  &UR; _ &LR;  may double
their current revenues following Tuesday's Academy Award
nominations, industry trackers predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a validation and it's a strong indication of how
well-received a movie is in terms of critical praise. It motivates
people to go see those movies,'' said Paul Dergarbedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations Co., which tracks box-office sales. ``The
Oscar nomination makes people think, &UR; ` &LR; Hey this is a good movie.'''
</P>
<P>
   People who plan to watch the awards show live also tend to want
to have their own impressions to compare to the outcome of the
vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people watch the Oscars, they want to be able to know
what they are watching,'' Dergarbedian said. ``Certainly, the
water-cooler effect is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The best picture category usually has the most effect because
it's the most recognized of the awards given out, said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source film tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``'The Cider House Rules' probably has the best chance to at
least double its revenues because it hasn't reached the
mainstream,'' Bucksbaum said. ``You can always count on Miramax to
promote this film heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   If last year is any indication, Bucksbaum is right about
Miramax. After the nominations were announced in February 1999,
Miramax expanded its distribution of ``Shakespeare in Love'' by an
additional 1,123 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The studio said it has plans to almost double the number of
theaters showing ``The Cider House Rules,'' from around 800 to
1,500 the weekend of Feb. 25. The film has grossed $22 million to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Other films that stand to gain from a predicted Oscar boost are
``The Insider,'' the story of a tobacco industry informant, which
to date has brought in $27 million. Bucksbaum predicted the film
could see $40 million in revenues with the increased interest.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' tale of suburban dysfunction, ``American Beauty,''
will gain on a lesser scale, mainly because it already has done so
well in theaters, Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the few films that you know it's almost a
shoo-in for getting the award,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dergarbedian said he believes ``American Beauty'' will
attract a more mainstream audience than it has to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ```American Beauty' has a lot left in it. That's a film that a
lot of people have heard about,'' he said. ``It's a pretty popular
film, but it's not your typical mainstream movie.''
</P>
<P>
   More commercially successful films such as ``The Green Mile''
from Warner Bros. also will see upticks in their box-office
revenues following their best picture nominations, but both experts
said the people who are most likely to go see them already have.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said he expects Warner Bros. to increase ``The Green
Mile''  &UR; _ &LR;  now in 2,012 theaters  &UR; _ &LR;  by at least 500 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top nominees are films that have been trapped in
relative obscurity. Woody Allen's ``Sweet and Lowdown'' will
benefit from Sean Penn's best actor nomination, and more viewers
are likely to seek out ``The Straight Story'' now that Richard
Farnsworth has been nominated for the award as well, Bucksbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buena Vista Films, distributor of ``The Sixth Sense,'' would do
well to release the film on video between now and the awards show,
Dergarbedian said. No such date has yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is still in theaters, could gain a boost in
video sales from the nominations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's after the awards, I don't see what kind of boost it
would get,'' Dergarbedian said. ``They can put that on their
packaging, and they can exploit it in their ads.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination committee can doom a film as much as it can give
sagging box-office returns a shot in the arm, Dergarbedian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon,'' starring Jim Carrey, was widely expected to
receive at least a best actor nomination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: If you don't get an Oscar nomination,
there's no way you're going to get an Oscar boost,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Number of on-the-job injuries, illnesses up
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Workplace injuries and illnesses are up substantially
in Georgia, with more than 400 workers being hurt on the job every
day, according to new government data.
</P>
<P>
   The number of on-the-job injuries and illnesses increased 8
percent in 1998, the latest available figures, to 162,200 incidents
in Georgia, or roughly 5.8 injuries or illnesses for every 100
workers, the annual Survey of Nonfatal Occupational Injuries and
Illnesses found. That's 11,400 more reported incidents than in
1997. Until this latest reporting period, the injury and illness
rate in the state had been declining.
</P>
<P>
   State labor officials attributed the increase to a lack of
safety training, especially at small companies. The region's
booming economy has meant more new small businesses have been
started and existing ones are keeping busy.
</P>
<P>
   The officials hope to address the problem through a coalition of
government, education and private industry that will work with
companies that do not have or cannot afford to set up workplace
safety programs. Labor officials released the report Tuesday in
Decatur at RMC Industries Corp., one of the companies heading the
workplace safety initiative through Project Safe Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be expensive to hire safety officers and purchase
equipment and supplies necessary to put on training programs to
educate a company's employees,'' State Labor Commissioner Michael
Thurmond said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a particularly critical one because most of the
injuries are occurring at small companies, firms with 50 to 250
employees. The overwhelming majority of employers in Georgia are
small firms, which can't afford to lose production time from even a
few workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45 percent of the injury and illness cases resulted in
lost time at work or restricted duty. Injuries accounted for 93
percent of the reported incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The most common injuries are sprains and strains, primarily to
the back. Those injuries usually occurred in the manufacturing and
construction industries. Bruises, cuts and lacerations were the
next most common injury.
</P>
<P>
   Complications related to repetitive motion injuries, such as
carpal tunnel syndrome, was the leading cause of illnesses,
followed by diseases and disorders of the skin, and exposure to
chemicals or other agents.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing and construction were the two most dangerous
places to work, accounting for the highest incidents of injury,
followed by the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries, the
report said. Finance, insurance and real estate had the best safety
records.
</P>
<P>
   Through Project Safe Georgia, larger firms will provide safety
training and materials for companies that need it, Thurmond said.
The effort is particularly crucial in a state and in industries
that are seeing growing numbers of non-English speaking workers,
said Don Williams, the new chairman of Project Safe Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in reported injuries, Georgia fared better
than the rest of the Southeast and the nation, according to Michael
Wald, regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
which keeps track of injury rates nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Wald cautioned against drawing any conclusion of a long term
problem in Georgia based on one year of data. He also noted that
the 6.7 national injury rate is the lowest rate of workplace
mishaps since the bureau began tracking workplace illnesses and
injuries in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>

   Per 100 workers in Southeastern states:

<P>
   The opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia began the latest of the
dozens of strikes she has led in recent years to try to bring down
the government of Prime Minister Sheik Hasina. The latest started
as a new law takes effect that would impose jail terms of up to 14
years for obstructing transportation and destroying property _ acts

   The government proposed a population policy that would freeze
each state's number of seats in the lower house of Parliament until
2026 so that a state like Uttar Pradesh that has not got its
population growth under control is not rewarded politically, while
a state like Tamil Nadu that has done a good job of controlling its

   Money from the new oil industry is worsening Sudan's civil war,
a Canadian government report said. But the report stopped short of

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1999, creative filmmakers cut a bold path toward the new
century with an outstanding array of inventive, ingenious and
incisive movies.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has
complacently plopped itself down in the middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some deceptive nods toward the new and the daring, the
72nd Annual Academy Awards nominations announced Tuesday were
noticeably biased toward the conventional and the comfortable.
Reports that hackers broke into the academy's database provide a
perfect metaphor for this year's results: It appears as if the
voters, daunted by an uncharacteristic overload of quality cinema,
suffered a mass taste crash.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other explanations why the popular but
pulpy ``The Sixth Sense,'' the overlong and overwrought ``The Green
Mile'' and the soft-pedaling, sentimental ``The Cider House Rules''
aced the truly thrilling likes of ``Being John Malkovich,'' ``Boys
Don't Cry,'' ``Magnolia,'' ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``Three
Kings,'' ``Topsy-Turvy'' and ``Toy Story 2,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   The academy fell into its old habit of recognizing the biggest
box-office hit it could honorably get away with (it's a safe bet
that, except for the gracelessness of Jar Jar Binks, ``Phantom
Menace'' would be on the list). Cozy familiarity powered ``The
Green Mile''; it was a Frank Darabont adaptation of a Stephen King
prison drama _ just like earlier nominations hog ``The Shawshank
Redemption'' _ and it starred Oscar golden boy Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Cider House,'' Miramax bought that one. The distributor
_ which has famously taken out increasingly unprecedented amounts
of campaign ads in the movie trade papers for eventual Oscar
showhorses ``Il Postino,'' ``The English Patient,'' ``Life Is
Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ has been bombarding
voters with ``Cider'' propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Disney division gave its Paramount co-production
``Ripley'' similarly lavish promotion, and that one got blanked in
the best picture race, as did its director (``Patient'' Oscar
winner Anthony Minghella) and subtly mesmerizing star Matt Damon.
But it's also apparent that the dark-hued ``Ripley'' is the kind of
uncompromising work that brought Miramax recognition in the more
independent days of ``The Crying Game,'' ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``The
Piano.'' In recent times, they've won more Oscars with sweeter,
less-radical fare _ and ``Cider House'' is nothing if not the most
conservative abortion-rights movie ever made, in the grand
tradition of softball Hollywood issue pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Cider'' surge sets up an even more expensive replay of
last year's promotional war between Miramax and DreamWorks, when
the Spielberg studio saw ``Shakespeare'' snatch victory from its
front-runner ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The quality gap between
DreamWorks' rigorous current favorite ``American Beauty'' and the
Miramax spoiler is measurably wider this time, but that won't stop
the ad frenzy. This year's real winners? The Hollywood trade
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tying ``Cider'' for second-most nominations (seven,
compared to ``Beauty's'' eight), momentum does not appear to be
with the fifth best picture contender, ``The Insider.'' It could,
however, be building for the film's lead actor nominee, Russell
Crowe. Consider: Designated front-runner Denzel Washington's
historically suspect ``The Hurricane'' gleaned only a single
nomination _ for his performance _ while the chameleonlike
Australian's historically suspect picture maintained much wider
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gotta say, the academy did itself proud with the rest of that
field. Spacey, of course, was a no-brainer. But recognizing Richard
Farnsworth for his delicate ``Straight Story'' work and vocal Oscar
detractor Sean Penn for the substantial achievement of not acting
like Woody Allen in a Woody Allen film earns a quiet but heartfelt
bravo.
</P>
<P>
   As does the academy's refusal, for the second year in a row, to
acknowledge a Jim Carrey caricature. Yes, the voters do appear
biased against the approval-seeking funnyman, but not because he's
a comedian; he just hasn't played a convincingly human character
yet.
</P>
<P>
   However, snubbing Eddie Murphy for his dual role in
``Bowfinger'' _ that's prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   An overview of the acting categories shows a majority (11) of
first-time nominees, some of whom did edgy work in cool films
(``Boys Don't Cry's'' Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny,
``Malkovich's'' Catherine Keener). But there's an overriding safe
pattern to the acting choices. Wise kids (Haley Joel Osment), mutes
(Samantha Morton), self-sacrificing African-Americans (Michael
Clarke Duncan), and accent-throwing Brits and Aussies (Janet
McTeer, Michael Caine, Jude Law, Toni Collette, Crowe) are
long-running Oscar-race stereotypes, regardless of how well-done.
</P>
<P>
   Even the vastly deserving Tom Cruise was probably nominated as
much for being a Hollywood rainmaker as for the intense, lacerating
originality of his ``Magnolia'' ensemble turn. And, really, yet
another nomination for Meryl Streep just because she learned to
play the fiddle? Nothing like rote academy thinking, abetted by one
of those Miramax campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The director's branch did try to appear hipper than usual by
bestowing four first-time nominations, and two to debutante feature
filmmakers (``Beauty's'' Sam Mendes and ``Malkovich's'' Spike
Jonze). And the writers, as usual, generally made the smartest
choices, though much more so in the original (all gems) than the
adapted (where ``Election'' and ``Ripley'' were finely judged)
division.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of these and a few other bones tossed to those
challenging (``The Matrix's'' technical innovations, a snarky
``South Park'' song), the Oscar race this year, at least at this
point, is looking like it might be another case of hype trumping
artistic merit. There are enough good nominees to prevent this
eventuality, though. As previously noted, many filmmakers made
exciting efforts last year to grow the medium into the 21st
century. The academy has until March 26 to join the parade. &QL;

WHO'S THE BOSS? WHO'S A WORKER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, a group of temporary employees at ARCO sued the oil
company, arguing that they were really full-time workers who
deserved better benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
touched off a firestorm of protest from Republicans and business
executives by seeming to suggest that all home offices would be
subject to ergonomic inspections.
</P>
<P>
   And in a continuing investigation, the New York state attorney
general is trying to force Manhattan food stores to pay the minimum
wage to delivery people the stores say are employed by an outside
company.
</P>
<P>
   What the three disputes have in common is a confusion over the
definition of what a worker is, and even what the workplace is, in
the new world of telecommuting, flextime and outsourcing. And the
confusion is widespread, as high-profile cases involving Microsoft
and Time Warner have shown. ``The modern workplace has changed
beyond the ability of the law and the regulations to keep up with
it,'' said Dudley C. Rochelle, a partner at Littler Mendelson, an
employment law firm based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In decades past, the picture was fairly clear. If you worked in
an office or factory, you generally worked for the company that ran
it. Its name appeared on your paycheck. At home, you were no longer
working.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, however, the picture became blurred by two
population explosions: one of telecommuters who did some work at
home; the other of temporary employees who worked part time or
under contract. As a result, courts and lawmakers across the
country are struggling to figure out how to apply employment laws
written before flexible work arrangements became so popular.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming years, said Scott H. Dunham, a partner in the
labor and employment law department of the law firm of O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers, executives, regulators and lawyers ``are going to spend a
tremendous amount of time and resources trying to figure out
whether someone is covered'' in different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary workers have received more attention than
telecommuters because the stakes for Corporate America are higher,
lawyers said. That is especially true for ``perma-temps,'' who have
more-or-less permanent office jobs but are paid by outside
placement agencies. Sometimes, these employees are let go and then
rehired every few months to justify their temporary classification,
which enables the company where they work to withhold health and
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Judges and elected officials seem to be coming down on the side
of the workers who challenge this arrangement. If somebody
regularly reports to work at one company and takes orders from its
managers, their reasoning goes, that person is an employee.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York case, deliverymen from a number of supermarkets
held a rally outside of a Fairway grocery store in October to ask
for better wages. The protest against the supermarkets lasted only
a few days, but it helped the workers win an important ally:
Attorney General Elliot L. Spitzer. Spitzer subsequently sued Food
Emporium, another supermarket, accusing it of paying its deliverers
about $1 an hour before tips, a violation of the state's
minimum-wage law. He is also investigating other chains. A&AMP;P, which
owns Food Emporium, argues that the men are employees of a separate
delivery company, while the lawsuit notes that they report to store
employees and sometimes do work in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in the ARCO, Microsoft and Time Warner cases centers
on benefits. Last month, the Supreme Court decided not to review an
appeals court decision that temporary Microsoft workers must
receive the same retirement benefits, including discounted stock,
as regular employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to recover a lot of money,'' said Christine
Jolls, an assistant professor specializing in employment law at the
Harvard Law School. The ARCO and Time Warner cases have not been
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some companies have reacted to the original Microsoft
decision by getting rid of temporary workers before they can be
considered permanent, lawyers said. Others will make temporary
workers sign documents that specify their pay and benefits, Jolls
said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the main court cases revolve around temporary workers,
telecommuters are in the news, too. In November, OSHA posted a
letter on its Web site saying that if a company permitted people to
telecommute, then the home office was covered by the same safety
rules as a traditional office. When the Washington Post reported on
the letter in early January, corporate executives and lawmakers
blasted the plan, raising the specter of Big Brother coming into
people's homes to inspect the angle of their desk chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman ordered the letter pulled from the
Web site and said OSHA would give the matter further study. The
agency later announced that the ergonomics rules applied only to
home workplaces where other employees besides the home owner
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Though the uproar died down, many lawyers think the larger
question of how work rules apply to home offices remains
unresolved. That is because the number of telecommuters will
continue to soar, they say, and along the way, companies and
workers are sure to clash over who is eligible for telecommuting
programs, how to count overtime hours or which side is liable for
sexual harassment that may occur between a telecommuter and a
company's customer.
</P>
<P>
   The ad hoc nature of most telecommuting programs adds to the
likelihood of trouble, experts said. According to a survey last
month by the American Management Association, only 7 percent of
American workers at big companies had received formal training on
how to work at home before they began telecommuting.

&HT;     DUSTY IS AS DUSTY DOES
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ My mother, my grandmother and all my female
ancestors took pride in keeping a spotless house, in which the
glassware sparkled, the woodwork gleamed and the presence of dust
bunnies was virtually a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   This artistic achievement did not happen with the wave of a
wand. For generations, the war on grungy households was demanding,
time-consuming, unending _ and boring.
</P>
<P>
   On her first visit to Washington's famed National Gallery of
Art, my mother ran her gloved hand across the frame of an important
picture, peered disgustedly at her fingers' sudden grey appearance
and muttered, ``Doesn't anyone dust in here?'' She appreciated the
art but she couldn't help the dust check. She was programmed that
way.
</P>
<P>
   But the dirty little secret about the consequences of women
flooding the work force over the last 30 years is that traditional
household chores are getting short shrift in the rush for a pay
check.
</P>
<P>
   Standards of domestic cleanliness and the careful polishing of
objects have fallen. There are only so many hours in the day, and
something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   A new study reported by USA Today reveals that women spent 11
1/2 hours a week less on housework in 1995 than they did in 1965.
The hours fell regardless of whether women were single, married,
had children or were young or old.
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for labor-saving inventions, modern appliances and
the availability of paid part-time housekeepers, that represents a
major decline in domestic tidiness.
</P>
<P>
   Men, the survey reports, have picked up only some of the hours
women no longer assign to the mop and pail. Husbands did about 4
1/2 hours of housework a week in 1965 and had a little more than
doubled it to 9 1/2 hours in 1995. Big deal. In the gender division
of household labor, men still have it easier. Women still put in 15
 &QC;  hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   The great change is in a newly relaxed attitude. Few families
notice any longer, or care, if the floor is clean enough to eat off
of. Friends don't either. ``What will the neighbors think?'' no
longer strikes terror in the feminine heart, and a good thing too.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays we are not preoccupied with neat, pristine
surroundings. It is enough to be warm and comfortable beneath a
roof that does not leak.
</P>
<P>
   Home may be where we live, but that does not mean we must have a
burning desire to make the bed every morning.
</P>
<P>
   Experts argue about the meaning of all this. It really comes,
however, as no surprise. The way we live has changed drastically in
dozens of ways. More than just the lifetime goals and career
opportunities of women have been transformed. Our clothing is more
casual, our relationships are more flexible, our priorities more
focused on monetary goals outside the home than the visual
perfection inside it.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Today survey, quoted from a book, ``Time for Life,'' by
John Robinson and Geoffrey Godbey, listed the reasons given by
those surveyed for lowering their cleaning standards. At the top
was lack of time, second was that there is ``more to life than
cleaning'', third and fourth were variations on that theme, and the
fifth was my personal favorite: The place ``will get dirty again.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue with that? Few other things we do except cook
meals and tend to personal hygiene need doing all over again so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a people we cling to the notion that tending house
deserves a high social priority perhaps because a filthy carpet and
dusty objects offend our sense of good taste. Wealthy women
regularly used to change their slip covers, rugs and draperies from
winter to summer weight with the shifting of the seasons. They had,
naturally, scores of servants to help in this daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Even though we don't scrub down dutifully any more, we still
like the idea of doing it. Or hiring someone else to do it. It
wouldn't do to act like a slob.
</P>
<P>
   That is why First Lady Hillary Clinton felt compelled to slip
the news that she is familiar with the uses of her kitchen into her
18-minute commercial introducing her candidacy for a U.S. Senate
seat from New York. She bragged that she made a mean salad and
could do an omelet too. No mention of dust cloths.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is as irrelevant to her qualifications for the
Senate as New York Mayor Rudolph Guiliani's agility with a broom.
Would he recognize one if he saw it?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it is still women who bear the bigger responsibility of
having a clean household even though their own standards are
slipping. Yet since voters don't care if Guiliani knows a washing
machine from a dish-washer, they shouldn't care if Clinton does.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Searching for ways to combat Internet attacks,
President Clinton turned Tuesday to America's high-tech leaders,
law enforcement officials and a hacker named Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Although he called last week's successful assaults on several
popular Web sites ``a wake-up call'' to the country, Clinton
downplayed the damage done to Internet commerce and security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an electronic Pearl Harbor,'' he said at a
meeting in the White House Cabinet Room with 29 industry
representatives as well as national security experts and Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should leave here with this vast sense of
insecurity,'' Clinton said. ``We ought to leave here with a sense
of confidence that this is a challenge that was entirely
predictable. It's part of the price of the success of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial idea of the session was to address the problem of
terrorists using cyberspace. But Clinton said a blizzard of
assaults last week that disabled some of the nation's most popular
Web sites _ among them CNN.com, eBay, Yahoo!, Amazon.com and ETrade
_ convinced him that the government needs to focus on protecting
the Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, he promised to provide $9 million in
``start-up money'' for a high-tech security institute to study ways
to improve Internet security. But the president stressed that
security on the Internet should be improved without jeopardizing
the entrepreneurial potential of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to keep cyberspace open and free,'' Clinton
said. ``At the same time, computer networks (must be) more secure
and resilient and we have to do more to protect privacy and civil
liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators think the cyber attacks against the Web
sites were perpetrated by one or more assailants who hacked into
computer systems including those at Stanford University and on at
least two campuses in the University of California system. The
assailants then directed those large, powerful systems to flood the
Web sites with data, causing them to fail for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Companies represented in Tuesday's meeting included America
Online, Yahoo!, 3Com, Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems, MCI
Worldcom, IBM, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett Packard, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant was Mudge, nickname for a member of a
``think tank'' of hackers who are security consultants operating
under the name  &LR; Stake. Mudge refused to give his name, but the
White House released a list of participants that included an  &LR; Stake
representative named Peiter Zatko of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because I know how the people who broke into the
those Web sites think,'' said the long-haired Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   The president emphasized that private industry should lead the
way in solving the Internet security problem with the government
playing only a ``minimal role,'' such as coordinating industry
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The industry security representatives agreed, saying they did
not want a large government presence on the Internet. Instead, they
pledged to share information ``regarding cyber attacks,
vulnerabilities, counter-measures and security practices'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has a lot to do, certainly by example and
education, but the private sector has to drive the security of the
Internet,'' said Charles Wang, chief executive of Computer
Associates International, a business software firm in Islandia,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge said, ``Every business on the Internet gets hurt when a
Web site is broken into because it makes people afraid of using the
Internet so it's in the interest of businesses to help each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most participants said the attacks were not
catastrophic, Thomas Noonan, CEO of the Atlanta-based Internet
Security Systems, said they signaled that ``an arms race'' was
under way, pitting the government and computer industry against
cyber-hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan said he told Clinton in the closed-door meeting that it
is next to impossible to stop a cyber terrorist from launching an
attack. ``But what we can do is make sure our systems are not
vulnerable, and we can make sure that our networks are capable of
detecting and responding to any attacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such security capability, which would ensure that U.S.
e-commerce can run smoothly and fend off attacks, will cost up to
$50 billion, Noonan said. ``We have built our new economy on a
vulnerable infrastructure. You'd never build a skyscraper on a
foundation full of holes. But that's just what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan said the group advised the president, ``For God's sake,
lead by example. The government's computers are some of the most
vulnerable out there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a computer believed to have been used in last week's
attacks was seized by federal agents, according to Hillsboro, Ore.,
Police Sgt. Allen Zaugg, head of a group of officers trained for
high-tech cases. The FBI is now analyzing that computer, which was
seized within the last two days from a home business in the
Portland, Ore., area, a federal official in Washington said,
requesting anonymity. The computer's owner apparently was not aware
the computer was used as part of the attacks, the official said.
The FBI also was seeking to interview several hackers known by
their Internet screen names, including one who calls himself
``mafiaboy'' and another who calls himself ``coolio,'' the official
said.

<P>
   QUM, Iran _ In this most devout of Iranian cities, a battle to
emancipate the nation's rigidly controlled political life is being
waged by a stern black-turbaned cleric with impeccable Islamic
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Operating from a dingy converted photography studio in the
center of town, Ayatollah Sayed Mohsen Musavi Tabrizi heads a list
of reform candidates for Parliament. Many of his competitors are
his fellow Qum clerics, who are campaigning for the Feb. 18
elections on a platform of calling for purging the country of
``deviant thoughts'' and Western influence.
</P>
<P>
   In Qum, the historic training ground for religious reformers and
reactionaries alike, all the extremes of modern Iran are on
display. But the country's politics can not be explained in simple
terms of conservative vs. liberal or even religious vs. secular.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing expresses the subtleties involved better than the
presence of a religious leader of Tabrizi's prestige in the loose
national coalition of political neophytes who, in the name of
progress, want to loosen the clergy's stranglehold on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the debate about political and cultural openness that
has emerged in the last two and half years around the country rages
even stronger here,'' said Tabrizi, sitting cross-legged on the
floor of his office, which contains nothing but a mobile phone and
an antiquated gray telephone. ``At the same time,'' he added, ``the
opposition to those ideas is stronger in Qum than in many places.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabrizi's own daughter, Nafiseh Musavi, for instance, is firmly
in favor of the laws requiring women to cover themselves with the
chador, a head-to-toe cloak, that were put in place by the clergy
after their revolution deposed the shah and brought them to power
21 years ago. But she is an avid supporter of reform of the
clergy's powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, reform would mean that not just one small group of
people will dominate society and tell us what to think,'' said Mrs.
Musavi, 27. ``It's just better if more people can speak out. It
wouldn't be against Islam if we could have the opportunity to
express ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Tabrizi's headquarters, a steady stream of turbaned
Muslim clerics hurried along the potholed streets, their tan cloaks
billowing in the breeze. Every few yards, several stopped to
examine the campaign posters pasted to store windows and walls for
many of the 71 candidates who are competing for Qum's three
parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
   Across Iran more than 8,000 people are running for 290 seats.
Many proclaim themselves to be independents, but the best-known
candidates are loosely organized into parties and factions that
define themselves by their opposition or support for the policies
of the reformist president, Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The race has been particularly strained in Qum, as the
candidates compete to speak in the city's many mosques and
theological schools.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a group of about 30 religious teachers issued an
appeal here to voters to elect only those who believe religion
should dictate all cultural, economic and social policy.
</P>
<P>
   The hard feelings have not abated, although it is clear the
clergy does not speak with one voice even here. ``There has been
just too much disrespect,'' said Ali Akbar Garibazad, a young
mullah who has been studying in Qum for 10 years. ``In the area of
culture and openness, we've gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, though, another cleric, Hassan Ansari, argued
in favor of open debate on Iran's future _ including the role of
the religious establishment that Iran's constitution puts in charge
of most security forces, the judiciary and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Khatami forces say they are trying to create a civil
society, but what does that entail?'' said Ansari, who described
himself as a Khatami supporter. ``That's what we need to discuss.
The roots of what they are talking about are in Western values and
this is an Islamic society. But we don't want to dismiss out of
hand everything that comes from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for its glorious blue-domed mosques, Qum is a drab city
of low brick buildings and musty shops selling honey-soaked
pistachio candy. But it occupies a hallowed place in Iranian
history as a theological center for Shiite Islam for 10 centuries.
Its narrow alleyways and simple houses provided sanctuary for the
fiery clerics whose protests eventually forced the shah of that era
to create the first national Parliament in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the 1979 revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, lived here, too, and it was in Qum that he developed and
taught his concept of a 20th century theocracy that ultimately
brought down the monarchy and became the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, also a cleric of the ayatollah rank, began his own
religious and political education in Qum, as did nearly every one
of the country's powerful religious figures in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Tabrizi, the reform candidate and a product of the city's
network of religious schools and complicated system of loyalties to
prominent ayatollahs, is the ultimate insider. Jailed as a
subversive by Muhammad Reza Shah, he served at 27 as one of the
youngest members of the first post-revolution Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Now 47, he directs his own theological school and, more
important, is a member of the Assembly of Experts, a body of 70
religious scholars chosen by their peers to make the most important
political decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Tabrizi said he made his decision to run for Parliament only a
few days before the deadline for filing. Colleagues and friends, he
said, urged him to run when it became clear that the pro-Khatami
forces did not have a prominent figure to lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in many other cities, the moderates had rounded up dozens of
people to run out of fear that many of the most liberal candidates
would be disqualified by the country's hard-line Council of
Guardians. In the end, fewer than one in 10 were disqualified,
leaving some districts with bloated lists of relative unknowns
vying for the moderate vote.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The intense interest in this election has caused headaches for
the hard-line forces as well. ``In past elections, people voted for
the candidates that the theological teachers' society told them to
vote for,'' said Saeed Ali Akbar Ahmedi, who was organizing the
distribution of leaflets in support of the three candidates
supported by the hard-line teachers group. ``This year many more
people entered the race without their backing and so nothing is
really clear.''
</P>
<P>
   While he has been endorsed by many reform parties and groups,
Tabrizi said he still considers himself an independent. He said he
is interested in economic policy and ``economic security,'' usually
a code phrase for creating a climate that will attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   He also alluded, indirectly, to some of the more controversial
court cases of recent years, including the arrest of newspaper
editors and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also feel the limits of judicial power should be clear and
that political issues should not enter into the judiciary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away from his main campaign headquarters, the
women's brigade of the reform movement was busy mobilizing to
capture the votes of young women. The minimum voting age is 16.
</P>
<P>
   Zahra Nouri, Tabrizi's wife and one of the main organizers, said
that those who oppose Khatami's policies regularly misstate his
aims. ``Their concept of our movement is that if there is freedom,
then all the women will take off their chadors and the parks will
be filled with young women and men who will sit together,'' she
said. ``They are afraid they will lose their power and influence
over how people will live.''

WHEN YOUNG MANAGERS DELIVER THE PINK SLIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic on how to fire employees is being sent to NYT
graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can make individual purchase by

 (bl)  
 By CHARLES BUTLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were in high school or college when the great wave of
layoffs swept Corporate America in the early 1990s. And while they
heard stories about neighbors who had lost their jobs, they didn't
give them much thought.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these 20-somethings are thriving in the longest economic
boom in American history. Many are managers, and holding onto
employees, not letting them go, is their main concern. But when
pink slips must be delivered, these young bosses often have to
deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear was, I don't want this girl to walk out of
here and hate me,'' said Michelle Anderson, the accounting manager
for the MA&AMP;A Group, a consulting firm in Atlanta, who at 26 fired a
female associate more than six years her senior last April. It was
a first for her, and it was an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, she had to repeat the process, firing the
associate's replacement for theft.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, managers have always had to dismiss underlings when
their performance lagged or the company's profits sagged. Even
Internet success stories like Amazon.com and iVillage.com recently
had to trim their staffs for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But not so long ago, the bearer of bad tidings was usually an
old pro, or at least someone old enough to know how to cope with
the emotions surrounding it. Today, increasingly, the dirty work is
done by people a few years out of college for whom management has
mostly meant recruiting employees with stock options and playing
the host at happy hours.
</P>
<P>
   And their inexperience can create problems for companies. For
instance, several employment lawyers say they are noticing an
increase in age-discrimination suits resulting from the way young
managers dismissed older workers. According to Rosemary Alito, an
attorney with McCarter &AMP; English in Newark, age discrimination ``is
becoming more an issue where you have younger people in high-level
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many Internet companies and other start-ups are likely
to be targets for suits because they often do not even have
human-resources departments in place to conduct dismissals
properly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, says Adin Goldberg, a lawyer with
Whitman Breed Abbot &AMP; Morgan in New York, many young managers are
not practiced in politically correct office-speak. Goldberg
recently advised a company to settle an age-discrimination suit
involving a 25-year-old sales manager who fired a salesman in his
50s. The employee said the manager repeatedly made references to
wanting ``a fresh approach'' in the office. While the phrase is
vague, Goldberg said, most juries would interpret it as denigrating
to the older worker.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the legal implications, young executives are often
unequipped to handle the emotional side of firings. For Jennifer
Floren, 28, the chief executive of experience inc., a Boston
Internet company she founded in 1996, the memory of one of her
first dismissals remains vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman burst into tears and started screaming, `This is so
unfair. How could you do this to me? Please give me one more
chance,' '' said Floren, whose Web site, www.experienceinc.com,
provides career advice to college graduates. ``It is so tempting to
say, `OK, stay one more day, one more week.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While she avoided making that concession, she has hired a
human-resources manager to handle personnel issues, including
dismissals, at the 65-employee company.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives of the MA&AMP;A Group in Atlanta would not let
Anderson, or any of its other managers, dismiss an employee without
their going through training sessions. In the days leading up to
the morning last April when she would let her first employee go,
Anderson spent several hours with the company's human-resources
manager, Ellen Warden, in role-playing simulations. The coaching
prepared her for possible reaction, from tears to tirades, and
provided a script to deliver the news sensitively but legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had rehearsed so much, I think I was a tape-recorder,''
Anderson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the firing, after a bad night's sleep, she got to
work earlier than usual and paced the hallways. As soon as the
employee arrived, she was called into a conference room where
Anderson, accompanied by Warden, dismissed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went a lot better than I expected,'' Anderson recalled.
``The woman said to me, `I know this is probably harder for you
than me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not every 20-something goes through such an
emotional crisis. ``Of course it gnaws at your stomach because you
have the fate of someone in your hands,'' said one young executive
of a Manhattan high-technology start-up who fired an employee
during the Christmas holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   But, added the executive, who requested anonymity for fear of
scaring off prospective employees, ``We were confident he could get
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Other young managers take a similarly businesslike approach.
Court Coursey, 27, says it was hard for him to lay off five
employees shortly after the company he founded, certifiedmail.com.,
was acquired by WebMD Inc., in 1998, ``especially in a high-growth
company where it's a team-like atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   But, added Coursey, who now runs a holding company that develops
Internet companies, ``At the end of the day it's a business, and
you have to make hard business decisions.''

   RAMPART-INVESTIGATION (Los Angeles) _ After months of
controversy over the LAPD Rampart Division corruption scandal, Los
Angeles leaders took a new step Tuesday that shows how the city's
leadership intends to try and deal with it. As City Councilman and
mayoral candidate Joel Wachs and some community group leaders were
calling for an independent investigation, the City Council and
Police Chief said it would be premature and called instead for the
city to provide new funds to the civilian Police Commission, which
will receive the LAPD Board of Inquiry report by March 1. By Rick

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ At Ming's Restaurant on Wednesday evening,
the main attraction wasn't the Peking duck, it was Bill Lee,
cofounder and president of RemarQ Communities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, an affable and modest if overachieving 29-year-old, told
the story to a transfixed crowd of 120 other Asian Americans of how
he gave up a six-figure salary as an attorney to start a company in
an unheated garage in San Rafael, 15 miles north of the Golden Gate
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1996 with just $6,000, was sold two
weeks ago for ``several hundred million'' dollars. As far as
Silicon Valley goes, it was a typical Internet Cinderella story,
complete with perilous moments and happy ending. And it was just
what the audience wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very inspiring,'' remarked Yiping Zhu, who came to hear
Lee at the monthly meeting of the Chinese Software Professionals
Association with his friend John Cao.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu and Cao, who met on a whitewater rafting trip sponsored by
one of the dozens of Asian-American technology-oriented
organizations in the Bay Area, are contemplating their own Internet
start-up. Cao is a consultant with KPMG; Zhu once worked for KPMG
and is now employed by iPrint.com, an online provider of commercial
printing services.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly surprising that so many Asians work in technology
companies in Silicon Valley. For years, the region has beckoned
immigrants from across the ocean with its rags-to-riches tales. One
out of five engineers and scientists in the Valley are Asian
immigrants, according to a study by AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor
at the University of California at Berkeley's Department of City
and Regional Planning. The figure doesn't even count the growing
numbers of young Asian-American professionals whose ancestors
immigrated to the United States years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is that many of these technically savvy Asians are
striking out on their own, following in the footsteps of Internet
pioneers such as Jerry Yang, the Taiwanese-born cofounder of Yahoo
Inc., and Sabeer Bhatia, a native of India who started Hotmail
Corp. and then sold it to Microsoft Corp. two years ago for $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the US-born Lee, the story was much the same. After
graduating from law and business schools at the University of
California at Los Angeles, Lee went to work at a law firm. One
Friday evening, as he was toiling on a legal brief, he got a
fateful call from a friend, Craig Wallace, who asked him to forsake
his job and start a company in Wallace's parents' garage. To his
parents' dismay, Lee agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In that garage, Lee learned an early lesson: ``When you've got
nothing, don't act as if you have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   His confident talk caught the ear of a venture capitalist at
Benchmark Capital, who sent his partners to check out the company.
Lee and Wallace, flying by the seat of their pants without even a
business plan, forgot to put titles on their freshly printed
business cards. When asked about the lack of titles, Lee bluffed,
saying the company didn't believe in hierarchy. At the end of the
week, Benchmark wired the fledgling company $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   RemarQ, based in San Jose, changed course several times before
settling on its current focus: running online message boards for
companies such as Siebel Systems and AltaVista. Last month,
Critical Path Inc., an Internet messaging company, agreed to buy
RemarQ for an undiclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Zhu and Cao joined a small crowd that
fluttered around Lee, peppering him with questions about venture
capital and board members.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Lihong Cai, marketing manager for e-Commerce
Technology Inc. in Cupertino. Cai said he enjoyed hearing about the
mistakes Lee made along the way and the near-death moments when Lee
and his partner had to write cash-advance checks from their
personal credit cards to pay employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked was that he was very honest about everything,''
said Cai, whose company was also founded by an Asian entrepreneur.
``He didn't make it seem like it was all perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, beaming from his newfound status as role model, offered the
following fortune-cookie advice: ``It's critical to make contacts,
to attend events like this.''

NET SECURITY FIRMS REAPING GAINS FROM ONLINE VANDALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Miami)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's spate of online vandalism wasn't a disaster for one
group of Internet companies _ the ones that make hardware and
software systems to keep online companies safe.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the world's most popular Web sites, including the
Yahoo Web portal and the eBay Internet auction site, were knocked
offline for hours last week. An unknown vandal used software that
sent a stream of false messages to the Web sites. So many of these
messages were sent that they overwhelmed the sites, blocking
legitimate traffic.
</P>
<P>
   To fend off such attacks, Internet companies are taking a hard
look at computer software and hardware that can detect and block
attacks before they can do any damage. And the companies that
produce such products have pounced on the opportunity to tout their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investors bid up share prices of firms like Internet
Security Systems Inc. and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.,
which make scanning software to detect attacks. Even companies like
the data encryption firm Verisign Inc., whose products would have
done nothing to prevent last week's crisis, benefited from a surge
of interest in computer security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of security technologies to an infrastructure has
gone up very considerably,'' said Abner Germanow, an Internet
security researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller firms also moved to capitalize on the fiasco. In press
releases, media interviews, and announcements on their Web sites,
companies asserted that their products and services could have
averted the ``denial of service'' assault that shut down major
Internet sites like Yahoo, eBay, and ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new for us,'' said Irv Johnson, director of
technical marketing for Acton-based Arrowpoint Communications Inc.
``We've been talking about this for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson thinks last week's assaults could help win customers
for Arrowpoint's product, a data switch designed to block the kind
of attack used by the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones are sort of ringing off the hook,'' said Johnson.
``We do see this as a good thing, indirectly. . . . The fact that
these (attacks) have made an impact is going to make the industry
more diligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer security consultants at Boston's Zefer Corp. hope
to get a burst of new business from old customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from some of our clients,'' said Amine Mekkaoui,
vice president of Zefer's Internet security consultancy. ``We're
sending them out additional information about what they need to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mekkaoui said Zefer consultants will be ``going
back to our clients and telling them: `This is another example that
will confirm what we've told you before, about why you should be
addressing this issue.' It's more of a confirmation to them, and a
confirmation of our value to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Predictive Systems Inc., a New York consulting firm, vice
president of information security Steph Marr rejects the idea of
using the Internet attacks to scare his customers into paying for
new services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always hoping for an increase in business,'' Marr said.
``I would imagine that something of this nature would increase our
business. Am I actively going out and using fear as a selling
point? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marr urges his customers to see last week's incidents
as a shot across the bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back to our client base and saying: `It's time to
address this issue and make sure this can't happen to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Predictive Systems may get an additional shot of publicity if it
helps authorities track down the culprits. The company specializes
in ``digital forensics,'' the detailed inspection of computer hard
drives to recover data even after it's been deleted. Marr has
offered his firm's help free of charge to the FBI and US Justice
Department to help crack the case.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bycoff, president of Netegrity Inc., says the Waltham,
Mass. firm has focused on protecting e-commerce Web sites from
those who want to break in and steal information, like credit card
numbers. While Bycoff knew about denial-of-service attacks, he
didn't see much interest from customers in being protected from
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been a focus,'' Bycoff said, ``because we all
guessed that the money was on the other side of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Bycoff expects plenty of interest in software for
fending off denial-of-service attacks, and he may add such a
product to the Netegrity line.

 &HT;    Lady Dogs eye `dynasty' label with 4th title
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Swimming in the Olympics is just around the corner for
Kristy Kowal. But the Georgia All-American has other priorities
closer to home before Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   For Kowal and roommate and fellow senior All-American Courtney
Shealy, the start of the SEC swimming and diving championships
today at Auburn University is a chance to cement a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the NCAA champion, unbeaten and top-ranked Lady
Bulldogs aren't even thinking about defending their national crown.
They want to win the conference meet for the fourth year in a row;
it hasn't been done in the SEC since the Florida women dominated in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many years you have to win to put that
dynasty stamp on it, but I think four would do it,'' Georgia coach
Jack Bauerle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia men, ranked 8th nationally, haven't captured the SEC
meet since 1955. No. 3 Auburn is heavily favored to win, but the
Bulldogs have lost only once, last month to No. 1 Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have one of those myself,'' senior All-American
Beau Wiebel said. ``This is the first time in a long while that we
have a chance to win SECs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowal, the American record-holder in the 100- and 200-yard
breaststroke, increased her profile at the Georgia Invitational by
setting an American standard of 2:25.27 in the 200-meter
breastroke. But thoughts of Olympic qualifying this spring will
have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's too much of a distraction, because I've
been training with this team for the past year,'' she said. ``Once
we get past the NCAAs, then I'll start thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia teams have been idle for the last month. Two meets
scheduled for the last week in January were canceled bec icy
weather. Bauerle is eager to see how the men fare, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure where we are with the guys, but we have a bunch
of overachieving young men,'' Bauerle said. ``I like this team. I
think we're capable of pulling off a few surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC SWIMMING, DIVING CHAMPIONSHIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When; where: Today-Saturday; Auburn University.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Format: Preliminary heats are in the mornings and afternoons;
final events are in the evenings.

THE LAUGHS COME ONE AT A TIME

 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Civilization, the magazine of the Library of Congress, notes
wistfully the passing of comedy partnerships. Once, there were
Burns &AMP; Allen, Abbott &AMP; Costello, Martin &AMP; Lewis, Bob and Ray,
Nichols &AMP; May, Rowan &AMP; Martin, the Smothers Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In place of those teams, writes  &UR; Adam Hanft &LR; , ``we have comedy
that is saw-toothed, vulgar, blistering in speed and attack,
careening from joke to joke without pause. Comedy has become a solo
mission, a dangerous high-wire act.''
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to figure out why, Hanft turns to demographics:
``The solitary comic may be a stand-up stand-in for the floating
American _ the single mother, the pensionless retiree, all those
who need to sleep with a night-light. The vulnerable, unpaired
comedian is equally marooned, frightened and honest _ a soldier of
misfortune who is struggling to make sense of the world and win the
unconditional love of a narcissistic audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you all a-giggle? Hanft continues: ``We turn for a reaction,
but there is no one there. So we struggle along to reach the point
beyond pain and isolation, the point of all humor.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. At the end of a  &UR; Jerry Lewis &LR;  tribute at the U.S. Comedy
Arts Festival last weekend, Lewis _ who had been ingratiating and
impressive _ was asked to name his favorite female comedians. ``I
don't like any female comedians,'' he answered. Host  &UR; Martin &LR; 
 &UR; Short &LR;  said surely Lewis must have liked  &UR; Lucille Ball &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' answered Lewis. ``A woman doing comedy doesn't offend
me, but sets me back a bit. I, as a viewer, have trouble with it. I
think of her as a producing machine that brings babies in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Short pleaded with Lewis _ ``You had them! Turn it around! I beg
you!'' _ to soften his statement so as not to turn off what had
been an enthusiastic audience. Listeners could be seen shaking
their heads as they left.

   A charisma crash course in the latest issue of Glamour credits
 &UR; Diane Sawyer &LR;  and  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  with ``IQ Charisma.'' These
women are ``truly charismatic intellectuals,'' says Glamour,
``without needing to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   For evidence, check out the way they ``lean forward, nod their
heads in acknowledgment and make the person they are speaking to
feel like the center of their universe,'' says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But how can everyday women hope to emulate Sawyer and Clinton?
``I always ask lots of probing questions,'' a 29-year-old book
editor named  &UR; Lisa &LR;  told Glamour. ``This gives the impression that
I'm thoughtful.''

   &UR; VOLVO TARGETS AFRICAN AMERICANS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Volvo is beginning a $6 million advertising campaign targeting
African Americans, reports Advertising Age. The first of the ads
will advocate using seat belts. Surveys show that African American
children are half as likely as others to be strapped in, Volvo Vice
President  &UR; Mark LaNeve &LR;  told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will include posters for inner-city schools and ads
on Web sites likely to be seen by African Americans. The line on
the ad is ``Volvo for life.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some publicity last year about Volvo ignoring minority
media, but the company says the new campaign is not in response.

   Civilization, the magazine of the Library of Congress, notes
wistfully the passing of comedy partnerships. Once, there were
Burns &AMP; Allen, Abbott &AMP; Costello, Martin &AMP; Lewis, Bob and Ray,
Nichols &AMP; May, Rowan &AMP; Martin, the Smothers Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In place of those teams, writes  &UR; Adam Hanft &LR; , ``we have comedy
that is saw-toothed, vulgar, blistering in speed and attack,
careening from joke to joke without pause. Comedy has become a solo
mission, a dangerous high-wire act.''
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to figure out why, Hanft turns to demographics:
``The solitary comic may be a stand-up stand-in for the floating
American _ the single mother, the pensionless retiree, all those
who need to sleep with a night-light. The vulnerable, unpaired
comedian is equally marooned, frightened and honest _ a soldier of
misfortune who is struggling to make sense of the world and win the
unconditional love of a narcissistic audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you all a-giggle? Hanft continues: ``We turn for a reaction,
but there is no one there. So we struggle along to reach the point
beyond pain and isolation, the point of all humor.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. At the end of a  &UR; Jerry Lewis &LR;  tribute at the U.S. Comedy
Arts Festival last weekend, Lewis _ who had been ingratiating and
impressive _ was asked to name his favorite female comedians. ``I
don't like any female comedians,'' he answered. Host  &UR; Martin &LR; 
 &UR; Short &LR;  said surely Lewis must have liked  &UR; Lucille Ball &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' answered Lewis. ``A woman doing comedy doesn't offend
me, but sets me back a bit. I, as a viewer, have trouble with it. I
think of her as a producing machine that brings babies in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Short pleaded with Lewis _ ``You had them! Turn it around! I beg
you!'' _ to soften his statement so as not to turn off what had
been an enthusiastic audience. Listeners could be seen shaking
their heads as they left.

ADMINISTRATION FIELDS LATEST DRUG-WAR PLAN AMID CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Armed with embarrassing CIA revisions in estimates
of cocaine produced in Colombia, US drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey
Tuesday launched the Clinton administration's effort in Congress to
win a $1.6 billion aid package aimed at fighting drugs along the
Andean ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The former four-star general took flak from Republicans who said
the administration was woefully slow in responding to the Colombian
threat, and he took heat from Democrats who criticized the program
for not giving goals in drug reduction, a timetable to get out or
an estimate of US troops.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey deflected much of the criticism but warned a House
Government Reform drug policy subcommittee of what he called
``anemic political theater over who lost Colombia. Nobody lost
Colombia. And we're not going to save it. Thirty-six million
Colombians are.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing provided a preview in Congress of a fierce and
lively debate over the next two months on the wisdom of sending a
military mobilization package to help the Colombian government take
back parts of their country from guerrillas and paramilitaries in
order to destroy coca and poppy fields.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, now the third largest recipient of US foreign aid,
produces 80 percent of America's cocaine and the majority of its
heroin. ``The war in Colombia is our war as well as the
Colombians','' said Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana
Republican. ``Every year, 14,000 Americans die from drugs and
drug-related violence.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey later corrected him: ``It's 52,000 dead a year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar was forced to explain why the US government had
underestimated cocaine production by as much as 250 percent in
Peru, Bolivia and Colombia in the past four years. Only last year,
McCaffrey was estimating an increase from Colombia to 320 metric
tons of cocaine, but the CIA estimated 520 tons produced last year,
or 70 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
   The error, he said, stemmed from underestimating potency of new
coca plants and ``new, industrial techniques'' in drug labs. The
revised estimate is now being used by the administration to help
sell the $1.6 billion plan and emphasize the shift of coca
production away from Peru and Bolivia and into Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans argued that the administration should have
proposed a huge military package several years ago. They also
complained that the administration had moved slowly in delivering
military equipment to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairman John L. Mica, a Florida Republican, said
three Blackhawk helicopters sat idle for months because of a lack
of proper armor. And he said 50,000 rounds of ammunition intended
for Colombia was shipped instead to ``the loading docks of the
State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that, unfortunately, we have a gang that can't
shoot straight, or get the ammunition to shoot straight to
Colombia, where it's needed,'' Mica said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, raised
completely different concerns, suggesting the administration's
priorities were misplaced. ``Do we invest in a militaristic drug
war that escalates the regional conflict, in the name of fighting
drugs, or do we attack the drug market by investing in prevention
and treatment at home?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Schakowsky also asked why the effort seemed directed only
against guerrillas, sparing rightist paramilitary fighters accused
of numerous human rights abuses. Paramilitary groups also control
and tax parts of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey challenged Schakowsky's assertion that the military
push into southern Colombia wouldn't affect the paramilitaries. He
said the best route toward peace was confronting the rebels with
force, even though government and guerrilla negotiators made
progress in talks last week in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey cast doubt on whether those negotiations would lead
anywhere. ``Why would you talk, if you're a (guerrilla) front
that's getting hundreds of millions of dollars a year out of the
drug cartels?'' he said. ``I can't imagine, politically, why (the
guerrillas are) doing this.''

BUSH SAYS HE'S A CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRMO, S.C. _ One week after adopting the informal stump style of
Senator John S. McCain, Governor George W. Bush Tuesday took up his
opponent's signature issue, declaring himself ``a reformer when it
comes to how we fund our campaigns'' and pledging new limits on
lobbyist donations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was simply underscoring a longstanding priority of
his own. He denied the initiative sought to muddy McCain's image as
a lonely crusader for reform. But in unveiling a new
campaign-finance proposal just four days before the crucial primary
here _ and unsettling congressional Republicans in the process _
Bush appeared anxious to undercut McCain in any possible way.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking of the Bush proposals is his ban on lobbyist
donations to members of Congress during legislative sessions _ a
notion that drew quick criticism across a wide spectrum, from
congressional Republicans to campaign-finance reform advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused wealthy lobbyists of wielding undue influence with
Congress _ an extension of his recent charge that McCain has spoken
out of both sides of his mouth, opposing the campaign finance
system while accepting, as chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, contributions from executives of firms with interests
before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are reforms that will make the system work better,''
Bush said. ``These are real reforms. These are wholesale reforms.
These are reforms that respect individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly trying to shore up his recent description of
himself as a ``reformer.'' And, in focusing on lobbyists, he picked
a target that many believe resonates with voters. However, Bush's
remedy prompted criticism from many who said it would be
impractical _ if not outright unconstitutional _ to limit federal
campaign donations to a particular time period or to cut off a
particular type of contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
said lobbyists would still find ways to donate large sums to
officials anyway, timing their donations to avoid the legislative
session. Scott Harshbarger, director of Common Cause, said the plan
did not do enough to enact real change, calling Tuesday's
announcement a ``spur of the moment, seat of the pants
hodge-podge.'' Several non-partisan advocates agreed that simply
limiting the timetable for lobbyists would not prevent them from
giving money in the hopes of influencing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed in the sense that I'm impressed with magic
tricks,'' agreed Fred Wertheimer of the nonpartisan Democracy 21.
``And this is an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mark Buse, an aide to McCain on the Senate Commerce
Committee: ``If there's a connection (between donations and
legislation), let's not create some false pretense that a
fundraiser on a Tuesday is different from a fundraiser on a
Saturday or a fundraiser in August. Let's be honest about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress have long opposed a sweeping
overhaul of the campaign finance system, and McCain has suffered
for his efforts to enact one. His legislation, co-sponsored with
Wisconsin Democratic Senator Russell Feingold, would ban so-called
``soft money'' _ largely unregulated donations to party
organzations. Although similar legislation passed in the House, the
latest McCain-Feingold effort failed last November, with a vote of
53 to 47, just short of the number needed to overcome a Republican
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senate aides Tuesday indicated they would be no more
enthusiastic about the Bush plan. One Senate aide, who supports
Bush, said it would ``certainly face opposition.'' John Czwartacki,
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, said it was
``going to be a bitter pill to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes life a lot more difficult for those who are charged
with raising money,'' Czwartacki said, pointing out that when
senators are not in session, they are usually at home and therefore
incapable of soliciting lobbyist funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended both the timing and the content of the
announcement. He said he was confident supporters would recognize
the differences between his plan and McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   For days, he has been pointing out the ``labor loophole'' in
McCain's plan. Bush said that under the current system, labor union
leaders are able to use union dues for whatever political purpose
they wish. When he railed against that Tuesday, the crowd here
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know that I have a plan,'' he said later at a
news conference. ``I've been talking about it ever since I've been
on the trail...And somehow, people keep asking me, they say, When
are you going to have a campaign funding reform plan? There should
be no question in anybody's mind that I'm now on the record with a
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain welcomed Bush to the campaign finance reform, and said he
would be happy to discuss a real substantive proposal. But he did
poke fun at what appeared to be Bush's adoption of his every move.
``The next thing you know he's going to be moving to Arizona,''
McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, said.

MARKETPLACE: WAL-MART'S HUGE SLICE OF THE AMERICAN PIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Propelled by strong growth in its superstores and international
operations, Wal-Mart Stores reported another year of record sales
and profits on Tuesday. So, naturally, its stock declined.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer, the largest in the world, said that its revenues
for the year ended Jan. 31 were a whopping $165 billion, a 20
percent increase from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was all the more impressive because it came on the
heels of a 17 percent revenue expansion last year and a 12 percent
increase the year before, proving that the juggernaut is only
gaining speed.
</P>
<P>
   To put those sales in perspective, total retail spending in the
United States was $3 trillion in 1999, according to the National
Bureau on Income Statistics. So, stripping out income from
international stores, which was some $22 billion, Wal-Mart accounts
for nearly 5 percent of the entire American pie.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was sales growth big at Wal-Mart, it was broad. Every
division, from Sam's Warehouse club to the discount stores,
reported gains in sales and profits (the international division
actually saw revenues expand by 85 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The retailer's profits rose 26 percent, or $1.25 a diluted
share, for the full year. For the fourth quarter, the company
earned 43 cents a share, ahead of the 42 cent estimate of Wall
Street analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded to the good-news fest by unloading stock.
Wal-Mart's shares slid by 87.5 cents to $58, largely on concerns
that the retailer would be hard pressed to exceed this year's
blistering growth. In a conference call with stock analysts, Les
Scott, the company's chief executive, added to the worries by
warning that the company would have to contend with higher oil
prices and higher costs of labor. Wal-Mart, which is based in
Bentonville, Ark., and has about a million Americans working for
it, is the largest employer in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is also experiencing a cyclical problem. Retail stocks
have been depressed by investors' concerns that continuing
increases in interest rates by Federal Reserve policy-makers will
dampen consumer demand in the upcoming year. ``The stock's softness
is more a reflection of institutional investors' concerns about how
a Fed hike will effect consumer spending,'' said Jeff Feiner, a
retail analyst with Lehman brothers. ``But the underlying
fundamentals of the business will continue to be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wal-Mart, which tends to err on the side of caution when
predicting future growth, is positioned for another banner year.
For starters, it is still expanding its supercenters. Supercenters
are outsized stores that combine discount store merchandise with
groceries and a pharmacy, and they have been a particularly
profitable form of retailing. Wal-Mart built 157 of these monsters
last year and predicted an equally aggressive expansion for this
year.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Wal-Mart actually could benefit from higher
interest rates. Who better to benefit from consumers watching the
bottom line than a chain famous for its low prices? Gucci and
Tiffany's might sweat a Fed increase, but Wal-Mart is full of
consumer necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while rising wages and fuel prices are tough on
businesses, Wal-Mart is better prepared than its competition.
``Wal-Mart can spread out fuel and labor costs over a dense volume
of merchandise because they are more efficient,'' said Burt
Flickinger III, managing director of Reach Marketing, a Westport,
Conn.-based marketing consulting firm. ``It could be a critical
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In other news, the company declined to confirm or deny a report
in the retail industry trade paper, Women's Wear Daily, that it was
set to purchase Fruit of the Loom, the apparel manufacturer that
filed for bankruptcy protection last December. Wal-Mart has had
great success in revitalizing once defunct apparel makers, like
Faded Glory and Catalina, and making them into profitable house
brands.

ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP ENDORSES GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice president Al Gore picked up an unusual early
endorsement from the country's biggest abortion rights group
Tuesday _ an endorsement apparently timed to take some steam out of
rival Bill Bradley's effort to question Gore's record on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, meanwhile, snared the backing of local members of the
Teamsters union in Atlantic City, N.J., taking a chip out of Gore's
image as organized labor's favored candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Both events reflected more the politics of the Democratic
presidential primary, than policy differences between the two men.
Both Bradley and Gore are vocal proponents of abortion rights, and
both have energetically sought labor backing.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the public backing by the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League _ which rarely endorses in a
primary election _ may give the vice president cover from the
relentless attack by Bradley on Gore's uneven abortion record.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the endorsement by the local Teamsters members
reminds voters that while Gore has snagged endorsements of union
leadership, the rank-and-file may still go for Bradley. Although
Gore had already clinched the endorsement of the union's parent
group, the AFL-CIO, a majority of delegates representing 450,000
Teamsters in the Eastern Region from Maine to South Carolina
expressed support for Bradley's candidacy in a non-binding vote
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the AFL-CIO called the vote ``a spontaneous
expression of support'' and said it would not affect the union's
official backing of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In backing Gore Tuesday, NARAL president Kate Michelman talked
less about Gore than she did about the ``divisive'' fight between
the Democratic candidates on abortion rights _ a clear reference to
Bradley's ongoing assault on Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat to this freedom (to have an abortion) is too great
to be used in a divisive, political way,'' Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also criticized Bradley's tactics, although Gore did not
once mention the former New Jersey Senator by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot play political games on an issue as fundamental as a
woman's right to choose,'' Gore told a small crowd at a Washington
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The NARAL endorsement was a blow to Bradley, who had put Gore on
the defensive on the issue. But Bradley plans continue hammering
Gore on his opposition, early in his political career, to federal
funding for abortions and for writing to constituents in the 1980s
that abortion was ``arguably the taking of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised that NARAL would support Al Gore since he
had an 84 percent right to life record and I've had a 99 percent
NARAL record,'' Bradley said after speaking to students at an
Orthodox Jewish school in Brooklyn, N.Y. `I don't understand it. I
think they need to explain it a little better than they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has depicted Gore as a Washington insider who is
beholden to special interests, said of the endorsement: ``This is
what a Washington-based interest group would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's lifetime record with NARAL is, in fact, stronger than
even he would have it: Bradley has a 99 percent rating; Gore, 61.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman was moved to make the endorsement because she was
worried the Republicans, whose party platform opposes abortion,
would use the fight betwen Bradley and Gore to weaken the eventual
nominee, said a Democratic strategist close to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate got angry with Bradley when he made that attack'' against
Gore, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the endorsement was intended to quell the sniping between
the two camps, it didn't work. Bradley and his supporters were
furious over the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is more pro-choice because Bradley was pro-choice way
back when,'' said Carol Greitzer, NARAL president from 1969-72.
``Gore's record currently is fine. But he was not there at the
beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insists he now unequivocably favors abortion rights, which
Bradley does not dispute. The issue, Bradley campaign staffers say,
is Gore's lack of candor about his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, Al Gore is pro-choice today. But he has yet to
explain his evolution; in fact, he has yet to fully acknowledge his
anti-choice past,'' said Gina Glantz, Bradley's campaign manager
and a former consultant to NARAL.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL's endorsement ``is a typically Washington decision that
has more to do with politics than a woman's right to choose,''
Glantz said.

ARGENTINA PURGES INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF PERSONS LINKED TO `DIRTY
WAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Just two months after taking office,
President Fernando de la Rua has ordered a purge of the nation's
military and civilian intelligence apparatus that will eliminate
many of the last suspected participants of the notorious ``dirty
war'' of the 1970s and 1980s from the government payroll.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 military and civilian intelligence agents have
been fired or forced to retire in recent days. The announcements
have been made with little fanfare, and the personnel changes have
been promoted as cost-cutting and modernization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But the full symbolic importance of the intelligence
reorganization was made clear when government officials leaked to
the press that they were also planning the sale of the old
headquarters of Army Intelligence Battalion 601, a unit that served
as the top spy agency of the military death squads and that donated
advisers to the first Nicaraguan contra guerrillas who took up arms
against the Sandinista government in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul began a week ago when the Fernando de Santibanes,
the new head of the Secretariat of State Intelligence, or SIDE,
announced the firing of one-third of his 3,100-member staff due to
a $170 million budget cut. Santibanes said he wanted to turn the
attention of the agency away from its traditional functions of
spying on domestic political opponents to the growing problems of
money-laundering, tax evasion and narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world changes,'' said Santibanes, a former banker and
close friend of de la Rua, ``intelligence services have to change
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Santibanes has consulted with U.S. officials of the FBI and Drug
Enforcement Administration and he is planning meetings at the CIA.
But he has indicated that he is looking most closely to Canadian
domestic intelligence as a more appropriate model for a country the
size of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The SIDE has come under criticism in recent years for failing to
stop the bombings of the Israeli embassy in 1992 and a Jewish
community center in 1994. It has faced allegations that it put
politicians, military personnel and journalists on its payroll to
do the political bidding of both military and civilian presidents.
Last year, reports surfaced that President Carlos Saul Menem had
put the agency to work on his failed bid to run for reelection
despite a constitutional ban on a third presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua and his aides have promised to end such political
activities, and concentrate on anti-terrorist and anti-crime
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not identified the names of intelligence
agents let go, but officials have not denied local press reports
that they include people who did intelligence work for past
military dictatorships and were probably involved with death squad
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The less than innocent records of at least some of the agents
has spurred wide concerns about what they might do now that they
are out of work, especially since a purging of the Buenos Aires
provincial police force in recent years led to several criminal
acts by former officers. Government officials said they were taking
measures to assure that the fired agents would not cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The housecleaning will mean nearly a 50 percent reduction in
military intelligence personnel, and officials said they would now
leave non-military intelligence work to civilian agencies. The new
defense minister, Ricardo Lopez Murphy, pledged to make the
reconstructed military intelligence apparatus ``as transparent as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 15,000 and 30,000 dissidents, guerrillas and others
viewed as dangerous to the dictatorships disappeared or were
executed between 1976 and 1983, when civilian government was
resumed.

CHERYL CROW PLAYS PROFESSOR FOR A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Dartmouth College has made its reputation by
inhabiting the cliche of a thoughtfully quaint New England college:
Students carve ice sculptures for their Winter Carnival, the town
falls silent after dinner, and J.D. Salinger and Noel Coward
qualify as celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But the college's new administration has vowed to change what it
sees as an anachronistic spirit, shutting down the famed
fraternities _ and, Tuesday, importing a little celebrity heat.
</P>
<P>
   Rock star Sheryl Crow lectured and chatted with Dartmouth
students as the latest guest of the Montgomery Endowment, the
college's most presitigious visiting Fellowship. She joins the
ranks of past fellows Saul Bellow, Gerald Ford, and Toni Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Crow is on campus for two days as part of a series called Music
Makers and Movie Makers _ a program that has sparked a heated local
debate which mirrors a national argument on the propriety of
including popular culture in scholarly curricula.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Gerstner, the Dartmouth official responsible for
bringing Crow to the classroom, says that while the choice may seem
unconventional, Crow's appearance is directly in line with the
spirit of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken and Howell Montgomery wanted a program that would bring
people who were not necessarily scholars to Dartmouth, to interact
with the students and serve as mentors,'' Gerstner said. ``I think
that bringing musicians and movie-makers here is a terrific way to
let students explore ideas they might not come into contact with in
the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students, however, think that pop songs don't belong on the
intellectual agenda of a rigorous Ivy League college.
</P>
<P>
   ``While she may be a talented singer, it's not clear to me that
the her work includes the intellectual and educational component
befitting the fellowship,'' said Noah Phillips, a senior from
Newton, Mass. ``Crow may be nice to look at and listen to, but I
don't see her concert spurring any substantive discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a fairly rigorous schedule Tuesday, Crow, a former
music teacher, lectured at a world music class and ate lunch with a
group of 20 students, with whom she talked about social activism
and the lagging legacy of Bob Dylan. Then, she played an acoustic
concert for 900 people in the college's main auditorium,
intermittently advocating for land-mine removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading a biography of Aldous Huxley years ago, and what
would happen in those days was these great writers went around on
lecture circuits and everyone would go out to see them,'' Crow
said. ``It seemed like such a fascinating and romantic time to me,
that it's always been something I wanted to do myself _ to go out
and act as a mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, arguments on whether to draw distinction
between classical education and pop culture have come to the fore.
Academic traditionalists want to halt a growing movement to include
popular works in the curriculum, such as a current Dartmouth class
which treats Bob Dylan's lyrics as poetry and subjects them to
rigorous academic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But some scholars contend that the dominant academic canon tends
to insist on a closed set of books and ideas. They argue that
studying mass-appeal art, literature and music is often the best
way of understanding cultures in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It well may be that the neglect of popular culture by the
academy accounts for some of the trash that passes under that
banner,'' said William Cook, a professor of English at Dartmouth
and past department chair. ``To promote literacy in its most full
sense, we must be concerned with literacy in all its modes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not exclude jazz, rock and other popular forms from
the study of music,'' he added, ``for they, like more elite forms,
tell us a great deal about the concerns and values of a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow, for her part, said she came to Dartmouth simply to to play
her music and talk to students. She spent the two hour-plus concert
cultivating a folk aesthetic, playing quiet, well-crafted songs on
an acoustic guitar, paraphrasing Walt Whitman, invoking Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she gave her own critique of pop culture during the
last 10 years, noting her ``influences and references'' seemed
markedly different from most Dartmouth students, and that she
couldn't appreciate their generation's infatuation with, say, the
rap-metal band Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   But during the concert, the skepticism of hosting a pop singer
and the generational disconnect faded. Crow charmed the audience
into laughter and enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know whether or not having Sheryl Crow play was the
best statement for the College to make, and I still don't,'' said
Benjamin Patch, a senior from Chattanooga. ``But the bottom line is
she's a great songwriter, and she's worth having up here for that
alone.''

COMMENTARY: AN AMERICAN PIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about globalization. Michel Camdessus probably knew that
his last speech as managing director of the International Monetary
Fund might be accompanied by some protests. But he surely did not
expect an American activist to follow him to Bangkok and throw a
cream pie in his face.
</P>
<P>
   The American represented one of the groups hoping to make
April's IMF-World Bank meeting in Washington a second Seattle.
Sunday's pie-throwing was, of course, a publicity stunt. But the
symbolism _ an American traveling to Asia to save Asians from
globalization, whether they want to be saved or not _ is too apt to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Let's admit that there were some actual Thai protesters outside
the lecture hall. And let's also admit that the IMF is a more
plausible villain than the World Trade Organization, the bizarrely
demonized target of the Seattle protests. The IMF is no more a
world government than the WTO is; but through the conditions that
it imposes in return for loans the IMF does, at least in times of
crisis, get to dictate policies to sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO, by contrast, is basically a commercial court; all it
does is determine when countries are violating the agreements they
have already made. (Example: The United States can set whatever
environmental standards it likes, but having agreed to the
principle of non-discrimination, it cannot hold imported gasoline
to a higher standard than the domestic product.)
</P>
<P>
   The protesters of Seattle past and Washington future, however,
don't make such fine distinctions. They are as opposed to free
trade in goods as they are to speculative movements of short-term
capital; they view the longer-term trends in the world economy, not
just the short-term crises, with dismay. And that is why the
spectacle of an American going to Thailand, of all places, to
protest globalization is so remarkable. For Thailand is one of
those export-led success stories that are the best advertisement
for the WTO and its free-trade agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Now wait a second, you say. Wasn't there a terrible financial
crisis recently? Yes, there was, and the IMF mishandled it. But the
Thai economy is recovering, and even post-crisis Thailand is a much
better place than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be obvious to the Western visitor. Much of Bangkok
is an urban nightmare of shanties and traffic jams; Thailand is
still poorer than most Westerners can easily imagine. But that, in
a way, is the point: because the developing world is still so poor,
what looks to careless observers like exploitation is often far
better than the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Try looking at some of the literature of the anti-globalists _
say, the lavish series of full-page ads that have been placed in
this newspaper by the Turning Point Project. (Who's paying for
those ads, by the way?) Again and again you see the less attractive
features of the modern world contrasted with an imagined
pre-globalization Arcadia of happy villagers living in harmony with
nature. Then try checking some of the facts about life before the
export boom. Never mind GDP; we're talking basic nutrition and
health. What you will discover is that life in that
pre-globalization society was nasty, brutish and short; for
example, in 1975 only one rural Thai in six had access to safe
drinking water. Today it's four out of five.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that many Third World leaders are contemptuous
of their self-proclaimed Western friends who, in the words of
Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, are ``determined to save
developing countries from development.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those developing countries have their own gripes
about the world trading system. Mainly these involve their desire
for more, not less, international trade: they are rightly angry
that rich countries that proclaim the virtues of free trade place
so many obstacles in the way of their potential exports. And they
also want more of a say in the decisions of the WTO _ largely
because they are afraid that it will give in to the demands of the
Seattle types, imposing labor and environmental standards that they
cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't want is affluent Westerners telling them _
strangely, at the very moment that some developing countries are
finally starting to acquire a bit of real economic power _ what a
terrible thing the modern world is.

   EAST ORANGE, N.J. _ The thick glass door with ``IBF'' in red is
open. The receptionist is working the switchboard. On the top floor
of the office building at 134 Evergreen Place, it's business as
usual here in the International Boxing Federation's suite of
offices where photos of Robert W. Lee Sr. adorn the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sanctioning fights,'' Hiawatha Knight, who has replaced
Lee as the IBF president during his leave of absence, was saying at
her desk. ``We're talking to promoters.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the 32-count federal indictment of Lee, his son, Robby,
and two other IBF officials, Bill Brennan and Francisco Fernandez,
never happened. As if Lee and the others were not going on trial in
late March on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering
and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   As if Lee and the others were not accused of receiving a total
of $338,000 in payments from promoters (such as Don King, Bob Arum
and Cedric Kushner) as well as from managers and boxers for
manipulating the IBF rankings to allow fighters to qualify for
lucrative bouts.
</P>
<P>
   As if a U.S. district judge had not appointed William W.
Robertson, a Newark lawyer, to monitor the IBF's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in boxing, a business that is often more brutal and
more brazen outside the ring than inside it, a business where guilt
or shame is never acknowledged.
</P>

   And if the IBF is as rotten as the indictment suggests, it's
reasonable to wonder if the other two bowls of boxing's alphabet
soup, the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Association,
might be rancid, too.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the WBC and the WBA rankings have often been
as, let's say, inconsistent as the IBF ratings were.
</P>
<P>
   Although the WBC is based in Mexico and the WBA is based in
Venezuela, each does business in the United States. Their officials
appear at championship fights here and collect sanctioning fees.
Their referees and judges officiate at title fights here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go wherever the evidence takes us,'' said Robert J.
Cleary, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, who announced the IBF
indictments. ``There's nothing to prevent us or any other
law-enforcement agency from pursuing a violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to prosecute foreign-based officials, especially when
most of the evidence is in another country, impediments do exist _
the lack of both subpoena power and grand jury investigation. But
terrorists who live in other countries have been indicted in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   To go after the WBC and the WBA, a law-enforcement agency would
need the two things that put together the IBF case _ a reason and
an informer. In the IBF case, the reason was the 1994 lawsuit
against the IBF by the heavyweight Michael Moorer, who claimed he
had been wrongly denied its No. 1 ranking. The informer was C.
Douglas Beavers, the IBF's ratings chairman from 1983, when Lee
founded the IBF, to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers, threatened with prosecution himself, agreed to
cooperate with federal agents in 1997; he secretly recorded more
than a hundred conversations with Lee and other officials regarding
bribes and rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were receiving payoffs from Don King,'' Beavers
said in a sworn statement, ``we gave special consideration to his
fighters and frequently rated them higher than they would have been
rated on merit.''
</P>
<P>
   King has not been charged in the IBF case; neither the
affidavits nor the government witnesses can directly link King to
specific payoffs. Arum and Kushner were also not indicted in the
IBF case.
</P>
<P>
   Arum acknowledged in an affidavit having funneled $100,000 to
Lee in 1994 to exempt George Foreman from the IBF rules requiring a
rematch with Moorer. According to Beavers, Kushner _ who has
declined comment to reporters through a lawyer _ paid Beavers
$100,000 in 1995 in return for the IBF forcing a rematch between
Foreman and Axel Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers told of collecting $100,000 from Kushner, then
delivering $50,000 of it to Lee's son, Robby, then giving $25,000
to Brennan and keeping the other $25,000 himself.
</P>
<P>
   So if the WBC or the WBA were to provide a reason for a
law-enforcement agency to investigate and if an informer surfaces,
those bowls of alphabet soup would be subject to a smell test. And
the sooner, the better.

LEADING ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP BACKS GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's leading abortion rights group endorsed
Al Gore for president Tuesday, effectively ending opponent Bill
Bradley's attack on the vice president for past inconsistencies on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said the group decided to make the unusually early
endorsement in direct response to Bradley's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to step forward and clarify the record,'' she said.
``We reject attempts to use this as a wedge issue to divide
pro-choice voters and that is what the Bradley campaign has been
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement drew immediate fire from the Bradley camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorsement doesn't change the fact that Bill Bradley has
a better voting record on this issue than Al Gore,'' said Bradley
spokesman Eric Hauser. ``I still think voters want a president that
they can count on on this issue, and Bill Bradley has a 20-year
record of absolute commitment. Regardless of the endorsement, I
think that's comforting in a way that the vice president's record
is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the back-up material provided by NARAL stated that as a
senator from Tennessee from 1985 to 1992 Gore had either abstained
or voted against abortion rights legislation in 11 of 51 cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelman said she was not going to punish politicians who
have become strong abortion-rights advocates over time.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the endorsement Gore indirectly referred to
Bradley's attacks, saying that it was time for the party to unite
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot play political games with an issue as fundamental as
a woman's right to choose,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Gore acknowledged that he wrestled with the issue, and
noted his early opposition to government funding of abortion. But
the vice president said he changed his position as he came to
believe that poor women would not have the same access to abortion
as wealthier women if they did not get federal help.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also scooped up some surprising support Tuesday from the
Teamsters representing locals from South Carolina to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   While much of organized labor, including the AFL-CIO, is behind
Gore, the Teamsters have remained officially neutral in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   However, after Bradley addressed the Teamsters locals in
Atlantic City, N.J., a union official entertained a motion to
endorse the former New Jersey senator. It passed by acclamation.
Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth said the ``spontaneous expression of
support'' carried no official weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very nice surprise,'' Hauser said. ``It was purely
spontaneous and we are glad to have their support.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore attempted to combine his interest in the
Internet with his need to energize the minority vote in an economic
address at Morgan State University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president told students at the historically black
school that he wanted to provide universal access to the Internet
in low-income, minority neighborhoods as rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer literacy is a fundamental civil right,'' Gore said.
He added that the ``digital divide'' between the rich and poor
would make it harder for those without access to computers to get
ahead in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president proposed setting up technology centers in
low-income communities and using Americorp volunteers to teach
Internet in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president's
goal of expanding computer literacy did not involve any new
government programs or funds.
</P>
<P>
   He said money for wiring classrooms in poor neighborhoods _ a
priority of President Clinton's _ is already included in the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore would encourage the private sector to wire
classrooms by reducing regulations.

 &HT;    Oil industry feels the rebound
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Just a year ago, a frantic Texas oil industry,
hit hard by plunging prices, went banging on the doors of the
Capitol for help. Producers were shutting down wells, workers were
losing jobs by the thousands, school districts in the oil fields
feared for their property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark price for a barrel of oil on the New York
Mercantile Exchange had fallen to around $12 a barrel. And
producers, who usually get paid less than the benchmark, were
getting about $8.50 a barrel at the wellhead, according to federal
statistics. A barrel is 42 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists, meanwhile, gladly paid well under $1 a gallon for
unleaded gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature _ after some backroom arguments over helping oil
and gas producers before children without health insurance _
responded with a $45 million tax break for owners of low-producing
wells when the benchmark price for oil fell below $15 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush signed the emergency bill into law March 11
so it could take effect immediately
</P>
<P>
   The break was applied to the severance tax on oil, which the
industry would like to get rid of altogether as an unfair leftover
from the days when oil was king in the Texas economy. But the best
it could get was a temporary suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Then came one of those unforeseen twists that makes this
industry so unpredictable: Oil prices immediately began a steady
climb.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the benchmark price topped $30 a barrel for the first
time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The steady rise over the past year has injected new life into
the oil patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' Jay Spiller, an Austin-based producer who operates
in the Luling area, said Tuesday. ``I'm back to pumping.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also back to hiring, picking up three new full-time
employees in January to overhaul his 140 wells to boost their
production.
</P>
<P>
   Another Austin-based producer, Stan McDonald, president of
Stanton Mineral Development Inc., has begun drilling a new well in
Bastrop County _ his first in 18 months: ``We have a whole
stockpile of prospects that just went on the shelf when oil was
down at $9 or $10,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy is back, our sales tax (revenues) have come
back,'' said Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, of his West Texas
district, which is heavily dependent on the oil industry. ``We're
seeing people come back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil price increase kicked in so quickly last year that
producers were able to claim only $17 million of the $45 million in
tax credits allowed by the Legislature. The break in the severance
tax, a 4.6 percent levy on the value of oil at the wellhead, has
expired. It had a section that applied to the 7.5 percent severance
tax on natural gas production, but natural gas prices held up much
better than oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Matthews of the Texas Railroad Commission, who pushed
hard for the tax break, makes no claim that that it bailed out the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped psychologically as much as anything.''
Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   Salvation actually came from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, whose members began limiting production,
forcing prices up.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether those higher prices can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez said Tuesday that oil
producers are likely to increase output to counter low world
inventories and high prices when current agreements expire March
31.
</P>
<P>
   Current oil prices are ``unsustainable for weeks, even for
days,'' Tellez said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas producers sought a tax break when prices plunged, no
one so far has proposed raising taxes to reflect the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Craddick, who sponsored the tax break bill in the House last
year, still thinks the severance tax should be abolished, although
he said that would be difficult to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation when you get rid of a tax,'' Craddick
said. ``You have a shortfall, or you have to tax something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers such as McDonald and Spiller say the severance tax is
unfair, given that they also pay property and federal income taxes
just as other businesses do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an onerous tax that we pay,'' said McDonald, who
estimates he saved $15,000 from last year's tax relief. ``We're the
only industry that pays a tax on the product we produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The severance tax was supposed to be a way for the people of the
state to reap some of the benefits of Texas' wealth in oil and
natural gas, which was first taxed in 1905. For years, it was a
mainstay of state government finance.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last half of the 20th century, the passage of the
sales tax in 1961 and development of the franchise tax on
corporations, as well as the long, steady decline in the state's
oil and gas production, reduced the role of the severance tax in
paying for state government.
</P>
<P>
   Although the severance tax on oil generated $210 million in the
state's 1999 fiscal year, the sales tax generated $13 billion and
the franchise tax brought in $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to study the
severance tax and make recommended changes, if any, for the
Legislature when it returns in January.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the full economic impact of the decline in oil field
employment between 1997 and 1999, the Workforce Commission
estimates the downturn directly and indirectly cost as many as
54,500 jobs statewide.
</P>
<P>
   So oil and gas producers are trying to build back up amid a boom
economy where many of their best workers have drifted off to other
jobs in less volatile industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many good people were lost,'' McDonald said.

 &HT;    Eds. WITH OILTAX
 &HT;    Consumers feel it at the pump
 &HT;    By Amy Schatz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Debbie Oenning remembers the good old days _
just last summer _ when she could fill up her red Explorer sport
utility for about $15.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's lucky if a full tank of gas doesn't set her back $22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices are so high,'' said Oenning, who drives 90 miles,
round-trip each day from her home near New Braunfels to downtown
Austin and fills up her tank two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Oenning and her husband, a self-employed contractor, spend a
combined $500 a month on gasoline, she figured. ``We're both in our
vehicles a lot,'' said Oenning, as she whipped out her gas card at
a Texaco station on I-35 and forked over another $20. ``It's like a
house payment.''
</P>
<P>
   With gas prices at or near their highest level since November
1990, it's no surprise that consumers are feeling the pinch.
Nationally, the average price of a gallon of gas, including all
fuel grades and taxes, is about $1.41 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Austin area, gas prices went up 6 cents in February to
$1.26 a gallon for regular, unleaded, according to a survey by the
American Automobile Association's Texas division.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin on Tuesday, gas was selling anywhere from $1.22 to
$1.29 a gallon for unleaded . At Payless Gas in Round Rock, a
gallon of unleaded was $1.29, the same price as at a Texaco station
in Wimberley.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrison, owner of the San Marcos Flower Co., said he has
two trucks driving around Hays County each day delivering flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's not bothering me. But it could, especially if it
goes up again,'' said Harrison. ``I just filled it up this morning.
Cost me $19.50 and it used to cost me $12.50.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on Lake Travis, fuel prices haven't gone up that much, said
Kelse Jennings, a co-owner of U-Flote-M, which sells gas and
groceries to boaters. A gallon of super-unleaded gas is $1.89, the
same price it was last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But that price is likely to go up, if costs don't go down soon.
``We're paying more for gas,'' said Jennings. ``I don't want to
raise prices if I can avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies, meanwhile, are seeing the cushions they
built into fuel budgets eaten up by rising gas prices. Capital
Metro, for example, has spent an average of 75 cents a gallon for
diesel fuel the last four months, after budgeting 60 cents a
gallon, said Leslie Browder, its chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's vehicles are driving fewer miles than expected
so far and it hopes that will make up the cost difference. Capital
Metro fuel budgets are based on gas price expectations and mileage
projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little too early to tell if we can absorb that within
the existing budget or if we need to look elsewhere,'' Browder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Ballard was filling up a trusty old Mercedes Tuesday in
Austin with $1.40 a gallon diesel gasoline. She spends at least 40
minutes driving in from her home each day to her law office in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Usually she saves money by driving her Ford Escort, but that car
is out of commission. ``You used to be able to fill up for $10. Now
its $16,'' said Ballard. Unfortunately, you've got to have it, so
you've just got to deal with it.''

AETNA ENDS POLICY OF PAYING FOR BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS TO TREAT
BREAST CANCER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By GINA KOLATA and KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reversing a policy that dates back almost a decade, one of the
nation's largest insurers has decided to stop paying for a grueling
and controversial breast cancer treatment that has not been proven
to work.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the company, Aetna/US Healthcare, has been
informing doctors that it will no longer provide reimbursements for
the treatment _ bone marrow transplants for women with breast
cancer _ for its 1.6 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes in the wake of a finding that a university
doctor in South Africa had falsified data that seemed to indicate
the transplants were more effective than a standard treatment. That
finding contradicted the results of four other independent studies,
which found no improvement in survival rates for patients who
received the experimental procedure. With the South African study
discounted, the findings of the other four studies remain
uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to cover bone marrow transplants for
illnesses where medical studies have proven their efficacy, such as
leukemia. Aetna will also cover women enrolled in
federally-sponsored studies of the transplants which are designed
to determine whether new variations of the treatment are effective.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that women covered by Aetna who qualify and
are willing to participate in valid, federally sanctioned, clinical
trials, will still able to receive such transplants. But other
patients will not be reimbursed for the procedure, which over the
past 10 years has been offered by an increasing number of hospitals
and medical centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's decision marks a dramatic shift in one of the most
contentious health care policy issues in decades. Since the late
1980s, many women and their doctors _ encouraged by the findings of
preliminary, early stage research _ believed that bone marrow
transplants were their last, best hope for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by courts and legislatures, many insurance companies
eventually dropped their resistance to paying for the experimental
treatment, which involves large doses of powerful chemotherapy
drugs followed by bone marrow transplants. That allowed for
transplants to be widely adopted as a standard of care, even before
the efficacy of the treatment was known.
</P>
<P>
   With insurance companies paying the often more than $100,000 for
the treatment, women who fervently wanted a bone marrow transplant
went to doctors and hospitals that provided them outside of the
studies. Many women were reluctant to enroll in studies in which
they might be assigned to a group that received conventional
chemotherapy for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, as many as 30,000 women had bone marrow transplants
in the 1990s, while only 1,000 participated in the scientific
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the studies failing to show that transplants prolong
life, an Aetna official said it was time to accept what science
showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a stand,'' said Dr. Joseph Carver, a medical
director at Aetna. He said that of the 336 Aetna patients who had
bone marrow transplants last year about half were breast cancer
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some patient groups hailed Aetna's decision, saying it should
have been made a long time ago. They said it would halt an
unnecessary expenditure of scarce resources for a treatment that
has been tested and proved to be of no discernable benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a responsible position for Aetna to have taken at this
time,'' said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer
Coalition, a patient group. But, she added, ``It's unfortunate that
insurance companies did not take that position a number of years
ago because we could have saved lives and we would have had an
answer much sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors who have provided bone marrow transplants were
reluctant to express their views on the new policy. ``No comment,''
said Dr. Karen Antman of Columbia University, a bone marrow
transplanter who has repeatedly said that the treatment still holds
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward A. Stadtmauer of the University of Pennsylvania said
that despite the discouraging results thus far, other studies still
underway might show the treatment works. Other health insurers said
they planned to continue to pay for bone marrow transplants for all
women who wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision about treatment would be between the patient and
the doctor,'' said Dr. Lee Newcomer, who is senior vice president
for health policy at United Healthcare, which insures 13.5 million
Americans. He said that his company would not intervene if a woman
and her doctor felt that a bone marrow transplant was warranted.
``There may be personal reasons why a woman may want to take that
approach, although personally I can't think of any,'' Newcomer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carver said he started calling cancer specialists in the middle
of last week and telling them about the new Aetna policy. He tells
them, he said, that while their patients can have a transplant as
part of a cancer institute study, ``you guys can't do it in your
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been getting mixed reactions,'' Carver said. But he
questions why the patients even want a bone marrow transplant. He
asks the doctors, he said, ``Have you explained the current state
of the science to your patients?''

NEW REPORT STUDIES GUN VIOLENCE IN PUBLIC HOUSING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study by the federal government has found that despite the
overall falling levels of crime in public housing projects around
the country, residents there are still more than twice as likely to
be shot or killed by guns than people living elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are included in a report by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development that President Clinton is expected to
make public on Wednesday in remarks preceding a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But it also comes as the administration is expanding efforts on
a variety of fronts to deal with gun violence and rights of gun
ownership. In addition to supporting new measures that would
require all firearms to be registered at the time of sale, Clinton
has called on Congress to close the so-called gun-show loophole by
requiring private dealers to conduct the same backgrounds checks on
buyers that are routinely performed by licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his budget proposal, he is also seeking an additional
$280 million to beef up enforcement of gun laws by adding 1,000
federal, state and local prosecutors and 500 agents at the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. And on behalf of the housing
department, he is asking Congress for $345 million _ an increase of
$35 million over last year _ for its program that is combating
illegal drug activity in public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the housing department is threatening to sue gun makers
as a way to force them to settle more than two dozen lawsuits filed
against them by cities and municipal governments that are seeking
compensation for the costs of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The new report is based on crime data from 55 public housing
authorities that are receiving money from the federal anti-drug
program. Its key finding, according to Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo, is that 1 percent of the 2.6 million people living in public
housing projects are subject to gun-related violence each year,
compared with .4 percent in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that says is that those who can afford it the least pay
the highest cost of gun violence,'' Cuomo said in an interview on
Tuesday, adding that the disparity between public housing residents
and other Americans was about the same whether the housing projects
were located in big or small cities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is facing strong opposition on nearly all his
gun-related initiatives, especially those involving the gun-show
loophole and registration.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the National Rifle Association, gun rights proponents
adamantly oppose any efforts that would lead to additional
record-keeping by the federal government, fearing that they would
ultimately lead to even more regulations and, ultimately, to the
confiscation of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have tried to enact similar measures in recent
years, mostly with little or no success. The Colorado legislature
this week became the latest to kill a measure that would have
closed the gun-show loophole.

CONSUMER QUERIES ABOUT SUSPECT INSULATION POUR IN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Homeowners worried about asbestos in Zonolite Attic Insulation
have been calling laboratories for tests and advice, but the labs
say they can't answer the biggest question consumers have: What
should I do if the results come back positive?
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to tell them isn't right because we are just testing,''
said Valerica Stanca, optical lab manager of ProScience Analytical
Services, Inc, in Woburn, Mass. The company received more than 20
calls from homeowners just by mid-day Tuesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a safety issue that people have called about,'' Stanca
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zonolite is a popular loose-fill insulation made by W.R. Grace
between 1963 and 1984. Though Grace knew it contained asbestos, the
company never warned the public and fought to keep warning labels
off its product, The Boston Globe reported Monday, citing internal
memos.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency has advised
homeowners to delay any renovation that may disturb Zonolite until
the agency has more information about it. The EPA issued its
warning from Libby, Mont., where Grace mined and milled the
vermiculite that is the main ingredient in its Attic Insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Many people also want to know if the insulation is hazardous and
if it should be removed from their homes, Stanca said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal EPA has been testing Zonolite in homes in Libby and
expects to have results back by mid-March, said Wendy Tomi, the
EPA's information coordinator in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, laboratories are fielding calls from anxious
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the EPA should have an emergency number for people to
get information,'' Stanca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to tell people they need to worry or give them a
false sense of security,'' said Keith Pokorny, a branch operations
manager for ATC Associates, in Woburn, Mass. The company, which
consults on asbestos, has contacted the EPA but hasn't heard
anything yet, Pokorny said.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorny's call was would have been one of nearly 100 that the
agency has received in the past two days. The EPA expects to issue
advice for laboratories very soon, said Wayne Toland, regional
asbestos program coordinator in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consultants are getting pummeled,'' with calls from concerned
homeowners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as homeowners wondering what they should do if they have
Zonolite, the EPA will be able to offer little guidance until
mid-March, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toland spent all day Tuesday fielding calls from homeowners
worried about their attic insulation. One caller said he is in the
process of purchasing a home that appears to be insulated with
Zonolite, Toland said.
</P>
<P>
   While the EPA strongly advises people to seek out a professional
asbestos consultant to conduct any sampling, many people have told
Stanca that they will collect the samples themselves, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at the money,'' Stanca said.
</P>
<P>
   Per-sample testing costs range from $12 to $40, and labs usually
advise at least three samples. Consulting fees, which homeowners
incur if they hire a company to come out to their house and test,
range from $100 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Once ProScience receives a sample, it analyzes it using a fancy
microscope called transmission electronic microscopy. This
technique allows the short fibers associated with the tremolite
asbestos, the type in Zonolite, to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Covino, of Covino Environmental Associates, in Woburn, said
that most laboratories recommend the three or more samples because
the asbestos may be clumped into one piece of vermiculite and not
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a chocolate chip cookie. One bite might have no
chips and another might have three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While little is known about how much of a risk is presented by
Zonolite in attics, many people in Libby have become ill or have
died of asbestos-related diseases. Some people in Libby have filed
suit against Grace and are closely watching controversial federal
legislation that would attempt to steer asbestos cases from the
courts and into a new federal office.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is scheduled to
be reviewed by the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Opening
remarks are expected, but the bill probably will not be voted on
until March, said Sam Stratman, a Hyde spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Grace released a statement maintaining that its
product is safe. The company said that people who want more
information about Zonolite can call Grace at 617-876-1400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace believes now, as it did during the time that it sold
Zonolite Attic Insulation that this product poses little or no risk
to human health or the environment,'' the company said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Greta M. Powell, a staff sergeant in the 49th
Armored Division of the Texas National Guard, taught algebra at
Sharpstown High School in Houston _ until word came that she was
going to Bosnia for nearly nine months. Then she had to fight to
keep her job.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie E. Hayes, a decorated Vietnam veteran who was promoted
to first sergeant in the 49th last Monday, lost his job as a pilot
for Petroleum Helicopters Inc., when he received his orders. Last
week, only days before leaving for Bosnia, he filed a lawsuit to
recover damages for a career he now believes is in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Frank T. Hinnant 3rd, a specialist who worked as the only
certified welder for a contractor in Bellville, simply could not
make the company's owner understand why he was trading his
acetylene torch for an M-16 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically he told me, `You either work for the military or you
work for me,''' said Hinnant.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon relies more heavily on the 564,000 members of
the National Guard and Reserves to support its military operations
around the world, it is creating a backlash among civilian
employers suddenly confronted with the loss of valuable employees _
not just for a few days or weeks, but for months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a federal law that protects jobs and benefits for
members of the Guard and Reserves, some employers still retaliate,
at times blatantly. In less extreme cases, members of the Guard and
reservists miss opportunities for promotions or choice assignments
and face the irritation of supervisors and co-workers who must pick
up the slack while they are gone.
</P>
<P>
   With Guard and Reserve units regularly serving from Kosovo to
the Persian Gulf, the resistance of employers to prolonged
activations has now emerged as the biggest obstacle to this
increased reliance. On Feb. 7, the Army officially mobilized some
700 members of the 49th Armored Division for Bosnia, the largest
single deployment of Guard troops since the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   As the troops prepare to leave for Bosnia, the effects on
employers and employees are now rippling across Texas, as they have
across the nation for other deployments and will again as the
Pentagon increasingly calls on the nation's citizen-soldiers to
serve more than just a weekend a month and two weeks each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Service in the Guard and the Reserves has always meant
sacrifices for employers and employees. But as the number of days
reservists spend on active duty has increased _ from less than 1
million in the 1980s to roughly 13 million today _ so have
complaints from those finding that military service and civilian
careers all too often conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is only now trying to measure the effects
mobilizations are having on employers, conducting the first survey
to measure their tolerance for losing employees to military duty.
But officials worry that the increased reliance on Guard and
Reserve units is steadily eroding their support. As a result, they
fear, reservists may be far less willing to join or stay in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the long-term impact of this is going to
be,'' said Maj. Gen. Roger C. Schultz, director of the Army
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   For the men and women of the 49th, the legal protections have
provided a small degree of comfort to lives and careers abruptly
interrupted by the call to duty. Before dawn one day last week,
they mustered one last time at the division's headquarters at Camp
Mabry here in Austin and then, in bulky combat gear, clambered
aboard buses for Fort Hood, where over the next two weeks they were
to depart for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Like any Army troops beginning a deployment, the members of the
49th left with the usual tangle of worries about what would happen
while they are gone. Unlike their Army counterparts, however, they
left with the added burden of wondering how nine months of military
duty would affect their civilian careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big strain,'' said Hayes, who was there with his wife,
Elizabeth, ``not knowing if I'll have a job when I come back.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Pentagon, these conflicts are more than just a legal
headache. More than a third of enlisted reservists and 45 percent
of officers say that their military service _ even short of a long
deployment like the 49th's _ has created problems with their
civilian bosses. According to the Pentagon, a third of the people
who quit the Guard and Reserves do so because of conflicts with
employers. Officers who have been mobilized leave far more often
than those who have not.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when they are more likely to be called up than ever
before, many reservists applying for civilian jobs even leave their
service off their resumes, afraid that it could make an employer
think twice before hiring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a sufficient amount of employer support, there could
be a chilling effect on voluntary participation in the Guard and
Reserves,'' said Kenneth U. Jordan, director of the National
Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserves, an agency
that mediates conflicts between military service and civilian jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, federal law has required that employers hire
back anyone in the Guard or Reserves called to active duty. After
the Persian Gulf war, during which the Pentagon mobilized more than
265,000 reservists, Congress strengthened the law.
</P>
<P>
   While employers do not have to pay reservists during their
military duty, they cannot refuse them time away to serve _ whether
they go for one day or five years, whether they volunteer or are
ordered to go. Not only must employers hold open their jobs or at
least ones of equivalent pay, they must preserve their seniority
and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The law even prohibits discrimination in hiring and promotions,
though officials and especially reservists say that is almost
impossible to enforce.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   While the law is clear, conflicts still arise.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Army notified the 49th that it was headed to Bosnia,
the Department of Labor has investigated 26 complaints against
employers of the division's soldiers; it opened two more cases just
in the last week. Many more conflicts have been mediated by the
division's commanders or by officials from the Texas Committee of
the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 90 percent of the cases, the employer is unaware of what
the law says,'' said Dale M. Pyeatt, executive director of the
Texas committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hinnant's employer told him he did not care what the law said.
</P>
<P>
   A tank crewman who is going to Bosnia as a driver, Hinnant
volunteered _ three times _ before a position opened up for him.
When he returned from a training exercise in November, however, the
company's owner had had enough. He rescinded a promotion and cut
his pay.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th's executive officer, Capt. Christopher C. Ryan, called
the owner and tried to explain the law's protections, but ended up
in a shouting match. ``Usually talking to them is enough,'' Ryan
said, referring to several calls he had to make. ``Some just don't
want to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hinnant took his case to the Department of Labor,
which has now begun an investigation that could force the company
to reinstate his promotion and raise. In extreme cases, the
department can refer cases to the Justice Department for
prosecution. Because of the investigation, neither Hinnant nor
department officials would identify the company.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although smaller companies are hit hardest, some of the worst
conflicts have been with federal, state or local government
agencies, according to officials here and in Washington. While
agencies' policies are generally clear, retaliation often comes
from lower-level supervisors who bear the brunt of rearranging
schedules or hiring temporary replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th has had a rash of problems with the state's prison
system, for example. Command Sgt. Maj. Bobbie R. Adams, a
25-year-veteran of the San Antonio Police Department, said the
force has been supportive, but the captain in his district has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``My captain has intimated to me that I won't be back in my unit
when I get back,'' said Adams, a community police officer in the
city's southeast section. ``Of course, that weighs heavily on my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 27, the sergeant from Houston who serves in the 49th's
intelligence unit, had nearly finished her first year teaching at
Sharpstown High when her orders came last May. She was, by all
accounts, a valuable employee, a bilingual math teacher who also
coached the school's chess team.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her performance, her principal told her she would not
have her teaching position back when she returned, according to two
people who were involved in her case. The principal even wrote her
a recommendation explaining why.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the division's commanders and the employer
support committee, Powell challenged her dismissal and ultimately
kept her job as part of a settlement that has since been sealed.
Powell declined to discuss the settlement, as did officials with
the division.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, employers eventually relent, but others end up in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes joined the Guard in 1972 after serving more than four
years on active duty. The Army taught him to fly helicopters, then
sent him to Vietnam, where he won a Silver Star for heroism, as
well as a Purple Heart. After the war, he turned his skill into a
career, ferrying patients to hospitals or flying oil workers out to
the rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, he started flying for Petroleum Helicopters
Inc., one of the nation's largest helicopter transport companies,
and the new job seemed to go well until he was mobilized last
January. As a senior noncommissioned officer responsible for
organizing the deployment, he was among those whose service began
nearly a year before the beginning of the mission in Bosnia.
</P>

   Last week, he filed suit in federal District Court in Galveston.
Edward Gatza, manager of human resources at Petroleum Helicopters'

   While there have been conflicts, many of the 49th's civilian
employers have been supportive. Some have gone out of their way to
give employees 15 days of paid military leave; some have promised
to make up the difference between civilian and active-duty pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Water Utilities Department for the city of Dallas honored
its assistant director, Col. Larry N. Patterson, with a ceremony
that included a military-style parade of the city's sewer
equipment. Mark A. Brinkman, president of Brinkman Technologies
Inc., is losing one of his vice-presidents, Lt. Craig D. Yarbrough,
but still offered to provide the families of the 49th with access
to video-conferencing equipment.

<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the most important test of employers' support will
come in October and November, when soldiers take off their uniforms
and return to employers. Then they will learn if their jobs remain
open, if they have been reassigned to other, lesser positions, or
if they have permanently poisoned relations with their bosses.

not be right away, but over a period of months _ then we'll know.''

WEB VALENTINE SITES OVERWHELMED

<P>
   Flooded with Valentine's Day requests, several online electronic
greeting card companies discovered they couldn't make every
last-minute love connection.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hallmark Cards Inc., Egreetings Network Inc. and Blue
Mountain Arts had trouble answering the doors to their online
stores. Even a day after Valentine's Day, Hallmark was swamped; it
told customers to try clicking in later because it was ``very
busy'' filling orders.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, an electronic card bearing a ``Happy Birthday''
or ``Congratulations'' message might arrive at its destination in a
few minutes. But Egreetings acknowledged that it was so backed up
that cards ordered on Valentine's Day may not have arrived until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy about that, and we definitely apologize to our
customers,'' said Gordon Tucker, chief executive of San
Francisco-based Egreetings. ``But the number of people that came
out was much larger than we had expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say the Valentine's delays and outages are
further evidence that many online retailers have not learned yet to
deal with spikes in customer traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, you have to be a little forgiving, only
because every year it's uncharted territory,'' said Carrie Johnson
of Forrester Research, the Cambridge, Mass. technology research
firm. ``For some of these retailers, it was probably the biggest
day they've had in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, traffic at BlueMountainArts.com more than quadrupled to
3.5 million new visitors on Monday compared to Valentine's Day last
year, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. Egreetings and Hallmark also
reported large increases in customer traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of Valentine's Day shoppers also helped cause slowdowns
last week at chocolate, gift and lingerie stores on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Several shoppers said their Valentine's gifts were not delivered
on time. Sandra McIntosh, a brand director at the Internet research
firm Gomez Advisors, said she paid the online gift store
RedEnvelope more than $14 in overnight shipping charges to ensure
that a cigar humidor would arrive well before Valentine's Day. It
arrived late but just in time _ on Feb. 14, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A RedEnvelope spokesman said McIntosh may have missed the
onscreen print indicating that shipments could be delayed due to
the perishable nature of the cigars included with the humidor. He
said the company intends to refund her for the overnight shipping
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Valentine's Day snafus, however, occurred at
e-greetings sites. Customers are drawn to sites like
bluemountainarts.com because the greeting cards are free, require
no postage and normally can be shipped quickly via e-mail.

RAINWATER INVESTMENT SEEN AS A CAUSE OF HOSPITAL CHAIN'S FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ga., N.H., Ill., Md., Wis., Ala.)   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's largest chain of psychiatric hospitals lies in
tatters. More than half of the 90 hospitals and treatment centers
operated by Charter Behavioral Health Systems will soon be closed
and the company is expected to announce as early as Wednesday that
it is seeking bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, officials of a real estate investment trust
headed by Richard E. Rainwater, a financier based in Texas,
announced a $400 million investment that they said would breathe
new life into Charter Behavioral. But the deal, rather than
revitalizing the chain, contributed to its collapse, undermining
patient care in the process, according to many former Charter
Behavioral officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 plan saddled Charter Behavioral, a unit of Magellan
Health Services Inc., with some $125 million in franchise fees and
rapidly escalating rents. The chain's former chief executive said
he warned that the costs would cause financial chaos. Those
pressures, coupled with industry-wide insurance cutbacks, were soon
felt in psychiatric wards, former company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital directors and employees, overworked and faced with
repeated salary freezes, quit. Wards were understaffed, federal and
state reports show. Training programs were eliminated, former
company officials said. Ripped chairs and broken walls were not
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like they were strip-mining this place,'' said Dr.
Hashim Hafez, medical director at a unit in Nashua, N.H., until he
quit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral, which once had units in 27 states for more
than 8,000 patients, many of them children, had a troubled past.
But after 1997, patient care failed even at well-run hospitals,
former executives and regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter was never a great company,'' said Cindy Musikantow,
who once ran a treatment center for adolescents that the company
managed in Naperville, Ill., a Chicago suburb. ``But it
disintegrated to the degree that decisions were being made without
regard for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal provided income for Rainwater's trust. As the largest
shareholder in Magellan Health, he also stood to profit because the
sale of the ailing chain boosted its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health received franchise fees under the plan and its
top executive got a large bonus, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission filings. The plan also enabled Magellan Health,
the nation's largest behavioral health company, to leave the
hospital business for managed health care, a more lucrative field.
</P>
<P>
   The deal split ownership of Charter Behavioral between Magellan
Health and an affiliate of Rainwater's real estate trust. The
psychiatric chain's buildings were sold to the trust, which leased
them back at a healthy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rainwater, a former business associate of the Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush, and Mac Crawford, the chief
executive of Magellan Health during the deal, declined to be
interviewed. In written responses, their spokesmen said that
Charter Behavioral's financial woes were caused by insurance
cutbacks, not by the 1997 plan. They said that patient care was not
affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we had falling resources,'' said Dr. Gary M. Henschen,
chief medical officer of Charter Behavioral, which is based in
Alpharetta, Ga. ``But we have done the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 Rainwater and his wife, Darla Moore, paid $69.7
million for a 12.3 percent stake in Magellan Health. The following
year, he approached Crawford of Magellan Health about a plan under
which Magellan would sell Charter Behavioral's buildings to
Rainwater's publicly-traded trust, Crescent Real Estate Equities
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that operate nursing homes had engaged in similar
``lease buy-backs'' to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 deal, Crescent Real Estate paid $400 million to
acquire a 50 percent stake in Charter Behavioral and buy its
buildings. (Because federal tax laws bar real estate investment
trusts, or REITs, from operating companies, Rainwater and his
associates formed a publicly-traded company, Crescent Operating
Inc., to hold the 50 percent stake.).
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Charter Behavioral was required to pay Crescent
Real Estate $41.5 million in rent, a return of about 11
percent.Gerald Haddock, a Crescent executive, described the lease
returns as ``exceptional.'' The rent, which took precedence over
franchise fees to Magellan Health, escalated 5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health, which is based in Columbia, Md., retained a 50
percent stake in Charter Behavioral, which was to pay it $81
million annually in franchise fees. Magellan, which used cash from
the sale to finance managed care acquisitions, said those payments
could decline if industry-wide insurance cuts continued.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts applauded the plan. But John Lutzius, an analyst
with Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, Ca., said the new
payments left Charter Behavioral with little cash to weather any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the franchise fees and the rent, Magellan and Crescent
were effectively sweeping all the cash flow from Charter,'' said
Lutzius.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater's bet on the psychiatric industry proved to be wrong.
In 1997 some within Charter Behavioral had sounded warnings about
the deal's consequences for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Two former top Charter Behavioral executives said in separate
interviews that the chain's top executive told Crawford of Magellan
Health that the franchise fee and rent payments would financially
devastate the psychiatric hospitals. Not long after the deal
closed, that executive, John M. DeStefanis, resigned, those former
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John went nose-to-nose with them and that's why he was forced
out of the company,'' said one former executive who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that account, DeStefanis confirmed it but declined
further comment, citing a confidentiality agreement. In a
statement, Crawford disputed this version of events, saying that
DeStefanis supported the deal. DeStefanis' departure was unrelated
to the deal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health officials declined to comment on discussions
with DeStefanis. ``In the course of negotiating any transaction,
differing viewpoints are always expressed, and, in a good
organization, are even encouraged,'' the company said in a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health executives said the deal would benefit Charter
Behavioral. Its top official also profited from it. Crawford, whose
salary in fiscal 1996 was $712,500, received a $2.48 million bonus
for closing the deal, according to Magellan Health's 1997 proxy
statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Crawford described his cash payment as a
``retention bonus.'' One company director, A.D. Frazier Jr., said
he supported the payment to Crawford because the 1997 deal moved
Magellan Health toward managed care and away from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   (Moore, who declined to be interviewed, did not participate in
board decisions involving Charter Behavioral because of holdings in
her husband's trust.)
</P>
<P>
   A month after the deal closed in June 1997, the federal
government further cut hospital reimbursements. That December,
Magellan Health told shareholders in its annual report that the
move would reduce the $81 million due in franchise fees from
Charter Behavioral in fiscal 1998 by about $10 to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   DeStefanis' projections, however, proved far more accurate.
Charter Behavioral managed to pay only $32 million in fees in
fiscal 1998. That January, seven months after the deal and 45 days
after Magellan Health issued its annual report, the chain made its
last franchise payment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Charter Behavioral had a troubled record of patient
care, including settlements of government charges involving
fraudulent billing. Regulators said, however, that some units
provided good care.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Dr. Ronald Davidson, a hospital consultant for
the state of Illinois, declared that he would not hesitate to use a
company center in Brown Deer, Wis. for his own child.
</P>
<P>
   But by early 1998, conditions there and at other well-run units
worsened as the weakening chain imposed repeated salary freezes,
staff cutbacks and other cost-cutting measures, said former
executives, including Musikantow, the former head of the
Chicago-area unit.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashua, N.H., the chain's flagship hospital, resources shrank
and staff levels fell, said Dr. Philip Santora, a former associate
medical director at the unit. When experienced nurses and
therapists quit, fresh graduates replaced them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999 reports, federal and New Hampshire state
regulators found unsupervised children engaging in sex or hurting
themselves at the Nashua unit. Wards were persistently
understaffed. Suicide attempts were not recorded and children were
injured when improperly restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Santora, who quit in August, said that while insurance cutbacks
played a role, the 1997 deal resulted in a pattern of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can chip away and chip away and sooner or later you reach
a critical mass and a point of no return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As its hospitals veered out of control, Charter Behavioral's
governing board, which was comprised of two executives from
Magellan Health and two associates of Rainwater, had little
response.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clarissa Marques, Magellan Health's chief clinical officer,
joined the board in August 1998 and found that it had never
received or asked for patient care reports. She said that in 1998
it did not meet until late October.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Goff, one of Rainwater's closest associates, who headed
the board then, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, Crawford left Magellan Health to become chief
executive of Caremark Rx. of Birmingham, Ala.. About that time, in
an SEC filing, Crescent Operating acknowledged that the chain's
operating losses were growing because of insurance cutbacks and the
rents and fees required by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, Goff resigned from its board. A month later,
in an SEC filing, the chain's accountants questioned its ability to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the television news magazine ``60 Minutes II''
broadcast the results of an undercover investigation at several
Charter Behavioral units. Secretly recorded footage showed
ill-trained employees crudely restraining teen-agers and filling in
medical records for patients who apparently had not been examined.
</P>
<P>
   Several company hospitals were already under Government
scrutiny. After the broadcast, federal officials announced a broad
investigation of Charter Behavioral for Medicaid fraud and patient
abuse. Magellan Health is also part of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation involves activities both before and after the
1997 deal and is not focused on its financial aspects. (There is
also a federal investigation into billing fraud at Columbia/HCA, a
hospital chain that Rainwater helped found. Rainwater has not been
accused of any wrongdoing.)
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to improve patient care, Charter Behavioral hired outside
consultants. Regulators shut some units and the company closed
others.
</P>
<P>
   By last August, Charter Behavioral could no longer make lease
payments. The next month, Magellan Health transferred the bulk of
its remaining stake in Charter to Crescent Operating. Magellan and
Charter agreed to indemnify each other in the face of the
government investigations. In December, Charter said it would
reorganize and sell some 50 units.Magellan Health officials said
Tuesday that the troubled chain could announce a bankruptcy filing
as early as Wednesday. Michael French, Charter Behavioral's chief
executive and associates of Rainwater said they believed that
following reorganization, Charter Behavioral would be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day at the New Hampshire facility, a sign on the
door instructed employees to turn in their keys during exit
interviews. The keys would not work anyway. The locks have been
changed. The last patient has been transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all fell apart so fast,'' said Hafez, the former medical
director. ``It was like the Kremlin. Everyone knew it was falling
apart. But when it fell apart, it fell apart so quickly because
there was no foundation.''

CHERYL CROW PLAYS PROFESSOR FOR A DAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Dartmouth College has made its reputation by
inhabiting the cliche of a thoughtfully quaint New England college:
Students carve ice sculptures for their Winter Carnival, the town
falls silent after dinner, and J.D. Salinger and Noel Coward
qualify as celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But the college's new administration has vowed to change what it
sees as an anachronistic spirit, shutting down the famed
fraternities _ and, Tuesday, importing a little celebrity heat.
</P>
<P>
   Rock star Sheryl Crow lectured and chatted with Dartmouth
students as the latest guest of the Montgomery Endowment, the
college's most presitigious visiting Fellowship. She joins the
ranks of past fellows Saul Bellow, Gerald Ford, and Toni Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Crow is on campus for two days as part of a series called Music
Makers and Movie Makers _ a program that has sparked a heated local
debate which mirrors a national argument on the propriety of
including popular culture in scholarly curricula.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Gerstner, the Dartmouth official responsible for
bringing Crow to the classroom, says that while the choice may seem
unconventional, Crow's appearance is directly in line with the
spirit of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken and Howell Montgomery wanted a program that would bring
people who were not necessarily scholars to Dartmouth, to interact
with the students and serve as mentors,'' Gerstner said. ``I think
that bringing musicians and movie-makers here is a terrific way to
let students explore ideas they might not come into contact with in
the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students, however, think that pop songs don't belong on the
intellectual agenda of a rigorous Ivy League college.
</P>
<P>
   ``While she may be a talented singer, it's not clear to me that
the her work includes the intellectual and educational component
befitting the fellowship,'' said Noah Phillips, a senior from
Newton, Mass. ``Crow may be nice to look at and listen to, but I
don't see her concert spurring any substantive discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a fairly rigorous schedule Tuesday, Crow, a former
music teacher, lectured at a world music class and ate lunch with a
group of 20 students, with whom she talked about social activism
and the lagging legacy of Bob Dylan. Then, she played an acoustic
concert for 900 people in the college's main auditorium,
intermittently advocating for land-mine removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading a biography of Aldous Huxley years ago, and what
would happen in those days was these great writers went around on
lecture circuits and everyone would go out to see them,'' Crow
said. ``It seemed like such a fascinating and romantic time to me,
that it's always been something I wanted to do myself _ to go out
and act as a mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, arguments on whether to draw distinction
between classical education and pop culture have come to the fore.
Academic traditionalists want to halt a growing movement to include
popular works in the curriculum, such as a current Dartmouth class
which treats Bob Dylan's lyrics as poetry and subjects them to
rigorous academic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But some scholars contend that the dominant academic canon tends
to insist on a closed set of books and ideas. They argue that
studying mass-appeal art, literature and music is often the best
way of understanding cultures in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It well may be that the neglect of popular culture by the
academy accounts for some of the trash that passes under that
banner,'' said William Cook, a professor of English at Dartmouth
and past department chair. ``To promote literacy in its most full
sense, we must be concerned with literacy in all its modes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not exclude jazz, rock and other popular forms from
the study of music,'' he added, ``for they, like more elite forms,
tell us a great deal about the concerns and values of a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow, for her part, said she came to Dartmouth simply to to play
her music and talk to students. She spent the two hour-plus concert
cultivating a folk aesthetic, playing quiet, well-crafted songs on
an acoustic guitar, paraphrasing Walt Whitman, invoking Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she gave her own critique of pop culture during the
last 10 years, noting her ``influences and references'' seemed
markedly different from most Dartmouth students, and that she
couldn't appreciate their generation's infatuation with, say, the
rap-metal band Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   But during the concert, the skepticism of hosting a pop singer
and the generational disconnect faded. Crow charmed the audience
into laughter and enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know whether or not having Sheryl Crow play was the
best statement for the College to make, and I still don't,'' said
Benjamin Patch, a senior from Chattanooga. ``But the bottom line is
she's a great songwriter, and she's worth having up here for that
alone.''

BUSH UNVEILS SOME NEW TWISTS IN HIS PLAN FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORM
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-FUNDRAISING) 
(nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRMO, S.C. _ Marching aggressively onto Sen. John McCain's
favorite turf, Gov. George W. Bush proposed a package of suggested
changes to the campaign financing system Tuesday, including a ban
on soft money from corporations and labor unions and a prohibition
against lobbyists making political contributions while Congress is
in session.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan, showcased at a rally here on the same day as the
final Republican debate before the South Carolina primary, wove
many of the positions that he had previously taken and added a few
new ones in an effort to stake a claim to an issue at the center of
McCain's candidacy and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the suggested ban on unregulated donations to political
parties, or soft money, differed from McCain's proposal in a
crucial respect: Bush would not apply it to individuals, who,
according to the Campaign Study Group, a research company, have
accounted for about 29 percent of such donations over the past nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that limiting individual contributions would amount to
an abridgment of the right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are reforms that respect individuals,'' Bush told
supporters here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, also campaigning in South Carolina, dismissed any
plan that would continue to permit unlimited donations from
individuals as a ``camouflage and a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advocates for campaign finance reform questioned Bush's
commitment to change, pointing to one of the conditions he placed
on the soft money ban. Bush said the changes must include a measure
preventing labor unions from using membership dues for political
purposes unless the members have given their consent.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, an advocacy group
that promotes overhauling the campaign financing system, said that
Democrats would reject that, dooming Bush's plan, and that Bush
undoubtedly knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed,'' Wertheimer said. ``I'm impressed in the sense
that I'm impressed with magic tricks, and this is an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer, other advocates and even a few Republican
congressional aides said that Bush's previously unarticulated
proposal on contributions from lobbyists was unlikely to diminish
their influence and that Bush might simply be using the
recommendation to remind voters that McCain has raised money from
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is directed at trying to embarrass Senator McCain rather
than solving real problems,'' Wertheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew attention to the fact that McCain has transferred
money he raised for a Senate race into his presidential campaign
with another one of his proposals: that candidates for federal
office not be able to use money that they had raised during a
previous campaign for a different federal office.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Bush proposed that candidates be required to
provide rapid disclosure of the contributions they receive on the
Internet. Bush is already doing that; McCain is not.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush's focus Tuesday on McCain's trademark issue, the Texas
governor continued a series of announcements and adjustments that
seemed designed to appropriate or neutralize as many aspects of
McCain's appeal as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Since his defeat by McCain in the New Hampshire primary, Bush
has held longer question-and-answer sessions with voters, much like
McCain. He has also challenged McCain's image as a reformer by
coming up with a brand new slogan for himself as ``a reformer with
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that he had previously stated his support for changes
to the campaign funding system, but conceded that voters had
perhaps not registered his concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking about it ever since I've been on the
trail,'' Bush said at a news conference. ``And somehow, people keep
asking me, `When are you going to have a campaign funding reform
plan?' And I felt for certain people were hearing it. Evidently,
they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions that Bush took from voters Tuesday covered wider
territory, and there was a tense moment when a black pastor, the
Rev. Samuel T. Ross-Lee, challenged Bush about his repeated refusal
to get involved in the controversy over whether or not South
Carolina should fly the Confederate battle flag over its Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you with the news media?'' Bush asked.
</P>
<P>
   After Ross-Lee assured Bush he was not, Bush explained. ``It's a
principled position to say that the people of South Carolina need
to solve the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross-Lee tried to press on, but was booed by other members of
the audience, and Bush implored him to sit down.

 &HT;    Chevy cries foul over Ford redesign
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ A pair of new Winston Cup cars made their
debuts here six days ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the 2000 Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Monte Carlos have been
the subject of heated debate ever since they took to the 2.5-mile
track on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy races teams have been screaming at NASCAR that the
modernistic Fords have an unfair aerodynamic advantage. The Fords
have dominated every Daytona competition over the first five days
of SpeedWeeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, the 1999 Winston Cup championship and Ford No. 88
driver, ran away from the rest of the field during the first round
of qualifying and captured the pole position for the Daytona 500.
Fords had four of the top five qualifying speeds. Chevy placed only
one driver in the top 15 _ Mike Skinner at fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's supremacy carried over to the Bud Shootout exhibition
Sunday. Jarrett blew away the rest of the field to easily win the
qualifying race. Later in the day, Jarrett drove into the winner's
circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Daytona score with five days to go: Ford 3, Chevy and
Pontiac 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I see a need to make any changes,'' Jarrett said
after the Bud Shootout. ``I was impressed with the Chevrolets out
there. Obviously, Bobby Labonte has a fast car, and the Pontiacs
can run, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Pontiac Grand Prix are the same style as last year. Its
drivers, who won the last three races of the 1999 season, have
taken a low profile so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I think, no matter what make of car you have,'' Jarrett
said, ``if you know how to work the draft and you get your car
handling good, everybody out here has a chance to win. The Chevy
complaints to the sport's governing body have been so overwhelming
that NASCAR chief operating officer Mike Helton called an
uncharacteristic last-second news conference this week to discuss
the brewing controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said that NASCAR has made no plans to make any car
changes, but he did not rule out the possibility that something
could happen before Sunday's race. A change during pre-race
activities would be unprecedented in NASCAR's 52-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that everybody understands that we have about a
100 percent different Monte Carlo, and we've got a Taurus that's
about 50 percent different than it finished last season,'' Helton
said. ``We (still) have some confidence that -- in approving the
new body changes and shapes -- that we were right on the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of unfair advantage is nothing new at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chevy drivers don't want to talk about the past.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR ``trimmed back on (the Monte Carlos) since its
introduction, when it was a better car in its original form,''
Chevy No. 3 driver Dale Earnhardt said. ``It has been handicapped
quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more or less let Ford come in with a better race
car,'' Earnhardt said. ``I think (Chevy drivers) will be behind the
eight ball for a little while, until we can figure it out and make
some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hamlin, Earnhardt's crew chief, said the Chevys have too
much drag in the car and the spoiler is farther from the ground in
the center than it was on last year's model. Other top Chevy
drivers, including Jeff Gordon, Sterling Marlin and Terry Labonte
also have expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to, 'Are we equal?' '' Gordon said. ``Are we
as fast as the (Fords) speedwise? I don't know where Mike Skinner
came up with that lap (in qualifying), but other than that, all the
Chevrolets are pretty much out to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet got some encouragement the last few days. Jarrett won
the Bud Shootout but only because Marlin refused to let Gordon
draft off his car in the last half of the final lap. The top six
finishers in the exhibition were two Chevys, two Fords and two
Pontiacs -- the equation that NASCAR seeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the Chevrolets and the Pontiacs are saying something
different,'' Jarrett said, ``especially about our car, but that's
the hard work and effort that was put forth by (crew chief Todd
Parrott) and his people that made our car run good. So, we're gonna
do everything we can to win everything they have here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (NASCAR sees) fit to make a change,'' Jarrett said, ``we'll
just race them harder.''

THREE REGENERATIVE MEDICINE FIRMS SET MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three small Massachusetts biotechnology companies agreed to
merge Tuesday and create a new company focused on the emerging
field of regenerative medicine to treat problems ranging from
baldness to broken bones, the latest in a wave of consolidations
sweeping the biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Each firm is developing therapeutic products designed to
activate the body's ability to repair or regenerate human tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies _ Creative BioMolecules Inc., Ontogeny Inc.,
and Reprogenesis, Inc. _ will become Curis Inc., a privately held
company with about $70 million in cash, 150 employees, and expected
royalties from Creative BioMolecules' bone-regeneration protein
implant to treat severe bone fractures, which will begin producing
revenue later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Curis also gains a pipeline of potential therapies ranging from
a hair regrowth to anti-cancer drugs. By 2002, it hopes to market a
gel-like product used in endoscopic surgery to treat a rare
urological disorder that affects young children which has been
developed by Reprogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was spearheaded by Dr. Doros Platika, the president
of Ontogeny, who has been informally talking to executives at the
other companies for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for biotech to be sustainable,'' Platika said.
``Together we can create a new era in medicine where we can create
drugs and therapies that will improve the quality of life by
repairing and regenerating parts of the body.'' Platika said
potential rivals may include Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Human Genome
Sciences, which recently expanded into regenerative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is occurring throughout the industry. Although
these are good times on Wall Street for stronger biotech firms,
smaller and weaker biopharmaceutical and medical device firms are
scrambling for financial survival.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Biomolecules, which developed the bone implant, has had
a turbulent history trying to develop a panoply of other products
while Reprogenesis lost a key patron in Pfizer Inc., which invested
$20 million in its gel-like product but decided to exit from the
medical device business. Ontogeny is the strongest, a company that
was considering an initial public offering of stock this year but
chose the merger route instead, Platika said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel R. Omstead, president of Reprogenesis, and Michael
Tarnow, who has headed Creative BioMolecules for four years ago,
will both leave Curis after a transition period.
</P>
<P>
   Under the merger agreement, shareholders of Creative
BioMolecules, the only pubicly traded company in the group, will
exchange 10 shares of Creative BioMolecules for three Curis shares
and become Curis' largest stockholder with 12 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Ontogeny will own 38 percent of the stock, or
10.64 million shares, with the remaining 19 percent, or 5.32
million shares, going to Reprogenesis shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are planned and the merger is expected to close in
June with headquarters at Ontogeny's facility in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday shares of Creative BioMolecules climbed 30 percent after
the announcement to 9 1/8, up 2-3/32 in Nasdaq trading on volume of
14.7 million shares _ 25 times the three-month daily average.

 SOME DEMOCRATS SEE McCAIN AS A GROWING THREAT  
(See also MCCAIN and MCCAIN-MAGAZINE) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's surge in the Republican
presidential race has unsettled some prominent Democrats who worry
that his compelling biography would overshadow his conservative
record and find broad appeal among Democrats and independents in a
general election.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the concern, Vice President Al Gore has begun
assailing McCain on issues ranging from abortion to gun control.
Just the other night, rather than castigate only Gov. George W.
Bush for his abortion record, Gore added a line, saying, ``His
challenger, John McCain, has an identical record _ and the
anti-choice forces would do anything to divide Democrats on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And some Democrats close to the White House, who for months had
been bracing for a contest against Bush, have begun in recent days
quietly putting out negative information about McCain's record.
</P>
<P>
   It was not lost on many Democrats that McCain has recently come
up with more penetrating attack lines about Gore's campaign finance
practices than former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the
Democratic nomination. Recalling what has become a fund-raising
embarrassment from the 1996 election campaign, McCain mocked Gore
for having insisted that he did not know he was raising money at a
Buddhist Temple in a way that violated some campaign laws..
``Perhaps those saffron robes and the smell of incense may have
given him a clue,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Democrats keep a close eye on McCain, they are
delighted at the overall state of the Republican race. Only a month
or two ago, Democrats lamented that Gore and Bradley were roughing
each other up as Bush appeared to be gliding almost effortlessly to
his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they said, the tables have been unexpectedly turned. The
belief among many leading Democrats is that it would be quite
difficult for Bradley to snatch the nomination from Gore, while the
Republicans find themselves locked in a costly, and damaging
struggle. And after months of polls showing that Democrats would be
easily vanquished in a general election, now surveys show the
Republican advantage has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore had about a one in ten chance of a good scenario
developing in this race and it happened by chance,'' said Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``The Bradley challenge never
materialized. The real danger for Al Gore was always that George
Bush would win the nomination very quickly and had a lot of time to
amass financial resources. But the race with John McCain is going
to go on at least a month or two _ and Bush's financial resources
are already dwindling.''
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, many Democrats said McCain would be a more
potent foe in the fall. ``If McCain keeps steady, McCain is a much
more dangerous candidate because he's the only candidate energizing
those folks who have already given up on elections,'' said Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, who is neutral in the race. McCain, he
added, would be more formidable than Bush in a debate because ``for
all the downsides of being in the Senate, at least it equips you
for combat. All we do in the Senate is debate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Biden, and several other Democrats interviewed, said, upon
further reflection, it was far from apparent this early whether
Bush or McCain would be stronger. In fact, he had second thoughts
about McCain's skills against Gore in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore just bores in and bores in,'' Biden said. ``I don't think
John can sustain programatically the boring in.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats said that in the aftershock of his stunning loss
in New Hampshire, they re-evaluated their views of Bush, saying he
appeared more vulnerable because he is not as nimble as McCain.
And, despite his two elections as governor of Texas, they said Bush
still has limited experience on a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   But while McCain has emerged as a new threat, Democrats also
speculated that McCain could lose his gloss as the primaries
progress. They said given his long history of votes in Congress,
McCain's issue positions could be more easily picked apart than
Bush's _ and he could more easily be painted as a hard-edged
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many Gore backers said if they faced McCain in a
general election, the senator's attempts to assail him on campaign
finance could be neutralized by McCain's own involvement in the
Keating Five scandal.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, many Democrats argued that McCain would
be weakened because if he wins the nomination, his candidacy would
divide the Republican Party, possibly spurring a third-party
conservative candidate that could take votes from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats likened the situation to 1972, when Sen. George
McGovern stirred excitement among voters but was so reviled by many
in the Democratic establishment that they did little to help him
win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are worried about McCain right now,'' said Rep. Norm
Dicks of Washington, one of Gore's staunchest backers in Congress.
``But I think this is going to be a 15-round heavy-weight battle.
But John McCain can blow all this smoke about reform but he's still
a very ultra-conservative Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked which candidate would be more beatable, Andrew Cuomo, the
federal housing secretary who advises Gore, said, ``I could argue
both. Everyone has their theory. George Bush has evidenced serious
weaknesses. The hype didn't bear up. But John McCain will not be
able to galvanize his base. And he'll have definitional problems.
What is he? McCain's got this current appeal but I don't know how
you sustain it. One year on a bus is a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said, ``This is an
iconoclastic view, but I would rather run against McCain just
because I think he does divide the Republican base. He has a voting
record that's easier to pin down.''
</P>
<P>
   While they still do not quite know what to make of McCain, many
Democrats are downright giddy about the prospect of Gore facing
Bush in a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like dueling with an unarmed man,'' said David
Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ``You'd almost feel
sorry for George Bush in a circumstance like that. So I'd rather
run against Bush, but it's a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, chairman of the Democratic congressional
Campaign Committee, said, ``Bush makes us shine brighter because
he's just vacuous and without substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said he was watching eagerly as Bush and McCain yanked
each other to the right in South Carolina. Speaking of the
Republican debate tonight, he said, ``These are the kinds of things
that as Democratic chair you love to hear. These guys are
conservative peas in a right-wing pod.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's backers say they are fortunate that all the attention on
the Republicans has overshadowed their contest _ and prevented
Bradley from gaining any attention in trying to overtake the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What McCain has been doing to Bush is a very subtle benefit to
Al Gore and it's been under the radar screen,'' said Roy Neall, a
former chief of staff to Gore. ``It hasn't resulted in the kind of
intra-party blood-letting that might have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Neall said he did not know whether McCain or Bush would
be a more energetic general election foe, he is clearly enjoying
their battle. ``To the extent that Bush and McCain can keep it a
dogfight for as long as possible, it's a great deal for the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the Democratic strategist and a Gore supporter,
remarked about the transformed political dynamic from only a few
months ago: ``If we had gone to lunch in October and I had said,
`Come mid-February, we'd be pretty much in a dead heat in the
polls. Republicans will be out there fighting over the premise of
their party. And I think Gore will be pulling ahead of Bradley,'
people would have thought I was crazy. I would have, too.''

GRAMMY'S KIDS ARE ALREADY THE WINNERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Yet another chapter in pop's latest bout with adolescence
unfolds this week at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards. The nominee
list, as undependable as ever in predicting music's real
history-makers, does crackle with one present conflict, between the
parent figures who run the event and the kids now paying their
allowances.
</P>
<P>
   Those kids get on adults' nerves with their obvious commercial
music, but these hit makers, sometimes unwittingly, are pointing
toward pop's future.
</P>
<P>
   A likely sweep by the night's deserving front-runner, Carlos
Santana, will reassure those baby-boomer voters far too old to
really understand the chart-topping teen-age nominees like Britney
Spears, Christina Aguilera and those ever-present Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even Santana needed a boost from the singer Rob
Thomas, a modern-rock heartthrob who doesn't have many years on
Kevin Richardson, the Boys' senior member. The image Santana's
collaborative album presents is of acolytes honoring a master, but
the commercial reality is that the patriarch needed a boost from
the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Grammy's babies don't give their progenitors
respect; Aguilera gushed appropriately at being pitted against her
role model, Madonna, in the best female pop performance category.
But this youth brigade doesn't seem to need mentors. It is
forcefully peer-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Like the fans they have enabled to become the most powerful
force in entertainment, most adolescent stars (and faux-adolescent
ones like the 27-year-old best new artist nominee Kid Rock) don't
go beyond lip service in acknowledging their elders, either as an
inspiration or a burden.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, Nirvana and the other titans of
alternative rock felt the need to scream out their differences with
the boomers who had long overshadowed them. Kurt Cobain famously
wore a T-shirt on which he had scrawled a motto obscenely deriding
corporate magazines when he posed for Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Backstreet Boys dropped their pants on that
magazine's cover, but more audacious was their reason for being
there at all. They had won the annual readers' poll because the
contest had been entirely overtaken by high-school-age voters who
used their experience manipulating the charts of MTV's ``Total
Request Live'' to hijack this organ of rock's establishment.
</P>
<P>
   David Cassidy graced Rolling Stone's cover, in a tasteful nude
pose, in 1972. But he was trying to transcend a teeny-bopper image
he found confining. The Backstreet Boys have far saucier fans, who
spin tales of much more than trouser-dropping on their ``fan
fiction'' Web sites. Such groups don't have to pretend to not be
sexual, because most teen-agers now frankly and fairly comfortably
express their desires.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the teen-age artists appear worried about their chances
of graduating into the ranks of adult stars. Now the more seasoned
ones want control of their careers; both the Backstreet Boys and 'N
Sync have publicly wrestled with Svengali-like management.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Grammy-nominated album designed to show the Backstreet
Boys' maturation, ``Millennium,'' did not shy away from the
teen-age sensibility: it aimed directly at it, with songs like
``Larger Than Life,'' which expressed the group's utter dependence
on its fans, and the year's likely best song winner, ``I Want It
That Way,'' a gorgeous and surprisingly sophisticated ode to
adolescent confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Spears and Aguilera more easily welcome comparisons to older
artists. Unlike the usually quick-fading male teen-age heartthrobs,
the diva lineage they're claiming is characterized by precocious
beginnings that lead to long careers. Yet Mariah Carey, the big
sister these two artists most closely resemble, orchestrated a
brazenly public rejection of a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   When Carey left her marriage to the record executive Tommy
Mottola, she not only turned away from his baby-boom sensibility,
which had her focusing on sweeping ballads, but she turned toward
hip-hop. The 29-year-old singer also began an early second
adolescence of her own, showing off her nubile body in photo
spreads and her dating record in the press. This embrace of youth
gave her credibility she had long lacked.
</P>
<P>
   For all their confidence, which will certainly dominate the mood
of this year's Grammys, today's teen-age stars cannot forever stave
off the end of their golden moment. Yet this inevitable next phase
is precisely what holds out the most promise for popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted wisdom dictates that acts like the Backstreet Boys will
fizzle out before truly maturing, but their own music shows they
have a chance. Their songs are already stronger than any
teeny-bopper music since the 1950s (with one telling exception:
Michael Jackson). Pull out an old Shaun Cassidy or Bobby Sherman
album; it won't compare to ``Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that, within the next few years, each Backstreet
Boy will take his next step. Brian Littrell will likely succeed in
country or as a Christian rocker. A.J. McLean could work his
renegade image to experiment with hip-hop. Nick Carter, already
known for his sarcasm, might rebel against his heartthrob status
and become another skeptical pop star, like Robbie Williams or
George Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments will be diverting. But the real story belongs
to those fans who make this moment of teen-age glory so singular.
They will soon enter young adulthood and assert their own tastes
and opinions, even more than they have as active participants in
the mass-marketed teen-age pop world.
</P>
<P>
   If they're anything like the baby-boomer parents they're busy
ignoring, they just might beget a new counterculture. The 45th or
48th annual Grammy Awards might not simply reveal a story of
intergenerational conflict; by then, we may witness a genuine
passing of the guard.

 &HT;    Once again, Oscar nominations prove difficult to predict
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, it was a landslide for the favorite, ``Titanic.''
Last year it was an upset, with the favorite, DreamWorks' ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' losing to Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Oscars are as eerie as ``The Sixth Sense.''
Tuesday's nominations prove that anything can happen. And it sets
up another potential studio slugfest: DreamWorks and its ``American
Beauty'' vs. Miramax and its ``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The big winner in Oscar nominations was the early front-runner,
``American Beauty,'' which DreamWorks is re-releasing for a second
run in theaters nationwide starting Friday. ``Beauty'' got eight
nods, including best picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), actress
(Annette Bening), director (Sam Mendes) and screenplay (former
Mariettan Alan Ball).
</P>
<P>
   But breathing down its neck, with seven nominations, is
Miramax's ``The Cider House Rules,'' a movie nobody talked about in
those talkative pre-Oscar television roundups, a movie that didn't
fare well on 10-best lists or critics' awards, a movie that was
snubbed, for goodness' sake, by the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a Cinderella story to be found in this year's
nominations, ``Cider House'' is it. What remains to be seen is what
sort of flakiness will be sparked once John Irving's pro-choice
subtext (very subdued in the film) becomes better known.
</P>
<P>
   Equally surprising was what didn't happen. ``The Green Mile,''
the movie that would've been the most ``traditional'' Oscar choice
in years past, popped up in odd places. Like best picture and
supporting actor (Michael Clarke Duncan), but not for actor (Tom
Hanks) or director. ``The Hurricane,'' with the exception of Denzel
Washington's exceptional performance, was all but shut out. Zippo
was exactly what Jim Carrey and ``Man on the Moon'' got.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' landed seven nominations, including best picture
and an actor nod for Russell Crowe. But what happened to the rest
of its stellar cast. No Al Pacino? No Christopher Plummer?
</P>
<P>
   The quirky ``Being John Malkovich'' nailed down nominations for
director (Spike Jonze), supporting actress (Catherine Keener) and
original screenplay, but couldn't muster a best picture nod.
</P>
<P>
   In any other year, ``American Beauty,'' with its surreal
satire/embrace of American suburban life, would've been considered
the oddball outsider. The edgy movie that was bound to alienate the
conservative academy. Yet here it is, the early favorite, with the
most traditional nomination base (actor, actress, director,
picture). Which says that maybe, just maybe, the academy is not
just growing up, it's growing younger. At least a little.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing: Maybe it's no coincidence that the leading
contender this year is called ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   If you look closely, this year's nominees all tell very American
stories. From Richard Farnsworth's cross-state odyssey in ``The
Straight Story'' and ``Being John Malkovich's'' examination of
identity and celebrity to the eerie spirituality showcased in both
``The Green Mile'' and ``The Sixth Sense,'' the 72nd annual Academy
Awards will be a near universal U.S. celebration.
</P>
<P>
   You have to love the sheer American-ness of Annette Bening's
secret to growing perfect roses in ``American Beauty'': eggshells
and Miracle-Gro. In a way, that's what Hollywood is all about, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some reactions to who got rewarded and who got robbed
in the major categories:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The good: Michael Caine's sublime work in ``The Cider House
Rules'' was recognized. Tom Cruise (``Magnolia'') didn't peak too
early. Haley Joel Osment (``The Sixth Sense'') was seen as an
actor, not just an appealing kid.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: No Christopher Plummer. Bad, bad, bad. Nobody bothered
to look outside the more high-profile choices and consider
wonderful work by Peter Fonda in ``The Limey'' or Albert Finney in
``Simpatico'' or Charles S. Dutton in ``Cookie's Fortune.'' That
Jason Robards and John C. Reilly (both in ``Magnolia'') were
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   The crazy: Does anyone really think Jude Law was better than
Plummer? Better looking maybe. ...
</P>
<P>
   Early line prediction: Tom Cruise, ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   The good: They recognized Angelina Jolie (``Girl, Interrupted'')
and Catherine Keener (``Being John Malkovich'').
</P>
<P>
   The bad: Toni Collette (``The Sixth Sense'') and Samantha Morton
(``Sweet and Lowdown'') instead of Natalie Portman (``Anywhere but
Here''), Kimberly J. Brown (``Tumbleweeds''), Jean Smart
(``Guinevere''), Helena Bonham Carter (``Fight Club'') and either
Cherry Jones or Susan Sarandon (``The Cradle Will Rock'').
Apparently the academy prefers moms and mutes to strong women.
</P>
<P>
   The crazy: Julianne Moore was the supporting actress of the
year, in everything from ``Magnolia'' to ``An Ideal Husband.'' We
can only hope that her being ignored in this category gives her a
better shot at best actress.
</P>
<P>
   Early line prediction: Angelina Jolie, ``Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The good: Kevin Spacey (``American Beauty'') and Denzel
Washington (``The Hurricane'') seemed to be shoo-ins, but you never
know with Oscar. And hooray for ``The Straight Story's'' Richard
Farnsworth (the oldest ever nominee in this category) and for
Russell Crowe (``The Insider''). Both very deserving choices. And
good as Tom Hanks was in ``The Green Mile,'' he really didn't need
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: I like Sean Penn in ``Sweet and Lowdown.'' I like
Terence Stamp in ``The Limey'' a zillion times better. And I'm
sorry there wasn't room for Jim Broadbent (``Topsy-Turvy'') and
Edward Norton (``Fight Club'').
</P>
<P>
   The crazy: The academy better wake up to Jim Carrey (``Man on
the Moon'') before it's too late. Leaving him out just because he's
irreverent toward the ``institution'' of Oscar is an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Early line prediction: Denzel Washington, ``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   The good: Nobody was scared to commit to Hilary Swank (``Boys
Don't Cry''). Julianne Moore (``The End of the Affair'') finally
got her shot at the major prize. The relatively unknown Janet
McTeer (``Tumbleweeds'') got a career boost.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: Hey, I worship Meryl Streep, too, and she
single-handedly saved her movie (``Music of the Heart''). But what
about Winona Ryder (``Girl, Interrupted'') and Reese Witherspoon
(``Election'') and even _ here's a stretch _ Jennifer Jason Leigh
in ``eXistenZ''? I mean, if you thought ``Being John Malkovich''
was out there. ...
</P>
<P>
   The crazy: Maybe it's the Georgia connection, but I think what
Julia Roberts does in romantic comedies is harder than it looks. A
lot harder. She's going to end up being the academy's female Cary
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Early line prediction: Hilary Swank, ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BEST DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   The good: The number of fresh names. We're not getting the usual
suspects, good as they are (Anthony Minghella, say, or Mike Leigh
or Neil Jordan.) Of the group, only Lasse Hallstrom (``The Cider
House Rules'') has a previous nomination. Remember ``My Life as a
Dog''?
</P>
<P>
   The bad: We didn't get Minghella, Leigh or Jordan. Or David
Lynch. And we closed out the century without a single American
woman ever being nominated for best director. But as Kimberly
Peirce knows, ``Boys Don't Cry.'' They close ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The crazy: Yet again _ is this an Oscar tradition? _ best
picture nominee ``The Green Mile'' apparently directed itself (no
nomination for Directors Guild Awards nominee Frank Darabont).
Spike Jonze was good enough for a best director nod while his
movie, ``Being John Malkovich,'' wasn't good enough to be a best
picture nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Early line prediction: Sam Mendes, ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BEST PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   The good: That ``American Beauty'' made good on its early
promise. That ``The Green Mile'' got some sort of recognition.
Ditto ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad: ``The Insider'' isn't a worthy nominee. Without Russell
Crowe and Christopher Plummer, it would crumble to pieces. And much
as I like ``The Cider House Rules,'' it, too, is a picture more
successful in its parts than its whole. Better choices would've
been ``The End of the Affair,'' ``Topsy-Turvy'' and ``Boys Don't
Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The crazy: Nothing really, aside from that usual
picture/director non-matchup. But I was crazy about ``The Limey.''
Apparently no one else was.
</P>
<P>
   Early line prediction: ``American Beauty.''

 &HT;    TNT traces the descent of an NBA superstar
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They called him ``Sugar,'' but his career was sweet and low.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-round draft pick for the New York Knicks in 1978,
Micheal ``Sugar'' Ray Richardson had it all: a wicked crossover
dribble, a deadly jumper and a big-money contract to match his
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   And just as quickly he dribbled it away, with late-night
partying, free-basing cocaine and going one on one with personal
demons he could never seem to shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Happened to Micheal Ray?,'' which debuts tonight on
TNT, could have been just another good-jock-goes-bad morality tale,
the type of depressingly familiar story that has dominated the
sports pages lately. But this winning collaboration between the
Atlanta-based cable network and NBA Entertainment is handled just
right, delivering a deftly rendered jockumentary that hits nothing
but net.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's hoop nightmare is narrated by Chris Rock, a native
New Yorker and, by birthright, a lifelong Knicks fan. Even though
he was just a child at the time, Rock recalls the excitement
Richardson sparked when he rolled into town with hopes of reviving
the sagging franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Rock, whose voice sometimes cracks like that of a tortured
parakeet, gives the documentary a here-and-now electricty that
keeps it from slumping into the sports-talk cliches you hear on AM
radio. Even the predictable stock footage of Richardson leading his
team in the too-tight gym shorts of the day is enlivened by Rock's
first-person commentary, as well as by candid remembrances of the
faded superstar's family, friends, coaches and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a twinkle in his eye, but he had the devil in his eye
at the same time,'' says Mike ``The Stinger'' Glenn, a former
teammate who often counseled his troubled but talented buddy.
``Sometimes one didn't know what the other was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson will be remembered for many on-the-court exploits,
such as humbling the legendary Dr. J and the Philadelphia 76ers in
a critical playoff game and showing up NBA superstars such as Larry
Bird and ``Magic'' Johnson in the league's all-star game.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson will also go down in hoops history for being the
first player booted from the league for violating the
``three-strikes-and-you're-out'' drug policy. By then Richardson
was already a laughingstock, especially after a drug-induced
episode in which he faked his own kidnapping, then demanded ransom
money using the none-too-clever pseudonym Micheal Ray Richards.
</P>
<P>
   So where did he go and where is he now? Do we ever learn the
answer to the titular question?
</P>
<P>
   We do, and the payoff is poign-ant without getting all mushy.
But even if you're not a die-hard basketball fan, this sharp-eyed,
sure-footed documentary will leave you rooting for a player who
seemingly turned his own brush with oblivion into the sweetest
victory of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Happened
</P>
<P>
   to Micheal Ray?''
</P>
<P>
   10 tonight on TNT.

   &HT;     (Eds: SUBS last two grafs to correct spelling, Giuliani sted
Guiliani)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ My mother, my grandmother and all my female
ancestors took pride in keeping a spotless house, in which the
glassware sparkled, the woodwork gleamed and the presence of dust
bunnies was virtually a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   This artistic achievement did not happen with the wave of a
wand. For generations, the war on grungy households was demanding,
time-consuming, unending _ and boring.
</P>
<P>
   On her first visit to Washington's famed National Gallery of
Art, my mother ran her gloved hand across the frame of an important
picture, peered disgustedly at her fingers' sudden gray appearance
and muttered, ``Doesn't anyone dust in here?'' She appreciated the
art but she couldn't help the dust check. She was programmed that
way.
</P>
<P>
   But the dirty little secret about the consequences of women
flooding the work force over the last 30 years is that traditional
household chores are getting short shrift in the rush for a pay
check.
</P>
<P>
   Standards of domestic cleanliness and the careful polishing of
objects have fallen. There are only so many hours in the day, and
something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   A new study reported by USA Today reveals that women spent 11
1/2 hours a week less on housework in 1995 than they did in 1965.
The hours fell regardless of whether women were single, married,
had children or were young or old.
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for labor-saving inventions, modern appliances and
the availability of paid part-time housekeepers, that represents a
major decline in domestic tidiness.
</P>
<P>
   Men, the survey reports, have picked up only some of the hours
women no longer assign to the mop and pail. Husbands did about 4
1/2 hours of housework a week in 1965 and had a little more than
doubled it to 9 1/2 hours in 1995. Big deal. In the gender division
of household labor, men still have it easier. Women still put in 15
 &QC;  hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   The great change is in a newly relaxed attitude. Few families
notice any longer, or care, if the floor is clean enough to eat off
of. Friends don't either. ``What will the neighbors think?'' no
longer strikes terror in the feminine heart, and a good thing too.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays we are not preoccupied with neat, pristine
surroundings. It is enough to be warm and comfortable beneath a
roof that does not leak.
</P>
<P>
   Home may be where we live, but that does not mean we must have a
burning desire to make the bed every morning.
</P>
<P>
   Experts argue about the meaning of all this. It really comes,
however, as no surprise. The way we live has changed drastically in
dozens of ways. More than just the lifetime goals and career
opportunities of women have been transformed. Our clothing is more
casual, our relationships are more flexible, our priorities more
focused on monetary goals outside the home than the visual
perfection inside it.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Today survey, quoted from a book, ``Time for Life,'' by
John Robinson and Geoffrey Godbey, listed the reasons given by
those surveyed for lowering their cleaning standards. At the top
was lack of time, second was that there is ``more to life than
cleaning'', third and fourth were variations on that theme, and the
fifth was my personal favorite: The place ``will get dirty again.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue with that? Few other things we do except cook
meals and tend to personal hygiene need doing all over again so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a people we cling to the notion that tending house
deserves a high social priority perhaps because a filthy carpet and
dusty objects offend our sense of good taste. Wealthy women
regularly used to change their slip covers, rugs and draperies from
winter to summer weight with the shifting of the seasons. They had,
naturally, scores of servants to help in this daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Even though we don't scrub down dutifully any more, we still
like the idea of doing it. Or hiring someone else to do it. It
wouldn't do to act like a slob.
</P>
<P>
   That is why First Lady Hillary Clinton felt compelled to slip
the news that she is familiar with the uses of her kitchen into her
18-minute commercial introducing her candidacy for a U.S. Senate
seat from New York. She bragged that she made a mean salad and
could do an omelet too. No mention of dust cloths.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is as irrelevant to her qualifications for the
Senate as New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's agility with a broom.
Would he recognize one if he saw it?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it is still women who bear the bigger responsibility of
having a clean household even though their own standards are
slipping. Yet since voters don't care if Giuliani knows a washing
machine from a dish-washer, they shouldn't care if Clinton does.

HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEW CARUSO? (NO KIDDING)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever wondered what it would be like to hear your
favorite Caruso recordings freshened up: say, with the great
tenor's voice, exactly as it was captured by an acoustic recording
horn in the days before microphones, newly cloaked in the lush
timbres of a modern symphony orchestra recorded in digital stereo?
</P>
<P>
   No, of course you haven't. Why would you? Why would anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Yet someone not only did, but also suspected that other people
might. Thus we have ``Caruso 2000,'' a production of the Austrian
Broadcasting Corp., now on CD (RCA Victor 74321-69766-2).
</P>
<P>
   In this woefully misbegotten patchwork, Caruso's voice, recorded
between 1906 and 1920, has been electronically wrested from its
original settings and transported to a modern recording studio,
where spanking new recordings by the Vienna Radio Symphony
Orchestra were added.
</P>
<P>
   Its cover art, at least, is appropriate: a portrait of Enrico
Caruso is reproduced four times, each image colorized with a
different set of iridescent hues, in the manner of Andy Warhol. The
wonders of technology, apparently, are to bestow 15 digitally
brightened minutes of fame on Caruso as the new century dawns.
</P>
<P>
   Included are 16 Caruso blockbusters, from ``La donna e mobile,''
``Celeste Aida'' ``Di quella pira'' and ``Vesti la giubba'' to
period specialties like Halevy's ``Rachel, quand du Seigneur,''
Meyerbeer's ``O Paradiso'' and Massenet's ``O Souverain.'' For the
sake of comparison, an undoctored version of ``Vesti la giubba''
closes the disc.
</P>
<P>
   The production was dreamed up by Robert Werba, who is credited
in the booklet notes with ``project-concept and artistic
supervision.'' One thing Werba's project had going for it was that
early recording techniques captured voices more faithfully and with
greater nuance _ limited though it is by today's standards _ than
any instrument except the violin.
</P>
<P>
   He reasoned that with digital editing software _ a program that
shows music on a computer screen as a wave form and allows a
producer to trim minute details from a fraction of a second's worth
of sound _ one could remove the sonically constricted orchestral
and piano accompaniments from Caruso's recordings, leaving the
voice to ring out on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost. Actually, the accompaniments could be removed only
from (italics)around(end italics) Caruso's voice. These are mono
recordings, after all, and as Werba points out in his notes, it is
not possible to remove the accompanists when they play at the same
time Caruso sings.
</P>
<P>
   But given the recording method of the time, with the musicians
gathered around a single recording horn, Caruso's voice, front and
center, tends to dominate at such moments. Filtering can reduce the
residual accompaniments further, and with the new orchestra
superimposed, the old accompaniments are virtually inaudible.
</P>
<P>
   Werba cannot be accused of skimping on details. He had scores
prepared with Caruso's personalized phrasings taken into account.
(The musicians also listened to Caruso through headphones during
the dubbing sessions.) A lot became possible: whereas the playing
of the reduced, wind-heavy orchestras that accompanied Caruso on
disc sounded rushed and scrappy, the replacements would be
note-perfect and have the string tone restored to a proper balance.
</P>
<P>
   Textual repair could be undertaken as well: where orchestral
introductions and interludes had been truncated to help an aria fit
comfortably onto a 78-rpm disc of four to five minutes, Werba and
company restored them.
</P>
<P>
   This procedure paved the way for a diabolically spurious
argument on behalf of ``Caruso 2000.'' In addition to the
predictable (and questionable) assertion that the performances have
now been made palatable for young listeners who disdain the
constrictions of historical recordings, RCA can argue that these
new versions, free of the sonic and musical compromises of the
originals, are more akin to what Caruso's audiences heard in the
opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that isn't entirely true. Caruso's audiences may have
heard him accompanied by fine-sounding orchestras; what they did
(italics)not(end italics) hear emerging from that orchestral
opulence was a voice that sounded as though it were coming through
a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   The Viennese orchestra's performances, conducted by Gottfried
Rabi, are lovely. Caruso's performances are Caruso's performances,
with all their character and expressivity. But the suspended
disbelief of an entire season at the Metropolitan Opera is not
enough to make the voice and the accompaniment sound as if they
belonged together.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``Caruso 2000'' is an elaborate practical joke: the
equivalent, in its way, of a party tape that circulated among CBS
producers in the early 1980s, on which a mariachi band had been
dubbed onto Rudolf Serkin's recording of the Rondo of Beethoven's
First Piano Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the untouched version of ``Vesti la giubba'' may be the
key to the prank: it's as if the listener, having sat wide-eyed and
mouth agape through 16 sonically colorized tracks, were at last
allowed to hear Caruso in his own element and to realize that RCA
and Werba were only kidding.
</P>
<P>
   My guess, though, is that RCA is serious. And if that's the
case, why not open the floodgates completely? Suppressing the
accompaniments, after all, could have been done with analogue
equipment, had the notion occurred to anyone; computer technology
allows for far more complicated editing. Using it to its full
capacity, RCA could expand the Caruso discography immeasurably and
really plumb the depths of taste and good sense, all in a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   If Caruso can be made to sing with a newly recorded orchestra,
for example, why can't he sing with Elvis Presley, another RCA
mega-seller whose catalog the label is forever raiding. The perfect
vehicle is at hand: ``It's Now or Never,'' a big hit for Elvis in
1960, is essentially the same song as ``O Sole Mio,'' which Caruso
recorded in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso's voice could be shorn of its accompaniment and
transplanted beside Elvis' in an expanded remix. And as a crossover
gesture, Elvis' voice could be lifted from its own environs and
carried over, with Caruso's, to a new orchestral track.
</P>
<P>
   And why stop with Elvis? There are recordings by Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in the RCA catalog. With some
electronic wizardry, their work and Caruso's could be folded
together as an alternative for those who think that Jose Carreras
isn't quite up to the level of the rest of the Three Tenors.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, maybe now is the time for a confrontation
between this benighted era and the golden age: with antique voices
lifted from RCA's library of early 20th-century recordings, Three
Tenors configurations might include Caruso, Martinelli, Bjoerling,
Gigli, Melchoir _ the sky's the limit!
</P>
<P>
   Even those concoctions would barely tax the abilities of a
skilled producer and a good editing program. A more virtuosic
notion might be to separate digitally every word Caruso sang and
warehouse them all in a data bank.
</P>
<P>
   Since computer technology allows one to change a note's pitch
without affecting its tempo, or vice versa, to say nothing of
bending pitches, elongating and truncating notes, or toying with
volume and even intensity, it would be possible to shuffle the
words and notes Caruso recorded into everything from complete opera
roles to such potential gems as ``Caruso Sings the Andrew Lloyd
Webber Songbook in Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even the language barrier may fall, since it should be
possible to separate and catalog each of the vowels, consonants and
dipththongs Caruso sang, then reassemble them into any word in any
language, sung in any combination of tones required. The time may
come when a complete Wagner ``Ring'' cycle, with Caruso in all the
roles, and ``Yo Caruso! _ E.C. Gets Down With Puff Daddy'' are
released in the same month.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, of course, would be for RCA to let its great
recordings speak for themselves, on their own terms, as they always
have.

 &HT;    Tornadoes aftermath: 19 dead; 200 injured
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMILLA, Ga. _ Authorities concluded their search Tuesday for
victims of South Georgia's killer tornadoes, compiling a staggering
toll of death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen people dead. As many as 200 injured. Between 250 and
300 families homeless. An estimated $20 million in insured losses.
All in sparsely populated rural communities that had never
experienced such devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to characterize this as a very big disaster,
compared to the size of the communities it happened in,'' said
Shelley Boone, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
Southeastern regional program director.
</P>
<P>
   Officials lowered the number killed in the storms late Sunday
and early Monday to 19. That is three fewer than the 22 fatalities
they had initially reported. Three victims had apparently been
counted twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge in disasters,'' said Jeff Jellets, a
spokesman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. ``The
priority is on saving lives. Sometimes that tracking gets a little
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst since WWII
</P>
<P>
   No tornadoes since World War II have caused so many fatalities
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   To promote recovery from the storms, President Clinton issued a
disaster declaration late Tuesday for the four affected counties:
Mitchell, Grady, Colquitt and Tift. Storm victims will be eligible
for federal aid, as will local governments. Clinton's declaration
also allows federal troops to assist in the recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will tour the region today, the White
House announced. Gore's presidential campaign canceled a political
event scheduled today in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is expected to meet with storm victims in the
hardest-hit county, Mitchell, where 12 people died. He also will
hold a press conference in Camilla, the Mitchell County seat, with
Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 12 killed in Mitchell County, state officials said,
six people died in Grady County and one in Colquitt County. No
fatalities were reported in Tift County, but property damage there
was substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported few problems in the region as recovery efforts
began in earnest Tuesday. Authorities had received no reports of
looting or other criminal activity by late Tuesday, said Lisa
Janak, a spokeswoman for GEMA.
</P>
<P>
   Damage assessments by federal disaster teams showed that of the
300 homes that received major damage, about half were house
trailers, said Boone, the FEMA official.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said Georgia has adequate building codes that
require mobile homes to be secured, and ``we have no indication
those codes were not in effect and were not followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those killed were in mobile homes, particularly in a
sprawling trailer park just outside Camilla. Of the 100 trailers in
the unnamed park, only three were still inhabitable after the
storms.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from the American Red Cross canvassed the park
Tuesday, trying to assess the damage and the needs of those who
survived.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's almost impossible to tell where individual houses
were,'' said volunteer Carolyn Bonner, walking along a street with
no remaining structures. ``Some were taken from this side of the
road and dumped on the other side. And vice versa. Some ended up on
this side.'' The tornado zone attracted scores of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   At an empty industrial warehouse in Camilla, Hew Lipscomb of
Adventist Community Services collected donations of nonperishable
food and building supplies.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to keep the 18,000-square-foot building open _ and to
sleep in his motor home in the parking lot _ for eight to 10 weeks,
or however long storm victims need his help.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Layel of Springfield was one of 40 members of the Georgia
Baptist Convention's ``chain saw strike team'' who converged on the
region _ volunteers ready to clear away toppled trees, clean up
debris and stretch plastic covering over roofs torn asunder.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusters on the scene
</P>
<P>
   Others helping the storm victims were paid to be there,
including utility workers from Georgia and Alabama, 300 state law
enforcement and forestry workers, and dozens of insurance
adjusters.
</P>
<P>
   The adjusters cruised devastated neighborhoods, the magnetic
signs attached to their rental cars notifying policyholders _ most
of whom have no telephone service _ that they were there to process
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction stunned even the adjusters, veterans of natural
disasters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by looking at the damage, you can tell it was a major,
major tornado,'' said John Dean of Allstate Insurance Co.'s
national catastrophe team. ``No matter how many catastrophes you go
on, it's always just pure devastation to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Allstate policyholders Johnny and Mary Thomas, whose trailer and
three cars were destroyed, were equally stunned.
</P>
<P>
   The roof over the couple's bedroom was ripped away, and they
were pelted with debris as the storm passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love the movie 'Twister,''' Mary Thomas said. ``But
I don't think I want to see it ever again.''

<P>
   CAIRO, Ga. _ As they picked through the rubble of their lives,
the people of southwest Georgia learned firsthand Tuesday about the
randomness of nature. It was not just that the killer tornadoes
that roared through on Monday night demolished some houses while
leaving neighboring ones unscathed. It was that the storm selected
its victims from across the spectrum of life, taking both those who
were nearing the end and those who had barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 18 people that the authorities now believe were killed
by the storm were an 88-year-old grandfather and a 7 1/2-month-old
girl. They were the oldest and the youngest victims identified thus
far. They died here in Grady County, both flung by the wind from
demolished house trailers onto the loamy farmland of this rural,
churchgoing region.
</P>
<P>
   Both left grieving families, one mourning the unexpected
conclusion of a rich and contented life, the other clinging to
their faith that God always has a purpose, even for the taking of
the most innocent child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I don't understand,'' said Annette C. Harrell, the
58-year-old grandmother of the youngest victim, Kylie Rae Harrell.
``But I know God is in control and He has a purpose for everything
that happens, and I'm accepting it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Georgia Emergency Management Agency on
Tuesday adjusted the death count from the storm, saying that 18 had
died in three counties, not 22 as the agency had previously
reported. They attributed the difference to double-counting in the
confused first hours as many victims were transported across county
lines to hospitals and morgues.
</P>
<P>
   The twister storm was the deadliest in Georgia since 1944. The
National Weather Service classified two of what apparently were at
least four tornadoes as F3 storms on the Fujita scale, which ranks
twisters from F1 to F5. An F3 tornado is considered very
destructive, with winds of between 158 and 206 mph.
</P>
<P>
   No other bodies were found Tuesday, and officials spent a clear
and temperate day reconnecting downed power lines and providing
food and shelter for homeless victims. State prisoners in white
uniforms helped sift through debris. ``It's just cleanup time
now,'' said Capt. Sam L. Singletary of the Grady County Sheriff's
Department. ``It's going to take awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Georgia officials, President Clinton declared
that a major disaster existed in four counties, making federal
money available for emergency housing and for grants and loans to
individuals and businesses seeking to rebuild. Vice President Al
Gore, who will compete in Georgia's Democratic presidential primary
on March 7, plans to travel to the area on Wednesday to survey the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   As the relatives of 88-year-old John E. Hancock held a tearful
reunion on the site where the elderly man's trailer once stood,
Kylie Rae Harrell's family spent the day in a waiting room at Grady
General Hospital here, where the baby's father and stepsister
remain hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The child's mother, 28-year-old Shannon Harrell, died along with
her infant daughter when their trailer was blown off its foundation
into a field planted with kale and collards. The child's father,
Todd Harrell, 32, suffered broken ribs, internal injuries that
required surgery, and a long gash along the top of his head. Her
stepsister, Brittany, 11, smiled weakly Tuesday as she was wheeled
down the hallway with her left arm in a sling and bandages on her
face.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Harrell, the baby's grandmother, showed off a glossy
photograph of the family during happier times. Taken on Dec. 16, it
shows the Harrells seated before their Christmas tree, each of them
smiling and strikingly handsome. Todd Harrell, who stands 6-foot-4,
is holding his infant daughter around her waist with a big paw of a
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the love,'' Mrs. Harrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Harrell, who had been married to Todd for four years,
had miscarried once before becoming pregnant with Kylie Rae, making
the baby's delivery last June 30 all the more special, Mrs. Harrell
said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' she said. ``We were all there in the
hospital together. I held her less than an hour after her birth,
and the look on my son and his wife's face was just precious. They
were so devastated when she lost the first one, and they couldn't
wait for her to get pregnant again. When she did it was a glorious
event.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harrell, a former tight end with the Cairo High School
Syrupmakers, so named because the area once produced bountiful
sugar cane, is a loan officer with a farm credit agency in this
town of 9,300 people. He makes loans to the small farmers who plant
the cotton and peanuts and harvest the pecans that form the
economic foundation of this area, just north of the Florida border.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is a region connected by long, two-lane highways that gently
rise and fall over the landscape. In winter, green John Deere
cotton pickers sit idle in the fields, surrounded by the white fuzz
and brown stalks left after last year's harvest. Rusty pickups race
down the roads bearing bumper stickers that declare: ``My President
is Charlton Heston.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Harrell family is well known here, with Todd being a leader
of the Royal Ambassadors, a Bible scouting group at the Pine Level
Baptist Church. He had been an active hunter and fisherman, but
that changed once Kylie Rae was born.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the storm, Todd Harrell tried to move his family
to the house of Ricky L. Powe, a friend since high school, when the
winds picked up, but he did not have time. Before they could leave,
the trailer was shattered. Despite his own injuries, Harrell
managed to get Brittany to safety, but he apparently passed out
before he could find his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first word out of his mouth was go get my baby and my
wife,'' said Powe, who arrived just before Harrell collapsed. Powe
said that neighbors found Shannon quickly, but walked past Kylie
Rae several times, mistaking her in the darkness for a doll.

 &HT;    Camilla witnesses community's spirit
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMILLA, Ga. _ The spirit of tornado recovery in South Georgia
is a man who can look at his roofless home, where a crumpled pickup
has replaced his front porch, and say, ``I'm blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a pair of farm workers who brought their Bobcat into a
devastated neighborhood of strangers and started asking, ``Where
can we help?''
</P>
<P>
   It is corporate executives manning chain saws in low-income
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tornado hit hardest in working-class residential
areas in Mitchell County, the entire community has rallied to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very strong, close-knit community,'' said Camilla
police Chief Ray Folsom. ``I'm sure we're going to see this
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Folsom said many of the estimated 300 families displaced by the
storm were people of modest means. ``They may not have had the
nicest of homes, but they worked hard to invest in something they
can call their own. They're not going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Even federal disaster relief officials have taken note of the
people's resolute spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of folks in southwest Georgia are very independent,''
said Shelley Boone, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
Southeastern regional program director. His agency's damage
assessment crews have observed many cases where tornado victims and
their friends and neighbors aren't waiting for the federal programs
to kick in, but are starting to do some of the heavy cleanup work
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not necessarily surprising, since the magnitude of a
disaster's impact is often magnified when it hits a relatively
small community like Camilla, where the population is about 7,000,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a community this size, it's your neighbors who have gotten
hurt, the people you go to work with, the people you go to church
with,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit is perhaps seen most clearly in people like Harry
Williams, who lost his home and much of what he owned. Williams
said he considers himself blessed, in that he and his wife and
daughter survived without serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge his good fortune, Williams said, he only had to look
next door, where a neighbor was killed. He said he's determined not
to be defeated by his losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to start over,'' he said. ``Life's not going to end
over this. I've lived here for 25 years, and I'm going to build me
a new home, right back here.''
</P>
<P>
   About all he can do in the mean time, he said, is to
``sympathize with my neighbors, say my prayers, and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his employers, the Cagle Keystone chicken
processing company, have been understanding, giving him and other
tornado victims time off to attend to the problems brought on by
the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering from disasters presents a whole new set of
difficulties. Even with insurance and government help, losses are
usually not fully covered. Filing claims and keeping track of
paperwork is time-consuming and confusing. Especially in smaller
communities, finding enough skilled construction workers can pose
problems. Destroyed and damaged structures usually must be restored
under new building codes that often require larger lots and more
expensive construction methods.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Vienna, which lost almost one-third of its
structures to a tornado last spring, has still not repaired federal
rental housing owned by the city because of problems with an
out-of-state insurance company. About half the 35 units were
destroyed by the storm, leaving the small South Georgia town with a
shortage of low-cost rental housing. At his shell of a home in
Camilla, William S. Smith said he's been too overwhelmed with
salvaging his few salvageable possessions to plot out his next
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine I probably will build back,'' Smith said. ``This
here is my land.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie Doris Coleman, a clothing factory supervisor, had a small
group of relatives and friends helping her sort through the pile of
debris that had been her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much choice but to go on,'' she said. ``I've been
here all my life. After I get everything tended to, I've got to go
back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Cagle Keystone, the county's largest private employer, has
temporarily altered its focus from poultry to people in need, said
Buddy Paracca, the company general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is family down here,'' Paracca said. The plant, which
employs 2,800 people, virtually shut down operations Monday and
part of Tuesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But its kitchens kept going, preparing about 1,200 meals daily
for emergency relief workers and disaster victims at the shelters,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has not yet been confirmed how many of its workers
suffered major damage in the storm, the company, a joint venture of
the Cagle and Keystone companies, has established an $100,000 fund
for disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Even though government relief program funds will be available,
Paracca said, ``We can't wait. That first period after a disaster
hits is the most difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Paracca said he has seen almost heroic examples of generosity in
the wake of the storm. One of his supervisors was out in a the
storm-damaged area, offering his help and his chain saw skill, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit is what you'd expect of the people down here,'' he
said. ``Some people may not have a roof on their home, but they're
looking for what they can do for their neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grady County, a small of volunteers and professional rescue
workers labored shoulder to shoulder Tuesday. At the home Gladys
Powe, volunteers were cleaning debris and repairing the roof. Grady
County Electric Membership Corp. worker Jamie Salter said power
crews from as far away as Tallahassee and North Georgia were
helping restore electricity. State Trooper Scott Fisher came from
Savannah to hold a post on Ga. 112 near the Mitchell-Grady County
line.
</P>
<P>
   He said troopers from all over Georgia were pulling duty in the
tornado-hit counties. Also pitching in was the Georgia Forestry
Commission. Randy Johnson, forester for the Grady-Mitchell-Colquitt
district, said, ``We have been out removing downed trees so the
emergency crews could get through. The full extent of the damage
probably won't be known until the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Many storm victims face emotional damage.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Nelson, who is medically disabled, slumped in a sort of
semi-shock as he sorted through the devastation of his apartment.
Nelson said he was knocked out and blown across a highway from the
apartment, and he was woken by the running water in the ditch where
he landed.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his sisters and a niece were seriously injured in the
storm, he said. He might move away from Camilla, but it's still too
early to think about making plans like that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I going to regroup, that's what I'm trying to figure
out,'' Nelson said.

 CAIRO, Ga.: a doll.

   On Tuesday, the Harrells' belongings were strewn across the
fields. Teddy bears, baby bottles and a crib mobile with stuffed
pink ponies all spoke of the life that had been lived there.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harrell, who is sedated, told his father Tuesday morning
that he knows that his wife and daughter are gone. ``He said he
knows that it happens,'' Mrs. Harrell said, ``but he doesn't know
why it has to happen.'' Nonetheless, she said confidently, faith
will get them through.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles to the north, John E. Hancock's three sons and
numerous other relatives gathered where his trailer once stood to
salvage a few belongings and to reminisce about their family
patriarch. Hancock had been born in the area, had lived most of his
life in Jacksonville, Fla., and had moved back with his wife in
1991 to live next door to his youngest son, Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hancock, 49, and his wife had purchased a 1900 farmhouse and
had nearly finished restoring it when the tornado crumpled it as
they huddled in a doorway. They emerged without a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Hancock, living in a double-wide trailer next door,
was not so lucky. His body was found in a field across Old Newton
Road, where the remains of his trailer were deposited in a
4-foot-high heap. The foundation was reduced to a pile of cement
blocks, surrounded by a tangle of uprooted pecan trees.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock had spent his life as a buyer and salesman for Colonial
Stores and for Sears. But his primary love was his family,
including his wife, his three sons and his five grandchildren. He
had been married to his wife for 65 years when she died last
October after a long battle against Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   During his wife's struggle, Hancock fed her and bathed her and
cared for her in every way, Lee Hancock said. And once the family
placed her in a nursing home a year before her death, Hancock
continued to spend virtually all of every day with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not miss a day that she was in there,'' he said. ``I
tried to get him to go fishing at the beach with us and he couldn't
bring himself to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock was active in the Midway Baptist Church, and loved to
tend his garden of tomatoes, okra, cucumbers and peas. He often
spoke of how glad he was that he had moved back to south Georgia,
where he could be close to sisters, brothers, nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   As they looked Tuesday for comfort and reassurance, the
relatives of this devoted family man kept coming back to one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're looking at it is that Mom and Dad were married
for 65 years and they're not separated anymore,'' Lee Hancock said.
``They came back together on Valentine's Day.''

 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEE, Mass. _ Under storm clouds late one August afternoon, the
photographer Gregory Crewdson and his swarm of assistants had
overrun Tabar Avenue here, transforming the tiny street lined with
a dozen 1950s prefabricated houses into a film set.
</P>
<P>
   By hooking up cables to the circuit breakers of the homes,
Crewdson had managed to flood the entire neighborhood with
cinematic lighting and roily gusts from a fog machine. The
photographer directed a cameraman, poised in a cherry picker
overhead, to point an 8-by-10-inch view camera at the scene below.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, mayhem struck. The cameraman was about to collide with
a telephone wire, prompting Crewdson to yell and wave his arms
frantically. At that very moment, a clap of thunder sounded,
releasing a torrent of rain, and the photographer's entourage
scrambled to cover the equipment with tarps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about creating this collaboration with the production
crew and the neighborhood,'' said Crewdson, wearing a baseball cap,
Ron Howard-style, and looking very much like a movie director.
``But it's not a professional operation. It's chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaos may lie behind Crewdson's work, but you would hardly know
it from looking at his pictures of suburbia, where an eerie calm
always prevails. Since 1998, the 37-year-old photographer has been
creating a series titled ``Twilight,'' which now includes 20
meticulously detailed, richly colored pictures, all taken in and
around the outskirts of Lee, ranging from domestic interiors to
landscape views. The photographs, featuring the local townspeople,
are always shot at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twilight is this magic hour,'' said Crewdson. ``It's the
perfect hour between day and night, when ambient and artificial
light come together. It's a time of transcendence when
extraordinary things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of Crewdson's most recent ``Twilight'' photographs are
now on view at Luhring Augustine Gallery. With the elaborate
production, which called for nearly 35 assistants and technicians
including electricians, a cinematographer and tree surgeon, it took
over a year to create the C-prints, which measure 48 by 60 inches.
His early work, from 1986 to 1988, is also on exhibition at
Partobject, a gallery in Carrboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The collision of the ordinary and extraordinary, the normal and
the strange, lies at the heart of Crewdson's work, in which a
perfect world is perverted by surrealist, macabre touches. In one
``Twilight'' photograph, a glassy-eyed man is sprawled face down on
a bed of leaves next to an open car door, as if he has just been
killed. Wolves guard his body, casting watchful eyes at a distant
house.
</P>
<P>
   Like the filmmakers David Cronenberg, David Lynch and Alfred
Hitchcock, from whom he draws inspiration, Crewdson seeks to map
out a terrain that is at once familiar and terrifying, the
photographic equivalent to Freud's definition of the uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Gregory is plowing crop circles in the Berkshires or
photographing dirt sculptures, he's taking on the fact that there
is surrealism in everyday life,'' said A.M. Homes, a novelist who
also writes about photography. ``Sometimes it's obsessional;
sometimes it's deja vu weird. It's demented Norman Rockwell.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where he still lives,
Crewdson perceived suburbia as an ideal, far-off place. After
graduating from the State University of New York at Purchase, he
entered the graduate art program at Yale in 1986 and began to
photograph genre scenes around Lee, in the Berkshires near
Stockbridge, Mass., where his family owned a log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, in his ``Natural Wonder'' series, he built
stomach-turning still lifes and dioramas, photographing them inside
his studio. It included close-up images of moths descending on a
screen window and mice climbing over a dismembered, sore-covered
leg. Because of his ghoulish sensibility, he was compared to Cindy
Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staged part and creepy part of his photographs are the
connection to me,'' said Ms. Sherman. ``Blood and guts and rotting
decay and the irony and humor in that and the fact that it is all
artificial. The way I see it, it's not meant to scare you. But
Gregory's work is still different territory. It's about landscapes
and a statement about photojournalism whereas I'm using myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Crewdson returned to Tabar Avenue, ascending a cherry
picker to photograph the backyards and front lawns from an aerial
perspective in black and white, his ``Hover'' series. At first
glance the images look like conventional suburban scenes, but upon
closer study something is amiss, like a man irrationally laying sod
across the street and connecting his front lawn to his neighbor's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Crewdson started the ``Twilight'' series, once again
focusing on the land of kiddie pools and sprinkler systems, not
because of any personal associations it conjured but rather to
explore his own psychology. ``I use these locations as a private
landscape or backdrop to create my own narratives,'' said Crewsdon.
``The suburban landscape is alien and strange and exotic. I
photograph it out of longing and desire. My photographs are also
about repression and internal angst.''

 LEE, Mass.: internal angst.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Crewdson suffering angst. The easygoing
photographer hardly seems like a tortured soul who relies on art to
sublimate his fears and fantasies. But, as Ruth Bloom, a Los
Angeles collector of Crewdson's work and former gallery owner,
pointed out: ``Gregory comes across as more normal than most. But
even in normalcy there's always that undercurrent, that little bit
of darkness. His work allows him to explore what we're normally
uncomfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Crewdson recalled that during his childhood, which was a happy
one, his father, a psychoanalyst who died in 1998, met with
patients in the basement of the Brooklyn brownstone in which
Crewdson grew up. He would press his ear to the floorboards and
listen to the therapy sessions, projecting images onto the
patients' narratives. It was, he says, his ``first photographic
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Those early experiences haunt him to this day. ``My father is
the most central person in my work,'' said Crewdson. ``All the
pictures are indirectly about him and the need to connect to
something larger. All these pictures are about moments of
revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures in Crewdson's photographs are often pictured in
moments of reverie. In one ``Twilight'' image, a middle-aged
pregnant woman, is seen from inside a house through a window framed
with white curtains. She is wearing only a white bra and panties,
and appears to be sleepwalking across her front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Bathed in silvery, raking light, painterly in sensuality, the
somnolent woman seems possessed, as if drawn by a power greater
than herself to the unseen source of illumination lying outside the
picture. The metaphysical overtones _ maternity, illumination, the
overall sense of mystery _ conflate with the mundane iconography of
Middle America, the freestanding mailboxes, an old Buick and a
trailer in the background, to create an image that is reminiscent
of ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' a movie that Crewdson
repeatedly cited as influential.
</P>
<P>
   Crewdson described his work as a fusion of documentary and
fiction, portraying real people in a real place, where he directs
them to act out scenes that include staged sets and props. Despite
the theatricality of his photography, and his use of gels and
computers to enhance the colors of his pictures, he does not want
them to look artificial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unique to Gregory and the generation he taught is that
they come out of this tradition of documentary photography, like
Robert Frank, and blend it with this fictive and created thing,''
said Homes. ``They take the studio out into the real world. They're
using reality as a stage set and then manipulating it. There's a
weird docudrama. It's a whole new kind of photography. You used to
want to make pictures that didn't fool people. Now no one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Crewdson has taught art at Yale, where a number of
his students, like Ana Gaskell, Malerie Marder, Dana Hoey and
Justine Kurland, have received critical attention. ``As a teacher,
Gregory has evolved a whole generation,'' said Connie Butler,
associate curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.
``His role has been important in terms of color photography. He's
very grounded in the history of photography and intervenes in that
tradition of still life and documentary and reworks those tropes in
interesting ways. What I see in his students are references to
straight photography, but they're also introducing ideas about
performance and issues of gender and identity, particularly the
women.''
</P>
<P>
   His students maintain that just as Crewdson will shoot and
reshoot a scene, painstakingly creating bizarre tableaus, he
insists that they take risks and go to extremes for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things that will stay with me
forever is Greg's advocacy of artistic obsession,'' said Katy
Grannan, who graduated from Yale last year. ``He always tells a
story of a woman he called to ask if she would mind if he mowed a
perfect circle in her backyard. She said, do what you have to do.
He told that story all the time. He always told us, do whatever you
have to do to make your work.''

IN DEFEAT FOR MUGABE, ZIMBABWE VOTERS REJECT NEW CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Voters in Zimbabwe have dealt President
Robert Mugabe a stinging setback, rejecting a draft constitution
that his opponents charged would have entrenched his powers.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently fed up with fuel shortages, soaring inflation and
steep unemployment, urban voters in particular demonstrated by a
sizeable margin that they wanted nothing to do with strengthening
the hand of the leader many believe to be responsible for the
country's dismal economic plight.
</P>
<P>
   Official results for the referendum held Saturday and Sunday
showed that almost 55 percent of voters opposed the proposal, and
that opposition in the cities ran as high as four to one. Only
about a quarter of the 5 million eligible voters cast ballots, a
turnout that apparently undermined Mugabe's strength in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to constitutional reforms _ which, among other
things, would have allowed Mugabe to dissolve Parliament without
cause _ the referendum also proposed giving the government the
power to seize white-owned commercial farms without compensation, a
move Mugabe has often threatened despite warnings that this would
cripple one of Zimbabwe's major export earners.
</P>
<P>
   Though the referendum was not binding, Mugabe declared on state
television Tuesday night that he ``respects the will of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us all, winners and losers, accept the referendum verdict
and start planning our way for the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Mugabe, 75, the only leader this nation of 12.5 million
people has known since it achieved majority rule two decades ago,
the defeat was regarded as a considerable setback, one certain to
energize the growing opposition as the country prepares for
parliamentary elections in April. Mugabe himself does not face
re-election until the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referendum is just a curtain raiser for the general
election,'' said Johannes Mutasa, 23, who said Mugabe was ``too
power-hungry'' and the draft constitution demonstrated that. ``It
would have been very dangerous. He wants to run the country like a
king.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to start again and do it right and rebuild
our foundation,'' said Isaac Maposa, national coordinator for the
National Constitutional Assembly, part of a coalition that has
mounted an increasingly stiff challenge to Mugabe and campaigned
against him in the referendum..
</P>
<P>
   Though the 4,000 white commercial farmers campaigned strongly
for a ``no'' vote, taking out advertisements in newspapers that
said they were being ``treated vindictively,'' the results were
seen more as a reflection of the widespread frustration with the
country's plight and Mugabe's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is well over 60 percent, fuel is scarce, and the
International Monetary Fund cut off assistance to the impoverished
country after it found that the government was underreporting the
cost of its participation in the war in Congo, where Mugabe has
dispatched 7,000 troops to prop up the government of President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outside the headquarters of the National Constitutional
Assembly, scores of supporters erupted in cheers as the results
were read out Tuesday afternoon _ 697,754 against and 578,210 in
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Many waved the same red and white ``Vote No'' signs that have
been plastering around the country in recent days. Others carried
signs reading ``No to Mugabe, No to ZANU-PF.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the opposition can turn its victory into genuine
political power is far from certain. Mugabe has been ruthless in
maintaining the dominance of his Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can underestimate Mugabe's political power
and I don't think you can underestimate his support among
Zimbabweans,'' said Dr. Beverly Peters, a senior researcher at the
South African Institute for International Affairs. She said a close
look at the referendum results makes clear that the opposition's
push for seats in Parliament will not be easy..
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals that the populous is not happy, but it's premature
to say it means the end of Mugabe,'' Peters said. ``Very few people
voted, and very few people voted in the rural areas and the rural
areas have always supported him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the excitement of the first majority-rule elections,
turnouts have been low in Zimbabwean votes, and it was the success
of the opposition in mobilizing urban voters that shaped the
outcome. That could change in national elections.
</P>
<P>
   It was also doubtful that the referendum results would help the
country with international aid organizations, since Mugabe remains
in charge and is not likely to withdraw forces from Congo or
undertake the painful reforms the country requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the IMF or the World Bank will be moved much
by this,'' said Tony Hawkins, an economist at the University of
Zimbabwe. ``Their arguments with Zimbabwe are about economic policy
and the things that Zimbabwe has to do are unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   But however the results of the referendum ultimately play out,
opposition groups are certain to remember Tuesday's victory as a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a choice between the status quo and change and I think
the advocates of change have carried the day,'' said Morgan
Tsvangirai, leader of the new Movement for Democratic Change, one
of the fledgling opposition parties that have tapped the country's
economic crisis to attract supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of writing a new constitution has been debated ever
since Zimbabwe achieved majority rule under the Lancaster House
Agreement of 1979 which ended white-minority rule.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, campaigners for a new constitution formed the
National Constitutional Assembly, and last year finally won
agreement from the government to take up the issue. But Assembly
members quickly took issue with the government's handling of the
process, like the fact that the 400 members of the draft commission
were hand-picked by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, when the commission issued a draft, critics said
it failed to reflect some of the most persistent concerns expressed
by citizens in the many forums held by the commission. In
particular, the critics said, it failed to dilute the powers of the
president, and in fact entrenched many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several weeks, the process became even more heated
when a raft of amendments were added, including a provision
allowing the government to seize white-owned land and declaring
that any compensation would be the responsibility not of Zimbabwe,
but of Britain, the former colonial ruler. Britain rejected the
claim as preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of land ownership has bedeviled the country since
independence. Only about 70,000 whites remain in Zimbabwe, fewer
than 2 percent of the population, but they own 70 percent of the
land, while millions of rural blacks are crowded onto ``communal
areas'' of poor, stony soil.

   BOSTON _ After threatening to withdraw support for the Olympic
games, John Hancock Financial Services Tuesday said it would
continue to sponsor the sporting events, giving the International
Olympic Committee a massive vote of confidence following last
year's allegations of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, which will spend $25 million over four years as a
sponsor and an additional $24 million on advertising during that
period, said the agreement with the IOC contains an ethics clause
which gives the company the right to withdraw at any time if
another scandal arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did, which is something no other sponsor of the games
has done, is insist on an ethics clause that says if the Olympic
movement conducts itself in a manner that is detrimental to our
brand, we can cancel our contract at any time,'' said David
D'Alessandro, president and chief executive elect of the financial
services firm. ``This is typical in movie star's contracts, and in
sports contracts with athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers said Tuesday that John Hancock's continued
support of the games should ensure future advertising and the
financial health of upcoming competitions because it will send a
message to other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very significant day for the Olympics in terms of
sponsorship,'' said Bob Williams of Burns Sports in Chicago.
``Getting a major company like John Hancock back into the fold
offers tremendous credibility to the IOC. It gives them a case to
point to and say, ``Look, this major advertiser and supporter has
stayed with us because of what we did to clean (our problems) up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems came to light last year following a bribery
scandal in which investigators found that Salt Lak City officials
had spent more than $1 million on cash gifts, scholarships and
other presents to committee members. The purpose of the gifts was
to help the city land a winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. In
all, 10 members of the IOC were expelled or forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Greysercq, a marketing professor at Harvard Business
School who specializes in the business of sports, described
Tuesday's announcement as ``a very clear signal that one of the
most vocal critics of the IOC has found a way to feel comfortable
with an ongoing relationship and the confort stems from the ethics
clause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hancock is the first, technically to renew its contract,''
said Jim Andrews, president of IEG Sponsorship Report in Chicago,
which tracks the financial sponsorship of the Olympic games. ``The
fact that it is returning suggests that it has taken a close look
at the reforms and feels there is still value for them (at the
games) despite the scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, John Hancock pulled its television advertising for
the games, and said it would pull away completely if it did not see
significant reforms. At one point, D'Alassandro reportedly ordered
the Olympic rings removed from company stationery.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the IOC has established an ethics committee, made sure
that a majority of the ethics committee members are not from the
IOC, and has developed a study commission and given it the
authority to delve into the institution to determine how it should
be financed, choose its members, and operate. The group has also
changed the way the host city for the 2006 Winter Games will be
selected.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is among 11 firms, nine of them headquartered in
the United States, that, as top sponsors, spend as much as $50
million over four years in support of the international sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   Under most agreements with the IOC, companies are locked into
sponsorship once they sign, making it impossible to break away
during the life of the contract, even when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is believed to be the first major backer to
negotiate an agreement with an escape clause. Technically, its
contract was set to expire Dec. 31. It was not clear Tuesday
whether other companies would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the IOC and its sponsors provides much
needed financial backing for the games while allowing the companies
to capitalize, through advertising and other venues, on the
underlying values the Olympic Games purport to represent. Values
such as sportsmanship, team spirit, courage, pride, honor, and
respect for self and others are all associated with with the games.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, news last year that some members of the IOC had been
involved in a bribery scandal in Salt Lake City threatened the
reputation of the committee, and angered D'Alassandro and others
whose companies and products have been linked with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hancock has sponsored the USA gymnastics
competition and figure skating. Last year, it began a four-year
sponsorship of the John Hancock Champions on Ice Summer Tour, a
figure skating tour sanctioned the IOC. It has also sponsored,
among other events, a 24-city hockey tour in which the US Olympic
team was pitted against the Canadian and Russian Olympic teams as
well as college and National Hockey League teams.

 HARARE, Zimbabwe: stony soil.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under pressure to improve distribution of farmland, Mugabe has
introduced various plans to seize some of the white-owned
commercial farms and to distribute the land among black peasants.
But the proposals have been opposed by the IMF because of the
damage they would do to exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the referendum campaign, the government tried again to tap
the issue. A blitz of newspaper and television advertising
reinforced that message, with talk of ``masters'' and ``sellouts''
and images of white voters sporting ``Vote No'' T-shirts,
suggesting that a ``no'' vote vote would serve the former
colonialists.
</P>
<P>
   But there were only a few whites Tuesday among the 200 or so
people present at the National Constitutional Assembly
headquarters. One of them was Ian D. Smith, the white settler who
led the white minority in unilaterally declaring independence for
Rhodesia from Britain in 1965 and led the maverick government until
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this means there is hope,'' he said. ``They are in
trouble. How can you justify all the corruption they have been part
of? How do answer for that? That is what they are going to have to
try to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Black opponents of the constitution rejected any notion that the
vote did not serve the black majority. ``Zimbabweans have spoken,
black or white,'' Maposa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous to talk about the white vote,'' Tsvangirai
said. ``They are a very small minority. It's really just
scapegoating. The whites have always been the whipping boys for
Mugabe.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan N. Moyo, the chief spokesman for the constitutional
commission, said it was clear to him was that the vote had not been
about the document he and colleagues drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know is that people voted as a message to Mugabe and
not because they didn't like the constitution,'' said Moyo, a
Zimbabwean-born political scientist on leave from his post at the
University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a pyrrhic victory,'' he added . ``It's a no, but
what do you get for a no? The answer is nothing. Now they have to
have the elections under the same constitution they've been
complaining about for years. The ruling party stands to have the
last laugh because when they celebrate, they will be celebrating an
election victory.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Mbare, one of this city's townships, voters
said that the constitution was about entrenching the president's
power and their vote was about curbing that power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people don't want the current government,'' Cornelius
Mashiri, 40, said Tuesday night as he walked home from his job at a
candy factory. ``We're tired of them. They've made lots of promises
and they weren't telling people the truth.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Clothes folder. Dog walker. Morning bartender. Those
are a few of the glamorous professions undertaken by Mark Setlock
during his self-described ``squalor days'' a few years back, when
he was living on a ``syringe-lined'' street in the East Village,
learning about urban ecology. ``I saw mice, I saw cockroaches,''
Setlock said cheerily. ``I saw silverfish for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Nowadays, his prospects are considerably
brighter, starring as he does in the one-man show ``Fully
Committed,'' a satirical look at a day in the life of a
reservations clerk at a four-star restaurant besieged by
high-powered customers demanding tables.
</P>
<P>
   The play, written by Becky Mode, a friend of Setlock's, and
directed by Nicholas Martin, opened to raves in September at the
Vineyard Theater and moved to a commercial run at the 180-seat
Cherry Lane in December. A representative of the show said recently
that ``the box-office staff have had some astonishing encounters
with people who are not accustomed to being told no.'' Sounds
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   While a steady paycheck is always nice, Setlock, 31, said his
success was particularly meaningful because much of the play's
fictional action was born out of his own miserable experiences as
an actor and day laborer. ``Oh, the things I've seen,'' he said
wryly over breakfast one morning in the East Village. ``All grist
for my mill.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief grist: from 1994 to 1996, Setlock, an unemployed actor
from the Midwest, was a reservations clerk in the basement of
Bouley, the high-end, four-star New York restaurant founded by the
chef David Bouley that closed in 1996. (Mode worked there briefly,
checking coats.)
</P>
<P>
   And while Bouley is never mentioned, there is plenty of obvious
biography at work in ``Fully Committed.'' In the play, after all,
Setlock portrays Sam, an unemployed actor from the Midwest,
struggling through his reservations shift in an unnamed, famously
popular New York restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Sam deals with, as did Setlock, all manner of the
petulant and the persnickity. There is Bunny Vandevere, a monied
matron from the Upper East Side; Jean-Claude, the ur-French maitre
d'; and Bryce, a manic, and imaginary, assistant to the model Naomi
Campbell who requests a ``no-fat, no-salt, no-dairy, no-sugar,
no-chicken, no-meat, no-fish, no soy tasting menu.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Setlock plays 35 characters, switching from role to role
with deadly rapid-fire accuracy. Accents _ Southern, German,
Southern German _ roll out of his mouth synchronized with their
attendant facial acrobatics. By his own account, it is a skill he
discovered while growing up in a middle-class Cleveland
neighborhood, imitating Bugs Bunny on the Saturday morning
cartoons. ``I played a lot alone,'' he said. ``Television was my
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Setlock went on to study acting at Kent State University, where
he once fooled a radio disc jockey into believing he was Dr. Ruth
Westheimer and took questions about sex from the public. (
Westheimer's voice _ channeled through Setlock _ is heard in
``Fully Committed.'')
</P>
<P>
   He continued his training at the American Repertory Theater in
Cambridge, Mass., where he met Mode, then came to New York in 1992
to find work as an actor. Instead, he got a job at the Gap on West
34th Street, then the largest Gap in the world. ``You would live in
fear that the manager would say, `Mark, go work on the pant
wall,''' he said. ``It was (italics)enormous.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   He settled into a small apartment in the East Village and worked
with a variety of downtown companies, including Todo Con Nada and
Target Margin. But getting paid for acting proved trickier. He quit
the Gap, and after stints as a ``dog exercise specialist'' and a
bartender _ ``people started tapping on the window at noon'' _ he
landed the Bouley job, juggling six phone lines eight hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   He got a final callback for the one-man show ``The Night Larry
Kramer Kissed Me'' and, more agonizingly, was cast in the workshop
but not the actual production of a little musical called ``Rent.''
``I thought I would go insane,'' he said. ``I was tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Rent'' moved to Broadway in 1996, Setlock landed a role
as an understudy and quit Bouley. It would prove the starting point
for ``Fully Committed.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, he had been entertaining friends, including Mode,
with tales of obnoxious restaurant patrons. He kept a list over his
phone with categories of callers _ ``hags,'' ``depressed
secretaries,'' ``television anchormen'' _ that he would point to as
the calls came in.
</P>
<P>
   Mode, who had long wanted to write a play set in a restaurant,
thought his experiences might be a jumping-off place. The producer
David Stone agreed. ``I thought it was a great idea for a play,''
Stone said, ``because everyone I knew lived their lives trying to
get into restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Setlock and Mode developed the piece together, making lists of
types of characters while Setlock improvised his calls. To find the
voices, he relied on his past job experiences. ``A lot of the
voices are really similar,'' he said. ``My brother is just my
father faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Setlock is scheduled to perform until September. There is some
talk that ``Fully Committed'' may become a television show, though
Setlock is uncertain how he would fit in. ``I'm not that interested
in restaurants,'' he said. ``I'm interested in freaks, the odd
people in the world. I like to take them all in and see if I can
spit them back out.''

HOUSE MEMBERS CRITICIZE U.S. DRUG EFFORTS IN COLOMBIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PHILIP CAUTHON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With reports that cocaine production is on the rise
in Colombia, House members Tuesday challenged the Clinton
administration's two-year, $1.6 billion plan to help the South
American country's fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Citing intelligence estimates, administration officials said
Colombia's cocaine production jumped to 572 tons last year, up
almost 20 percent from a year earlier. Colombia now produces about
80 percent of world supply of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the White House has ignored the growing problems
in Colombia, Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., questioned whether the plan
laid out last month by President Clinton goes far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone must be accountable for the disaster at our
doorstep,'' Mica said during a House subcommittee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic members of the panel voiced
doubts about the adequacy of U.S. aid and whether it was being
delivered quickly enough. In addition, lawmakers expressed concern
about the Colombian government's past support for paramilitary
groups accused of narco-trafficking and human rights violation.
</P>
<P>
   Members also sought assurances that the United States was not
getting involved in a ``Vietnam-like quagmire'' in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has not and will not get involved with the
counterinsurgency in Colombia,'' said Ana Maria Salazar, who
oversees anti-drug-trafficking efforts at the Pentagon. ``The
Department of Defense will not step over the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating Colombia's counterdrug efforts, the country has
been battling guerrilla groups since the 1960s. The anti-government
forces are allied with cocaine producers, who help fund guerrilla
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite years of congressional pleas for counterdrug
assistance to Colombia, countless hearings and intense
congressional efforts, resources approved by Congress have failed
to be provided to Colombia,'' said Mica, who chairs the oversight
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Mica and Rep. Benjamin Gilman, D-N.Y., criticized the
administration's slowness in delivering previously promised
military equipment, particularly helicopters such as Blackhawks,
needed to find and eradicate drug operations hidden in the
Colombian mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of National Drug Control Policy,
said the administration will need at least two years to transfer
equipment and properly train Colombian personnel.
</P>
<P>
   About $1 billion of the aid requested by Clinton would be used
to support counterdrug operations in the southern, coca-growing
region of Colombia. The rest would go toward reforming Colombia's
judicial and prison systems in hopes of ending widespread
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now drug traffickers are acting with absolute
impunity,'' McCaffrey said, acknowledging that the priority should
be on military operations to help the Colombian government win back
rebel-controlled regions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the administration wants to help with
economic, legal and social reforms in Colombia. ``We are supporting
all the things essential to a democratic process at the grass
roots,'' McCaffrey said
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Tierney, D-Mass., voiced the concerns of human rights
organizations, saying that the aid package ignores the failure of
Colombia to crack down on right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian paramilitary groups, which initially worked in
conjunction with the government, have been accused of involvement
in drug-trafficking as well as in atrocities against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey dismissed the concerns. ``We cannot substitute U.S.
thinking for having (Colombian) President Pastrana and the
Colombian government devise their own plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has proposed a $7.5 billion campaign to eradicate drug
production and force guerrilla groups to negotiate a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for eliminating drug crops with aerial fumigation
and infiltrating drug-processing laboratories. He also wants to
establish alternative crop programs for peasant farmers who
currently grow coca.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug campaign would be funded with the aid proposed by
Clinton, $4 billion from the Colombian government, and assistance
from the European Union and from international banks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials also emphasized that the
counterdrug effort should not focus solely on Colombia. To avoid
simply driving drug producers into other countries in the region,
officials said, aid to Bolivia and Peru should be continued, and
expanded in Brazil, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela.

 &HT;    Sanders: I would play for Bengals
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Deion Sanders says he is finished with the
National Football League's Dallas Cowboys, ``because I want to play
with a winner, with a team that has a chance to make the Super
Bowl,'' so his answer was shocking when he was asked if he would
play for the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah I would,'' he said Tuesday after his first workout
day with the Cincinnati Reds at City of Sarasota Sports Complex.
``You have to understand ... I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why the Bengals? Sanders has a proposition for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to them in a package,'' he said. ``I want to go
to them in a package of players and my agent (Eugene Parker) has a
whole squad of players who are free agents. I told him I want him
to be the first agent to give somebody a team package. We have
linemen, we have linebackers, defensive backs ... whatever you
want, we got. We can revamp your whole defense for a small fee, for
a feasible fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengals executive Mike Brown wasn't biting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is he is going to try to play for the
Cincinnati Reds,'' Brown said. ``As far as the part about the
Bengals, that's premature. I thought he is still on the roster (of
the Cowboys) so I can't say anything and I'll beg off that question
for the time-being.''

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The AFL-CIO said Tuesday it would spend more money
than ever before to help elect worker-friendly candidates to the
White House and Congress and would devote more resources to
mobilizing volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the labor federation's winter meeting,
John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, said trade unions would
focus on races in 71 swing congressional districts and on electing
Al Gore president.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the labor movement had already listed 1,600 union
officials and members to coordinate labor's political activities in
35 different states. That is four times the number of coordinators
that labor used in 1998, when unions played a pivotal role in
enabling the Democrats to pick up House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said the AFL-CIO had planned to spend $40 million
on politics this year and last, up from $35 million in the 1997-98
campaign cycle. Sweeney stressed that labor's spending would be far
less than corporate America's, adding that unions could largely
offset that disadvantage by getting tens of thousands of union
members involved as volunteers in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we are conducting the broadest and most intensive
program we have ever conducted,'' Sweeney said. ``I do know that no
matter how much money we spend, we'll be outspent by business
groups by at least 11-to-1, as we have every year.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the American Federation of Labor-Congress
of Industrial Organizations, which represents 13 million members,
is holding its winter executive council meeting in New Orleans.
Five years ago, the federation decided to stop meeting in luxury
seaside hotels in Miami, a tradition that was proving embarrassing,
in favor of holding its meetings around the nation to strengthen
labor's ties with workers in various cities. Here, in New Orleans,
labor leaders are showing support for local workers involved in
strikes at Overnite Transportation, Domino Sugar and Kaiser
Aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the success in mobilizing union members in
political campaigns, Steven Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political
director, noted that in 33 percent of the people who attended the
Iowa's Democratic caucuses last month were from union households.
He also noted that in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, 24
percent of those who voted came from union households.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal pointed to polls that showed that without union
members, Gore would have lost New Hampshire to former Sen. Bill
Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Members of nonunion households voted 50 percent for Bradley and 49
percent for Gore, while 62 percent from union households backed
Gore and 37 percent backed Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said that labor unions had endorsed the Democratic
candidate in all but one of the 71 congressional districts where
labor plans to make a major push. In that one district, the union
has endorsed Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican. Nonetheless, Rosenthal
said he expected labor to endorse a fair number of Republicans in
other races, noting that in 1998, unions endorsed 26 Republican
House candidates whom union considered friendly on their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have a pro-worker majority in the House and the
Senate,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   After having endorsed Gore at the AFL-CIO's convention last
October, union leaders are directing considerable fire at the two
major Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, denounced Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas for calling union leaders ``bosses'' and for attacking Sen.
John McCain for not being tough enough toward unions.
</P>
<P>
   With many union members caught up in the groundswell for McCain,
Sweeney said it would be unwise for union members to back the
Arizona senator because he has often taken anti-labor positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain has been anti-worker, anti-working family agenda
throughout his whole career in the United States Senate,'' Sweeney
said. ``He may have a real courageous war record in terms of his
hardship as a prisoner of war, but he has been on the wrong side on
just about every issue that was a working-family-related issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney noted that McCain backed right-to-work laws and
sometimes opposed raising the minimum wage.

 &HT;    Dell gets new chief of European operations

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the second time in seven months, Dell
Computer Corp. has replaced the head of its European operations,
transferring Senior Vice President Paul Bell to London to
jump-start disappointing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 40, replaces John Legere, who resigned suddenly Monday.
Legere was named president of Dell Europe only last July, after 12
months as senior vice president in charge of Dell's Asia-Pacific
business.
</P>
<P>
   Legere, 42, left Dell to be chief executive of Asia Global
Crossing, a joint venture with Microsoft and Softbank Corp. to
build a fiber-optic network in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move has nothing to do with my opinion of Dell or Dell's
opinion of me or of the European business,'' Legere said Tuesday in
response to questions sent my e-mail. ``I just suddenly resigned to
take up this great opportunity leading Asia Global Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new job suggests Legere left Dell for a good career
move. But PC industry analyst Roger Kay said he may have believed
it was time to go for other reasons as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably was getting a lot of heat from inside Dell,'' said
Kay, vice president of International Data Corp.'s PC research unit.
``And he wasn't having that much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's business in Europe grew 17.2 percent last year, slipping
markedly from the 60 percent rate of the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives have been troubled by slowing growth in the
world's second-largest PC market since last spring. The worries
were compounded last week when the company reported that
fourth-quarter revenue grew by only 7.1 percent in Europe over a
year earlier. That was Dell's poorest performance in Europe, and
appeared especially anemic compared to a surge of 40 percent
between the fourth quarters of 1998 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Legere, himself, was transfered to Europe to replace Jan
Gesmar-Larsen, who took a personal leave last summer. That move was
foreshadowed in April, when Chief Executive Michael Dell expressed
disappointment with the 29 percent increase in sales during a
conference call with Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But the European slide continued. Year-over-year revenue grew 24
percent in the second quarter, 22 percent in the third and 7.1
percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The European assignment _ running a $6 billion business with
10,000 employees _ is both a daunting challenge and a major
opportunity for Bell, whose record of fast growth has made him one
of Dell's rising stars.
</P>
<P>
   As senior vice president for the consumer and small business
group in the Americas, Bell has led the company's vigorous
expansion in those segments.
</P>
<P>
   With sales of $8 billion last year, the consumer and
small-business operation accounted for nearly one-third of Dell's
revenue. Most of that comes from businesses, where Dell is No. 1 in
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said fourth-quarter shipments of Inspiron notebooks and
Dimension desktop PCs increased 64 percent over the same quarter in
1998. As the senior manager over both those products and the
Americas, Bell oversaw the transfer of the company's Dimension PC
operations to a multi-million-campus in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has been the global manager of Dell's online
business, which now accounts for half Dell's sales.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his role in ramping up the consumer and small-business
that Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins emphasized Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That portion of our business in the Americas is nearly five
times its size just two and one-half years ago, when we stepped up
our pursuit of home-PC and small-business customers,'' he said in a
statement.You may contact Jerry Mahoney at

HANCOCK SAYS IT WILL CONTINUE SUPPORTING OLYMPICS

<P>
   BOSTON _ After threatening to withdraw support for the Olympic
games, John Hancock Financial Services Tuesday said it would
continue to sponsor the sporting events, giving the International
Olympic Committee a massive vote of confidence following last
year's allegations of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, which will spend $25 million over four years as a
sponsor and an additional $24 million on advertising during that
period, said the agreement with the IOC contains an ethics clause
which gives the company the right to withdraw at any time if
another scandal arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did, which is something no other sponsor of the games
has done, is insist on an ethics clause that says if the Olympic
movement conducts itself in a manner that is detrimental to our
brand, we can cancel our contract at any time,'' said David
D'Alessandro, president and chief executive elect of the financial
services firm. ``This is typical in movie star's contracts, and in
sports contracts with athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers said Tuesday that John Hancock's continued
support of the games should ensure future advertising and the
financial health of upcoming competitions because it will send a
message to other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very significant day for the Olympics in terms of
sponsorship,'' said Bob Williams of Burns Sports in Chicago.
``Getting a major company like John Hancock back into the fold
offers tremendous credibility to the IOC. It gives them a case to
point to and say, ``Look, this major advertiser and supporter has
stayed with us because of what we did to clean (our problems) up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those problems came to light last year following a bribery
scandal in which investigators found that Salt Lak City officials
had spent more than $1 million on cash gifts, scholarships and
other presents to committee members. The purpose of the gifts was
to help the city land a winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. In
all, 10 members of the IOC were expelled or forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Greysercq, a marketing professor at Harvard Business
School who specializes in the business of sports, described
Tuesday's announcement as ``a very clear signal that one of the
most vocal critics of the IOC has found a way to feel comfortable
with an ongoing relationship and the confort stems from the ethics
clause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hancock is the first, technically to renew its contract,''
said Jim Andrews, president of IEG Sponsorship Report in Chicago,
which tracks the financial sponsorship of the Olympic games. ``The
fact that it is returning suggests that it has taken a close look
at the reforms and feels there is still value for them (at the
games) despite the scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, John Hancock pulled its television advertising for
the games, and said it would pull away completely if it did not see
significant reforms. At one point, D'Alassandro reportedly ordered
the Olympic rings removed from company stationery.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the IOC has established an ethics committee, made sure
that a majority of the ethics committee members are not from the
IOC, and has developed a study commission and given it the
authority to delve into the institution to determine how it should
be financed, choose its members, and operate. The group has also
changed the way the host city for the 2006 Winter Games will be
selected.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is among 11 firms, nine of them headquartered in
the United States, that, as top sponsors, spend as much as $50
million over four years in support of the international sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
   Under most agreements with the IOC, companies are locked into
sponsorship once they sign, making it impossible to break away
during the life of the contract, even when problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock is believed to be the first major backer to
negotiate an agreement with an escape clause. Technically, its
contract was set to expire Dec. 31. It was not clear Tuesday
whether other companies would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the IOC and its sponsors provides much
needed financial backing for the games while allowing the companies
to capitalize, through advertising and other venues, on the
underlying values the Olympic Games purport to represent. Values
such as sportsmanship, team spirit, courage, pride, honor, and
respect for self and others are all associated with with the games.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, news last year that some members of the IOC had been
involved in a bribery scandal in Salt Lake City threatened the
reputation of the committee, and angered D'Alassandro and others
whose companies and products have been linked with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hancock has sponsored the USA gymnastics
competition and figure skating. Last year, it began a four-year
sponsorship of the John Hancock Champions on Ice Summer Tour, a
figure skating tour sanctioned the IOC. It has also sponsored,
among other events, a 24-city hockey tour in which the US Olympic
team was pitted against the Canadian and Russian Olympic teams as
well as college and National Hockey League teams.

IRA QUITS DISARMAMENT TALKS, IN A NEW BLOW TO PEACE IN ULSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Irish Republican Army retaliated on Tuesday night
for Britain's shutdown of the power-sharing Northern Ireland
government by ending its contact with disarmament mediators and
withdrawing newly offered proposals to abandon its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dismaying development for supporters of the peace plan
who had been looking to the new IRA arms initiative as the basis
for restoring the home rule government that was suspended on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But though the IRA's move constituted a grave setback for the
already battered peace accord, it did not appear to signal any
return to violence by the IRA. Sir Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, said security forces had no intelligence
to indicate that the clandestine army ``intends to re-engage in
acts of violence contrary to their stated cessation.''
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie
Ahern, planned an emergency meeting at 10 Downing Street on
Wednesday to try to decide how to move forward. They hope to put to
rest differences that have arisen between the two governments, both
sponsors of the peace talks, over how to deal with the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the Nobel Prize-winning head of the moderate Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party, who inspired the current peace
effort, sought to put Tuesday night's development into perspective,
saying, ``It is not a death knell for the process, but a stumbling
block.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's decision came in a statement defending its resistance
to dismantle its arms stockpile. It contended that the real
responsibility for the breakdown in the peace plan lay with Britain
and the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, who, it said, have ``no
desire to deal with the issue of arms except on their terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain justified its suspension of the two-month-old government
on Friday by citing the IRA's failure to move on weapons even after
members of Sinn Fein, its political wing, had been admitted to
their ministerial posts in the new administration.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA maintains that its cease-fire, now in its third year, is
proof enough that it is cooperating and argues that as an
undefeated army it has no obligation to surrender weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who seek a military victory in this way need to
understand that this cannot and will not happen,'' the statement
said. ``Those who have made the political process conditional on
the decommissioning of silenced IRA guns are responsible for the
current crisis in the peace process.'' Decommissioning is the word
used for disarmament in Ulster politics.
</P>
<P>
   The latest setback in the struggle to bring stability to Ulster
stemmed from a bewildering flurry of events on Friday evening when
the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, announced that the
new Belfast administration was being suspended and that London was
reimposing direct rule.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before Mandelson spoke, Gerry Adams, president of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, made a surprise announcement
of his own. He said a long-awaited ``major breakthrough'' in the
central dispute over guerrilla disarmament had occurred, and he
urged Britain to hold off the suspension order.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, head of the independent
panel charged with supervising the disarmament of paramilitary
groups, confirmed the news in a hurried report, saying the IRA had
earlier that day made moves to put their arms and explosives
``beyond use.'' He portrayed this as ``valuable progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The hasty new report replaced a far gloomier one by the general
on Jan. 31 that said the IRA had shown no willingness to discuss
disarmament. The report two weeks ago had dashed widespread
expectations that the IRA was going to make a move, and resulted in
feverish but unavailing diplomacy involving London, Dublin, Belfast
and Washington aimed at persuading the IRA to start disarming.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was the continuation of the two-month-old Northern
Ireland government created by the peace settlement under a formula
that balanced power among republicans and unionists. Republicans,
most of whom are Catholic, want to see Ulster more closely linked
with the Irish Republic while unionists, who are largely
Protestants, want to reinforce the province's British
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with no apparent movement from the IRA, Britain
rushed a suspension law through Parliament with the publicly
announced goal of acting by last Friday. The deadline was important
because the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, whom Britain
considers essential to keeping the unruly Protestant party
committed to the peace settlement, faced being ousted that night as
head of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He had had to give his party members a postdated letter of
resignation in November in exchange for their agreeing to enter
government with Sinn Fein in the absence of any disarmament. The
letter, a form of collateral, promised that he would step down if
there had been no IRA moves on weapons by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, in November, announced it had established contact with
de Chastelain's commission, a development that set up the
anticipation of news of a matching move by the IRA in the general's
report. It is that contact that came to an end, at least
temporarily, on Tuesday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pressure mounted on Sinn Fein to produce a cooperative response
from the IRA, and party leaders complained that they were being
unfairly scapegoated for the looming failure. In the past, it has
been the unionists who have been pictured as the obstructionists,
and Sinn Fein has mounted a furious campaign in recent days to
deflect any responsibility for the new breakdown from itself onto
the unionists and the British.
</P>
<P>
   Adams emerged from a talk with Mandelson on Tuesday in Belfast
which he described as a ``bad meeting,'' and he was due in London
on Wednesday. He said he had ``stretched'' his constituency to the
limit. ``As far as we are concerned, we have moved beyond our
obligations. We have been morally and politically bound to do all
of that, and this Sinn Fein leadership has now no further room to
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said he thought republicans had ``squandered'' the best
opportunity to date to settle the vexing problem of arms with their
``precipitate withdrawal'' from disarmament talks. The April 1998
peace agreement, intended to end the sectarian violence that has
cost more than 3,600 lives in three decades, specifies May 22 as
the date for total disarmament. De Chastelain's first report said
he saw no evidence the IRA could disarm by then, but his second one
on Friday night said he now did.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has assailed Mandelson for disregarding the general's
conclusion. Mandelson says he received the report too late to put
off his order and he said he also thought its language too vague a
commitment to have forestalled Trimble's forced resignation. He
said the job in the days to come would be to seek ``clarification''
of the IRA proposals, but that was before Tuesday night's
withdrawal of the secret proposals themselves.

 Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the Brazilian choreographer Deborah Colker.  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Julio Bocca, a dashing star of American Ballet
Theater, did not look himself as he rehearsed in a mid-Manhattan
studio early this month. With his toes turned in, his back arched
and his hands placed on his hips, not a trace of Albrecht or Romeo
could be discerned in his demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   While still jet-lagged from a flight from Buenos Aires and worn
from rehearsing his own company, Ballet Argentina, for its recent
performance at the World Financial Center Winter Garden, he was
trying to absorb a choreographic style as different from Petipa as
night from day.
</P>
<P>
   And he had to learn it fast, because last Tuesday he was to make
his Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical ``Fosse.'' A
compilation of 30 dance sequences, it features excerpts from
``Sweet Charity'' and ``Dancin''' by the quintessential Broadway
choreographer Bob Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   Bocca joins the show through April 2, when Keith Roberts _ a
former Ballet Theater principal who was bitten by the Broadway bug
when he danced the lead in Matthew Bourne's irreverent ``Swan
Lake'' _ comes in for the summer. ``Fosse,'' which opened in
January 1999, is now a plum for big-name male ballet dancers.
</P>
<P>
   From the sidelines, the show's dance captain, Bill Burns,
unobtrusively observed Bocca. He had scheduled five hours a day,
six days a week for two weeks to get Bocca up to par for his
several numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step means something,'' said Burns, who, along with J.
Kathleen Watkins, coaches all 35 cast members. ``It's never just
dancing for dancing's sake. I tell them some of the images Bob had
in mind. Then I let them plan their attack.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first chord of ``Bojangles,'' from ``Dancin' ,'' Bocca
tilted his head to the side, rolled his shoulders and fell into a
slow, mellow soft shoe. But there was nothing of the ordinary
hoofer about him. ``Good and loose,'' Burns said approvingly. Bocca
smiled with some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob felt that ballet dancers made his dances look classy,''
said Ann Reinking, the show's co-choreographer with Chet Walker.
``That's why we've had them in the show from the beginning. It
gives people who never go to the ballet a chance to see these
superb dancers. Plus, their star power doesn't hurt the box
office.'' In fact, ticket sales took off for Bocca's first week.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Richardson, a former principal dancer with Ballet
Theater, led the pack and won a Tony nomination for best supporting
actor last year. Scott Jovovich, a former principal with the
Joffrey Ballet and the Pittsburgh Ballet, followed Richardson and
continues in the show, and Roberts briefly preceded Bocca and
returns when he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the coming months, Damian Woetzel, a New York City
Ballet principal, also plans to don bowler hat and gyrate. To him,
it means more than dancing. ``I can't wait to sing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Bocca was invited into the show last fall by Reinking, who
starred in many Fosse productions, he asked whether she would
rehearse him alone. ``I wanted to make sure,'' he said, ``that Ann
felt comfortable with me in Fosse's work.'' She agreed to teach him
``Percussion 4,'' also from ``Dancin','' an explosive solo danced
to drums and nicknamed ``Perk 4'' by the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells the story of a man,'' said Reinking, ``going into a
studio and trying to figure out, as he watches himself in the
mirror, what he can do, what his next step should be. He's fighting
age. But as he warms up, he loses that grim feeling and starts to
have fun _ though soon his time runs out and he has to leave. In
four or five minutes you go through four or five hours in a life.
It's a tour de force.'' In a little over an hour, both Reinking and
Bocca felt he had a grip on it.
</P>
<P>
   Why do male ballet dancers so eagerly join ``Fosse''? ``There's
a bit of the grass-must-be-greener on the other side,'' said Burns.
``But they also like the ensemble work. I remember Desmond wanted
to be in every number. They love the energy. And the work doesn't
squelch personality; charisma is crucial for these parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps speaking for all of them, Jovovich said, ``It's nice to
get out from behind all those tutus.'' There's also not a little
machismo in their choice. ``Perk 4'' can ``trash the body, it's so
arduous,'' said Jovovich. ``Nothing compares to it. I think of it
as sporting event and approach it as a challenge. It's very
athletic but needs very good ballet technique. I love it and I hate
it. I never do `Perk 4' without trepidation. It's a very liberating
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts called the work ``manly'' and ``animalistic.'' He too
said he had to get pumped up to do it. In Richardson's opinion:
``Fosse loved to see the effort put into his dances. He wanted to
see the sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   At his rehearsal, Bocca was sweating, at least metaphorically.
``Right now,'' he said, ``I'm afraid if I do badly in the show, it
will reflect on my position at Ballet Theater. It's a new
beginning, but I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one. What if, once these dancers return to
their regular gigs, they can't get ``Fosse'' out of their blood?
Will Bocca confuse his winged creatures in the middle of ``Swan
Lake,'' swivel his hips, click his fingers and launch into ``Bye,
Bye Blackbird''? Could Roberts forget his gallant self in ``Romeo
and Juliet'' and slink around like the sexy dude in ``Cool Hand
Luke''? Will Woetzel break into song in Balanchine's ``Stars and
Stripes''? Oh, what has Fosse wrought?

 &HT;    Sanders to concentrate on Reds
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ The clubhouse was nearly empty late Tuesday
morning, a few nonroster pitchers, pitcher Steve Parris, coach Ken
Griffey Sr. and the legendary Stowe family _ Bernie, Rick and Mark,
the men who run the room.
</P>
<P>
   There was another person standing near a locker in the City of
Sarasota Sports Complex, spring home of the Cincinnati Reds,
searching frantically for his car keys.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and catchers aren't scheduled to report until today and
position players are expected next week, but when the dawn broke
over the palm trees Tuesday morning, ``Neon'' Deion ``Prime Time''
Sanders was there, working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got work to do, a whole lot of work to do,'' Sanders said,
pulling a blue t-shirt over his head on which was inscribed, Team
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders found Jesus three years ago, about the time he left the
Reds with a month left in the 1997 baseball season to go play
football. He hasn't played baseball since and although he knows the
odds are longer than a football field, longer than a Mark McGwire
tape-measure job, he says he is here to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a heck of a team to cover here, you guys (writers)
got to be excited,'' Sanders said, thereby emphasizing how
difficult it will be for him to crack the roster, let alone the
lineup. ``I am on a mission, I ... am ... on ... a ... mission. No,
I don't need this, but it is sort of like a chapter in your life
you want to close. I want to really go out there and play. I'm not
going to look back after this year and wonder what would've,
could've or should've been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to excel, and I mean really excel,'' Sanders added.
``It was hard the last time when you don't have everything together
in your life. I didn't last time I was here. Now I have it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the baseball bug bit him late last season when his
close friend, Lenny Harris, with whom he played in his previous
time with the Reds, invited him to a game when Harris's Colorado
Rockies played an interleague game at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left me some tickets and I told him, 'Don't make no big
fuss over me, just leave me some tickets,' so we sat way up high in
the stands, my wife and daughter,'' Sanders said. ``I sat up there
looking and thought, 'My God, this is what I used to do?' That was
the first baseball game I ever watched and the first game I had
been to in a couple of years and I thought, 'This is something
else.' I asked my wife, 'Baby, this is what I used to do?' and she
said, 'Yeah, you had those skinny little legs in those big baggy
pants.' That's when I considered coming back to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he prayed about his decision and it wasn't anything
like ``I rolled over in bed and said, 'Hey, I'm going to play
baseball again.' So much happened in Cincinnati last time and
(general manager) Jim Bowden is more than a friend and more than a
GM to me. My relationship with the guys, with Barry Larkin. It
isn't a situation where there will be jealousy and animosity. Man,
I'm too old for that stuff and that kind of drama in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Deion comes to camp with a 0-and-2 count, but he has faced many
two-strike counts. He is rehabbing a right knee after tearing the
meniscus in his last game with the Dallas Cowboys last season. And
he is rehabbing a left ankle on which a cast was removed not long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even a perfectly healthy Sanders would face steep odds because
the Reds outfield is populated by heavy-duty talent _ Ken Griffey
Jr., Dante Bichette, Dmitri Young, Michael Tucker, Alex Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   So what will it take for Sanders? The Reds do need a leadoff
hitter, the spot occupied in his two previous baseball lives with
the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a lot of work, a lot of hard work,'' he said. ``A
lot of repetitions, the type of work I've never done. That's why
I'm here so early. I have to get my whole body in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind is wonderful,'' he said. ``I have plenty of peace in
my life right now. I figure if I could hit 270 and steal almost 60
bases the last time I played when all hell was breaking loose in my
life (a difficult divorce) and I was suicidal, what I can do with
10 times the peace I have in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is more peace is his mind. His new wife, Pilar, gave
birth last week to a son and they named him Shilo(cq), ``which
means peace. And I am at peace. now. I will do well. I will exceed
all expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden loves Sanders like a son, but there won't be any fatherly
favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ankle and knee have to be healthy,'' Bowden said. ``He
needs to improve his on-base percentage and take more pitches. One
thing excites me, though. Deion is totally focused on baseball. He
has the type of makeup where you never bet against him and I love
that.''

 HECHE AND DeGENERES: AFTER THE CHAOS, A HAPPY COUPLE GET TO WORK   (af)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years after they became the most publicized, criticized,
scrutinized gay couple in Hollywood, if not the country, Ellen
DeGeneres and Anne Heche have had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Not of each other. Far from it. They are eager to declare,
despite predictions that theirs was a relationship founded on
Hollywood-style eccentricity and star madness, that they are still,
as Heche put it, ``crazy happy'' together.
</P>
<P>
   Then she quickly added, ``We probably shouldn't say that because
it will only irritate some people.''
</P>
<P>
   And that gets to the heart of what she and DeGeneres would like
to put an end to: the defensive posture in which they have found
themselves since March 1997, when they first became a couple. With
DeGeneres' public declaration _ on the cover of Time magazine, no
less _ that she is a lesbian, and her accompanying decision to have
her television character come out on her ABC sitcom, the din of
publicity reached the gong level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a different perspective on all that now,'' DeGeneres
said in a telephone interview from the home she shares with Heche
in Los Angeles. And a newfound perspective it is. As recently as
last July, when Heche and DeGeneres sat down for an interview in
their trailer on the set of ``If These Walls Could Talk 2,'' the
HBO film in which both women have had a prominent hand, they were
still anguished over the lack of enthusiasm their pairing up had
inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand more what went on,'' DeGeneres said on the phone.
``What did we think? That people would wrap their arms around us
and say, `Good for you!'?''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for their new outlook, Heche said, is that the
hostility they felt rise up around them after their highly public
declaration of love (they posed for a photo, ``nuzzling together''
in some accounts, with President Clinton at the 1997 White House
correspondents' dinner) is subsiding. ``People have had time to
adjust,'' Heche said.
</P>
<P>
   For her that has meant a sudden opening up of movie roles. For
DeGeneres it means a return to the role she has loved her entire
adult life: making people laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to just being funny,'' DeGeneres said.
``You can't be both political and funny. It's hard for people to
separate the two. The political stuff started to be more important
to me. Now I feel: enough of that.''
</P>
<P>
   For both women there is relief in returning to work after long
months of what Heche called ``enforced relaxation.'' DeGeneres is
planning a national tour with a new stand-up comedy act, which will
culminate in an HBO comedy special in July, followed quickly, she
hopes, by a return to weekly television in a new comedy series for
CBS. Heche has completed filming two movies in the last six months,
one with Sam Shepard, the other with Jeff Goldblum.
</P>
<P>
   But before the public gets a look at their rejuvenated
performing careers, it will get a chance to judge their
high-profile collaboration on what they are calling ``Walls 2,'' a
project that might be expected to thrust them back into the debate
about sexual preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If These Walls Could Talk 2'' is a sequel to the most-watched
movie HBO ever made. The original, in 1996, was a trilogy of
stories about abortion, produced by Demi Moore, Sissy Spacek and
Cher. The new version, which will be shown on March 5, is a
three-part drama about lesbians. Like the first, it was written,
produced and directed exclusively by women.
</P>
<P>
   The stories, all set in the same house, address being gay at
different moments in history. In the first story, set in the 1950s,
Vanessa Redgrave plays a retired teacher who loses the house she
had lived in with her longtime companion. The second story, with
Chloe Sevigny and Michelle Williams, is about sexual conflicts
between lesbians and feminists on campus and is set in the 1970s.
The third, which stars DeGeneres and Sharon Stone as a gay couple
planning to have a baby, has a contemporary setting.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres said she was asked early on to be an executive
producer of one of the stories, but her involvement deepened after
Heche was chosen to write and direct the third story. Heche said
she took on the assignment partly because she felt her acting
career was on hold at that point, but also because she was already
moving in that direction, having written and directed a film,
``Reaching Normal,'' starring Andie MacDowell, which played at this
year's Sundance Festival.
</P>
<P>
   What Heche wrote, however, clearly had personal resonance. ``I
really wanted to show the beauty of a relationship and enlighten
people to the normalcy and joy of our relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she intended the piece to be strictly a lesbian story.
``We wanted to make it a universal story about a loving couple
trying to have a child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But given DeGeneres' comic talent, the story Heche wrote and
directed is more lighthearted than the others in the trilogy. It
includes broad comic moments about artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different side of me,'' DeGeneres said. ``My TV
character was always a self-deprecating, very nervous, very goofy
kind of person, a grown-up but kind of like a child. I was like
Peter Pan for a while. I'm a little more grown-up in this. There's
a sexuality about me that people haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the film has a love scene with Stone that DeGeneres
admitted she was very reluctant to do. ``I fought Anne for months,
saying I wouldn't do the love scene. She was like, `It's Sharon
Stone.' I said: `I won't do the scene. I'm not getting naked. I'm
not going to kiss somebody else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Heche said, ``What other lesbian on the planet would say, `I
won't do a love scene with Sharon Stone'?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, DeGeneres was nervous. ``To me, it's a very private thing
that I don't think you show the world, and yet it was important to
show that part of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of assumptions that would be made about their own
relationship, the couple recognized that Heche could not play the
role opposite DeGeneres. ``But one reason I cast Sharon was she had
very short blonde hair,'' Heche said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres said she would play lesbian roles again as long as she
felt they were different from what she had done before. ``I have no
problem playing a lesbian in something like this because I think
it's an important thing to do, and I am a lesbian. You don't say to
Gwyneth Paltrow: `You're going to play straight again? Haven't you
done that before?'''
</P>
<P>
   The women said that for now they have decided not to try to have
a baby themselves. ``We've both been care givers at other points in
our lives,'' DeGeneres said. ``And we love babies. She'd be such a
great mom, and we think about that. But then we try to be realistic
because we love our life, and we love being spontaneous and doing
whatever we feel like doing and not having to load up the station
wagon with diapers and whatever babies need _ I'd look into it to
find out what babies need. I know diapers is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any decision about a baby would likely put them back
into what DeGeneres called ``the terrarium,'' where it seemed as
though everybody was watching them. ``I was waiting for the guy
from Mutual of Omaha to start describing our movements,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres acknowledged that she felt ``hurt and humiliated'' by
the way her show, ``Ellen,'' ended at ABC. ``It did take a while to
get that out of my system,'' she said. ``But I don't have a problem
with it anymore. My new big thing is compassion. Everybody's doing
the best they can.''
</P>
<P>
   She had expected that as she began putting together her new
stand-up act, her writing would be dominated by feelings about what
had happened in the last three years. That didn't happen. ``All
that's really coming out in the writing is normal things I think
are funny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her HBO special is likely to be called ``Born Again,'' DeGeneres
said. And Heche will be around to film a documentary about the
tour, which may also play on HBO. As for the new CBS show,
DeGeneres described it as ``a combination of the old Carol Burnett
show and the Larry Sanders show.'' It will be a sketch show, with
DeGeneres as the Burnett-like star (complete with opening chat with
a live audience) and even Tim Conway, an old Burnett regular, as a
likely supporting player. But it will also include backstage
interaction with fictional characters _ a wardrobe person, a
network executive. ``More than anything else, I'd just like to be
welcomed back,'' DeGeneres said.
</P>
<P>
   Heche said she will continue to write and direct, but her acting
career is also back in high gear. She may even dive into a series
herself, though a limited one, for HBO on a subject she said she
could not talk about yet.
</P>
<P>
   In their personal lives, the couple have come a long way in the
last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most difficult things was we fell in love and
nobody celebrated,'' Heche said then. ``You couldn't talk to
friends because everyone was like: `You did what? What's the matter
with you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, they can be more philosophical. ``We try not to wonder
anymore if we surprise people or shock people.'' DeGeneres said.
``It's hard to know what people think. I expect they're going to be
reacting to us after we're together for 30 years. They'll still be
saying: `Really? Are those two still gay?'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, whoop-de-do and rah, rah, rah! Things are so great in New
York right now! So much more excellent than before! Unless they're
not. The death, last month, of the legendary city planner Ed Logue
came as another grim reminder that New York's current triumphalist
mood is as hollow as a plastic party horn.
</P>
<P>
   For many New Yorkers, Logue's name evokes an era when the
quality of urban life was measured by something more than
skyrocketing real estate prices, the banishment of homeless people
from public sidewalks and the glitter of confetti falling from the
sky. The ideal of social equality also figured in the equation.
</P>
<P>
   Logue, born in Philadelphia in 1921, was among the last of the
master planners to practice urban renewal on an epic scale. When he
started out in the late 1950s, master planning, subsidized housing
and architectural innovation had not yet become discredited
concepts. They were the most effective tools used by older urban
centers to reconfigure themselves in the era of mass suburban
exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Urban planning is inherently imperfect. It is also a creature of
politics as well an instrument of design. Logue's failures thus
attracted more attention than his successes. Because of his work,
however, New York and other cities could continue to regard
themselves as engines of democracy. This overarching achievement
transcended the highs and lows of mid-20th-century urban renewal.
It gave our dirty towns the tattered semblance of a soul.
</P>
<P>
   It would take volumes to chronicle Logue's achievements, in a
career that took him first to New Haven, then Boston and eventually
to cities throughout New York State. Roosevelt Island, perhaps his
best-known New York project, deserves a book in itself. Or, you
could hop aboard the island's aerial tramway and write one in your
head.
</P>
<P>
   The project was conceived by Logue in 1971 when he was head of
the New York State Urban Development Corp. That agency was founded
after the death of Martin Luther King, partly to honor the slain
leader's memory: the word urban had already come to denote the
concentration of minorities in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid the creation of high-rise ghettos, Logue
envisioned Roosevelt Island as an economically and racially
integrated new town of subsidized, market-rent and co-op housing.
City planning, architecture, landscape design, historical
preservation, technological innovation: all combined to produce
Southtown, the first phase of what was originally foreseen as a
much larger community of 18,000 people. The place looked good 25
years ago and has improved with age.
</P>
<P>
   But I have a particular affection for a project that was widely
regarded as a failure, Marcus Garvey Village in the Brownsville
section of Brooklyn. Completed in 1975, Marcus Garvey is a good
illustration of Logue's efforts to fuse architecture's social and
artistic dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The group of infill row houses, distributed over seven city
blocks, was designed by Theodore Liebman, an architect on the
development agency's staff, along with Kenneth Frampton and other
members of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, a
nonprofit think tank that flourished in the 1970s under the
direction of Peter Eisenman. Working drawings were prepared by
David Todd and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton, born in England, was an advocate of ideas developed by
the British architects Peter and Alison Smithson in the early
1960s. Garvey Village adapted these ideas for American use. Instead
of the towers-in-a-park format embraced by postwar architects of
subsidized housing, Marcus Garvey employed the concept of low-rise,
medium-density housing.
</P>
<P>
   The retention of the traditional street wall and sidewalk, the
inclusion of front door stoops and the enclosed mews areas echoed
ideas advocated by Jane Jacobs in her epochal 1961 book, ``The
Death and Life of Great American Cities.'' In 1973, the design was
displayed in a show at the Museum of Modern Art called ``A New
Chance for Housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Logue and his contemporaries struggled against the winds of
changing opinion. After Jacobs's assault on conventional planning,
and with the preservation movement on the rise, planners could no
longer count on the public to be grateful for their inventions.
People were as likely to react as victims of government
high-handedness as they were to react as beneficiaries of
enlightened largesse.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, even many architects and planners had
come to doubt the value and the intentions of urban renewal. In
1971, Robert Goodman, a Boston architect, published a book called
``After the Planners.'' Describing planners as soft cops, Goodman
pummeled his profession for undertaking projects as a means to
prevent radical change and to perpetuate oppression in the cities.
He accused Logue, in particular, of removing the poor to redevelop
central city areas for a more affluent clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years after Jacobs, however, a different set of issues
must be confronted. The insights of Logue's critics, however fresh
they once were, have hardened into a set of assumptions that have
impaired New York's capacity to reckon responsibly with change. The
decentralization of authority in the planning process, for example,
began with the virtuous goal of empowering local communities to
shape their own futures.
</P>
<P>
   It has resulted in the capitulation of city planning to the
private sector and its market-driven pressures. So-called
contextual design, which began in part as a way to ward off
invasion by urban master planners, has become a camouflage that
enables the free market to conduct more tasteful invasions.
</P>
<P>
   In the present dispensation, we're supposed to applaud the
collapse of planning as a victory for freedom. No more big
government oppressors are moving in to trash old neighborhoods and
put up bleak towers to warehouse the poor, tah-dah!
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, the failures of postwar city planning are to be
gloated over. See, government can't do anything right. Look at
these awful towers with their high crime rates, busted elevators
and filthy lobbies. Of course, these conditions are due more to
lack of maintenance than to architectural design. But this is a
mere detail to be brushed aside as neighborhood gentrification
proceeds apace. And with a hard cop for mayor, who needs soft cop
planners?
</P>
<P>
   What's dropped out of the picture, of course, is the ideal of
social equality and the energy that ideal brings to modern
democracy. In the classic de Tocqueville formulation, democracy is
contingent on the tension between the competing forces of freedom
and equality. Without both, there is no tension. Without the
tension, democracy dies.
</P>
<P>
   Logue's achievement can be measured in quantitative terms. So
many units of housing built. So many created. So much concrete
poured. Architecture, however, exists on the symbolic as well as
the material plane. The physical reality and the metaphoric value
of buildings reinforce each other.
</P>
<P>
   In public works, architecture becomes part of the social
contract. Some people can be housed. Others can see that people are
being housed. From both, an entire city can derive a sense of civic
pride.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Marcus Garvey was a flop? The project nonetheless
embodied a faith in the city's talent for continuous reinvention.
Success is a relative concept. Accusations of failure can arise
from measuring new buildings against a pre-existing standard, often
nostalgic, of what constitutes success.
</P>
<P>
   But experimentation is also a measure of success. It is a
standard that gauges our willingness to venture into the unknown.
This, too, is a source of civic pride.
</P>
<P>
   Logue and his generation of planners can be faulted for
embracing too uncritically the postwar mythology of progress. But
the entire culture was trapped within that myth. It was a powerful
symbolic language, drawn on by appliance manufacturers, nuclear
scientists, the Mickey Mouse Club, progressive architecture and
modern art. Like cultural workers in other fields, Logue and his
contemporaries manipulated the symbols of their time toward the
needs of an evolving present.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, the climate of opinion has shifted to the
opposite pole, trapping the city in a theme park mythology of its
past. Market pressures have cultivated a demand for ersatz prewar
apartment buildings. The status quo is sacred. Kneel but don't
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural preservation began as an expression of liberal
conscience. It has devolved into a deeply reactionary mode of
self-deception. It masks the failure of the liberal imagination to
address the social justice side of the democratic equation. Who
cares about housing when we can rescue a landmark building, throw a
fabulous party inside it and toast our sense of public spirit?
</P>
<P>
   Logue's generation can also be critized for relying too heavily
on the analogy with disease. Routinely, they compared slums to
cancer, and saw themselves as surgeons attempting to cut out or
arrest tumors. This attitude helped to solidify the popular image
of the city as a victim, a permanent casualty of the postwar
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Due in no small part to Logue's efforts, the city might better
have defined itself as a survivor, a victor entitled to infinite
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, break it! That subversive message is struggling to
be heard today, as the city confronts the continuing pressures of
urban decentralization. Risk failure, risk criticism, risk losing
it all. Rage against inertia. Revel in imperfection. Otherwise, the
city risks losing its democratic rationale.

ALASKA CRASH INVESTIGATORS VISIT JACKSCREW MECHANISM PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Federal investigators Tuesday got their first look at
a Southern California factory that makes two parts that are
believed to have played a key role in the crash of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   Trig Aerospace in Santa Ana, Calif., is the sole supplier of a
jackscrew mechanism that moves the horizontal stabilizer wing atop
the tail of planes such as the one that crashed off the California
coast on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of Flight 261 were having problems with the MD-83's
stabilizer for at least 30 minutes before it jammed, 12 minutes
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Although Trig only bought the business last July and did not
make the parts on the Alaska jet, investigators are looking closely
at the company's manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew mechanism is used in the stabilizer of nearly
2,000 McDonnell Douglas single-aisle jets that are still in service
around the world. It is also used in the new Boeing 717 (formerly
the MD-95).
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, U.S. airlines have grounded 27 of the jets after
finding potential problems with the jackscrew mechanism. On some of
those planes, mechanics found metal shavings from a large nut that
rides up and down the jackscrew as it moves the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Similar damage was found on the jackscrew and nut that were
recovered from the Flight 261 crash site. Threads on that nut were
found to have been stripped nearly clean.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew is hard steel, but the nut is a softer alloy of
aluminum, nickel and bronze, and is designed to wear over time.
Normal wear should leave only a powder residue and not metal
shavings, according to Boeing, which now owns McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines to
inspect their planes last Friday after two Alaska jets were found
to have metal shavings in or around the jackscrew. Subsequent
inspections found six more Alaska MD-80-series jets with similar
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for those inspections was Monday, but airlines have
until Wednesday to report problem planes to the FAA. As of Tuesday
evening, the count stood at 27.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew and nut mechanism on many of those 27 planes was
removed and sent to the safety board's laboratory in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   While those parts were being examined Tuesday, crash
investigators toured Trig Aerospace. Trig began operating the
150-person factory eight months ago after buying it for $21.4
million from Derlan Industries of Toronto. Derlan had manufactured
the jackscrews and nuts since buying the factory from Peacock
Engineering in 1995 and moving the operation to Santa Ana.
Peacock's factory was in Norwalk, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock was the early supplier of the jackscrew and nut assembly
for the DC-9, predecessor of the MD-80, MD-90 and 717. Peacock
manufactured the jackscrew and nut assembly that was originally on
the Alaska plane that crashed. An Alaska spokesman said he did not
believe the parts had been replaced since the plane was delivered
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew is located inside the 40-foot long stabilizer,
which is moved up and down in flight to help keep the plane's nose
from pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer on the Alaska jet that crashed was made at a
McDonnell Douglas facility in Tulsa, Okla., the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer learned.
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue of U.S. News and World Report said the
stabilizer was made in China. That country did supply stabilizers
to McDonnell Douglas beginning in the early 1990s, but it did did
not manufacturer the one on the accident plane.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Under withering attack from Gov. George W. Bush
and his conservative allies, Sen. John McCain and his insurgent
campaign fought hard Tuesday to build public resentment against the
assault and try to turn it into a boomerang against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain soared high and lofty above the fray, telling crowds that
he was ``trying to reform the Republican Party'' and that he was
now ``running nothing but a positive campaign.'' In a sign of just
how broadly he was casting his net for votes, he held one of his
campaign events in a tent outside a synagogue here Tuesday in a
state where Republicans usually fight for Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you at the end of this campaign, I want people all over
America at the end of this campaign, I want my children at the end
of this campaign, to look on this campaign as one that was
honorable,'' McCain told the enthusiastic noonday crowd at the Beth
Shalom Synagogue in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his campaign sent an array of surrogates to
radio and television talk shows to try to mobilize independents and
moderates with the theme that voters should rebel against attack
politics by turning out in droves for McCain in the primary
Saturday. And the McCain camp began broadcasting three new radio
spots, all of them in one way or another seeking to stoke rebellion
against negative advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   One began with an announcer saying: ``Listen to the People of
South Carolina.'' Then a man says ``I think the American people and
especially the people of South Carolina are sick and tired of
negative campaigns.'' Another woman chimes in, ``Yeah, I feel like
when I see a negative ad, that they are skirting what the real
issues are.'' And soon more and more voices speak out against
negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated references to South Carolina were deliberate _ part
of a broader effort by the campaign to tell South Carolina voters
that outside groups base in Washington were meddling in their
primary.
</P>
<P>
   On the local NBC affiliate Tuesday night McCain broadcast a
30-minute biographical commercial, which includes riveting scenes
of him being held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing McCain either behind Bush or running neck and
neck, the senator enters the last days before the crucial South
Carolina primary with a serious tactical disadvantage. Not only
does Bush have more money, he is free to pour unlimited funds into
the state because of his decision not to accept federal matching
funds. And his own campaign efforts are being supplemented by
mailings, phone banks and radio ads by an array of conservative
groups bitterly opposed to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign by contrast has to abide by the federal
spending cap and is near the $3 million spending limit in South
Carolina. So it is attempting something unconventional in politics
_ not battling negative with negative. Aides said the senator had
no second thoughts about his decision last week to pull a sharply
negative ad against Bush off the air.
</P>
<P>
   One senior adviser to McCain said of the assaults, which are
designed to raise doubts about the senator's conservative
credentials, ``the sheer volume of it makes it almost impossible to
try to fend off. So your only hope is to try to use that negative
weight against them as you would in jujitsu or karate. We'll see if
that works.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Polls have shown Bush doing better with traditional Republicans
and McCain ahead with independents who are free to vote in the
South Carolina primary just as they could in New Hampshire. So the
results Saturday could well hinge on which side is better able to
turn out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is making a heavy push for conservatives in his ads and
telephone banking including using calls by Rep. Henry J. Hyde,
R-Ill., known for his anti-abortion stand, who praises Bush's
``strong pro-life record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ads by the Bush campaign or outside groups are being featured
heavily on radio stations around the state that feature popular
conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh. Afternoon listeners
to WBOC-AM in Columbia or WORD in Greenville can now typically hear
20 minutes of Limbaugh assailing McCain as the darling of liberal
Democrats, followed by ads from the South Carolina Coalition for
Life that criticize McCain's abortion voting record and from Bush
criticizing McCain's stand on the campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, McCain's aides were handing out fliers at his rallies
seeking volunteers for what they called ``Operation Call-In'' _ an
effort to call radio talk shows all over the state on behalf of
McCain. ``This week it is absolutely critical that all supporters
of John McCain phone in to the various radio talk shows that air
during the day throughout South Carolina,'' the pamphlets said.
``If McCain supporters do not call in Bush supporters will control
the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sheets gave a list of suggested reasons for callers to say
why they like McCain, including his character, his preparedness to
lead, his ``perfect 17 year pro-life voting record,'' his positions
on Social Security and against special interests and his votes to
convict President Clinton on two impeachment articles before the
Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   They ended _ with some of the instructions emphasized in
capitals _ ``NO matter what KEEP THE MESSAGE POSITIVE and about
McCain. NO bashing Bush or Keyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain forces were hoping the tone of the campaign could
drive up Bush's own negatives. ``It can have an opposite and equal
reaction,'' said Davis. ``It's physics.'' McCain's aides aid that
undecided women, independent women and ``casual Republicans'' not
locked to their party's ideology are all driven away by negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain and his supporters were going out of their way
to highlight anything negative that they learned of. In an
appearance on the Today Show filmed from his bus, McCain himself
brought up what he called the ``ludicrous situation'' of a
professor at Bob Jones University who had sent out e-mails saying
the senator ``chose to sire children without marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign has taken some very interesting turns,'' McCain
said, ``but we're not bothered by that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the professor, Richard Hand, was told on CNN''s ``Inside
Politics'' on Monday that there was no evidence of McCain having
illegitimate children, Hand said, ``That's a universal negative.
Can you prove that?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would probably vote for Bush but that his e-mails had
not been coordinated with the Bush campaign or the university,
which is a center of conservative Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, though, Hand said he was only trying to
give his feelings to a small circle of friends but acknowledged
that he had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., supporting McCain, retold the
story Tuesday as he introduced McCain at the synagogue and his tale
drew gasps and a murmur of shock from the crowd. ``Ladies and
gentlemen,'' he said, ``South Carolina and this country need to get
behind somebody that rejects that way of doing business.''

A DIFFERENT VOICE ASSAILS McCAIN 
 (See also MCCAIN, MCCAIN-DEMS) 
(nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the news media are accused in some conservative quarters of
muting criticism of Sen. John McCain, there is at least one
publication that is all but shouting its hostility toward him:
World magazine, a little-known, North Carolina-based newsweekly for
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Like other news magazines, the periodical, which claims a
subscription-based circulation of 109,000, has recognized McCain's
newsworthiness, putting him on the cover of its Feb. 19 issue. What
is different is the tone. In a scathing article and sidebar, World
attacks the candidate and the media that it says adore him.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which began a campaign recently to raise its
profile by being distributed to journalists in Washington, has some
notable connections. The cover article on McCain was written by Bob
Jones IV, scion of the family that founded the fundamentalist
Christian college in South Carolina, Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   And its editor, Marvin Olasky, has served as an informal adviser
to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign and was one of the
inspirations for Bush's credo of compassionate conservatism. The
two men met in the mid-1990s, news reports say, after Bush had a
spiritual awakening, and Olasky became a confidant of the Texas
governor on faith-based issues.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky, himself an evangelical Christian and journalism
professor at the University of Texas, said Tuesday that because ``I
have done some informal advising to Governor Bush, I have recused
myself from our political reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his role in the campaign last year was to help ``develop
a position explaining what compassionate conservatism is.'' That
culminated, Olasky said, in a speech Bush delivered in Indianapolis
in July in which he detailed his view that the federal government
should provide money and tax incentives to churches and
neighborhood groups to aid the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, I have been teaching at the University of Texas,''
he said. ``I haven't been involved in the campaign.'' He added that
he had not seen the McCain article before it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, written more in the style of an editorial than a news
article, directs its message to a conservative audience. ``One look
at Mr. McCain's policies,'' Jones writes, ``reveals why so many
conservatives find him unacceptable.'' The article says that on tax
cuts, for instance, the Arizona senator ``makes his case with
liberal, even Marxist, terminology, complaining about the `class
warfare' waged by the `haves' against the `have-nots.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the conservative
Media Research Center in Alexandria, Va., and the author of the
sidebar to Jones' piece that chronicles the ``media lovefest'' with
McCain, said in an interview that it has been left to a publication
like World to provide the adversarial journalism that the
mainstream press corps is not offering.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain aides said that articles such as those in World are
less a reflection of any ideological differences with groups like
the religious right than of the Republican establishment's fear of
what his candidacy represents.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, a campaign spokesman, said McCain has no fight
with World's readers. ``The truth is John McCain has a strong
pro-family, pro-life voting record,'' he said.

THE NEW BOHEMIANS: TOURISTS WITHOUT A CAUSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being a young American pursuing ``la vie de boheme'' isn't what
it used to be. After the image of the bohemian merged with that of
the hippie, and a once-marginal drug culture invaded American high
schools, the cliches of the urban hipster and the avant-garde were
swallowed by the ``cutting edge'' marketing of MTV and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the archetype of the bohemian rebel hasn't entirely
vanished. It has simply been reconfigured as a sporty backpacker
combing the globe in search of adventure, a purer environment and
better drugs. It's an archetype ready-made for Hollywood,
especially when it's embodied by everybody's favorite young rebel,
Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Beach,'' Danny Boyle's film adaptation of Alex
Garland's popular novel, DiCaprio is Richard, a pleasure-seeking
backpacker who finds himself alone and itching for adventure in
swinging Bangkok. Richard's vague search for heaven on earth (with
some requisite danger thrown in) leads him to a secret commune on a
remote coastal island that can be reached only by swimming to its
shores.
</P>
<P>
   At first, paradise appears to be everything he has been looking
for. Against a backdrop of perfect sunsets and moonrises, its
international brigade of post-hippie sybarites (so preposterously
well-tended that they resemble the cast of ``Baywatch'' on a Club
Med holiday) while away their days in peppy beachside games of
soccer and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Utopia only begins to pall after a tragedy reveals Richard's
fellow exiles to be a bunch of selfish party animals willing to
sacrifice lives to keep their pristine enclave a secret.
</P>
<P>
   That the restless backpacker has replaced the beatnik and the
hippie as Hollywood's bohemian du jour is a sign of the times. And
so is the fact that the commune Richard joins is as picturesque,
spiritually vapid and camera-friendly as the pretty people who live
there.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's the rare starving artist, poet or sidewalk
philosopher who possesses movie-star looks. That may be why
Hollywood has had such a spotty record when it comes to portraying
bohemian culture. One notable exception is Warren Beatty's
``Reds,'' which offered an unusually thoughtful portrait of
Greenwich Village in the World War I era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy Rider'' captured the giddy spirit of late-'60s hippie
culture. More recently, such independent films as ``High Art,'' ``I
Shot Andy Warhol'' and ``Basquiat'' have given us reasonable
facsimiles of some of the New York art world's tonier precincts in
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But in general the restless young tourist in exotic climes is
far more amenable to Hollywood-style fantasy than the lives of
painters, writers or political dreamers whose aesthetics and ideas
require explanation and analysis. One reason ``The Beach'' is the
third Hollywood movie in as many years to portray arrogant young
Americans who land in trouble while searching for kicks and cheap
lodging in Southeast Asia is that no ponderous theorizing is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Return to Paradise'' (1998), naive American tourists run
afoul of the stringent Malaysian drug laws and pay dearly for it.
And in ``Brokedown Palace'' (1999), two young women visiting
Thailand are unwittingly turned into drug couriers, arrested and
thrown in prison. Both movies are cautionary tales about the limits
of America's influence abroad when it comes to helping its
law-breaking citizens.
</P>
<P>
   As a cautionary fable, ``The Beach'' is more grandiose. As
lovely as paradise may be, it warns, it can only be as lovely as
the people living there. Most of the commune's denizens turn out to
be moral and intellectual ciphers. Nary a word is uttered about
art, politics or human values, and no one seems to have more than a
cursory interest in Asian culture.
</P>
<P>
   The commune's duplicitous sexual mores aren't any different from
those of suburbia. Although an endless supply of marijuana is
available from a nearby field, the movie is too strait-laced to
show its islanders getting seriously stoned.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can be said of them is that they're sensitive
enough to have sought to escape the honky-tonk frat-party
atmosphere on the mainland. But in their devotion to pleasure,
these hedonists finally aren't much different from the boors they
left behind. It's dispiriting to think that these shrewd young
tourists might represent the last gasp of hip. But in an age when
any couch potato who watches MTV can acquire a gloss of ersatz
hipness, exotic travel stickers have superseded psychedelic posters
as cutting-edge merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   And who better to represent this watered-down bohemian ideal
than DiCaprio, Hollywood's resident Peter Pan? DiCaprio's character
may exhibit little of the exuberant curiosity of the early Beats or
the idealism of the hippies. But the actor's record of portraying
genuine bohemian rebels lends whatever he does a certain cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Already he has impersonated that ultimate teen-age artistic
revolutionary and runaway, the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, in
``Total Eclipse,'' and Rimbaud's callow latter-day American
descendant, the New York poet Jim Carroll (as a teen-age junkie) in
``The Basketball Diaries.'' In ``Titanic,'' of course, he also
played an aspiring artist.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio's screen persona in all these movies is a variation of
the same character: an unformed, slightly androgynous, volatile
youth who looks and acts more like 15 than 25 ( DiCaprio's actual
age).
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Beach,'' Richard does go through some heavy changes.
Exiled from the commune, he reverts to ``Lord of the Flies''-like
savagery in an MTV-ready sequence in which he confuses reality with
his pocket Game Boy. But as personified by DiCaprio, the new
bohemian isn't an artist, a dreamer or even an eccentric. He's a
perpetual adolescent, a bratty airhead on the road doing whatever
it takes to stave off boredom.

 &HT;    Mood calm at Coke as 500 let go
 &HT;    By Henry Unger and Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a day that started with prayers among the rank and
file, Coca-Cola told about 500 full-time employees Tuesday that
their jobs have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   About 420 of those jobs were cut at the soft drink company's
headquarters on North Avenue, with the remainder eliminated in
other parts of metro Atlanta and North America.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second round of cuts since Coca-Cola stunned Wall
Street and its employees three weeks ago when it announced that it
will be eliminating 6,000 jobs worldwide, including 2,500 in
Atlanta, as part of a major reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has eliminated a total of 1,500 jobs in
North America, most of them in Atlanta. The cuts, from throughout
the company, have been made through layoffs, outsourcing, not
filling vacant positions and eliminating contract employees. In
North America, so far, the company has cut 273 contract employees,
primarily in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And the downsizing will continue. About 1,000 additional jobs
will eliminated in Atlanta in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For employees, Tuesday twisted with a brutal rush of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Some managers called in workers one by one or gave them
scheduled times to hear privately about their fate.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative assistant spent the last three weeks fearing
she would lose her job. Her manager called her into the office
Tuesday morning. This would be it, she knew. Instead, the manager
said she was not being cut. The employee cried.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a colleague with many years of experience was let go.
The colleague walked around as though in shock.
</P>
<P>
   A contractor who has worked at Coke for more than two years
learned that, at least for the moment, she can keep her job, though
hundreds of other contractors have lost theirs in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   She did see some people walking out with boxes, apparently after
cleaning out their desks. She and others said the vast headquarters
of the world's largest soft drink company seemed far quieter than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Some people whose jobs were spared on Tuesday fear they may be
cut by Coke in the coming weeks and months. Some have heard that
their jobs will be changed and their work groups restructured, but
they have yet to hear particulars about what their employer is
planning for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is waiting and wondering what's the next step,'' the
contractor said. ``We really don't know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   One laid off marketing manager described the mood as
surprisingly an, with some employees in shock and others expecting
the hit.
</P>
<P>
   The manager said he was called into a meeting with his bosses
Tuesday morning and told that this was the ``hardest thing they had
to do and that they really regretted that they had to let me go.''
The employee said he would get five months' severance pay, and if
he can't find a job in five months in Atlanta, he'd ``have a
problem. But I think it will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his boss asked him to stay a few days to help out.
The employee has agreed to do so to complete several projects. Lisa
Calhoun, an accountant who has worked eight years at Coke, believes
prayer changes things, and she tried to help others make it through
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Calhoun e-mailed about 20 friends and invited
them to a prayer meeting Tuesday morning in a courtyard on the
company campus near Georgia Tech. Word spread rapidly. By the 8:30
a.m. start, the meeting had been moved into the company's Goizueta
Auditorium. More than 200 employees attended.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, a member of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in
Decatur who sometimes preaches to prison groups, asked her fellow
workers to pray for outgoing Coke Chairman and CEO M. Douglas
Ivester, as well as his replacement, Doug Daft, and incoming
President Jack Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   She told Coke employees to take strength and to seek balance in
their work and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let people know their faith should be in God, not
in a job or a company,'' Calhoun said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``All companies, from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to
Coca-Cola to BellSouth, are in business to make money,'' she said.
``If our faith is in the right place we won't get upset if they
make the decisions they need to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who believes her job is safe, said colleagues have been
concerned about the future of their careers, but not panicky. A
friend was among those out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   While Calhoun believes Coke has made the cuts as painless as
possible, others disagree, pointing out that weeks of anxiety are
still not over for those who may lose their jobs later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing, announced less than two months after Daft became
president and chief operating officer, is part of a major
restructuring by the company to decentralize operations, reduce
costs and eliminate some duplication of work performed by its
bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the job reductions are expected to save the
company about $300 million a year.

Tuesday morning and told that this was the ``hardest thing they had
to do and that they really regretted that they had to let me go.''
The employee said he would get five months' severance pay, and if
he can't find a job in five months in Atlanta, he'd ``have a
problem. But I think it will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his boss asked him to stay a few days to help out.
The employee has agreed to do so to complete several projects. Lisa
Calhoun, an accountant who has worked eight years at Coke, believes
prayer changes things, and she tried to help others make it through
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Calhoun e-mailed about 20 friends and invited
them to a prayer meeting Tuesday morning in a courtyard on the
company campus near Georgia Tech. Word spread rapidly. By the 8:30
a.m. start, the meeting had been moved into the company's Goizueta
Auditorium. More than 200 employees attended.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, a member of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in
Decatur who sometimes preaches to prison groups, asked her fellow
workers to pray for outgoing Coke Chairman and CEO M. Douglas
Ivester, as well as his replacement, Doug Daft, and incoming
President Jack Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   She told Coke employees to take strength and to seek balance in
their work and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let people know their faith should be in God, not
in a job or a company,'' Calhoun said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``All companies, from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to
Coca-Cola to BellSouth, are in business to make money,'' she said.
``If our faith is in the right place we won't get upset if they
make the decisions they need to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who believes her job is safe, said colleagues have been
concerned about the future of their careers, but not panicky. A
friend was among those out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   While Calhoun believes Coke has made the cuts as painless as
possible, others disagree, pointing out that weeks of anxiety are
still not over for those who may lose their jobs later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing, announced less than two months after Daft became
president and chief operating officer, is part of a major
restructuring by the company to decentralize operations, reduce
costs and eliminate some duplication of work performed by its
bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the job reductions are expected to save the
company about $300 million a year.

A NEWER, LONELIER CROWD EMERGES IN INTERNET STUDY

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The nation's obsession with the Internet is
causing many Americans to spend less time with friends and family,
less time shopping in stores and more time working at home after
hours, according to one of the first large-scale surveys of the
societal impact of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``the more hours people use the Internet, the less
time they spend with real human beings,'' said Norman Nie, a
political scientist at Stanford University who was the principal
investigator for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Nie asserted that the Internet was creating a broad new wave of
social isolation in the United States, raising the specter of an
atomized world without human contact or emotion.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion is certain to prove controversial because of the
contention among some online enthusiasts that the Internet has
fostered alternative electronic relationships that may replace or
even enhance face-to-face family and social connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a zero-sum game,'' said Howard Rheingold, author
of ``Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier.''
``People's social networks do not consist only of people they see
face to face. In fact, social networks have been extending because
of artificial media since the printing press and the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford survey, which was conducted by the university's
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society and will be
published Wednesday, appears to offer an Internet-era parallel to
some of the findings of ``The Lonely Crowd,'' a landmark
sociological analysis of American society in 1950. The book,
written by David Riesman with Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney,
described the changing American character and chronicled the shift
away from family and community-centered life and the ascendance of
mass media.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford study, in turn, details how the Internet is leading
to a rapid shift away from mass media. The study reported that 60
percent of regular Internet users said they had reduced their
television viewing, and one-third said they spent less time reading
newspapers.

BUSH SUPPORTERS CONCERNED ABOUT DRAIN ON CAMPAIGN TREASURY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The campaign of Gov. George W. Bush is spending
close to $3 million a week, a rate that alarms his top fund-raisers
and has forced Bush finance officials to schedule a number of
unplanned money-raising events in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's spending spree in the early primaries, which has
intensified with an advertising blitz in South Carolina this week,
has left roughly $20 million in Bush's campaign treasury, according
to a senior campaign strategist who is a top member of the Bush
finance team.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign raised an unprecedented $68 million in 1999, but
spent $37 million before the first vote was cast in Iowa last
month. Bush spent an additional $15 million in January and early
February, when his fund raising slowed after his defeat by Sen.
John McCain in New Hampshire, according to estimates from several
individuals who are raising money for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Bush campaign insisted that he was continuing
to attract thousands of donations and would have sufficient
resources to compete in all the coming primaries. But they refused
to provide any spending figures and declined to comment on the $20
million cash-on-hand estimate. Those numbers will be disclosed in a
financial report for the month of January to be filed with the
Federal Election Commission early next week, campaign officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be any help on this,'' said Ari Fleischer,
a Bush campaign spokesman. ``There is a lot of guessing going on
about our cash on hand but we are not going to provide any
information that would be helpful to other campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The worry among Bush supporters over possible financial
shortfalls is a remarkable reversal of fortune. As recently as
early January, political observers were marveling at the
unprecedented sums being raised by the governor's campaign. Now
many of those same observers are amazed at how quickly Bush is
depleting his treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Among the drains on Bush's campaign bank account is the media
saturation of South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary on
Saturday. Bush is spending an estimated $3.5 million to buy
television advertising in South Carolina, including three half-hour
broadcasts scheduled to air Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Bush campaign is spending hundreds of thousands
of dollars in South Carolina on phone banks, staff, travel, mass
mailings and other campaign operations. Bush is not accepting
federal matching funds and does not have to comply with the
spending restrictions that accompany public money. His chief rival,
McCain, is bound by the federal spending limit of about $3 million
for South Carolina and McCain aides said he would comply.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of Bush's early contributors have already given him
the maximum $1,000 contribution permitted by federal election law,
his campaign is under pressure to find new donors. The Bush
operation is stepping up its direct-mail appeals and has scheduled
money-raising events in Virginia, Florida and New York later this
month after announcing late last year that it was winding down most
of its fund-raising efforts during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, capitalizing on his big win in New Hampshire on Feb. 1,
has received a bonanza of small donations from the Internet, some
$4 million so far, including $2.5 million since the New Hampshire
primary. The Bush campaign has raised less than $500,000 online.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Republican who has raised money for Bush said that
campaign officials are concerned about the rate of spending and
some of the members of his finance team are ``beginning to grouse
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser, who insisted that his name not be used, said
that many Bush supporters are appalled that he has spent nearly $50
million to win the Iowa caucuses and the Delaware primary _ which
were not contested by McCain _ while getting trounced by his rival
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Bush and McCain are running even in South
Carolina and in Michigan, which votes next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of people shaking their heads saying `Gee whiz,
how is it possible? How can you spend that much and be in the
situation that you are in?'' the fund-raiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bush fund-raiser, who also demanded anonymity, noted
that it costs money to raise money and blamed the media for
showering McCain with buckets of favorable free coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look at why Bush has spent so much,'' said this Bush
supporter. ``They have had to deal with a campaign that has been
the beneficiary of the best media swoon since Gutenberg. Nobody has
seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unanticipated competition from McCain has forced Bush and
his advisers to contemplate a primary election outcome almost no
one imagined even three weeks ago. The Bush camp still believes
their candidate will win the nomination, but he may well emerge
from the March primaries battered and near broke.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore is growing more confident that
he can dispatch his sole challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, by
early March. And even though his campaign bank account will then be
empty, he will be able to fall back on the millions of dollars the
Democratic National Committee is raising in events headlined by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a presumptive Republican nominee emerges, he, too,
could be the beneficiary of Republican Party soft money, the
unrestricted donations that flow to the political parties. Like the
Democratic National Committee, the Republican National Committee
has mounted an aggressive drive to raise soft money this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the surge of support for McCain has unsettled some Gore
supporters, who had expected a general election campaign against
Bush and are now considering the possibility of running against
McCain, who has demonstrated appeal to Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he would instruct his party not to spend soft
money on his behalf and he has introduced legislation to ban soft
money. Bush has proposed eliminating certain kinds of soft money
contributions. The vice president has said his campaign would
eschew soft money if his Republican opponent agreed to a similar
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign would not release details of its spending in
January that would delineate where and how it has spent $15 million
since the first of the year. But in year-end filing the outlines of
the campaign's spending are apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single expenditure _ roughly a third of the total _
has gone for media advertising, chiefly television and radio. The
next biggest category is voter research, which includes polling,
campaign literature and get-out-the-vote efforts. General overhead
_ staff, telephones, computers _ consumes 17 percent of the
campaign's spending. Fund-raising costs account for 15 percent of
expenditures and the campaign spends 10 percent of its money on
travel.

AIR CANADA THE WINNER IN TAKEOVER BRAWL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It took a distracting three-month takeover brawl for
Air Canada to emerge as the winning buyer of Canadian Airlines,
shrinking the nation's major air carriers from two to one. That may
have been the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months since Air Canada won control of the nation's
air space, it has grappled with making good on a promise to improve
air service, generate higher returns for shareholders, eliminate
thousands of overlapping jobs and reduce billions of dollars in
debt _ much of it owed by the financially ailing airline it had
struggled to buy in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Air Canada raised the possibility of putting
its erstwhile rival into bankruptcy protection if creditors were
not willing to negotiate more flexible payment terms.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Air Canada is that it has emerged as Canada's
only major airline just has it has completed a profitable year.
</P>
<P>
   It earned $213 million Canadian, or $146 million U.S. after
losing $16 million Canadian, or $11 million U.S., in 1998. Its
operating profit margin of 7.7 percent, said president and chief
executive Robert Milton, ``is the best in 27 years and in line with
the world's best performing carriers.'' His objective, he said, is
to achieve a margin of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps Milton has taken to achieve that is to
start eliminating some of the overlapping cross-country flights of
the two airlines _ mainly those that link the big eastern cities of
Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, and the big western cities of
Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. Almost one-fifth of current
domestic flights provide matching service.
</P>
<P>
   This does not necessarily mean air travelers in Canada will have
fewer choices, however. The reduction in service is expected to
open niches for an ambitious regional carrier, WestJet Airlines of
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Air Canada estimate that streamlined routes and
other efficiencies will yield savings between $650 million
(Canadian) and $800 million (Canadian) a year. At least 2,500 jobs
will be cut, but all departures are expected to be voluntary. Air
Canada, based in Montreal, has 24,000 employees, compared with
15,000 at Canadian Airlines, which is based in Calgary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Air Canada won control of Canada's airspace in November after a
three-month fight with Onex Corp., a Toronto holding company that
had tried to buy the two airlines and merge them. Onex withdrew
because a court upheld a law that prevents anyone from owning more
than 10 percent of Air Canada's shares. That opened the way for Air
Canada to buy Canadian Airlines for about $92 million Canadian or
about $63 million U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult challenge facing Air Canada may be
renegotiating Canadian Airlines $3.5 billion (Canadian) debt. Its
creditors were warned in October, when Air Canada was in the midst
of trying to buy Canadian Airlines, that concessions would be
sought. Earlier this month, Canadian Airlines suspended payments of
$135 million (Canadian) to lenders and lessors of aircraft to
conserve cash during the weak winter season.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada, which has annual revenue of $6.5 billion (Canadian),
has $6.7 billion (Canadian) of debt on its books. But Canadian
Airlines, with less than half as much revenue, is even more heavily
mortgaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian is paying far above what Air Canada is paying for
identical assets,'' Milton said when Canadian Airlines suspended
its debt payments. He said Canadian Airlines will be put under
bankruptcy protection ``if the creditors don't want to play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Airlines' fleet of 79 aircraft is older than Air
Canada's fleet of 155, and industry analysts said lessors of older
or unwanted planes will have to accept payments as low as half the
current rate or take back their assets. They think some unsecured
creditors may get only 60 cents on the dollar.

<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ To worried parents, they can look like pack
mules on two legs _ students who are not only carrying a load on
their minds but also a load on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Take Molly Alexander. Her school district in this affluent patch
of suburban Westchester County gives her an extra set of textbooks
to keep at home. Still, Molly, a seventh grader who weighs 74
pounds, slumps under a bag that weighs in at 15 pounds. Hers is one
of the lighter loads that many children her age carry.
</P>
<P>
   What is filling Molly's backpack? A French looseleaf binder, a
French workbook, a science binder, an English binder, a social
studies binder, a math binder, a planning agenda, an English
workbook, hardcover copies of Jack London's ``Call of the Wild''
and ``White Fang,'' a hole puncher, a dictionary and a thesaurus
(both paperbacks), index cards, a hat, a scarf, pencils and pens,
lip gloss and a scrunchie.
</P>
<P>
   School backpacks, parents and educators complain, are getting
heavier, bulging with textbooks and looseleaf binders, and
sometimes musical instruments, laptops and lunch bags. By middle
school, when they are most popular, they often weigh more than a
quarter of what the children who carry them weigh.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, orthopedists warn, children are increasingly at
risk for back pain, muscular strain and hunched posture. A recent
study by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons said that 58
percent of orthopedists reported seeing children complaining of
back and shoulder pain caused by heavy backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   It is causing parents _ both urban and suburban _ to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My older daughter actually had to have physical therapy for
back pain, and I think it's clearly related to the weight of the
backpack,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Baker, a psychotherapist whose two
daughters attend the Brearley School in Manhattan. ``Both my girls
have to travel 50 minutes on public transportation to get to
school, and that means they are spending a lot of time walking
around with 20-pound backpacks pulling on their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Bergman of Ardsley, N.Y., whose daughter Betsie weighs
90 pounds and carries a 23-pound backpack, said, ``I know that
backpack is way too heavy for my daughter's little bones. As a
parent, you see your kid dragging out of school and saying, `Oh my
back hurts, my backpack is so heavy.' And you agree, yes it is, but
if you need that French textbook what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Many children maintain that everything in their bags is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Alexander admitted that in her 15-pound backpack, the
dictionary and thesaurus were probably not necessary and that she
had finished both Jack London novels. Other than those items, she
said, ``I need the whole thing.'' School administrators say they
repeatedly remind children that they need not carry all that they
do. The administrators say the problem is one of the quirks of
being an adolescent _ middle school children would usually rather
spend time between classes to socialize than streamline their book
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Some wealthy suburban districts have even bought two sets of
textbooks for students _ one for the classroom and another for
home. It is not as expensive as it may seem, said Dr. Ken Mitchell,
principal at Robert E. Bell Middle School in Chappaqua, because it
saves wear and tear on the textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Schools also try to help students organize their time and
belongings. Some teachers require, for example, softcover binders
and workbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents call, I will tell them, `Take your child and your
child's backpack into the middle of the living room and empty the
whole thing out and then put the backpack on a diet,''' said
Michael McDermott, principal at Scarsdale Middle School. ``For
kids, it's really an organizational issue. Their whole world is in
their backpack, because they're afraid they are going to forget
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Children shrug off some proposed solutions. Molly Alexander's
twin sister, Jackie, said she has no time to visit her locker to
lighten her load.
</P>
<P>
   ``My locker is on the first floor, where I only have one
class,'' Jackie said. ``It's nowhere near the rest of my classes.''
</P>
<P>
   But her principal said time constraints are not the problem.
``They do have time, they just don't avail themselves of it,''
Mitchell said. ``They'd rather substitute that time for social
reasons, and that's seventh graders. Seventh graders tend to have
the greatest backpack load, because they are compulsive about
having everything and they are going through so many social,
emotional and physical changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle school children, it seems, do not want adults to help
them get organized, because they view their knapsacks as their own
private territories that they want to protect. ``The backpack, in a
sense, is a mobile locker,'' said Pam Jones, a product manager at
L.L. Bean. ``It's a secure, contained place for kids' stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the price that children pay for that security may be high.
The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends that a
backpack not exceed 20 percent of a child's body weight.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Iris Schlesinger, a pediatric orthopedist at the Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla, said more and more children are
complaining of pain related to backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write a note to the school that they are not going to be
carrying anything more than one notebook for two weeks until the
back pain subsides,'' Schlesinger said. ``If the pain does subside
after two weeks of not carrying everything they own, then you know
what the problem is and you don't have to do a million dollar
work-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Most parents of middle school students do not remember carrying
such heavy backpacks themselves. Until about 25 years ago, students
tended to carry their books in their arms _ sometimes held together
with a rubber book strap. Some students carried briefcases or
satchels. School notes were carried in a single binder separated by
dividers; now, many teachers require separate binders for each
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Book bags were never designed to carry such heavy loads,
manufacturers say. Several companies are now reinforcing them with
metal stays along the back, extra cushioning in the shoulders and
waist belts.
</P>
<P>
   Also becoming more popular are backpacks on wheels, which
children can pull as though they are rolling suitcases through an
airport. They are difficult on curbs and stairs and can create
congestion and hazards in crowded hallways. And worse, according to
the middle school set, they are not cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are worried about what they look like with the
wheelie,'' said Emily Robbins, 13, an eighth grader at Ardsley
Middle School. ``But I don't care. If my backpack keeps getting
heavier in high school, I might switch to one.''

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The AFL-CIO said Tuesday it would spend more money
than ever before to help elect worker-friendly candidates to the
White House and Congress and would devote more resources to
mobilizing volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the labor federation's winter meeting,
John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, said trade unions would
focus on races in 71 swing congressional districts and on electing
Al Gore president.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the labor movement had listed 1,600 union officials
and members to coordinate labor's political activities in 35
different states. That is four times the number of coordinators
that labor used in 1998, when unions played a pivotal role in
enabling the Democrats to pick up House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said the AFL-CIO had planned to spend $40 million
on politics this year and last, up from $35 million in the 1997-98
campaign cycle. Sweeney stressed that labor's spending would be far
less than corporate America's, adding that unions could largely
offset that disadvantage by getting tens of thousands of union
members involved as volunteers in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we are conducting the broadest and most intensive
program we have ever conducted,'' Sweeney said. ``I do know that no
matter how much money we spend, we'll be outspent by business
groups by at least 11-to-1, as we have every year.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the American Federation of Labor-Congress
of Industrial Organizations, which represents 13 million members,
is holding its winter executive council meeting in New Orleans.
Five years ago, the federation decided to stop meeting in luxury
seaside hotels in Miami, a tradition that was proving embarrassing,
in favor of holding its meetings around the nation to strengthen
labor's ties with workers in various cities. Here, in New Orleans,
labor leaders are showing support for local workers involved in
strikes at Overnite Transportation, Domino Sugar and Kaiser
Aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the success in mobilizing union members in
political campaigns, Steven Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political
director, noted that in 33 percent of the people who attended the
Iowa's Democratic caucuses last month were from union households.
He also noted that in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, 24
percent of those who voted came from union households.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal pointed to polls that showed that without union
members, Gore would have lost New Hampshire to former Sen. Bill
Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Members of nonunion households voted 50 percent for Bradley and 49
percent for Gore, while 62 percent from union households backed
Gore and 37 percent backed Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said that labor unions had endorsed the Democratic
candidate in all but one of the 71 congressional districts where
labor plans to make a major push. In that one district, the union
has endorsed Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican. Nonetheless, Rosenthal
said he expected labor to endorse a fair number of Republicans in
other races, noting that in 1998, unions endorsed 26 Republican
House candidates whom union considered friendly on their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have a pro-worker majority in the House and the
Senate,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   After having endorsed Gore at the AFL-CIO's convention last
October, union leaders are directing considerable fire at the two
major Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, denounced Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas for calling union leaders ``bosses'' and for attacking Sen.
John McCain for not being tough enough toward unions.
</P>
<P>
   With many union members caught up in the groundswell for McCain,
Sweeney said it would be unwise for union members to back the
Arizona senator because he has often taken anti-labor positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain has been anti-worker, anti-working family agenda
throughout his whole career in the United States Senate,'' Sweeney
said. ``He may have a real courageous war record in terms of his
hardship as a prisoner of war, but he has been on the wrong side on
just about every issue that was a working-family-related issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney noted that McCain sometimes opposed raising the minimum
wage and backed laws that allow workers in unionized workplaces not
to pay any dues to the unions.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Tuesday of the Teamsters Eastern Regional Council
in Atlantic City, N.J., a majority of Teamsters, many from New
Jersey, voted to urge the union's national board to back Bradley,
their former senator. But Teamster leaders, who have so far not
endorsed any presidential candidate, said they had still not
decided whom to support. They also said the vote in Atlantic City
did not constitute an official action by the eastern region.

A NEWER, LONELIER CROWD EMERGES IN INTERNET STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs and lengthens by about 650 words)  
(bl) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The nation's obsession with the Internet is
causing many Americans to spend less time with friends and family,
less time shopping in stores and more time working at home after
hours, according to one of the first large-scale surveys of the
societal impact of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``the more hours people use the Internet, the less
time they spend with real human beings,'' said Norman Nie, a
political scientist at Stanford University who was the principal
investigator for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Nie asserted that the Internet was creating a broad new wave of
social isolation in the United States, raising the specter of an
atomized world without human contact or emotion.
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion is certain to prove controversial because of the
contention among some online enthusiasts that the Internet has
fostered alternative electronic relationships that may replace or
even enhance face-to-face family and social connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a zero-sum game,'' said Howard Rheingold, author
of ``Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier.''
``People's social networks do not consist only of people they see
face to face. In fact, social networks have been extending because
of artificial media since the printing press and the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford survey, which was conducted by the university's
Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society and will be
published Wednesday, appears to offer an Internet-era parallel to
some of the findings of ``The Lonely Crowd,'' a landmark
sociological analysis of American society in 1950. The book,
written by David Riesman with Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney,
described the changing American character and chronicled the shift
away from family and community-centered life and the ascendance of
mass media.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford study, in turn, details how the Internet is leading
to a rapid shift away from mass media. The study reported that 60
percent of regular Internet users said they had reduced their
television viewing, and one-third said they spent less time reading
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Those regular users, spending at least five hours a week online,
represented about 20 percent of those surveyed and were the group
looked at most closely. In all, the study found that 55 percent of
those polled had Internet access at home or work and that 43
percent of households were online.
</P>
<P>
   And the study found evidence that the Internet was allowing the
workplace to invade the home. A quarter of regular Internet users
employed at least part time said the Internet had increased the
time they spent working at home without reducing the time spent at
work.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Nie has been the author of studies on the decline of
American involvement in political and community organizations. He
said that while much of the public Internet debate had been focused
on the invasion of privacy, little study had been done of the
potential psychological and emotional impact of what he said would
be more people ``home, alone and anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nie, a co-author of the study with Professor Lutz Erbring of the
Free University of Berlin, contended that there was no evidence
that virtual communities would provide a substitute for traditional
human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go home at 6:30 in the evening and spend the whole night
sending e-mail and wake up the next morning, I still haven't talked
to my wife or kids or friends,'' Nie said. ``When you spend your
time on the Internet you don't hear a human voice and you never get
a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   The new study was based on a sample of 4,114 adults in 2,689
households. It is the second major research project to suggest that
the advent of the Internet may have negative social consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998 researchers at Carnegie Mellon University
reported that people who spent even a few hours a week connected to
the Internet experienced higher levels of depression and
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Carnegie Mellon study, which focused on
psychological and emotional issues, the Stanford survey is an
effort to provide a broad demographic picture of Internet use and
its potential impact on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is asking the obvious questions about what kind of
world we are going to live in when the Internet becomes
ubiquitous,'' Nie said. ``No one asked these questions with the
advent of the automobile, which led to unplanned suburbanization,
or with the rise of television, which led to the decline of our
political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can give society a chance to talk through some of
these issues before the changes take place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans overwhelmingly use e-mail as their most common
Internet activity, according to the Stanford researchers. Moreover,
the report found that most Internet users treated the network as a
giant public library, albeit with a commercial tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general perception that the Internet has become a
vast cybernetic shopping mall, the Stanford study indicates that
only 25 percent of the Internet users surveyed make purchases
online and that fewer than 10 percent do other types of financial
transactions online, like banking. The assertion that the Internet
is leading to a new form of social isolation is certain to generate
a lively discussion among social scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true by definition that if you're spending more hours
hitting the keyboard, you're not spending time with other people,''
said Amatai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University.
``But people do form very strong relations over the Internet, and
many of them are relations that they could not find any other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nie disagrees, arguing that today's patterns of Internet usage
foretell a loss of interpersonal contact that will result in the
kind of isolation seen among many elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be millions of people with very minimal
human interaction,'' he said. ``We're really in for some things
that are potentially great freedoms but frightening in terms of
long-term social interaction.''

POLL FINDS EDUCATION IS CHIEF CONCERN OF LIKELY VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Education is the top concern among voters this election season,
ranking above health care, Social Security and tax cuts, according
to a national poll, scheduled for release on Wednesday, that shows
strong support for more federal money and involvement in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of those surveyed back a variety of
initiatives pending on Capitol Hill, many of them proposed by
President Clinton. These include added dollars for students with
special needs and poor districts, and national certification for
teachers and financial incentives to attract and retain them.
</P>
<P>
   Some 61 percent of those surveyed said the federal government
spent too little on education, and more than half also thought that
states and districts should increase their education budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education demands attention, and public officials who ignore
it do so at great risk,'' the pollsters wrote in their summary.
``Education stands out as the single most important issue
nationally, and voters support action at the national level to
improve the nation's schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was sponsored by the National Education Association,
the country's largest teachers' union, but was conducted by a
bipartisan team of pollsters, Greenberg Quinlan Research _ a firm
that has worked for Clinton _ and Voter/Consumer Research, whose
clients include Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. In late January, the
firms canvassed 1,000 likely voters, more than 90 percent of whom
voted in 1996 and planned to vote this fall.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which two issues Washington politicians should be
paying the most attention to, 38 percent cited education, 35
percent chose Social Security and Medicare, 31 percent health care,
17 percent taxes and 15 percent crime. A separate question about
where more money should go in next year's federal budget found 42
percent naming education, 37 percent health care, 33 percent Social
Security and Medicare and 20 percent each tax cuts and paying down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Though the federal government provides just 7 percent of the
money spent on public schools, education has been a much-mentioned
issue on the campaign trail in recent weeks, with both Bill
Bradley, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey, and Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., unveiling proposals and devoting speeches to
the topic. Vice President Al Gore, the other Democratic candidate,
has made education a centerpiece of his campaign from the start,
and Bush has emphasized education in his tenure as Texas governor
as well as on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll found that 42 percent of voters would like to see
more money devoted to education in the next federal budget, with
Democrats, independents and Republicans all naming education as
their top spending priority. However, when asked about the federal
role in public schools, 38 percent said it should grow, 35 percent
said it should shrink and 24 percent wanted it to remain steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters still look to the states as primarily responsible for
education,'' the pollsters explained, ``but majorities now believe
the federal government should also play a role on a wide range of
education issues.''
</P>
<P>
   When offered a choice between a Democratic proposal of smaller
classes and national performance standards for students and a
Republican plan centered on local control and taxpayer-financed
vouchers for private schools, voters favored the Democrats' plan,
53 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about education savings accounts, a Republican
idea that would replace some taxes for schools with tax breaks for
parents, 49 percent agreed that parents were better off keeping
their education dollars and choosing how to spend them, while 42
percent said they believed this favored the rich and robbed public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate question, 37 percent said they believed the
Democrats would do a better job on education, and 27 percent
expressed more confidence in the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans run a real risk if they fail to address the
education issue,'' the pollsters wrote, noting that education was
of particular concern to Republican women and liberal to moderate
Republicans. ``Though it may not be the issue on which they win,
they may well pay a price if they do not put forth an agenda on
education,'' they continued.

CLINTON SETS INTERNET CHIEFS AT EASE ON GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Executives from the nation's leading Internet
companies told President Clinton at the White House Tuesday that
despite hacker attacks that disrupted several major Web sites last
week, they saw no need for an increase in government regulation of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was organized months ago to discuss ways to prevent
the World Wide Web from being used for terrorism, but took on a
sudden urgency with last week's events, in which several sites were
disrupted for hours. Those sites included Amazon.com, Yahoo and
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry feared that the government would cite the
hacker attacks as evidence of the need to expand its role in
regulating Internet security. But after Tuesday's meeting, many of
the two dozen executives who sat down with Clinton said they were
reassured that he had no such intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with the challenge of security on the Internet,
private industry must take the leadership role,'' said Harris N.
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose trade group represents many of the leading
information technology companies, told reporters after the two-hour
meeting that it was important that the computer industry _ not the
government _ oversee Internet security because ``the private sector
has made the Internet the vibrant and dynamic thing that it is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Clinton administration seemed to go to great
lengths to reassure the industry participants, who included a
reformed hacker turned security consultant who went by the Internet
nickname ``Mudge'' during his hacker days, that there was no
intention to impose new regulations on them that could impede the
growth of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley told reporters after the
meeting that the administration would do nothing that would damage
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government's role was to support the industry, and
that companies were properly taking the lead in enhancing security.
``It is not about the government regulating this or taking steps or
actions that would at all impede the Internet because, of course,
it is the dynamic engine that is driving our economy today and we
must keep that open.''
</P>
<P>
   David Starr, the chief information officer for 3Com Corp., said
after the meeting that ``everybody was concerned going in that the
government would use this as an excuse for more involvement in the
Internet. But we were pleasantly surprised that they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said that one of the issues discussed at the meeting was
whether the government could do anything to improve security on the
Web to ensure that last week's incidents were not repeated. ``The
answer was clearly no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened the meeting with a reference to last week's
cybersalvos by hackers who are still being sought by the the FBI,
saying that the attacks were ``a source of concern, but I don't
think we should leave here with this vast sense of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to leave here with a sense of confidence that this is
a challenge that was entirely predictable,'' he said. ``It's part
of the price of the success of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, he added, ``an electronic Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said Tuesday that they were
seeking to interview two young computer enthusiasts who might know
about last week's attacks. But the officials cautioned that the
people were not necessarily themselves suspects and that they did
not anticipate any early arrests.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Diffie, the corporate information officer of Sun
Microsystems Inc., who attended the meeting, said the participants
were relieved when Clinton quickly made it clear that he believed
the industry had thrived because the government had applied a light
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general agreement on the desirability of the
industry solving our own problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diffie said the industry leaders at the meeting were intent on
letting the White House know that ``the real expertise on these
problems is in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of the participants acknowledged that
there had been insufficient attention to security in some parts of
the industry. ``It's clear that we've got to do a better job,''
said Nicholas M. Donofrio, senior vice president for IBM's
technology group.
</P>
<P>
   He said that most of the security tools already existed to
prevent incidents like those last week, but that some companies had
not deployed them.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he said, many computers come with a
factory-installed default security system that is meant to be
changed when it is put into operation. ``We believe that a third of
them are never changed but left just the way it arrived from the
factory,'' he said. He described that as the equivalent of buying a
briefcase with a three-digit combination lock that opens when all
the numbers are at 0-0-0 and never changing the combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a wake-up call, not a crisis,'' Donofrio said,
employing a description used by several of the participants. ``The
time to fix things is now, before there is a real crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But like his colleagues, Donofrio was firm in saying that ``this
is a problem mainly for the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the company officials said that if the industry was to
be left to solve security problems by itself, as they had urged,
there had to be greater coordination and more uniform security
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Chandron, executive vice president for Nortel Networks
Corp., said the group agreed that ``we really need to focus on
implementation now,'' including ``a massive communications effort
throughout the industry'' to make sure that other companies install
the security systems needed to avert these kinds of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   This work, he said, would most likely be coordinated by the
Information Technology Association, the trade group that
coordinated the industry participation in Tuesday's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that his group had proposed a plan in which Internet
companies would commit to sharing information among themselves,
including how to deal with security vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The industry participants spoke regularly and politely about the
need for a continuing partnership with the government in improving
computer security. But their concept of what role the government
would or should have was decidedly limited.
</P>
<P>
   They generally wanted the government to maintain high security
for its own computers and to keep up with changing technology. ``So
that when we speak, they understand us,'' said Donofrio of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, who has been in
charge of the issue of computer security, said the government had
not done a good enough job of securing its own computer systems.
``We need to make the government a role model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a 16 percent increase in funding for
computer security issues, to $2 billion. Podesta said that would
include a proposal to address the problem of gifted computer
security specialists' leaving government for more lucrative
positions in private business.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is proposing a subsidy to help with education
costs for computer students who would then be obligated to serve
for a time with the government.

RECIPE FOR JOY: DANISH DOGMA PLUS SAMURAI  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark _ The idea that rules can bring freedom may
seem teasingly contradictory, but Soren Kragh-Jacobsen needed
little persuading when two fellow Danish movie directors, Lars von
Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, invited him to sign onto Dogma '95,
their 10-point ``vow of chastity'' designed to liberate filmmaking
from technology by banning everything from special lighting to
post-production dubbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lars sold it to me by saying it was about getting joy back
into moviemaking,'' recalled Kragh-Jacobsen, 52, who admitted to
feeling jaded after a long television career and seven feature
films. ``It was what I had been dreaming about for a long time and
I immediately said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kragh-Jacobsen came to shoot his first Dogma movie,
``Mifune,'' however, von Trier had already made ``The Idiots'' and
Vinterberg ``The Celebration,'' and their new movie creed had
provoked much debate and some mockery when it was presented with
fanfare at the Cannes International Film Festival in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If von Trier and Vinterberg enjoyed making their films, it was
not too apparent in the dark stories they told. In contrast, with
``Mifune,'' a touching love story set on an isolated farm in
southern Denmark, the joy of moviemaking is very much visible on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which won a special jury prize at the 1999 Berlin film
festival and is Denmark's Academy Award nominee for best foreign
language film this year, opens in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a film that I would go and see if I had a
Friday evening free,'' Kragh-Jacobsen said in an interview at his
Copenhagen home, ``the sort of film I'd take my wife and kids to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   The story opens with the marriage of Kersten (Anders W.
Berthelsen) to his boss' daughter, Claire (Sofie Grabol). On their
wedding night, Kersten receives a telephone call with news that his
father has died, also a shock for Claire since Kersten had said he
had no living relatives. As Kersten rushes off to bury his father,
he further reveals that he has a retarded brother living in the
family farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Kersten finds his brother, Rud (Jesper Asholt), understandably
upset, but distracts him with a childhood game in which Kersten
pretends to be the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune in his role
from the Kurosawa classic ``The Seven Samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   More critically, what is Kersten to do with Rud? After he
advertises for a housekeeper, the beautiful Liva (Iben Hjejle)
shows up. To pay the private school fees of her rebellious brother,
Bjarke (Emil Tarding), she has been working as a call girl until
forced by a stalker to flee the city. Playing nursemaid, though, is
not what she had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   When Kersten's wife discovers this bizarre household arrangement
and announces that the marriage is over, however, Kersten needs
Liva more than ever. Meanwhile, Liva's own problems grow when
Bjarke is expelled from school and arrives at the farm. Yet
somehow, left to themselves, these lost souls with secrets
eventually find peace.
</P>
<P>
   Kragh-Jacobsen, who wrote the main parts for Anders Berthelsen
and Iben Hjejle (pronounced EE-ben YAY-lay), said he had the idea
of bringing together the family that was torn apart in Vinterberg's
``Celebration,'' which revolves around child abuse committed by a
father and shockingly revealed at his 60th birthday party. But the
director's principal aim, he conceded, was to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   His previous film, ``The Island on Bird Street,'' was about the
Holocaust. It was also a large European production, what he calls
``a Euro-pudding,'' with endless meddling by producers. Now, he
wanted to make a film for himself and his actors. And the Dogma
rules helped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a film where the focus is totally on the
actor,'' he said, ``where the actors have so much time and I have
all the time in the world with them, because we're all tired of
standing around for two or three hours waiting for the lights. I
thought, what about this? You mike them and you work all day. I
have never worked with happier actors than on this film. And, yes,
it was the most extreme selfish egotistical film I have ever shot
in my life, with no interference from anybody. You write your
story, you shoot it, you edit it and you put it in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Kragh-Jacobsen said he did his best to respect the Dogma rules,
which include shooting on location without props, sets or special
lighting and using a hand-held camera, with all sound recorded at
the same time as the images. The manifesto also requires films to
be set in the present day and to avoid ``superficial action
(murders, weapons, etc., must not occur).''
</P>
<P>
   Kragh-Jacobsen later confessed to some sins, among them covering
a window in black drape and chasing a neighbor's chickens onto the
location, but he was still given his Dogma certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Hjejle, 28, primarily a theater actress, said that making
``Mifune'' proved to be a delight, not least because cast and crew
spent six weeks camped out in the countryside, with fireside
entertainment provided by Kragh-Jacobsen, who is probably better
known in Denmark as a former folk singer than as a movie director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what Dogma was at the time, but I was so excited
to work with Soren,'' she said. ``What really made the biggest
difference was that I was completely free to do my own makeup and
hair and wear my own clothes for costumes. So the whole preparing
of the character became much more of a personal journey because
she, well, maybe Liva is not like me, but she (italics)looks(end
italics) like me. There was also a difference in the way we
discussed the story and characters. I think it should always be
like this for actors, having that much focus on you and character
development.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The experience also brought Hjejle an unexpected surprise.
Having seen her in ``Mifune'' at the Berlin festival, Stephen
Frears cast her opposite John Cusack in ``High Fidelity,'' a
romantic comedy based on the novel by Nick Hornby, which opens in
the United States on March 31. The actress already spoke English
without an accent (thanks to her mother, an English teacher, and a
year spent with a family in Boston). Now she came to know a big
movie production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great fun, but it wasn't something that I had expected
for several years,'' she said. ``It wasn't as if I were begging for
the part, so I felt freer. Still, in the first days, I felt the
difference, the crew, the way people talk, a hierarchy that is much
harsher than in Denmark. After that it was the same, but the whole
Hollywood thing is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   For her next film, Hjejle will be working again with
Kragh-Jacobsen, who is again writing a role for her. But this time,
they will not be following the Dogma rules. In fact, neither are
von Trier and Vinterberg in their next movies. All of which raises
the question of whether Dogma represented a genuine conversion to
low-tech moviemaking or simply a clever gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it more of a cure than a creed,'' Kragh-Jacobsen
said, ``and you don't go on a cure every time. For me, I think it
was very good. This is my eighth film. I was losing spontaneity
over the years. Dogma taught me to play the game again. It doesn't
mean I have to do a Dogma film next. Maybe in 10 years, I'll need
another cure, but then I'll invent something new. But even for my
next film, I intend to use less special lighting and give more
space to the actors.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Kristian Levring, the fourth signatory of the Dogma
manifesto, completes his first Dogma film (``The King Is Alive''),
will the experiment be over? One American film, Harmony Korine's
1999 ``Julien Donkey-Boy,'' and on French film, Jean-Marc Barr's
``Lovers,'' have already been certified by the Dogma politbureau.
</P>
<P>
   But the interest stirred up by Dogma is also becoming something
of a burden to its inventors, not least because the Dogma
certificate has gone from spoof to a sort of good filmmaking seal
of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original idea was that a Dogma film would be shown to the
four Dogma brothers and if they approved, it was stamped `Dogma
certified,''' said Lars Bredo Rahbek, an executive at Nimbus Films,
which produced ``The Celebration'' and ``Mifune.'' ``Now, if
someone swears he has made a film following the rules, we will
grant a certificate. But people are also beginning to make Dogma
films without asking for certificates, which is fine because it's
about going back to basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dogma can claim one significant achievement: it has drawn
attention to the fact that, thanks to government subsidies, loads
of energy, talented directors and astute marketing, Denmark is in
the process of building up a noteworthy movie industry. In fact, in
the barracks of a former army base at Hvidore, outside Copenhagen,
Nimbus and Zentropa, von Trier's production company, are among
firms creating what they hope will one day become a Danish
Cinecitta. Certainly, Kragh-Jacobsen feels no yearning for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy telling stories, I have a life here and I'm not that
keen on money,'' he said, ``and money is what it comes down to when
I talk to Hollywood. They say, `You're ruining your career.' And I
say: `Why? I have a car, I have a house in the country, I have a
wife, kids, good friends.'''
</P>
<P>
   He looked out of the window of his sitting room and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also enjoy the climate here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It was pouring with rain.

 &HT;    Lewis walks out of jail after posting bail
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As NFL star Ray Lewis walked out of the Fulton County
Jail Tuesday afternoon and into a throng of reporters and sheriff's
deputies, another suspect in the Buckhead double murders was being
booked into the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Oakley, 31, surrendered about an hour before Lewis was
released. Like Joseph Sweeting, who surrendered Monday, Oakley 's
arrival at the jail was eagerly anticipated by reporters , who
staked out the detention center and Atlanta's homicide unit at City
Hall East.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Sweeting and Oakley's stay in the Fulton County
Jail is expected to be more routine than that of their well-known
acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis left the county jail Tuesday afternoon after posting a
$1.1 million bond. Lewis, Sweeting and Oakley have all been charged
with murder in the stabbing deaths of Jacinth Baker, 21, and
Richard Lollar, 24 on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys Steve Sadow, who represents Sweeting, and
Bruce Harvey, who represents Oakley, said they will ask for bond
hearings after a superior court judge is assigned to their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a celebrity defendant with a $26 million
contract,'' said Harvey referring to Oakley. ``His (Oakley's)
financial resources are limited. My client is here, he's turning
himself in and he's pleading not guilty. The question of whether
he'll have a bond hearing is not certain right now.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sadow and Harvey waited for word about a judge for the
case, Lewis, 24, enjoyed his first night of freedom with his family
since his arrest Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God to be out,'' Lewis said smiling and shaking his
head as he walked briskly to a blue-green BWM parked at the front
of the jail earlier in the day. Inside the car were Lewis' two
sons, his mother Sunseria Keith and his fiancee Tatyana McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a chocolate-brown Fubu brand football jersey with the
word ``Supreme'' across the back and the number ``7'' on the front,
Lewis jumped into the car, grabbed his youngest son from the back
seat, placed the toddler on his lap and hugged and kissed the
2-year-old boy repeatedly on the face.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' attorney Ed Garland said his client would spend time with
his family and then fly to Baltimore by Thursday: ``I never expect
to see him in a jail again unless he's doing charitable work.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said about Sweeting, 35 and Oakley, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting, of Miami, surrendered to Atlanta police Monday
morning, while Oakley, of Baltimore, went directly to the county
jail on Tuesday afternoon. The two men, described as ``longtime
associates'' of Lewis' by Atlanta Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson, were
accompanied by their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Sadow acknowledged Tuesday that evidence against his client
could affect his chances of his getting bond. He would not
elaborate on his client's status because of a gag order placed on
attorneys and investigators involved in the case. However,
prosecutors on Monday revealed Sweeting had purchased three knives
at a sporting goods store in metro Atlanta two nights before Baker
and Lollar were fatally stabbed at a Buckhead intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has said the knives were used in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sweeting and Oakley have been linked to Lewis as far back
as his college days at the University of Miami. Tampa Bay
Buccaneers defensive tackle Warren Sapp testified at Lewis' bond
hearing Monday that Sweeting _ also known as ``Unk'' and ``Joe'' _
hung around Lewis when he played football at the U of M.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, also known by the monikers A.J. Johnson and A.J.
Washington , was quiet as he walked with Harvey through the throng
of reporters that crowded in front of the county jail on Rice
Street. His face was partly covered with a creme-colored
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch baseball cap that bore a red ``A'' on the
front. Dressed in a dark brown leather jacket, a light brown shirt
with a checker print and dark pants, he did not look at the glaring
cameras or answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel if you had just been charged with double
murder?'' Harvey asked.
</P>
<P>
   After Harvey left, an Atlanta homicide investigator emerged from
the jail. The detective, having just learned of Oakley's surrender,
said he had gone to the detention center to serve Oakley with the
arrest warrant that was drawn up and signed last week by a
municipal court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said Oakley asked for his representation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge assigned to their cases could grant a bond hearing as
soon as 10 days from the time it is requested, but it could be
longer. Some Superior Court judges routinely schedule bond hearings
two weeks from the date granted.
</P>
<P>
   After that there would be an arraignment, at which time the
defendant enters a plea. That would be followed by a series of
hearings before the actual trial in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   While Sweeting, Oakley and Lewis were indicted together, it's
unlikely the three will be tried at the same time. Lawyers normally
move to have all defendants' cases severed and tried separately.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting's attorney Sadow said he is confident all three men
will be acquitted. ``I look forward to hearing 'not guilty' from a
jury when we go to trial. All three are innocent.''
</P>

CANADIAN WOMAN IS CLEARED OF ROLE IN TERRORIST PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucia Garofalo, a Canadian woman who federal investigators
initially linked to a murky, cross-border terrorism plot involving
smuggled explosives and illegal aliens, was freed from a Vermont
jail on Tuesday after prosecutors announced that she had not
knowingly aided any planned violence.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo, 35, pleaded guilty to two immigration charges stemming
from her role in running Algerian nationals illegally across the
border from Canada last December.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said that Garofalo, a mother of three from
Montreal, had cooperated with FBI investigators and should be
allowed to return to Canada until her sentencing on May 8. She
faces up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines, but
prosecutors said that they expected to push for a more lenient
sentence of some six months to a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government had thought it was more than an ordinary alien
smuggling case,'' Tristan Coffin, an assistant U.S. attorney, told
Judge William Sessions in Federal District Court in Burlington
before conceding that there was nothing to warrant holding Garofalo
further. She agreed to surrender her passport, stay in the Montreal
area and check in by telephone with American officials daily.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo was arrested on Dec. 19 when she was caught trying to
enter the United States from Canada with an Algerian man, Bouabide
Chamchi, at a remote border crossing in Beecher Falls, Vt. The man
had a stolen French passport in his coat which Garofalo later
conceded she had given him. He is scheduled to be tried in April.
</P>
<P>
   Her December arrest caused a flurry of anxiety among law
enforcement agencies because it came just five days after another
Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, was detained near Seattle. Customs
officials had discovered that the trunk of his car was bristling
with hidden explosives and other bomb-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors thought the two might be linked through
several roundabout connections, including a chain of telephone
calls and the fact that Garofalo was acquainted with one of
Ressam's former Montreal roommates.
</P>
<P>
   The government now says that the telephone call had to do with
alien smuggling. In addition, they believe she had received money
in 1997 from Said Atmani, another Algerian, in connection with
helping her own Algerian husband, who was expelled from Canada and
unable to return.
</P>
<P>
   Atmani, himself deported from Canada in 1998, once shared an
apartment there with Ressam and is suspected of belonging to the
terrorist ring that despatched him over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Garofalo, a convert to Islam, had frequently attended a
Montreal mosque where yet a third leading suspect in the aborted
terrorist plot, Mohambedou Ould Slahi, had led prayers before he
departed Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's lawyer in Vermont, Maryann E. Kampmann, criticized
the government for holding her client for so long based simply on
the fact that she had vague associations with suspects in the
terrorism case, calling it a case of ``ethnic profiling.'' Garofalo
often wore the head scarf of a devout Muslim during her trips
through obscure border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo still faces a detention hearing by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which took her into custody on Tuesday
after federal prosecutors released her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a separate development in Seattle, prosecutors said they
believed that Ressam burned himself with the kind of explosive
chemicals he later tried to sneak across the border.
</P>
<P>
   A report on Tuesday in The Seattle Times, quoting court
documents filed there, said that tests on a pair of pants and
tennis shoes seized from Ressam's apartment show that holes and
other burn marks in them were caused by a chemical reaction that is
one step of the process to concoct explosive material.
</P>
<P>
   The report said an examination of Ressam's legs had revealed
recent scars on his right thigh and their pattern suggest they were
caused by splashed material. The motion filed in court asked among
other things that Ressam submit to a doctor's exam.

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES PLAN TO SOLVE BIG DIG FUNDING CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci has rejected a plan for a new
toll on the Southeast Expressway's car-pool lane, saying he will
rely on driver's license fees, previously announced toll hikes and
hefty state borrowing to solve the ``Big Dig'' $1.4 billion funding
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci dismissed the idea for a toll on single-occupancy cars
in the Expressway's HOV lane, along with other new fees on drivers,
saying they would be complicated, unpopular, and unlikely to win
legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tolls and fees had been pushed by Massachusetts
Turnpike Authority Chairman James J. Kerasiotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan we have produced is a fiscally prudent plan that will
close the gap, and make sure that we can complete this project,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the governor's plan calls for $900 million in borrowing
_ $150 million of which would be spread out over 50 years _ even
though the administration concedes the state is ``swimming'' in
cash reserves, thanks to repeated budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for increasing easternmost Turnpike tolls from 50 cents
to $1 and harbor tunnel tolls from $2 to $3 for cars and from $3 to
$5 for taxis next January. But Cellucci said there is a possibility
those increases could be delayed an additional year, if the
Legislature embraces his plan for large-scale borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic gesture aimed at restoring public confidence in
the $12.2 billion highway project, the plan was unveiled at the
State House by Cellucci's top budget aide, Andrew Natsios,
well-known for his fiscal conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the event was Kerasiotes, who two weeks ago
admitted the Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project was
overbudget by $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kerasiotes privately urged the governor to embrace a
plan to hike Tobin tolls and allow single-occupant vehicles to use
the HOV lane for a fee, the governor rejected the ideas and told
Kerasiotes over lunch Tuesday he was moving in a different
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci bailout proposal requires the Turnpike, which has
responsibility for paying for the project, to contribute in $200
million in cash, and partially liquidate a controversial insurance
account, which would raise $150 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Massachusetts Port Authority would provide another $50
million in cash, in addition to the $300 million the agency has
already paid to the project for the completion of the Ted Williams
Tunnel, which links the airport to the expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the governor's plan requires Legislative approval,
although tolls can be raised without the OK of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Natsios said the state is ``swimming'' in $4 billion in
cash reserves, he said the governor wants to conserve that money in
case of an economic downturn or other emergencies and to provide
tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said the borrowing is prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a conservative person and a hard-liner,'' said Natsios,
whose reputation for flintiness was reinforced during Tuesday's
press conference, when he scolded reporters for taking notes on a
table he had salvaged from a basement and refinished, fearing they
would scratch it.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders sharply criticized Cellucci Tuesday. Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham earlier in the day threatened to cut
off the state's Big Dig funding after one month if the governor did
not quickly present a bailout plan rather than issue ``half-baked,
half thought-out trial balloons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting the administration on a short leash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cellucci, and privately some members of the House, said
Birmingham was just posturing because he knew Cellucci was about to
unveil a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Birmingham said the Senate would approve only $200
million of a $2 billion transportation bond bill, which includes
money for the Big Dig and other projects, until senators are
confident the Central Artery shortfall has been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer prepared to write that kind of a blank
check,'' Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Birmingham said he needed to ``review the fine print'' of
the Cellucci plan. ``But it seems to me the necessity to foist this
onto other generations is driven by the unwillingness to be less
aggressive on the tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci wants to cut over $1 billion from the state income tax
by reducing the rate from 5.85 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said it makes sense to spread out some of the debt to
2050 because the project will have benefits for commuters well into
the future. Natsios also said the tax cut would help the economy
grow and insulate the state from a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a repeat of 1989,'' Natsios said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Natsios added, the toll increases included in the plan
aren't new. They are just being put in place Jan. 1, a year sooner
than planned.
</P>
<P>
   But others were also quick to criticize the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien said she is worried about
stretching the limit of the state's borrowing capacity and was
particularly dismissive about part of the plan that would bond $150
million over 50 years, saying it shifts too much of the debt on
another generation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is ``continually opening up new credit
cards,'' she said. ``I just question whether that's the smartest
and cheapest way we can tackle this shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over the Big Dig siphoning funding from other road and
bridge projects appear to be mounting in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not improve our infrastructure in Springfield and
Worcester and the Cape?'' asked state Senator Robert Havern 3d, an
Arlington Democrat and cochairman of the Joint Committee on
Transportation. ``And what about the morality of telling future
generations . . . they're going to pay for this?''

   BOSTON _ If you liked the book, you'll love the movie. The story
is about a highly regarded Red Sox player who came to town not
knowing his future and was swept off his feet by a multiyear offer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the happy player was Pedro Martinez, who signed
for $75 million and now owns the city. In the sequel, played out
Tuesday at Fenway Park, center fielder Carl Everett played the lead
and had the Red Sox promising very good things down the road.
Everett, who had filed for arbitration, instead signed a three-year
contract, with a club option for a fourth. Terms were not
announced, but sources said the deal could be worth $25 million,
not including the option.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, obtained in a trade with Houston Dec. 15, has come a
long way. Over a seven-year major league career, he has played in
just 605 games, with the Marlins, Mets, and Astros. In the last
five years, he has hit a solid .280 _ including .325 last year _
and the Red Sox think that, at 29, Everett has his best years ahead
of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl was one of the best clutch hitters in the Natiional
League last year,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette.
``And we're looking forward to him joining our key core players
that we've signed _ Pedro, Nomar Garciaparra, and Jose Offerman. It
also gives us a much stronger outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett was in town last month for the Baseball Writers dinner,
but serious negotiations on a contract apparently didn't begin
until very recently.
</P>
<P>
   After making $2.5 million in 1999, he filed for arbitration at
$6 million. The Red Sox offered $4.4 million. A deal was reported
to be close late last week, and the sides talked again Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been in the flow of what's going on,'' said
Everett in a teleconference. ``At this moment, I can't say that I'm
overjoyed, sad, or anything. But it's always a good feeling to be
wanted. And it's good to go someplace where you are wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around and seen things, and I like the whole
atmosphere here. I just feel that I fit in. The team is young, and
we all have the same goals that I have. That's what I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who had 25 home runs and 108 RBIs last season, also
likes the style of baseball played by the Sox under Jimy Williams.
It is like National League baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy has National League instincts,'' said Everett. ``I like
that because that's what I am about.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Duquette, ``The outfield was one of the places where we
felt we needed to improve some, especially get more power. I think
we've done that. We're better now than we were a year ago.''

<P>
   White women in New York state had the highest death rates from
heart disease among white women in the United States, and New York
ranked second highest in the number of deaths among women over all,
the first national study of heart disease in women by region, race
and ethnic origin has found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta and by West Virginia University, found
that the death rates from heart disease were generally highest in
the impoverished, rural areas of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta
and elsewhere in rural Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also found pockets of high death rates elsewhere,
too, particularly in four densely populated cities: New York,
Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans. States with the lowest death
rates were in the West, and the rates were low to moderate in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what many people believe, heart disease is the
leading caused of death for women,'' said the surgeon general, Dr.
David Satcher. While heart ailment has long been regarded as a
``men's'' disease, Satcher said the study provides a perspective on
the threat heart disease in women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michele L. Casper, an epidemiologist at the CDC who is the
chief author of the study, said she was surprised by the New York
findings because the high rates generally appeared in Southern
rural areas where many women, particularly the elderly, might live
isolated and alone, perhaps unable to care for themselves or get to
doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Casper also said that many rural areas have no coronary units
that can sometimes prevent heart attacks or cardiac rehabilitation
centers that can prevent recurrences. Such conditions might also
apply to poor women living in densely populated urban areas, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Casper said the current research was designed specifically to
pinpoint differences in death rates among different groups of women
and how the rates varied from region to region. Further studies
would examine the causes, she added.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said that lifestyle and social and economic
factors were also possible reasons for the disparities in death
rates generally and for the high rates in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Antonio M. Gotto, dean of Weill Cornell Medical College in
New York City, said he believed that lifestyle might be responsible
for as much as 50 percent of the incidence of the disease.. In New
York, he said, a great ethnic, cultural and economic diversity
produces great differences in lifestyle and patterns of behavior,
including diet, intake of fat and cholesterol, physical exercise,
smoking, blood pressure, money to pay for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings of the new study:
</P>
<P>
   The states with the highest heart-disease death rates were
Mississippi, ranked 51; New York ranked 50; and West Virginia
ranked, 49.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest among the low range of rates occurred in the states
of the Pacific Northwest, in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado,
New Mexico and in parts of Wisconsin and North and South Dakota.
The Midwest was found to be in the moderate to low range.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Minnesota were the most likely to survive heart
disease, while white women were most likely to survive in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 370,000 women died of heart disease in 1997, the last
year for which statistics are available. Annual rates or mortality
among women, a total of 401 per 100,000 base population, the CDC
statisticians said, were greater than for all forms of cancer
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Disparities of heart disease death rates among men will be
studied next.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Krieger, an associate professor in the department of
health and social behavior at Harvard School of Public health, said
the researchers were trying to move beyond the limitations of
current health data.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't look at heart disease mortality among women.
Epidemiology research shows that what matters are the conditions
you lived in when you grew up as well as how you are able to live
as an adult and the quality of care you receive'' when medical care
is needed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The research confirmed previously known disparities between the
five major racial and ethnic groups in the United States: that
significantly more African American women die from heart disease
than any other group but that whites are much more likely to do so
than Asian and Pacific Islanders and American Indians and Native
Alaskans.
</P>
<P>
   Among African American woman, the death rate from heart disease
was 553 per 100,000; among white woman, 388 per 100,000; native
Americans 259 per 100,000 and among Asian and Pacific Islander
women 221 per 100,000. The rate for Hispanic woman of all races was
265 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Counties with the highest rates for African American women, in
addition to those in Mississippi River and delta region, were those
in a band across Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and in pockets
of the Northeast, the Midwest and Texas and Oklahoma. Among the
states with the highest rates for this group of women were
Mississippi, Nebraska, Illinois and Michigan. Hawaii had the
lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Counties with the highest death rates for whites were roughly
the same as those for African Americans, that is in Appalachia and
the Mississippi River Valley, except that for whites there was a
greater concentration reported along the Southeast coastal regions.
The highest state rates were New York, ranged 51st among white
women, Mississippi and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In New York State, the death rate for all 4,929,714 women was
487 per 100 thousand, compared to the national average of 401; for
black women the rate was 573; for whites 477; Hispanic women 307;
Asian and Pacific islanders 236, and American Indians and Alaskan
natives 212.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City the death rate for all 2,019,225 women was 561
per 100 thousand; for black women the rate was 587; for whites 559;
Hispanic women 320; Asian and Pacific islanders 248, and American
Indians and Alaskan natives 97. Average deaths among both whites
and Hispanics were highest in Manhattan; for blacks and Asians and
Pacific islanders, Brooklyn; American Indians and Alaskan natives
were scattered through the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn.

GORE, BREAKING WITH CLINTON, OPPOSES NOMINATION OF REPUBLICAN TO
FCC 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a split from President Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore said Tuesday that he would not have nominated Bradley
Smith, a Republican who opposes the overhaul of the campaign
finance system, to the board of the Federal Election Commission and
that he would urge the Senate to reject the president's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have made the nomination,'' Gore said in an
interview Tuesday. Clinton nominated Smith as a concession to
Republicans in order to advance his judicial nominees, who have not
been confirmed. Gore said, Smith is ``unfit for the office'' to
which the president nominated him because ``he is completely and
totally opposed to the campaign finance laws'' that he would be
required to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, a White House spokesman said: ``We don't
disagree with the vice president's criticism of Mr. Smith's views.
However, this is traditionally a Republican spot on the FEC, and
this is who the Republicans have chosen to reflect their point of
view on that panel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he told the president of his opposition on Tuesday and
that their chiefs of staff had discussed the issue two days ago,
but he would not characterize the president's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is hoping that the vice president's divergent
view on Smith will demonstrate that he is a believer in changing
the campaign finance system and that he is committed to standing up
to congressional Republicans on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is campaign finance reform important or not?'' Gore asked. ``I
think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore conceded that the nomination process for the Federal
Election Commission was ``checks and balances extortion'' because
it allowed the parties to pick their own nominees. And he
acknowledged that the possible rejection by the Senate of this
nominee would not be terribly disappointing to Clinton, who
resisted the nomination for months before giving in.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gore said, ``it's the first time I've called for
the defeat of a presidential nominee.'' And, he said, ``The
judgment made that this was the right decision, to put this guy
forward is one that, however uncomfortable it had to be, was a
judgment made.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's opposition comes after former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's
sole rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, chastised
the administration for putting forth Smith's name.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a leading abortion-rights group endorsed Gore,
prompting an open feud with Bradley supporters who noted,
correctly, that Bradley has a more consistent history of supporting
abortion rights than Gore has.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement of Gore by the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League was welcomed by the Gore campaign
as confirmation that the vice president is now firmly in the
abortion-rights camp.
</P>
<P>
   However, even the league itself had given Gore a low ranking of
23 percent for his abortion votes during his tenure in the House,
from 1976 to 1982. The same group has given Bradley a lifetime
rating of 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How then to explain Tuesday's endorsement?
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the league, said in a small,
hastily arranged ceremony at a downtown hotel here that the issue
of abortion was ``far too important to be squandered as a wedge
issue between two pro-choice candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   And she acknowledged in an interview after Tuesday's ceremony
that her group was motivated by a concern that the Bradley campaign
has been using Gore's evolving position on abortion as a way to
question his veracity in general.
</P>
<P>
   At a debate last month, Gore had said that he had ``always been
pro-choice,'' even though in 1984 he had voted to redefine the word
``person'' to include ``unborn children from the moment of
conception'' and had repeatedly voted against public funding of
abortions for poor women. Gore earned a favorable rating of 84
percent from the National Right to Life Committee during his tenure
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's always been pro-choice, Al Gore is pro-choice, that
is not the issue,'' Michelman said. ``There is no difference
between the two in terms of their positions. The difference is that
one candidate is using the issue divisively as a weapon to divide
pro-choice voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Brooklyn on Tuesday, Bradley said, ``For me, this
is an issue of core conviction on an issue I've believed in from
the very beginning of my political life and I will always believe
in.'' He added, ``To me it's very surprising that this is what a
Washington-based interest group would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Glantz, Bradley's campaign manager, and other Bradley
backers said the former senator was essentially being punished for
raising questions about Gore's veracity and that Michelman was
returning a favor to Clinton, who has strongly supported abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications director, who had been a
political consultant for the league, said she sent her resignation
by fax to Michelman when she heard about the endorsement.

A FORMER CLUB KID TAKES OFFICE IN WASHINGTON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Kate Mattingly's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the Stuttgart Ballet.  
 By KATE MATTINGLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was once a private home, but now the four-floor
white building at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Porter
Street is filled with studios, offices and dressing rooms. In a way
it is still a home, but now to the Washington School of Ballet,
founded in 1944 by Mary Day and Lisa Gardiner, and the Washington
Ballet, founded by Day in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Choo San Goh, who was the resident choreographer,
transformed the company from a regional ballet troupe into an
internationally respected entity. Goh died in 1987, and after
several successors had come and gone, the company appointed its
present artistic director, Septime Webre, last June.
</P>
<P>
   During a rehearsal one afternoon last month, seven men were
slumped in chairs in front of Webre (pronounced WEB-er) after
running through a section of his ``Carmina Burana.'' They were
exhausted, but the 37-year-old choreographer appeared to have the
stamina of the Energizer bunny. Decked out in Nike Air sneakers,
black Gore-Tex pants and a long-sleeved Adidas shirt, he counted,
sang and corrected as he demonstrated the moves he has set to Carl
Orff's music.
</P>
<P>
   The men picked themselves up and repeated the acrobatic section,
leaping in unison, using the chairs as resting places, launching
pads and see-saws. One dancer, Jason Hartley, was particularly
notable, rocketing into the air and seeming to suspend himself in
mid-flight. The section ended with the seven lying on the floor,
their energy spent altogether this time. ``That's a good way to end
a rehearsal,'' Webre said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the 22-member Washington Ballet presented
``Carmina Burana'' at the Kennedy Center, accompanied by the
100-member Cathedral Choral Society, and on Tuesday it takes a new
program to New York for a weeklong run at the Joyce Theater, its
first season there with Webre as artistic director. The program
includes works by Jiri Kylian, Nacho Duato and Kirk Peterson (who
served as associate director in the 1980s) as well as Webre's
``Juanita y Alicia,'' based on stories about his mother's childhood
in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Webre is the seventh of nine children. ``All of my older
brothers were born in Cuba and grew up there,'' he said. ``I was
the first one born here after the revolution.'' His ``Juanita y
Alicia,'' set to Cuban music from the 1920s and '30s, will feature
live accompaniment by the Washington-based group Sin Miedo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a choreographer,'' Webre said during an interview in his
top-floor office, ``I am attracted to two different types of
dancers and two different kinds of movement: an exotic lyricism,
like watching Amanda McKerrow _ it's like watching smoke or a
whisper dance _ and then this whole other side, very athletic and
punchy dancing. I value both of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   McKerrow, a guest artist with the company, trained at the
Washington School and was a company member before joining American
Ballet Theater in 1982. More than 20 graduates of the school have
joined Ballet Theater, including its artistic director, Kevin
McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   Webre's eclecticism can be attributed to his dance background.
``While training in classical ballet, I was a club kid in the early
'80s,'' he said. ``Going to college at the University of Texas,
going to nightclubs five times a week, smoking clove cigarettes,
thinking I was really hip, part of this underground, undergraduate
culture. In choreographing, I delved into how these two worlds were
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29, Webre became artistic director of the American Repertory
Ballet, based in New Brunswick, N.J. ``It was really a crash
course: I had on-the-job training,'' he said. At American
Repertory, he established his reputation for exhilarating, slick
choreography, staging 17 ballets, including a popular version of
Maurice Sendak's book ``Where the Wild Things Are.'' His
choreography has been commissioned by Pacific Northwest Ballet and
Les Grands Ballets Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Webre signed a five-year contract with the Washington
Ballet, which has a $3.3 million budget, almost twice that of
American Repertory Ballet. ``The institution is more evolved and
mature here,'' Webre said. ``The infrastructure is more solid.
Also, we have a new executive director, Martin Cohen, who just
started. He was with DanceUSA as director for a year and a half
and, before that, State Ballet of Missouri. He is a top-notch
logistics person.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to choreographing for the Washington Ballet, Webre
hires dancers and expands the company's repertory though
commissions and acquisitions. About 20 percent of the repertory
will be his. Both he and Cohen hold seats on the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophically, I feel strongly linked to Mary Day's
legacy,'' said Webre. ``What has made the company special over the
last 20, 25 years is that it has always been a well-trained group
of classical technicians who are doing interesting work _ a lot of
new work _ with a strong influence and presence by choreographers
coming out of the Dutch school, which happens to be one of my
strong interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kylian and Duato worked with Nederlands Dans Theater. ``I'm
an extension of Mary Day in that I value real clean classical
technique and bringing in other people who can help bolster that
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Webre traveled to Havana to investigate touring
opportunities for the company. ``We're beginning a three-year Cuba
initiative that will include teacher exchange, dancer exchange,
choreographer exchange with Ballet Nacional and several
contemporary dance companies,'' he said. ``We are working with the
Dance on Camera Film Festival in New York to produce a Dance on
Camera Film Festival in Havana this May. We'll probably commission
a work from a Cuban choreographer soon. I'll probably go and create
a ballet for one of the ballet companies down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Webre is developing outreach programs in the
Washington area. ``I made a commitment to start collaborating with
other arts institutions,'' he said. ``Next year I'll be making a
new work with Sweet Honey in the Rock. People who go see Sweet
Honey in the Rock, who don't ordinarily see the Washington Ballet,
will be exposed and will broaden our audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Collaborations with Washington-based groups confirm Webre's
commitment to his new home. Last summer, he spoke about some of its
unexpected offerings: ``Washington's chockablock full _ like New
York _ with distinguished institutions. In fact, because there's a
little bit less touring through Washington, the local theaters are
more a part of the community here.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Washington Ballet started a program called Beer
and Ballet, sponsored by a local microbrewery. ``I wanted to open
our doors to the community,'' said Webre. ``This seemed like a good
way to make ballet accessible: an hourlong open rehearsal and
showing, followed by a tasting of beer from the John Harvard
brewery here at the studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Webre's choreography grabs attention, and the programs that he
has planned have the potential to transform the company, just as
Goh did 20 years ago. Goh was not so much a community activist as a
skilled dancemaker. A Singaporean, he worked for the Dutch National
Ballet before he was invited to Washington by Day. His
choreography, along with his ability to attract and inspire artists
of the highest caliber, brought the company international respect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Goh's death in 1987 at age 37, no choreographer has
brought the Washington Ballet as much attention. Patricia Berrend,
a dancer in the company during the Goh years and now associate
director of the school, compares his demeanor to Webre's: ``In the
studio, Choo San had that energy and it was great: really youthful,
bouncing all over the place when he was choreographing. But on the
outside he was very quiet.'' The new artistic director is always on
the run. ``I've never seen Septi anywhere,'' says Berrend,
``he constantly runs by.''

 &HT;    New Women's soccer league aiming to be independent of MLS
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a phenomenal run last summer that led to their
triumph in the Women's World Cup, the U.S. women's soccer team set
as its next objective the creation of a professional league.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing cadre of potential investors want in on what they
believe could be a marketing bonanza in women's professional
soccer. The Women's United Soccer Association, whose business plan
was unveiled Tuesday by a host of cable television companies as the
lead investors, think $40 million over five years is enough to get
started, beginning in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer, formed after the 1994 men's World Cup,
could probably put a lot more in the pot, and have a billionaire
investor, Phillip Anschutz, in their own camp who seems to be
willing to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   However, members of the U.S. women's team say they want to go
their way with an independent league that would have the women's
league as its primary enterprise. ``Part of my soccer career is due
to the fact that I had an NASL (North American Soccer League) team
to watch,'' said U.S. defender Brandi Chastain, who became famous
for ripping off her jersey and revealing a black sports bra after
the final against China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how excited I was to watch George Best, Pele
and Franz Beckenbauer when I was a kid. They were my heroes. I
can't wait for young girls to see us compete and for us to give
something back to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But in order for the WUSA to meet its targeted attendance goal
of 6,500 it would need to emphasize soccer, and not women's sports,
as was done during the World Cup. Atlanta is one of 15 markets
being considered for a WUSA franchise, but not even its investors
are sure how strong the appeal for women's pro soccer might be at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be interesting to see,'' said Ellen East, a
spokeswoman for Atlanta-based Cox Communications, Inc., which along
with Cox Enterprises, Inc. is investing in the WUSA. ``If there's
going to be a time, it's now. I think this is a great time to do
it.''

 &HT;    Soccer proposal gives women a league of their own
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Their World Cup championship was the most refreshing
American sports story of 1999. And members of the U.S. women's
soccer team capitalized on their popularity with a lucrative indoor
tour, personal appearances and improved salaries from the U.S.
Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But what they wanted more than anything was a professional
league to call their own.
</P>
<P>
   Their wish may have been answered Tuesday, when a consortium of
cable television companies announced plans for an eight-team league
to begin play in April 2001. The Women's United Soccer Association
would be the only professional full-time women's soccer league in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The league, which would offer a base salary of $40,000, must
still be approved by the USSF, the governing body of soccer in the
United States. But all 20 players on the '99 World Cup team have
agreed to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Christmas,'' U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the league's investors are Cox Enterprises Inc. and Cox
Communications Inc. The group is spearheaded by Discovery
Communications Inc., the parent company of the Discovery Channel
and the Travel Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors include Time Warner Cable, Comcast Corp. and
Amos B. Hostetter Jr., former chairman and CEO of Continental
Cablevision Inc. The group has committed $40 million to the league
over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's team played before packed houses during the
World Cup last summer, including 90,000 at the Rose Bowl for their
win over China in the final. That set a world attendance record for
a women's sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   The largely upscale suburban demographic _ ``soccer moms'' and
their families -- that made up the team's fan base has not been
lost on potential investors. Since the World Cup, there have been
at least three different groups trying to plan a women's pro
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enormous drawing power that they've been able to
generate,'' said John Hendricks, chairman and chief executive
officer of Discovery Communications. ``People realize the value
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is one of 15 markets under consideration for a team. The
two Cox companies would become primary investors in two teams,
according to Collen Brannon, a spokeswoman for Cox Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Like Major League Soccer _ a five-year-old men's professional
league _the WUSA would operate as a single entity. The league would
own all the teams, allocate players and handle player contracts.
Each team would hire its front office staff and coaches, handle
marketing and promotions and arrange its own local television
package.
</P>
<P>
   Each franchise would pay $5 million for local operating rights,
with anticipated operating costs of around $1.2 million per team
per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some good sponsorship and marketing opportunities
here,'' said Cox Communications spokeswoman Ellen East. ``Having a
product that has good community appeal is a good way for us to keep
our customers happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The WUSA plans to put a majority of its games on television via
its cable partners, but also is approaching broadcast and cable
networks, including NBC and ESPN, for a national television
package.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said the WUSA has an initial attendance projections of
6,500 per game, and would prefer to play in stadiums seating 15,000
to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   But while the women's World Cup was touted as a ``breakthrough''
event for women's soccer, skeptics wonder if the fans who got
excited about a one-time Olympic-style event will support a team on
a regular basis. Especially if it's not under the guise of a ``Team
USA'' concept that's easy to promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty ambitious number, 6,500,'' said Bobby
Glustrom, co-owner of the Atlanta Silverbacks men's professional
team, which last May sponsored an appearance involving the U.S.
women's team that drew 15,000. ``Nobody's been able to show the
size or the depth of the women's soccer market when you don't have
someone wearing the U.S. uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The WUSA proposal may get competition for sanctioning
consideration from the USSF, which has set no timetable for acting
on the proposal. Billionaire Phillip Anschutz, owner of the Los
Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League and an investor in
three MLS franchises, has been interested in a similar proposal. An
MLS source said late Tuesday that the league is leaving the door
open to formulate its own plan.
</P>
<P>
   But players have been adamant that they operate separately,
unlike the Women's National Basketball Association, which gets most
of its funding, marketing, front office support and a substantial
television package courtesy of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``These investors are committed to an independent league in
which the women's professional game is the priority,'' U.S. star
forward Mia Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time a women's league has has been tried. Two
years ago, a group called the National Soccer Alliance proposed a
league that was quickly nixed by the USSF because it would
interfere with preparations for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But the federation acknowledged that it had no opposition now. A
number of high-profile U.S. players probably will retire from
international competition following the 2000 Olympics, and a wave
of new stars is being groomed to succeed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support soccer in all its forms,'' USSF spokesman Jim
Moorhouse said. ``The excitement and enthusiasm of the Women's
World Cup set the tone for launching a league. The bid from the
WUSA has been done in a very professional manner.''

 &HT;    What's next for Ray Lewis?
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conditions of Ray Lewis' $1 million bond mean he will
probably show up for the Baltimore Ravens offseason conditioning
program in outstanding physical shape, as usual, but his
free-wheeling life off the field is sure to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to stop him from renting stretch limousines as
often as he wishes, but they'll have to drop him at his doorstep at
9 p.m. every night. Nightclubbing will be less attractive with a
total ban on alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The major strictures on the All-Pro linebacker are the curfew
and the ban on drinking, but there are others.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, charged with murder in the deaths of two men after a
Super Bowl party Jan. 31 in Buckhead, won't be allowed to visit
Orlando, where he has worked with a personal trainer the past two
years. Lewis' fiancee and two of his children also live in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The bond requires Lewis to stay in Maryland unless he is
traveling to Georgia for court appearances or to meet with his
lawyers. There is no prohibition against him bringing his trainer,
his fiancee and his children to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   While there appears to be no particular threat to Lewis'
off-season conditioning, the question of what the travel ban would
do to his season _ and his $27 million contract, which depends upon
his ability to play _ remains unclear. There is little chance
Lewis' case will come to trial before the NFL season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Sheriff's Sgt. Clarence Huber said Superior Court
Judge Doris Downs would give further instructions concerning the
stipulations today _ including how Lewis' curfew and abstention
would be monitored in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two years, Lewis didn't participate in the
Ravens' voluntary, 16-week offseason program, which begins March 6
at the team's complex in suburban Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He worked exclusively with his trainer in Orlando and only
occasionally traveled to Baltimore to be examined by Ravens
trainers. The team's first mandatory offseason requirement is a
minicamp on April 28-30, which opens about two weeks after the NFL
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything required of our players until the
mini-camp after the draft,'' said Kevin Byrne, the Ravens' vice
president for public relations. ``No decision (on whether Lewis
will participate) has been made at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a presumed innocence involved,'' Byrne said. ``I
assume with that presumed innocence Ray has the ability to earn a
living like he always has had. We will ask for guidance from his
attorney and, at some point, we'll consult with the league office.
Currently, since we don't have a function that requires Ray's
presence, we don't have to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens also have passing camps in May and June, one of which
is mandatory for all players. A camp for veteran players is
schedued June 12-15 and the team's training camp opens July 23 at
Western Maryland College in Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys, and every team has a handful of them,
that you don't worry about as far as conditioning,'' Byrne said.
``He's always come into training camp in terrific shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stipulations of the bond require Lewis to relinquish his
passport and avoid speaking with any of the witnesses who appeared
at his bond hearing _ except for members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   The total of the bond was $1,100,300.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Lewis is likely to have to return to Fulton
Superior Court in the near future is to enter a plea to the
charges. This is usually a matter of a few minutes and may be
followed by a private conference among Lewis, his attorneys,
prosecutors and the judge assigned to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely do murder cases work their way through various
hearings and motions to trial in less than about 10 months. Some
take years.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile cases such as Lewis' _ with appropriately
high-priced attorneys _ generally go before a jury in the least
amount of time.

 Gymboree's 2 Top Executives Resign  
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Amid hemorrhaging sales, Gymboree Corp.'s chief executive, Gary
White, and president, Melanie Cox, resigned under pressure
yesterday. The company's co-founder and chairman, Stuart Moldaw,
stepped in as CEO.
<P>
   ``The disappointing sales and the loss in our fourth quarter
require us to take action in an effort to return Gymboree to its
pre-eminent position as the quality brand for children,'' Moldaw
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Moldaw declined to be interviewed yesterday. A spokeswoman for
the troubled children's wear retailer, which is headquartered in
Burlingame, said Moldaw, who is 73, will manage the company for the
foreseeable future and is not looking for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not plan to close any of its 605 locations, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's duties will be handled by Lisa Harper, Gymboree's senior
vice president for merchandising and design. Harper is is taking on
the additional title of general merchandise manager.
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree characterized White's and Cox's departures as
resignations, but company sources said they were asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Moldaw co-founded Gymboree in the early 1980s when he was
general partner of U.S. Venture Partners. He has been Gymboree's
chairman through most of the 1990s and also served as chief
executive of Ross Stores in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains one of the country's best-known children's wear
brands, Gymboree has suffered from poor sales since 1995. It has
been unable to create fashion lines that most parents like.
</P>
<P>
   Sales plummeted 26 percent in the fourth quarter to $140.3
million while sales at stores open at least a year fell an
extraordinary 32 percent. Fourth-quarter inventories were 50
percent lower than in the comparable quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a February 3 announcement, White said he expected
fourth-quarter earnings to range between 16 and 19 cents, but
yesterday's announcement described the results as a loss. No
specifics were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was recruited last year from the hip teen retailer Urban
Outfitters to replace Gymboree's trademark colorful clothing with
apparel that reflects current fashion trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their strategy was correct, but the timing was
difficult,'' said Helen Bulwik, director of global retail with
Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that after Cox joined the company, there was not
enough lead time to redesign the line and source merchandise for
the crucial fourth quarter. Plus, the launch of a new concept for
pre-teens, Zutopia, ``put a lot of strain on the organization,''
Bulwik added.
</P>
<P>
   White joined Gymboree in February 1997, replacing chief
executive officer Nancy Pedot. White had been Gymboree's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its children's stores, Gymboree operates 19
Zutopias and 420 franchised educational play centers.

 Internet Is Stealing Social Life of America  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   People who use the Internet regularly say their online hours
increasingly reduce the amount of time they spend with family,
friends and _ most of all _ the television.
</P>
<P>
   A Stanford study of connected households across the United
States also showed that while a quarter of employed Net users take
more work home from the office, they don't necessarily spend less
time in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommuting doesn't happen,'' said Lutz Erbring, a professor
from the Free University of Berlin, who conducted the study with
Stanford Professor Norman Nie. ``People do work more at home, which
you would expect, but they still work just as much at the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people surveyed _ about two thirds _ spend fewer than five
hours each week connected to the Internet, and they say that use
hasn't changed their lives much. It's the other third, who log on
for five hours a week or more, who report that the Net takes big
bites out of their social lives, TV watching and newspaper reading.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford billed the study as the first to look at the social
consequences of Internet use. Researchers provided more than 4,000
adults in 2,689 households across the United States with Internet
appliances and free Net access so they could answer the survey
questions electronically. Of those families, 55 percent already had
Internet access, and those households provided the bulk of the
survey's data. The 45 percent who were new to the Internet were
surveyed to show how quickly Net use began to affect peoples'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Erbring said that every hour spent online typically reduces
television viewing by an hour, and even people who are new to the
Internet start watching less television almost immediately. By
contrast, new users are usually slower to curtail their newspaper
reading time.
</P>
<P>
   While the research firm Dataquest recently reported that 27
million adults watch television and use the Internet at the same
time, Erbring and Nie believe that browsing the Internet requires
too much attention to truly share users' time with television.
</P>
<P>
   Even if people can view television programming on a computer
screen while simultaneously accessing the Internet, ``there will be
a real competition for time,'' Erbring said.
</P>
<P>
   Erbring pointed to the AOL-Time Warner merger as an example of
TV companies ``preparing for the future'' in light of this
competition.
</P>
<P>
   While television can be a background to conversation with other
human beings, ``Internet use does not mix well with social
intercourse in face-to-face contact,'' Erbring noted.

SENIOR BANK OF NEW YORK OFFICIAL TOOK BRIBE, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Justice Department has evidence that a senior
Bank of New York official accepted a bribe from the
husband-and-wife team implicated in the money laundering
investigation at the bank, law enforcement officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the identity of the bank official who is believed to have
received the bribe could not be determined, those involved in the
investigation said it was someone senior to Lucy Edwards, a former
Bank of New York vice president who, along with her husband, Peter
Berlin, are expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to money laundering
charges in federal court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, through his company, Benex International, controlled
several accounts at the bank that moved billions of dollars from
Russia between 1996 and last year.
</P>
<P>
   If one of Edwards' superiors accepted a bribe to facilitate the
illegal transfer of money, it could expose the Bank of New York to
possible criminal charges in the investigation, according to
experts in banking law.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Edwards, who worked in the bank's Eastern European
division, has implicated one of her superiors in the matter but
federal prosecutors believe that she and her husband have
information that may implicate others at the bank, according to
individuals involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That is a major reason why federal authorities pushed to bring
the couple back to the United States and pressured them to
cooperate with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   During congressional testimony in September, the chairman and
chief executive of the bank, Thomas A. Renyi, said that allowing
the accounts to remain open was a ``lapse on the part of the
bank.'' But an investigator said on Tuesday that the couple might
provide evidence that the accounts remained open not because of a
management error, but because some bank employees had chosen
consciously to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin's lawyer, T. Barry Kingham, did not return
phone calls on Tuesday seeking comment. The FBI and the U.S.
Attorney's office in Manhattan also declined to comment, as did the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official said on Tuesday that no agreement had been
reached with Edwards and Berlin on the sentence they would face for
a guilty plea. Their sentence will be determined by the level of
cooperation they provide to federal investigators, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   If federal authorities believe that the senior management of any
company had knowledge of possible malfeasance, they typically try
to pressure lower-level targets of an investigation to provide
testimony or evidence against their superiors. Those involved in
the investigation at the Bank of New York said on Tuesday that that
was the strategy being used in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Berlin arrived in New York on Tuesday from London,
where they have lived since 1996. Previously, the couple had lived
in New Jersey. Upon their arrival, Edwards and Berlin were
immediately taken into custody by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The money laundering charges against them relate to about $8
million in their personal accounts, of which about $1 million is
believed to be transaction fees they earned from the Benex
operation, according to people with direct knowledge of the charges
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers have argued during plea negotiations
with Edwards and Berlin that the couple violated federal money
laundering laws when they moved those fees from their accounts at
the Bank of New York to personal accounts overseas, a lawyer close
to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is generally defined as the practice of taking
illegally obtained gains and passing them through a series of bank
transactions so they appear as legitimate profits. Under U.S. law,
it is a crime only if the money is earned from illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   While the money laundering charges do not encompass the vast
sums of money that moved through Benex _ about $7 billion __
federal officials were able to use the charge to extradite the
couple from Britain. The couple are not being charged with
laundering criminal proceeds for others, even though federal law
enforcement officials said on Tuesday that they believe that at
least some of the money that moved through the bank was funds
earned from illicit activities.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally believed, however, that the majority of the
money that flowed through the Benex accounts represented money
leaving Russia to avoid taxes or duties there.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the United States had been
hampered in its investigation against Edwards and Berlin because of
a lack of cooperation from Russian authorities. Teams of FBI agents
and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's office have recently spent
weeks in Russia attempting to find viable working arrangements with
their Russian counterparts _ so far, to no avail.

 Intel Shows Off New Processor  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Intel yesterday fleshed out its plans for new chips it will release
later this year, including its first fundamentally new processor
design for desktop PCs since 1994.
<P>
   Before some 3,000 attendees at the Intel Developers Forum here,
company executives demonstrated the new chip, code-named
Willamette, running at 1.5 gigahertz, or 1,500 megahertz _ almost
twice as fast as today's fastest Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Another new Intel chip, called the Itanium, is also due this
fall, but it is designed primarily for network servers and high-end
technical workstations, and new software will be required to take
full advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Willamette, by contrast, is intended for standard PCs and will
speed up existing Windows programs. It also has some new features
that will work only in programs optimized for it.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Willamette will appear in high-performance PCs,
priced at $2,500 and up, but over the following 18 months, it will
gradually move down to systems priced as low as $1,000, according
to company officials. During that period, Intel will continue to
offer its Pentium III in mid-range desktop systems and in notebooks
and Celeron chips for low-priced PCs.
</P>
<P>
   A new Celeron designed specifically for systems priced around
$600 is also due this fall. To help PC-makers achieve that price,
the chip will have a graphics accelerator and memory controller
built in; most PCs now need separate chips for those functions. The
new Celeron is code-named Timna, after a national park in Israel,
where it was developed.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Yu, senior vice president in charge of Intel's
microprocessor products group, said the company expects to ship
``hundreds of thousands'' of Willamette chips before the end of the
year and millions next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company hasn't yet given Willamette a marketing moniker, but
company officials said it will likely carry the Pentium name,
combined with something to indicate that it represents a new
``microarchitecture,'' or core design. The Pentium III and the
Celeron, like the earlier Pentium II, are all based on a
microarchitecture first introduced with the Pentium Pro more than
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allowing higher clock speeds than previous
members of the Pentium family, Willamette will incorporate several
new instructions programmers can use to accelerate certain tasks.
It will also be able to fetch data from the PC's memory at a speed
of 400 megahertz, compared with 66, 100 or 133 megahertz in most
PCs today.
</P>
<P>
   The faster chip will help Intel in its battle for high-end PC
market leadership against Advanced Micro Devices and its Athlon
chip. AMD last week demonstrated an Athlon system running at 1.1
gigahertz and promises further speed increases and other
enhancements later this year.
</P>
<P>
   To address the argument that few users actually require the
level of performance Willamette will deliver, Pat Gelsinger, vice
president and general manager of Intel's desktop products group,
showed benchmarks demonstrating that the faster chips significantly
reduce the time PCs take to display complex Web pages, even over a
56K modem. He also noted that faster chips make it possible to
encrypt data on the fly to enhance security.
</P>
<P>
   Intel also announced new initiatives, in collaboration with
other industry leaders, to define future standards for faster disk
drives and graphics cards. It staged the first public demonstration
of version 2.0 of the Universal Serial Bus, a channel for adding
external peripherals to PCs. The new version will move data 40
times faster than current USB ports, making it suitable for use
with fast hard drives, high-resolution scanners and other devices
that move more data than USB can now handle.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Intel said it will wind down its efforts to assist
Sun Microsystems in porting Solaris, Sun's version of the Unix
operating system, to Intel's chips. Paul Otellini, senior vice
president of the Intel Architecture Business Group, charged that
Sun has ``for years displayed a very consistent pattern'' of making
the software run better on its own Sparc chips than on Intel's.
</P>
<P>
   He said Intel will honor contracts that require it to support
Sun through the introduction of the Itanium chip, but ``unless
something changes drastically, I see no reason to engage again in a
relationship that benefits them and no one else.''

 _ SF CHRON   Incubators Hatching on the Web 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: What is a good source for information about high-tech

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It might come down to the ``Big Easy'' vs. the
Tiger again at the Nissan Open, at least if Ernie Els has his way.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old South African with the oh-so-easy swing will be
defending his title this week at Riviera Country Club and says he
looks forward to another head-to-head competition with Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at the Nissan, Els beat Woods by two strokes. But at
their most recent meeting _ the Mercedes Championship in Hawaii
last month _ Tiger prevailed after a heart-pounding, two-hole
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having so much fun. You have two great players -_I don't
want to lose, he doesn't want to lose. Neither of us was going to
give in.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Woods' first win of this year and his fifth in a row.
After winning at Pebble Beach and then losing last week at Torrey
Pines, Tiger could begin a new streak at Riviera. But he'll have to
get past a field headed by Els, whose play in the Mercedes could
have ended Woods' streak at four if it were not for a few missed
short putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I got him,'' Woods said after prevailing with an
eagle-birdie-birdie finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning has become a habit for him,'' said Els, who matched
Woods' eagle on the 72nd regulation hole in Hawaii to set up their
playoff. ``Tiger has built himself up physically . . . and his
mental game is so good he can recover from a bogey with a birdie. I
still have a ways to go to reach that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Els, who admittedly feels a ``little like the grandfather''
among youngsters such as Sergio Garcia, Woods and David Duval,
became a first-time father last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the course, I didn't have the success I wanted (in 1999)
because I don't think I was all that focused,'' Els said. ``A lot
of things were happening in my life. Being a first-time dad brought
a lot of changes. We were still getting our house ready in England,
getting used to this little kid, not getting too much sleep. It's a
lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samantha is almost 8 months old now. I think I will be more
focused this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Els says he plans to play in 20 PGA Tour events this year, and
that requires a lot of flying back and forth between Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gotten to where I can pretty much sleep while I'm
standing,'' Els said. ``I try to sleep as much as I can. There's
nothing you can do about it. All you can do is set your mind to it
and do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he's not sleeping, he says he wants to ``re-establish''
himself on the tour with a fresh start in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get into contention more often on Sundays,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if he's in contention this Sunday at Riviera, the ``Big
Easy'' would like the competition to include Tiger Woods.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Antique Dealers Pursue Artifacts With Passion  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
When Dave DeRoche was a child, his favorite bedtime story was about
the Lost Dutchman gold mine, not Winnie the Pooh.
<P>
   ``I always dreamed of finding treasure,'' he said at last
weekend's annual Tribal, Folk &AMP; Textile Arts Show at San
Francisco's Fort Mason Center, where he was selling African and
other tribal art.
</P>
<P>
   Trolling for treasure _ whether in a gallery, at the flea market
or on eBay _ is captivating more and more Americans. As a sign of
the times, ``Antiques Roadshow'' has become the top-rated public
broadcasting show, with almost 14 million viewers each week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a big difference between dabbling in art and
collectibles and making a living at it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 75 dealers at the show were born into the trade. A
few others inherited a fortune, or made it themselves, and went
into the art business because they enjoyed the lifestyle and didn't
need to worry about money.
</P>
<P>
   But most dealers at the Fort Mason show and elsewhere discovered
a passion for Asian armor, Indian baskets, pre-Columbian statues,
Persian carpets and all sorts of other artifacts, and pursued them
without a financial safety net.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Vicki Shiba grew up near San Jose, got a teaching
credential at the University of California at Berkeley and taught
in San Francisco grammar schools for three years. Then she took a
leave of absence to spend three years on an odyssey to Indonesia,
India, Nepal and other Asian countries. There she studied and
collected Tibetan and Nepalese carpets, religious paintings called
thangkas, bronzes and other arts.
</P>
<P>
   After her return to the Bay Area, she continued to collect and
travel but earned a living in public relations for the Japan
Cultural and Trade Center, marketing greeting cards and other jobs.
Finally, about a decade ago, Shiba decided to become a full-time
dealer, selling out of her Mill Valley home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business can be difficult; you have to ride the waves,'' she
said. ``There's more demand for fine objects, but it's not easy to
find them, and there are more dealers everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiba relies on long friendships and good sources overseas to
find rare objects. For example, at the Fort Mason show, she was
selling an 18th century miniature Tibetan thangka painting of the
wrathful deity Palden Lhamo that she bought from a trusted source
``in the field.'' The asking price: $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shiba enjoys researching the pieces she finds as much as the
hunt for them. That's fortunate, because buying art can be a
gamble. ``You have to trust your eye and vision,'' she said. ``But
if you make a couple of mistakes, you might be finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting fooled by a reproduction or making a wrong assessment on
age and quality can hurt more than a dealer's pocketbook. It can
tarnish a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   DeRoche, of San Francisco's Gallery DeRoche, deals in both
pre-Columbian and African tribal arts, two areas he acknowledges
are rife with fakes.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly impossible to prove an item's provenance, or
ownership history. That's one reason DeRoche gets excited about a
19th century Nigerian carved pipe made by the Ovimbundu tribe of
Angola that he bought as part of a 42-piece collection. It was part
of the Dunhill pipe museum during World War II, which is one of the
reasons DeRoche put a $25,000 price tag on the rare piece.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to quit jobs or leave home hits art entrepreneurs at
different times.
</P>
<P>
   DeRoche knew it was time to pursue his passion for antiquities
when he was an editor for Annual Reviews in Palo Alto about 20
years ago. ``I would be proofreading a microbiology text and have
trouble staying awake,'' he recalled. ``My body was telling me to
do something more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Spratt, a dealer in American Indian crafts who grew up on a
farm outside Boise, Idaho, sought wanted  &LR; a change of scenery after
he graduated from high school. ``I wanted to get away from milking
cows,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After studying creative writing and comparative cultures, he
worked at the Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction house for three
years before going into business, first selling Persian rugs from a
store in Berkeley and then specializing in American Indian crafts. &LR; 
Americana. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Foraging for collectibles can be a tenuous living. ``It
depends on what you come across,'' said Spratt, who sells at a
handful of shows each year in San Francisco; Los Angeles; Santa Fe,
N.M.; and New York. Mostly, though, he sells by appointment from
his home in Rutherford in the Napa Valley. Some of his objects are
pricey, such as an 1880s Western Apache 18-inch basket that sells
for $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   But many dealers find it increasingly difficult hard  &LR; to uncover
treasures, especially at a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way it was 30 years ago when rug dealer James
Blackmon got out of the draft during the Vietnam War war  &LR; by
pretending to be crazy. He traveled to Afghanistan, where he got
hooked on tribal carpets. When he returned to the Bay Area,
Blackmon made a modest living restoring carpets before discovering
he could make more buying and selling old carpets than repairing
them.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmon, who sells by appointment from his San Francisco
gallery,says his biggest problem is finding good material. ``It's
hard to find any overlooked area,'' he said. ``Turkmenistan or
Uzbekistan might open up for a year or two, but then it dries up.''
</P>
<P>
   He also observed observes  &LR; that with TV shows on collecting,
online auctions and other sources of information, ``everyone is
more sophisticated and collectors often view dealers as
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Blackmon, Roger Cavanna went into the carpet business by
accident rather than design.
</P>
<P>
   After studying architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
in New York, Cavanna joined the Peace Corps in 1966 in Iran, in
1966  &LR; where he bought his first Qashqai tribal rug. He got some
money from his family and brought back some carpets for them and
himself, and then paid for his graduate school by selling a rug
every three months or so.
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing a career as an architect, Cavanna fell into the
rug business full time. After the 1978 revolution in Iran, a Tehran
rug dealer, who was Cavanna's friend, sent him 14 bales of rugs to
get some of his money out of the country. Cavanna paid $33,000 in
COD shipping charges and said, ``the next thing I knew, I was in
the rug business.''
</P>
<P>
   He sold more than $1.2 million worth of his friend's carpets
during the next two years and lived nicely off the commissions.
Now, Cavanna has a gallery, Carpets of the Inner Circle, on Jackson
Square in San Francisco. ``I love it,'' said Cavanna, who works
with his son. ``I'm surrounded by textile art that reflects
cultures that have pretty much disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Murray of Mill Valley was not initially interested in
art, either. After attending Redwood High School in Marin with
Robin Robbin  &LR; Williams and majoring in psychology and anthropology
at UC U.C.  &LR; Berkeley, he planned to go med school. But those plans
were shelved after he bought an old rug at the former Marin City
flea market, got interested in textiles and then traveled to Asia
for five months in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has made a living collecting and selling selling
 &LR; textiles and archaic sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge is power,'' he said at his booth at Fort Mason,
surrounded by ancient carved stone megaliths from Sumba and other
lands. ``Success is when you are able to buy something from someone
who doesn't understand it as well as you do, and sell it to someone
who knows it at least as well as you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite finds was a mid-17th century Indian Mogul
textile he bought in Indonesia, where it was not widely recognized
or appreciated. He sold it for $25,000 to an Asian museum.
</P>
<P>
   Like other dealers, Murray is not keen on divulging details of
where he finds treasures or what he pays for them.
</P>
<P>
   It's an up-and-down lifestyle. Murray goes into debt buying
objects and then sells one or two and is flush with cash for a
time. ``I've given up a lot for this,'' Murray said. ``I'm not
married. I don't have kids. I live in an apartment, but it's an
interesting life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for an IRA or 401(k) plan, forget it. ``I have a textile
collection of about 500 pieces,'' he said. ``That's my pension
fund.''

   Study Says the Internet Increases Social Isolation
</P>
<P>
   The nation's obsession with the Internet is causing many
Americans to spend less time with friends and family, less time
shopping in stores and more time working at home after hours,
according to one of the first large-scale surveys of the societal
impact of the Internet. The report raises the specter of an
atomized world without human contact or emotion. That conclusion
may prove controversial because some online enthusiasts say the
Internet has fostered alternative electronic relationships that may
replace or enhance face-to-face family and social connections.

BCE OF CANADA OFFERS $6.7 BILLION TO BUY THE REST OF TELEGLOBE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada's largest telecommunications company, BCE Inc.,
took a big step Tuesday toward its goal of expanding globally with
a $6.7 billion stock deal to buy the 77 percent of Teleglobe Inc.
that it does not already own and invest in Teleglobe's network
linking 160 cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second big strategic move for BCE in the last three
weeks. Late in January, the company said it would spin off most of
a 39 percent interest in Nortel Networks, the huge equipment
manufacturer with which it was affiliated. BCE said that decision
would allow both companies to more easily pursue their own growth
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Teleglobe, the world's third-largest carrier of voice telephone
traffic, is based in Montreal, as is BCE.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was halted in the shares of BCE and Teleglobe late in
Tuesday's session on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the offer was
announced after the market had closed. BCE's shares fell 75 cents
to 173.25 Canadian dollars, or $118.92, before the halt. Teleglobe
rose 3.5 percent to 47.55 Canadian dollars, or $32.64.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Claude Monty, president and chief executive of BCE, said
fully owning Teleglobe would give BCE and its subsidiaries _
including Bell Canada, the country's largest phone company _ a
strong international focus. He said BCE would support Teleglobe's
$5 billion effort to span the globe with fiber optic and satellite
connections. A poor financial performance by Teleglobe because of
international competition has threatened the project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Monty has become chairman of
Teleglobe, replacing Charles Sirois, who had been chairman and
chief executive. Sirois has agreed to exchange his 8 percent
interest in Teleglobe for BCE shares, as has another founder, Kenny
Troutt, who owns 18 percent. Two presidents of Teleglobe divisions,
Paolo Guidi and Christina Gold, have been named co-chief executives
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the offer for Teleglobe will be based on BCE's
share price after the distribution of Nortel shares to BCE
shareholders. The offer puts an assumed value of $36.90 on BCE
shares and $33.41 on Teleglobe shares. If BCE shares are trading
below $34 when the deal is completed, the exchange ratio will be
0.97 BCE share for every Teleglobe share. If BCE is trading above
$39, the ratio will be 0.85.

2 OFFICERS SAY THEY THOUGHT DIALLO HAD GUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The third and fourth police officers who shot at
Amadou Diallo testified Tuesday that they thought Diallo had a gun,
backing up their two partners, who testified Monday that they
feared for their lives when they killed Diallo a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Kenneth Boss, who fired 5 shots, and Officer Richard
Murphy, who fired 4, are charged with Diallo's murder, along with
Officers Sean Carroll and Edward McMellon, who each fired 16 shots.
Diallo was hit by 19 of 41 police bullets as he stood, unarmed, in
the vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the courtroom was markedly less emotional Tuesday
than on Monday, when Carroll broke into sobs several times on the
witness stand and McMellon told the jury how he had emptied his gun
into Diallo, a Guinean immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of cross-examination Tuesday, one prosecution theme
had emerged. Don Levin, of the Bronx district attorney's office,
asked each officer if he had considered, in approaching Diallo,
whether he might not have understood English, whether he might have
been deaf or whether he might have backed away because he was
afraid of the officers, who were not in uniform. Each said he had
not, which could help the prosecution establish recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   For the defense lawyers, the testimony of the final two officers
Tuesday was meant to continue their plan to humanize their clients
in the eyes of the jury. Boss, 28 and single, told the jury he grew
up in Suffolk County, did not go to college and lives with his
father. He joined the carpenters' union after high school and
entered the police academy in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On the night Diallo was shot, Boss was driving the unmarked
police car, and remained in the car as Carroll and McMellon
approached Diallo, who was standing on the stoop of his building.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached Diallo, Boss said, one of the officers said,
`` `Police. Can I have a word?''' and then repeated the question.
Diallo, he said, ``turned abruptly and darted back into the
vestibule.''
</P>
<P>
   Boss said he jumped from the car, heard loud voices, then
shooting. McMellon, he said, came flying backward out of the
vestibule, fell down the stairs, and from the ground, continued
firing into the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was crouching in the vestibule with his arm extended, he
said. On that point, his testimony differed from Carroll's and
McMellon's, who had said Diallo remained standing throughout the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Boss said he fired five shots at Diallo because he thought
Diallo had a gun. But when he ultimately saw that he was holding a
wallet, he said, ``I think I was going into shock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the vestibule and I didn't know where I was,'' he said.
``I didn't know what street I was on.'' He ran to the corner to
read a street sign, he said, then radioed for help, asking for a
``bus and a boss,'' meaning an ambulance and a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you made that call, what were you feeling?'' Boss'
lawyer, Steven Brounstein asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destroyed,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Richard Murphy, who fired four shots, is 27, married and
has a 14-month-old son. He joined the Police Department in 1994. He
was behind Carroll and McMellon when he heard gunfire and saw
McMellon fall.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking McMellon had been shot, he backed away, and then saw
Carroll ``in a panicked state, scrambling down the stairs and
shooting.'' McMellon, on his back at the bottom of the stairs,
continued firing, too, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Murphy saw Diallo, he said. ``I seen a gun in his hand,''
he said. ``I had this empty feeling, I'm gonna be hit, I'm gonna be
shot. I pulled my trigger and I jumped out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph C. Teresi ruled Tuesday on a motion by the
prosecution to preclude one of the defense experts, James Fyfe,
from testifying. The judge said that Fyfe, an expert on police
shootings who is a criminologist at Temple University and a former
New York City police lieutenant, would be allowed to testify on
specific issues like the evaluation of a suspect's movements, but
not on whether he believed the officers had acted reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   The case could go to the jury by early next week.

RAINWATER INVESTMENT SEEN AS A CAUSE OF HOSPITAL CHAIN'S FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ga., N.H., Ill., Md., Wis., Ala.)  (SUBS 8th and 9th grafs to give name of Rainwater's trust earlier
and provide other details) 
 (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's largest chain of psychiatric hospitals lies in
tatters. More than half of the 90 hospitals and treatment centers
operated by Charter Behavioral Health Systems will soon be closed
and the company is expected to announce as early as Wednesday that
it is seeking bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, officials of a real estate investment trust
headed by Richard E. Rainwater, a financier based in Texas,
announced a $400 million investment that they said would breathe
new life into Charter Behavioral. But the deal, rather than
revitalizing the chain, contributed to its collapse, undermining
patient care in the process, according to many former Charter
Behavioral officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 plan saddled Charter Behavioral, a unit of Magellan
Health Services Inc., with some $125 million in franchise fees and
rapidly escalating rents. The chain's former chief executive said
he warned that the costs would cause financial chaos. Those
pressures, coupled with industry-wide insurance cutbacks, were soon
felt in psychiatric wards, former company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital directors and employees, overworked and faced with
repeated salary freezes, quit. Wards were understaffed, federal and
state reports show. Training programs were eliminated, former
company officials said. Ripped chairs and broken walls were not
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like they were strip-mining this place,'' said Dr.
Hashim Hafez, medical director at a unit in Nashua, N.H., until he
quit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral, which once had units in 27 states for more
than 8,000 patients, many of them children, had a troubled past.
But after 1997, patient care failed even at well-run hospitals,
former executives and regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter was never a great company,'' said Cindy Musikantow,
who once ran a treatment center for adolescents that the company
managed in Naperville, Ill., a Chicago suburb. ``But it
disintegrated to the degree that decisions were being made without
regard for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a complex one that was intended to benefit both
Rainwater's real estate trust, the Crescent Real Estate Equities
Co., and Magellan Health. Under the plan, the trust received income
from lease payments and Magellan received franchise fees. In
addition, Rainwater, as the largest shareholder in Magellan Health
at the time, stood to profit because the sale of the ailing chain
raised Magellan's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health's top executive also got a large bonus,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Additionally, the plan enabled Magellan, the nation's largest
behavioral health company, to leave the hospital business for
managed health care, a more lucrative field.
</P>
<P>
   The deal split ownership of Charter Behavioral between Magellan
Health and an affiliate of Rainwater's real estate trust. The
psychiatric chain's buildings were sold to the trust, which leased
them back at a healthy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rainwater, a former business associate of the Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush, and Mac Crawford, the chief
executive of Magellan Health during the deal, declined to be
interviewed. In written responses, their spokesmen said that
Charter Behavioral's financial woes were caused by insurance
cutbacks, not by the 1997 plan. They said that patient care was not
affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we had falling resources,'' said Dr. Gary M. Henschen,
chief medical officer of Charter Behavioral, which is based in
Alpharetta, Ga. ``But we have done the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 Rainwater and his wife, Darla Moore, paid $69.7
million for a 12.3 percent stake in Magellan Health. The following
year, he approached Crawford of Magellan Health about a plan under
which Magellan would sell Charter Behavioral's buildings to
Rainwater's publicly-traded trust, Crescent Real Estate Equities
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that operate nursing homes had engaged in similar
``lease buy-backs'' to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 deal, Crescent Real Estate paid $400 million to
acquire a 50 percent stake in Charter Behavioral and buy its
buildings. (Because federal tax laws bar real estate investment
trusts, or REITs, from operating companies, Rainwater and his
associates formed a publicly-traded company, Crescent Operating
Inc., to hold the 50 percent stake.).
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Charter Behavioral was required to pay Crescent
Real Estate $41.5 million in rent, a return of about 11
percent.Gerald Haddock, a Crescent executive, described the lease
returns as ``exceptional.'' The rent, which took precedence over
franchise fees to Magellan Health, escalated 5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health, which is based in Columbia, Md., retained a 50
percent stake in Charter Behavioral, which was to pay it $81
million annually in franchise fees. Magellan, which used cash from
the sale to finance managed care acquisitions, said those payments
could decline if industry-wide insurance cuts continued.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts applauded the plan. But John Lutzius, an analyst
with Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, Ca., said the new
payments left Charter Behavioral with little cash to weather any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the franchise fees and the rent, Magellan and Crescent
were effectively sweeping all the cash flow from Charter,'' said
Lutzius.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater's bet on the psychiatric industry proved to be wrong.
In 1997 some within Charter Behavioral had sounded warnings about
the deal's consequences for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Two former top Charter Behavioral executives said in separate
interviews that the chain's top executive told Crawford of Magellan
Health that the franchise fee and rent payments would financially
devastate the psychiatric hospitals. Not long after the deal
closed, that executive, John M. DeStefanis, resigned, those former
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John went nose-to-nose with them and that's why he was forced
out of the company,'' said one former executive who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that account, DeStefanis confirmed it but declined
further comment, citing a confidentiality agreement. In a
statement, Crawford disputed this version of events, saying that
DeStefanis supported the deal. DeStefanis' departure was unrelated
to the deal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health officials declined to comment on discussions
with DeStefanis. ``In the course of negotiating any transaction,
differing viewpoints are always expressed, and, in a good
organization, are even encouraged,'' the company said in a
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Health executives said the deal would benefit Charter
Behavioral. Its top official also profited from it. Crawford, whose
salary in fiscal 1996 was $712,500, received a $2.48 million bonus
for closing the deal, according to Magellan Health's 1997 proxy
statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Crawford described his cash payment as a
``retention bonus.'' One company director, A.D. Frazier Jr., said
he supported the payment to Crawford because the 1997 deal moved
Magellan Health toward managed care and away from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   (Moore, who declined to be interviewed, did not participate in
board decisions involving Charter Behavioral because of holdings in
her husband's trust.)
</P>
<P>
   A month after the deal closed in June 1997, the federal
government further cut hospital reimbursements. That December,
Magellan Health told shareholders in its annual report that the
move would reduce the $81 million due in franchise fees from
Charter Behavioral in fiscal 1998 by about $10 to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   DeStefanis' projections, however, proved far more accurate.
Charter Behavioral managed to pay only $32 million in fees in
fiscal 1998. That January, seven months after the deal and 45 days
after Magellan Health issued its annual report, the chain made its
last franchise payment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Charter Behavioral had a troubled record of patient
care, including settlements of government charges involving
fraudulent billing. Regulators said, however, that some units
provided good care.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Dr. Ronald Davidson, a hospital consultant for
the state of Illinois, declared that he would not hesitate to use a
company center in Brown Deer, Wis. for his own child.
</P>
<P>
   But by early 1998, conditions there and at other well-run units
worsened as the weakening chain imposed repeated salary freezes,
staff cutbacks and other cost-cutting measures, said former
executives, including Musikantow, the former head of the
Chicago-area unit.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashua, N.H., the chain's flagship hospital, resources shrank
and staff levels fell, said Dr. Philip Santora, a former associate
medical director at the unit. When experienced nurses and
therapists quit, fresh graduates replaced them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999 reports, federal and New Hampshire state
regulators found unsupervised children engaging in sex or hurting
themselves at the Nashua unit. Wards were persistently
understaffed. Suicide attempts were not recorded and children were
injured when improperly restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Santora, who quit in August, said that while insurance cutbacks
played a role, the 1997 deal resulted in a pattern of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can chip away and chip away and sooner or later you reach
a critical mass and a point of no return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As its hospitals veered out of control, Charter Behavioral's
governing board, which was comprised of two executives from
Magellan Health and two associates of Rainwater, had little
response.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clarissa Marques, Magellan Health's chief clinical officer,
joined the board in August 1998 and found that it had never
received or asked for patient care reports. She said that in 1998
it did not meet until late October.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Goff, one of Rainwater's closest associates, who headed
the board then, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, Crawford left Magellan Health to become chief
executive of Caremark Rx. of Birmingham, Ala.. About that time, in
an SEC filing, Crescent Operating acknowledged that the chain's
operating losses were growing because of insurance cutbacks and the
rents and fees required by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, Goff resigned from its board. A month later,
in an SEC filing, the chain's accountants questioned its ability to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the television news magazine ``60 Minutes II''
broadcast the results of an undercover investigation at several
Charter Behavioral units. Secretly recorded footage showed
ill-trained employees crudely restraining teen-agers and filling in
medical records for patients who apparently had not been examined.
</P>
<P>
   Several company hospitals were already under Government
scrutiny. After the broadcast, federal officials announced a broad
investigation of Charter Behavioral for Medicaid fraud and patient
abuse. Magellan Health is also part of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation involves activities both before and after the
1997 deal and is not focused on its financial aspects. (There is
also a federal investigation into billing fraud at Columbia/HCA, a
hospital chain that Rainwater helped found. Rainwater has not been
accused of any wrongdoing.)
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to improve patient care, Charter Behavioral hired outside
consultants. Regulators shut some units and the company closed
others.
</P>
<P>
   By last August, Charter Behavioral could no longer make lease
payments. The next month, Magellan Health transferred the bulk of
its remaining stake in Charter to Crescent Operating. Magellan and
Charter agreed to indemnify each other in the face of the
government investigations. In December, Charter said it would
reorganize and sell some 50 units.Magellan Health officials said
Tuesday that the troubled chain could announce a bankruptcy filing
as early as Wednesday. Michael French, Charter Behavioral's chief
executive and associates of Rainwater said they believed that
following reorganization, Charter Behavioral would be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day at the New Hampshire facility, a sign on the
door instructed employees to turn in their keys during exit
interviews. The keys would not work anyway. The locks have been
changed. The last patient has been transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all fell apart so fast,'' said Hafez, the former medical
director. ``It was like the Kremlin. Everyone knew it was falling
apart. But when it fell apart, it fell apart so quickly because
there was no foundation.''

JUDGE TAKES FIRST STEP ON DAMAGES FOR REPORTER HELD IN BEIRUT

   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Tuesday took the first step toward
awarding damages in a lawsuit filed by a former reporter, Terry
Anderson, that seeks $100 million from the Iranian government for
the pain and suffering he experienced during nearly seven years as
a hostage in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of federal
District Court here coincided with efforts to persuade Congress to
pass laws allowing victims of terrorism and their families to
collect on judgments against states that sponsor terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran and other sponsors of terrorism must be held accountable
for supporting activities that kill, injure, torture and imprison
innocent persons,'' said Anderson, former chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. ``No government is above
the law when it violates basic human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was among 18 Americans taken hostage in Beirut in the
1980s. He was held the longest, spending 2,454 days _ more than six
and a half years _ in captivity before he was freed on Dec. 4,
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson opened the two-day hearing Tuesday by saying that the
government of Iran had not responded to the lawsuit and was in
default. Iran did not send a representative to the proceedings
despite being notified through diplomatic channels. A table that
had been set up for the defense remained empty throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last March under a 1996 law that allows legal
action against countries that the U.S. government accuses of
sponsoring terrorism, asserts that Anderson's kidnappers were
members of Hezbollah, or Party of God, a ``a politico-paramilitary
terrorist organization'' with ties to Iran. The suit also says that
Hezbollah received financing, training and direction from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law was designed to make terrorism expensive,'' Anderson
said in a break in proceedings. ``And we are going to make it
expensive for Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Republic of Iran and its Ministry of Information and
Security were named as defendants. The law that allows victims of
terrorism to sue foreign countries in U.S. courts requires the
State Department to list the country as a sponsor of terrorism.
Iran has been on the list since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's case follows others with similar intentions. In March
1998, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $247.5 million to the
family of Alisa M. Flatow of West Orange, N.J., who was studying at
a seminary in Jerusalem in 1995 when she was killed in a suicide
bus attack for which Islamic Jihad, with ties to Iran, claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, a federal court ordered Iran to pay $65 million
in damages for its role in the kidnappings of Joseph J. Cicippio,
Frank H. Reed and David P. Jacobsen, three Americans held with
Anderson in Lebanon. They have been unable to collect on the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a measure in October 1998 that called for the
State Department and the Department of Treasury to assist victims
of terrorism to locate money to settle judgments. The legislation,
however, contained a provision that permits the president to waive
implementation in the interest of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have voiced concern that the sanctity
of U.S. diplomatic property abroad, a right extended to all
diplomatic missions under international law, might be compromised
if private citizens here seized foreign government property under
such court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department on Tuesday, James P. Rubin, a department
spokesman, said Iran did not ``accept the jurisdiction or the
awards'' in Anderson's case, and that the State Department opposed
the ``attachment of diplomatic property'' to settle claims awarded
by a court.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
proposed legislation in 1999 to establish a system for tapping a
foreign government's frozen assets that could be used to settle
these claims and ease the administration's concern that diplomatic
property, like foreign embassies, would be among the assets
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``American citizens deserve the right to know that their
government stands behind them when acts of terrorism are committed
against their families,'' Mack said in October when he presented
the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Anderson, 52, and his wife, Madeleine Bassil,
wrote a book about the ordeal, ``Den of Lions.'' He now teaches
journalism at Ohio University and serves on the board of the
Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group that works for
press freedom around the world.

EDITORIAL: THE FIREFIGHT IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 17:
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of the pivotal South Carolina primary, Gov.
George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain are in more than a
scorched-earth battle for the Republican presidential nomination.
Recently it has also become clear that they offer competing
approaches to conducting and financing campaigns. Bush has tried to
get back the momentum he lost in New Hampshire by hammering at
McCain's record and proclaiming himself a ``reformer with
results.'' But it is McCain who has shaped the GOP contest so far
with his accessibility to voters and journalists, his demand for a
campaign finance overhaul and, most recently, the most aggressive
Republican appeal since Ronald Reagan for Democratic and
independent votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's desire for a share of the reformer label compelled him on
Tuesday to announce his own version of the campaign finance cleanup
advocated by McCain. But the Texas governor's proposal is seriously
flawed. It is designed to gain attention without really removing
special-interest money from politics. Like McCain, he would ban
unlimited ``soft money'' donations to political parties by unions
and corporations. But unlike McCain, he would let wealthy
individuals make contributions as big as they want, on the specious
ground that curbs on the size of individual donations are an
unconstitutional infringement of free speech. That has been an
untenable argument for at least the 25 years since such curbs were
enacted after the Watergate scandals. It also runs counter to the
Supreme Court's direction in its latest ruling upholding limits on
campaign donations to candidates. Far from reforming the system,
governor Bush's proposal is an attempt to confuse voters and
enhance the power of wealthy interests.
</P>
<P>
   The governor further weakened his proposal by including in it a
virulent anti-union measure known as ``paycheck protection.'' It
would allow union members to withhold the part of their dues used
for political activity. That idea is worth considering, but only if
accompanied by a proposal to let stockholders approve political
expenditures by corporations. To hold campaign reform hostage to
such a biased proposal would kill any chance of putting together
the necessary bipartisan majority in Congress, as Bush must know.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidates began their debate in Charleston on Tuesday
night, they found themselves locked in a junkyard campaign of
smears and attacks in the Lee Atwater tradition. McCain may be
slipping a bit in the polls after an onslaught of negative ads,
telephone calls (many of them under the phony pretext of polling
operations) and mailings. He has abandoned his own negative ads and
vows to maintain a positive approach. Bush's furiously negative
campaign reflects the widespread view that winning South Carolina
is vital to the survival of his candidacy. But it could hurt him
down the road by draining his campaign machine of money and sending
him back to donors who have already been heavily dunned.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign argues that it was McCain who first went
negative when he compared an ad run by the governor to the
techniques of Bill Clinton. Among Republicans, that is tantamount
to comparing your opponent to the Devil himself. McCain withdrew
that ad and called on Bush to withdraw all his negative ads. If
McCain can win without mud or push polls, he could elevate the
entire process for the rest of the year. He has also redefined the
nature of campaigning by subjecting himself to more questioning
from regular voters and from reporters on his campaign bus than any
leading presidential candidate in decades.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's accessibility is often written about as an attempt to
become popular with reporters. In fact, it has made McCain sharper
as a candidate and enabled him to get out in front of issues
instead of having to retreat to staff meetings for new material.
McCain's approach has forced Bush to abandon the royal trappings
and insularity provided by his big organization. Meanwhile, on the
Democratic side, both Al Gore and Bill Bradley have also been
subjecting themselves to free-swinging debates and questions from
voters. So far, the 2000 campaign has proved that candidates who
listen to voters instead of simply throwing poll-tested position
papers at them are doing better. The battle in South Carolina will
provide a stern test of that encouraging pattern.

 Terrence Rafferty is the critic at large for GQ magazine.  
 By TERRENCE RAFFERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe the oddest thing about Eric Mendelsohn's
likably odd debut feature, ``Judy Berlin,'' is that all the
characters live on Long Island and nobody seems to hate it _ not
even the title character (played by Edie Falco), who is about to
leave for ``the coast'' in search of fame and fortune as an
actress.
</P>
<P>
   This affectionate attitude might actually puzzle filmgoers who
have become used to seeing suburbia portrayed as a sick,
soul-destroying place, both in independent films like Todd
Solondz's ``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' (1996) and ``Happiness''
(1998) and in studio pictures like Sam Mendes' recent
awards-gatherer ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   I was puzzled for another reason. I grew up on Long Island, in
the blithe assumption that everybody hated it. That's a kid's
perspective, of course. When you're young, it's pretty much part of
your job to despise the place you live in _ or, rather, where your
parents live and you just sort of subsist, waiting for your real
life (elsewhere) to begin.
</P>
<P>
   And in those days, the '50s and the early '60s, Long Island had
a particularly unglamorous image. To the extent that it penetrated
the national consciousness at all, the area signified bland, tacky
middle-class conformity: when people heard ``Long Island,'' they
thought ``Levittown.'' (Which was just two towns to the east of me
along the Hempstead Turnpike.)
</P>
<P>
   This was, I now realize, unfair to the rich history of the area,
hinted at in the Native American names of some of its towns. Such
indispensable Americans as Theodore Roosevelt and Walt Whitman
lived happily there, once upon a time; and as recently as 75 years
ago, F. Scott Fitzgerald could plausibly use Long Island as the
locus of Jay Gatsby's dreams _ that green light at the end of the
dock came from somewhere around Great Neck.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island's terrible image was unfair to its postwar
residents, too: all the hard-working folks, like my parents, who
had found in the newly constructed suburban developments an
affordable respite from the rigors of ``the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But what do you know when you're young? You look around, and
what you see is a flat, dull landscape, its monotony occasionally
relieved by the bright red-and-green signage of a 7-Eleven store.
You listen, and what you hear are car horns, moms screaming for
their children to come home for dinner, and the ubiquitous drone of
lawnmowers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time you've entered restless adolescence, you may already
be thinking of Long Island exclusively in terms of cheap irony:
this, you tell yourself with what you imagine as a wry smile, is a
place that honors Walt Whitman by naming a shopping mall after him.
</P>
<P>
   For me _ a fanatical filmgoer from an early age _ the real proof
that Long Island was nowhere was that I never saw it in the movies.
It obviously wasn't important in the way New York, London, Paris
and Dodge City were. The lonely exception to the silver screen's
general embargo on images of Long Island was that sequence in
``North by Northwest'' in which the urbane Cary Grant was kidnapped
outside the Plaza Hotel and taken to a mansion on the North Shore,
where he would barely survive an attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
   There you go: Long Island, defined by my favorite filmmaker,
Alfred Hitchcock, as a place that practically kills Cary Grant. No
wonder James Bond, who went everywhere else in the world without
fear, never set a well-shod foot on Long Island _ not even the
Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   All this would change, though, in part thanks to the rise of
independent film, with its fondness for depicting quirky people in
ordinary settings (or, perhaps more to the point, in cheap
locations). In the '80s, a couple of studio movies had nervously
ventured out past the Queens border in search of offbeat humor.
</P>
<P>
   In Frank Perry's ``Compromising Positions'' (1985), Susan
Sarandon, as a Long Island housewife, pluckily solved the murder of
her periodontist. The picture was mildly amusing, in a Marple sort
of way, but its suburban setting looked, to this native's eyes,
disappointingly generic. Jonathan Demme's 1988 Mafia comedy
``Married to the Mob'' had a considerably more vigorous take on the
area.
</P>
<P>
   The mob's Long Island is a kind of hilariously vulgar theme park
for adults, in which restaurants are decorated as medieval castles
(the attendant at the door wears a suit of armor) and hot-sheets
hotels are done up as neon seraglios. Demme's vision of these
distinctly unstately pleasure domes wasn't malicious, or even, at
heart, satiric.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the film's cheerfully absurd Long Island
represented a relatively positive image of the area: it looked, at
least, like a place where someone could have some fun. But the
movie did not spend much time there; after about half an hour it
moved on to bigger and better places (Manhattan, Miami) and never
looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco who decisively
altered the general perception of Long Island, from that of a place
where men in plaid Bermudas reclined on plastic chaise longues to
that of a hothouse where twisted passions flowered. At a certain
point Long Island, quite unexpectedly, took on an aura of
postmodern hipness; a latter-day Whitman might apostrophize it as
the finger of suburbia rudely extended from the great palm of New
York City. (This, incidentally, is why it's just as well we have no
latter-day Whitmans.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the past decade has seen a mini-boom in
Long Island-set indies, beginning with Hal Hartley's ``Unbelievable
Truth'' (1990) and ``Trust'' (1992), and more recently including
Edward Burns' ``Brothers McMullen'' (1995), Greg Mottola's
``Daytrippers'' (1996), Richard Kwietniowski's ``Love and Death on
Long Island'' (1998) and now ``Judy Berlin,'' which is finally
getting a theatrical release in the United States on Friday after
more than a year spent wandering in the wilderness of international
film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelsohn, a 34-year-old son of Old Bethpage, has managed to
cut an impressive path through that wilderness, though. The movie,
which he wrote and directed, won prizes last year at the Sundance
Film Festival (best director) and, appropriately, the Hamptons Film
Festival (best picture); it was selected for the Cannes
International Film Festival showcase known as Un Certain Regard;
and it was given the prestigious opening-night slot at the Museum
of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much happens in ``Judy Berlin,'' and most of that
nothing much happens in the dark: i.e., during an impossibly long
total eclipse of the sun. (It lasts from 12:48 p.m. all the way
through a late-summer afternoon, the second day of classes at the
Babylon elementary school where several of the characters work.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie is shot in black and white, which somehow enables it
to evoke the special visual weirdness of the place: in the early,
pre-eclipse scenes, Jeffrey Seckendorf's cinematography masterfully
captures the thin, skim-milk quality of Long Island sunlight; after
darkness descends, the unremarkable tract houses acquire a more
mysterious, almost a romantic, air, and the few people on the quiet
streets have the look of ghosts searching for their lost homes.
</P>
<P>
   The style of the picture is a more significant achievement than
its content, which is a shade too wispy to do full justice to the
bizarre energy of the place it celebrates. The main characters are
Judy, who is 32 and clings a bit too poignantly to a stubborn
optimism about her prospects in life; David Gold (Aaron Harnick), a
depressed high school classmate of Judy's, who has returned to
Babylon after an unsuccessful stab at filmmaking; David's parents,
Arthur (Bob Dishy), who is the principal of the elementary school,
and Alice (Madeline Kahn), who is an extremely jittery housewife;
and Judy's mother, Sue (Barbara Barrie), a tough-minded teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the film Judy and David almost fall in love,
Arthur and Sue dare one furtive, embarrassed kiss in a deserted
classroom, and poor Alice, somewhat deranged by the eclipse, roams
the streets imagining herself as a ``space explorer'' and laughing
nervously _ just to make sure that everyone knows she's joking.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island of my experience is rather less Chekhovian than
this: the Three Sisters never got to Moscow, but natives of Babylon
(and Farmingdale and Old Bethpage, where ``Judy Berlin'' was
actually shot) do have the Long Island Rail Road, and therefore
spend less time yearning for the vivid life of the city and a great
deal more time shopping there. And if we've learned anything from
Amy and Joey, it's that bravely repressed desire is no longer an
outstanding feature of the suburban character.
</P>
<P>
   I still prefer the films of Hal Hartley. While he shares
Mendelsohn's appreciation of Long Island's peculiar physical
beauties, he has a much stronger sense of its denizens' anger and
aggression and drive. When Hartley's people are depressed, they
don't get wistful, they get dangerous. If you don't know that much
about Long Island, you may not know quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hint of that volatility in the late Kahn's ferocious
comic turn as Alice Gold. But ``Judy Berlin'' tells you a lot more
about the place than ``The Brothers McMullen'' does; Burns' picture
is so visually inept that it might be set anywhere (and wherever it
is, you don't want to be). Or ``Love and Death on Long Island,''
whose protagonist is a British novelist and whose basic insight
about Long Island is that it isn't England. Or even the
entertaining ``The Daytrippers,'' which, like ``Married to the
Mob,'' hits the expressway early and never returns.
</P>
<P>
   And now that Hartley has abandoned the home turf of his first
two pictures _ apparently for good _ Eric Mendelsohn has the
territory more or less to himself. The big question is, will he
stay there? If he lights out for the coast, as his heroine does,
will he ever find his way back? I don't know what it is about Long
Island, but many of us never do.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Who made the last dozen calls to your pager or cell phone? Was
the boss on your list? The baby sitter? The carry-out place on the
corner? Added together, such numbers are likely to form a mosaic of
your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now scroll with me through the calls to Joan Jaffe's cell phone
_ a phone she bought as a link to her ailing 91-year-old mother.
Added together, such numbers will one day form the mosaic of each
of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe, a travel agent near Chicago, is one of 7 million of us
who will care for elderly relatives this year. And her worries _
our worries _ are reshaping the world. ``Demand for elder care is
growing faster than demand for child care or school-age care,''
said Barry Wanger, a spokesman for the American Business
Collaboration for Quality Dependent Care, a coalition of 17 big
companies that has spent $100 million the last seven years to
improve the quality of such care in nearly 70 communities.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he tells me this, his mother is moving into a nursing
home and he apologizes for being distracted. ``It's something
everyone will go through,'' he said, adding that employers, who
have not quite gotten the knack of helping employees through the
shoals of child care, ``are just starting to figure this one out.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing they learn _ the first thing each of us will
learn _ is that this is different than child care. ``With a child,
a healthy child, you can plan,'' said Dr. Carol House, a diagnostic
veterinary microbiologist who lives in Cutchogue, N.Y., with her
75-year-old mother, who has lung cancer and heart disease and has
had a stroke. ``You know when you're going to have the baby. You
know that when that baby is 5 he'll go to kindergarten and by the
time he's 16 he won't be home as much as you are. With a parent, it
can come out of the blue, and you can't promise an employer, `I'll
be back in six weeks.'''
</P>
<P>
   And even if you are back at work, there is a good chance you
won't really be concentrating on your job. The infrastructure of
elder care is both more complex and less complete than that of
child care, said Pat Netsch, a legislative analyst for Chevron in
San Francisco, whose 86-year-old mother, paralyzed on one side by a
stroke, lived with her until last month when she moved into an
assisted-care center. ``Medicare, Social Security, home care,'' she
said. ``You have to do that during work hours. You can't do it at
home. You can't do it on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference, the most overwhelming difference,
has nothing to do with logistics. Caring for a healthy child is
about happiness and hope; caring for a failing parent is about
mourning and loss. Caring for a child is about living for the
future; caring for a parent is about living in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, I have become a parent,'' said Margaret Tierney,
who has two grown children. This time, though, the ``child'' is her
91-year-old father, who lives with her in her home in Suwanee, Ga.,
but who often does not know where he is or who she is. Instead of 2
a.m. feedings, she said, she is roused in the middle of the night
because her father is waiting at the door for a phantom guest or
wandering the yard searching, inexplicably, for cans of gasoline.
``My babies,'' she said of her father and her 90-year-old mother,
who also lives with her and who is crippled with arthritis. ``My
friends will ask me, `How are your babies?'''
</P>
<P>
   To take better care of her ``babies,'' Tierney, who is a manager
at AT&AMP;T, telecommutes from home. She has not taken a vacation in
two years. Netsch turned down a promotion that would have required
frequent travel. House retired at age 55.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe kept her travel agency job. ``Going to work was a godsend
to me,'' she said, ``to go there and do something productive.'' But
she reordered her life for her mother in so many other ways,
helping the elderly woman stay in her own home, surrounded by
24-hour nursing care, during her long battle with lung cancer. The
cell phone was the bridge between that home and Jaffe's office.
``She's really the only one who had the number,'' she said, and in
the final months, when the illness created delusion and panic,
there were frequent, frantic calls resulting in white-knuckle
dashes, usually in rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe's mother died several weeks ago. When Jaffe went back to
work, just last week, the cell phone went, too. She powered it on
and placed it within reach, though she knew no one was likely to
call. &QL;

EDITORIAL: KOSOVO FLASHPOINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo are facing their biggest
challenge since the air war ended last June. Serbs and Albanians in
the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica have been attacking each
other for the past two weeks, and NATO has increasingly been drawn
into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has responded appropriately, sending in British,
German and Italian reinforcements to supplement the French forces
already there. U.N. administrators have brought foreign judges into
Mitrovica to try violent ethnic Albanian and Serb extremists. A
clear message must be sent that NATO will not tolerate renewed
ethnic warfare in Kosovo or leave its soldiers vulnerable to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica has become a focal point for the combustible problems
left unresolved by last year's conflict. As hundreds of thousands
of Kosovo Albanians forcibly expelled by Serbian forces returned
home last summer, the province's Serbian minority fell victim to
numerous revenge attacks. Most Kosovo Serbs fled to Serbia. Many of
those who did not moved into the northern part of Mitrovica, a city
near the Serbian border. Mitrovica is now ethnically partitioned,
with the area north of the Ibar River 90 percent Serb and the
southern part mainly ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Kosovo, serious problems remain. The U.N.
administration under Bernard Kouchner, hampered by limited
financial resources and the slow recruitment of an international
police force, has made only limited progress toward constructing a
civil society under the rule of law. Ethnic hatreds persist. But it
is only in Mitrovica that armed Serbs and Albanians confront each
other and endanger NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   For months, French forces maintained an uneasy peace across
barricades partitioning the city at the main bridge across the
Ibar. But that awkward arrangement, which left more than 1,000
ethnic Albanians fearfully stranded in northern Mitrovica, broke
down earlier this month. Since then many of these Albanians have
been chased from their homes by Serbian mobs, while innocent Serbs
have been killed in Albanian terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear which side is more to blame. Serbian
nationalists apparently sponsored by Belgrade have displaced more
moderate leaders who showed some inclination toward living
peacefully with their ethnic Albanian neighbors. Meanwhile,
militant Albanians have been seeking to drive the Serbs out of
northern Mitrovica, fearing that their continued presence there
would solidify a partition of Kosovo that left the mineral-rich
north under Serbian control.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a long time and a lot of international assistance
to build the kind of society in Kosovo where Serbs and ethnic
Albanians can live together without fear, in Mitrovica and
elsewhere. But the chances of achieving that will evaporate unless
the violence in Mitrovica is suppressed. &QL;

A CONSERVATIVE FROM ARIZONA PICKS A PATH LESS TAKEN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Touring South Carolina, John McCain is accompanied by Lisa
Keegan, the magnetic schools superintendent from Arizona, his home
state, who handles inquiries about his education proposals. Widely
admired by conservatives, Keegan would be on a short list for
secretary of education in any Republican administration.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan has been a conservative flag-bearer in the education
wars, demanding publicly financed vouchers for parents to use at
private schools. She wants market forces alone to regulate
education. She acknowledges that when parents choose a school, it
might be better if they knew how it taught reading and math, but
she insists that they should nonetheless be allowed to choose on
any basis they wish.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, she has promoted tax credits for donations to
private voucher plans. And last year she received the annual award
of a foundation sponsored by the conservative economist Milton
Friedman, who has championed privatized schooling since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   But Keegan could ultimately surprise us, and perhaps herself.
When outsiders like her accept real responsibility, solutions that
once looked simple to them may no longer seem practical. Now in
charge of Arizona's school accountability, she must decide which
schools are successful, and the stakes have become particularly
high for her: She has presided over a big expansion of charter
schools, and unfair standards would harm charters as well as
regular schools.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan's challenge is this: To defend low-scoring schools
outside the regular system, she is being forced to acknowledge that
students' social and economic hardship, as well as school quality,
affects results. This insight is incompatible with the idea,
typically advanced by fellow conservatives, that public schools
must be failures if they cannot themselves eliminate the rich-poor
gap in scores.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 Arizona children are now in charter schools,
twice the enrollment share of charter schools in any other state.
Charters get state financing and are freed of almost all curricular
and personnel rules. In return, they are supposed to achieve, or be
closed. The idea is that regular schools, fearing loss of students,
will also improve. For such competition to work, the state schools
superintendent must report achievement for both regular and charter
schools. And because charters promise results, Keegan plans to
recommend closing those that perform poorly.
</P>
<P>
   But which will they be? In Arizona, scores at charter schools
are about the same as at regular schools. From 1997 to 1998,
regular schools' fourth-grade math scores rose from the 48th to the
51st national percentile, while charters' went from the 42nd to the
43rd. In reading, regular schools' scores were unchanged at the
52nd percentile, but charters' dropped from the 52nd to the 50th.
</P>
<P>
   This, Keegan knows, does not mean charters are failing. She
professes no concern if a school's scores are low, provided
students' annual gains compare favorably with gains in schools that
have similar students. It is this relative standard that defies
conventional cliches. David Garcia, Arizona schools research
director, says schools will be compared only with those where
students have similar socioeconomic backgrounds or ``extenuating
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan is now battling affluent suburban parents who maintain
that with scores already high, their schools should not have to
post student gains. Not so, she insists. Suburban schools have
stayed too comfortable by coasting at the 70th percentile while
student achievement stagnates.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools can be nontraditional. Some recruit dropouts;
simply getting many of those youths to stay in class may be a
success, and so it would not be fair, Keegan believes, to judge
such schools only by test scores. Her recommendations for which
schools should be closed will consider mitigating factors and
emphasize ``multiple measures'' of success, for regular and charter
schools alike. For example, a school might be considered adequate
if students, though testing poorly, later succeed at community
college.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bold approach. By contrast, Florida's governor, Jeb
Bush, last year gave private vouchers to parents at two low-scoring
public school ``failures.'' Those schools enrolled very poor
children, and tried to improve results with innovative programs.
Keegan's measures might not find failure there. (As in Florida, New
York policy makers resist alternative academic measures and now
identify school failure by low scores alone, without considering
Keegan's ``mitigating factors.'')
</P>
<P>
   Keegan has not yet detailed how she will decide whether to call
for a school's closing. She will almost certainly be pressured by
critics who contend that she whitewashes schools that serve
hard-to-educate children and achieve high gains but low scores.
Perhaps she came to these ideas only from a desire to excuse
low-scoring charters. But because she takes the challenge so
seriously, Lisa Keegan could transform education debates, providing
conservatives and liberals common ways to evaluate schools.

   THE BOSS
</P>
<P>
   NICK TRIVISONNO
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive, ACNielsen, a global market-research company.
</P>
<P>
   Written with Julia Lawlor
</P>
<P>
   Each year, we have a senior executive conference. The first
year, I rode into a big outdoor rodeo arena in Phoenix on a horse
and delivered some remarks. It was a lot of fun. So the next year,
the question was, ``Can you top that?''
</P>
<P>
   Some people here found a retired matador, Don Manuel Juarez, who
has a bullfighting school in Murcia, Spain, very near where our
meeting was being held. And they thought, ``Wouldn't it be a good
idea if Nick Trivisonno walked out into the ring in full matador
garb?'' So I said, ``Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   I have the outfit in a display case in my office. It is gorgeous
_ pink socks, ballet slippers, a toreador jacket embroidered with
sequins, red scarf, tuxedo shirt and tie, the hat and, of course,
the yellow and crimson cape. This suit sparkles in the sun. I'm
thinking I'm going to look like Robert Redford out there.
</P>
<P>
   Then I find out that they have arranged for me to take a couple
of lessons in bullfighting with Manuel. So on opening night, not
only am I walking out into the ring to the applause and laughter of
130 of our senior people, who threw carnations and roses at me, but
I did three passes with the bull. It was a baby bull, with horns.
It was probably 800 pounds. The bull comes by, you hear the hooves
pounding, the sand is coming up and hitting the cape. It is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I wouldn't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Matadors have a certain image and profile. But the pictures of
me in the matador suit made me look more like the Pillsbury
Doughboy. The bull had more to shoot at than I was willing to
admit. So immediately afterwards, I went on a major
exercise-and-diet program. I lost 40 pounds in about a year and a
half, and stopped smoking, too. I was smoking a couple packs of
cigarettes a day. I'd smoked since I was 13. In the beginning,
getting on a treadmill or jogging was out of the question. So I
bought a Richard Simmons tape _ ``Sweatin' to the Oldies'' _ and I
did it for 12 weeks every single morning. From there I graduated to
the treadmill and then to a full routine of aerobics and weight
lifting with a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in shape was probably the most difficult thing I've
accomplished in my personal life. Professionally, it was getting
ACNielsen back to being a profitable company after it was spun off
from Dun &AMP; Bradstreet in 1996. I didn't set out to go into
business. I grew up in a lower-middle-class neighborhood in
Brooklyn, and in high school, I entered the seminary. In my family,
studying for the priesthood was the most noble thing you could do.
But after my first year in college, I began to appreciate other
things in the world. Like women. And like the world of business. My
mom and dad were very disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Their reaction was, ``OK, now what are you going to do?'' I knew
a man in the neighborhood, an accountant, who had taught me to play
golf. So I decided to become an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, with all the travel I've been doing, I've put on another
10 pounds. I have to work on that. I'm a big golfer, and I love to
ride horses. But my bullfighting days are over. Last year at our
annual conference, we had a pirate ship out in the middle of the
harbor in Manzanilla, Mexico. I dressed up as a one-legged pirate
captain, but I decided I was going to stay dry. I had the others
walk the plank.

COMMENTARY: WIMP FACTOR REDUX
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIKEN, S.C. _ George Bush fighting the wimp factor? That rings a
bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I think Bush's problem is that he's
wimpy, he seems to dilly-dally,'' confided Barbara Looney, a
retired gift-wrapper at Macy's who lives in North Augusta, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Lois Marable, a fellow retiree, agreed: ``I do not
like the way he looks on television. He looks like a wimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The two John McCain fans had come to the University of South
Carolina here to see their man. After he spoke, he called on
Marable during the question period. She had only one question: Was
he nuts?
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizona senator must persuade South Carolinians that
he's not too coiled, Bush must persuade them that he's coiled
enough.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Saluda on Monday, Bush acknowledged,
after his flaccid performance in New Hampshire, that South
Carolinians had been pressing him about whether he was tough enough
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, people do that all the time,'' he said. Asked why, he
replied: ``I guess because they think I'm such a nice fellow, you
know? I don't know. 'Cause they want to win in November, they want
to figure out who can go toe-to-toe.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why he has been talking louder and faster in
speeches here, and came out swinging, determined to dominate, with
an aggressive and well-coached debate performance Tuesday night,
even as McCain tried to appear calm and avuncular.
</P>
<P>
   It must be a nightmarish, Groundhog Day experience for W. to be
forced, as his father once was, to defend his toughness, when he
expected to simply swagger in and avenge the family name.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, W. is a carbon of his father. And his campaign is
also imitating his dad's playbook, which may be sorely out of date:
rabid tax cuts, pandering to the religious right on abortion,
speaking to racist, anti-Catholic Bob Jones University ministers,
proclaiming Jesus as personal savior, splashing mud on foes while
promising to inspire Americans' ``better angels.'' The desire to be
president seems more urgent than the desire to do things as
president.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one way the son was never supposed to be like the
father. Bush supporters were certain that W. would never get tagged
with the ``W'' word. He would never be called wimp. He was, they
whispered, so as not to offend his dad, more like Ronald Reagan. He
had that cock-of-the-walk way about him. He seemed more peppery
Texan than flighty preppy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1987 Newsweek cover with the headline ``Fighting the Wimp
Factor'' was a searing experience for Vice President Bush, a war
hero, and his hyper-loyal son. The story said many Republicans were
worried that the elder Bush might not be ``strong enough or tough
enough for the challenges of the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   W., still a hothead in those days, called the magazine's White
House correspondent to inform him: ``Newsweek's been cut off.
You're out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1988, the vice president was still so peeved that
Katharine Graham, the publisher of Newsweek, had to meet with him
to appease him. He had even counted the number of times the word
``wimp'' had been used in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, W. still sometimes needles Newsweek reporters about
the wimp war.
</P>
<P>
   So he must loathe the position he now finds himself in, locked
in an unexpectedly scorching battle with a gritty war hero who
treats him as a callow squirt.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that ``W'' word popping up with this W.?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the bad luck of drawing this particular opponent, someone
who can speak knowingly about self-sacrifice to spoiled boomers,
while W. can only embrace such notions as distant ideals? Is it the
consequence of Bush's own diffidence about the race, which has
clearly been more grueling than he expected? Or does his attempt to
mimic everything McCain does _ including his risible,
loophole-laden campaign finance ``reform'' package _ leave him
looking like an insecure adolescent?
</P>
<P>
   Louise Hendley, 77, who swooned over McCain at a campaign event
at the Beth Shalom Synagogue in Columbia on Tuesday, said she
really liked Bush. ``But he just doesn't give me the feeling that
he could be in charge in an emergency,'' she said. ``He's just a
cute little boy to me, a cute little puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of praise that would make a candidate's blood
run cold. (BOX)

EDITORIAL: PAYING FOR THE UNINSURED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, Gov. George Pataki and New York state
legislative leaders approved a commendable new program called
Family Health Plus to provide coverage for uninsured low-income
parents and other adults. But now the governor is battling with the
Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, and the Democrat-controlled
Assembly over how that program is to be financed.
</P>
<P>
   The program will provide insurance to low-income parents, much
like Child Health Plus, a program for low-income children. It would
cover families with incomes of up to 150 percent of the poverty
line, thus providing help for a family of four earning up to about
$25,000 a year. It would also provide coverage for individuals
without children who are within the existing poverty level. The
federal government will pay roughly half the cost of the program,
or about $700 million, over the next three years and a half years,
with the state paying the other $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is insisting that New York City and the counties pay half
the state's costs, as they do in the standard Medicaid program.
That would cost the city $200 million and the counties $140 million
over the next three and a half years. The Family Health Plus
initiative is a commendable effort to expand health care for
low-income workers. But there is no reason that the state, which
will get more than $400 million a year from the tobacco settlement
and is expecting increased revenues from a new 55-cent-per-pack
cigarette tax, cannot carry the full burden.
</P>
<P>
   The governor argues that the counties and New York City have
benefited from significant cuts to Medicaid in the past few years,
and that the local governments will also get a large portion of the
tobacco settlement windfall. Even so, coverage for the uninsured,
as with other poverty programs, is best financed at the state
level, where the cost burden can be more broadly spread and where
there are more revenue sources than those available to local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of the Legislature want to relieve local governments
of this new burden. Bruno has incurred the anger of Governor Pataki
by introducing legislation to require the state to pick up the full
tab, thus ensuring that this issue will be part of the budget
fight. The underlying Child Health Plus program is fully financed
by the state and federal governments without a local contribution.
Family Health Plus, an important expansion of that concept, should
be financed the same way.

<P>
   PROTEST IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   Some black leaders in Detroit are urging the city's largely
Democratic residents to vote for Sen. John McCain in the Michigan
primary on Tuesday to embarrass Gov. John Engler, a staunch
supporter of Gov. George W. Bush. The Rev. Wendell Anthony,
president of the Detroit chapter of the NAACP, and State Rep. LaMar
Lemmons III said Engler had not supported moves to help Detroit
retain its tax base. Michigan Democratic caucuses are in March.

<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   AN OUTPOST IN VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   McCain on Tuesday opened a Virginia campaign office in Richmond,
Va. It will be headed by Dennis Peterson, described by a McCain
official as a ``veteran Republican political operative.'' Since
last month the campaign had an all-volunteer staff working from a
small office in Richmond.

   Vice President Al Gore, speaking at Morgan State University in
Baltimore on Tuesday, called for government and industry to work
together to give all households access to the Internet and to help
teachers use technology to improve instruction. He was vague about
how he would turn his ambitious technology agenda into reality, and
his aides said later that he would rely on relatively modest
amounts of taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY ON HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley told about 150 health care workers at
Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York Tuesday that his health care
proposals were realistic and affordable. Bradley's aides tried to
draw attention to a new study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy
Research, which they said showed that Gore's health plan would
neglect about 715,000 low-income adults in New York. Gore's plan
would continue Medicaid, which does not cover healthy childless
adults. Bradley would provide subsidies for those people to get
insurance.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: EXPLAINING THE MINUTIAE OF FREQUENT-FLIER AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Randy Petersen talks a mile a minute, which figures. Among
people who rack up the miles on business, Petersen is generally
considered to be the world's leading expert on airline
frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen is the founder and president of a company called
Frequent Flyer Services Inc., which publishes InsideFlyer, a
monthly magazine (circulation 130,000) devoted entirely to
information about airline frequent-flier awards programs. The
company, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., also runs a Web site
(www.webflyer.com) and other subsidiaries geared to serving the
frequent-flier market.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen estimates that frequent fliers currently hold about 3.5
trillion miles in their accounts, a figure that is growing by about
400 billion miles each year. We will not even speculate on what
would happen to the international air travel system if, say,
everyone decided to cash in their frequent-flier miles and demand
free trips, upgrades and other prizes all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, let's try a simpler question: What inspires someone to
become a repository of information on the breathtakingly complex
subject of frequent-flier programs? Surely, only a very
detail-oriented person would do this. All right, an
obsessive-compulsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm not that way at all,'' insisted Petersen, who is
46 and has been known to wear a T-shirt that says, ``What Part of
`Upgrade' Don't You Understand?'' A natural schmoozer, he was a
history major in college and worked in the retail clothing business
in New York until 1985, when he found his new calling. This was
during the early years of the frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traveled a lot on business, and back at the office, I'd
notice how much of the conversation had to do with frequent-flier
miles,'' he recalled. ``The first time I thought about
frequent-flier miles, I was looking over a TWA brochure with a
picture of a beach in Hawaii and the message, `You can earn free
travel.' And damned if I didn't find myself later on a beach in
Hawaii, thinking, `Hey, there might be a business in keeping track
of this stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen spent a couple of months putting together a plan to
start a business publishing a newsletter with reliable information
on the rapidly growing world of frequent-flier programs. The sample
issue was four photocopied pages _ typewritten, with snippets of
airline ads pasted on for display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt stupid because it looked like a ransom note,'' Petersen
said. He took stacks of the newsletters to La Guardia Airport and
Kennedy International Airport in New York and passed them out,
asking business travelers if they would pay $12 a year to
subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the response, he quit his job, drove to Colorado,
where it was cheaper to live, and began publishing InsideFlyer,
which now costs $36 a year and is filled with amazing amounts of
information each month about the world of frequent-flier programs _
and nothing but. ``I'm not interested in things like the distance
between seats on an airline,'' Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, who travels internationally as a consultant on
frequent-flier programs, said he currently had about 9.5 million
miles in his various accounts. ``But I'm nowhere near the top
guy,'' he said. The champion frequent-flier reputedly is a man in
Hawaii who works as an air courier. ``I hear he's got about 14
million miles _ but it's all in one program,'' Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   About 57 million Americans, and 98 percent of all business
travelers, belong to at least one frequent-flier program. Mileage
awards do not just accumulate from flying _ now about 39 percent of
all frequent-flier miles come from transactions with hotels and
credit card companies. Frequent-flier programs are an extremely
serious affair. Divorce proceedings have been known to snag over
dividing up the award miles. Hard-core business travelers deep in
frequent-flier colloquies can empty a hotel bar faster than a fire
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen stresses customer service at his company headquarters,
where he and 32 employees work in a new building they have
christened the House of Miles. The phones ring constantly with
calls from subscribers and other travelers asking questions or
passing on tips about the minutiae of the business.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, to ease the phone burden, Petersen put up a
chat-room-type Web site (www.flyertalk.com) for travelers to post
tips, anecdotes, questions and gripes about frequent-flier
programs. The site, which carries no advertising, now gets more
than 3,000 postings a week from people with an intense interest in
frequent-flier programs. Unlike many other chat rooms, it appears
to be relatively lunatic-free. Civility prevails. Reliable
information abounds.
</P>
<P>
   A literal online community soon formed within the site. Last
November, about 60 people who had met online decided to get
together in Hawaii to have a party and talk about _ what else? _
frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty people who didn't know each other,'' Petersen marveled.
``Some of them had to be wondering, `What if I fly there and this
is some kind of scam?''' In fact, the gathering went so well that
more get-togethers are being planned for Montreal, New York and
Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often tease people in the airline industry about what
they've done with these programs,'' Petersen said. ``I tell them:
`The only thing you were successful at was underestimating the
greed of the American flier. We all want a free lunch now.''' &QL;

WHITE WOMEN IN NEW YORK RANK HIGH IN DEATH FROM HEART DISEASE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   White women in New York state had the highest death rates from
heart disease among white women in the United States, and New York
ranked second highest in the number of deaths among women over all,
the first national study of heart disease in women by region, race
and ethnic origin has found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta and by West Virginia University, found
that the death rates from heart disease were generally highest in
the impoverished, rural areas of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta
and elsewhere in rural Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also found pockets of high death rates elsewhere,
too, particularly in four densely populated cities: New York,
Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans. States with the lowest death
rates were in the West, and the rates were low to moderate in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what many people believe, heart disease is the
leading cause of death for women,'' said the surgeon general, Dr.
David Satcher. While heart ailment has long been regarded as a
``men's'' disease, Satcher said the study provides a perspective on
the threat heart disease in women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michele L. Casper, an epidemiologist at the CDC who is the
chief author of the study, said she was surprised by the New York
findings because the high rates generally appeared in Southern
rural areas where many women, particularly the elderly, might live
isolated and alone, perhaps unable to care for themselves or get to
a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Casper also said many rural areas have no coronary units that
can sometimes prevent heart attacks or cardiac rehabilitation
centers that can prevent recurrences. Such conditions might also
apply to poor women living in densely populated urban areas, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Casper said the current research was designed specifically to
pinpoint differences in death rates among different groups of women
and how the rates varied from region to region. Further studies
would examine the caue added.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers said that lifestyle and social and economic
factors were also possible reasons for the disparities in death
rates generally and for the high rates in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Antonio M. Gotto, dean of Weill Cornell Medical College in
New York City, said he believed that lifestyle might be responsible
for as much as 50 percent of the incidence of the disease.. In New
York, he said, a great ethnic, cultural and economic diversity
produces great differences in lifestyle and patterns of behavior,
including diet, intake of fat and cholesterol, physical exercise,
smoking, blood pressure, money to pay for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings of the new study:
</P>
<P>
   The states with the highest heart-disease death rates were
Mississippi, New York and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest among the low range of rates occurred in the states
of the Pacific Northwest, in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado,
New Mexico and in parts of Wisconsin and North and South Dakota.
The Midwest was found to be in the moderate to low range.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Minnesota were the most likely to survive heart
disease, while white women were most likely to survive in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 370,000 women died of heart disease in 1997, the last
year for which statistics are available. Annual rates or mortality
among women, a total of 401 per 100,000 base population, the CDC
statisticians said, were greater than for all forms of cancer
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Disparities of heart disease death rates among men will be
studied next.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Krieger, an associate professor in the department of
health and social behavior at Harvard School of Public health, said
the researchers were trying to move beyond the limitations of
current health data.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't look at heart disease mortality among women.
Epidemiology research shows that what matters are the conditions
you lived in when you grew up as well as how you are able to live
as an adult and the quality of care you receive'' when medical care
is needed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The research confirmed previously known disparities between the
five major racial and ethnic groups in the United States: that
significantly more African American women die from heart disease
than any other group but that whites are much more likely to do so
than Asian and Pacific Islanders and American Indians and Native
Alaskans.
</P>
<P>
   Among African American woman, the death rate from heart disease
was 553 per 100,000; among white woman, 388 per 100,000; native
Americans 259 per 100,000 and among Asian and Pacific Islander
women 221 per 100,000. The rate for Hispanic woman of all races was
265 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Counties with the highest rates for African American women, in
addition to those in Mississippi River and delta region, were those
in a band across Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and in pockets
of the Northeast, the Midwest and Texas and Oklahoma. Among the
states with the highest rates for this group of women were
Mississippi, Nebraska, Illinois and Michigan. Hawaii had the
lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Counties with the highest death rates for whites were roughly
the same as those for African Americans, that is in Appalachia and
the Mississippi River Valley, except that for whites there was a
greater concentration reported along the Southeast coastal regions.
The highest state rates were New York, ranged 51st among white
women, Mississippi and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In New York State, the death rate for all 4,929,714 women was
487 per 100 thousand, compared to the national average of 401; for
black women the rate was 573; for whites 477; Hispanic women 307;
Asian and Pacific islanders 236, and American Indians and Alaskan
natives 212.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi had the highest death rate for black women, 686 per
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City the death rate for all 2,019,225 women was 561
per 100 thousand; for black women the rate was 587; for whites 559;
Hispanic women 320; Asian and Pacific islanders 248, and American
Indians and Alaskan natives 97. Average deaths among both whites
and Hispanics were highest in Manhattan; for blacks and Asians and
Pacific islanders, Brooklyn; American Indians and Alaskan natives
were scattered through the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn.

WALTER FLETCHER, 93, IS DEAD; WRITER ON DOGS FOR THE NEW YORK
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Fletcher, who covered dog shows for The New York Times
for more than 60 years and became something of a celebrity in the
sport, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Niceville, Fla., where he
lived in a retirement community. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who covered more than 40 editions of the Westminster
Kennel Club Show _ the sport's blue-ribbon event _ for The Times,
died hours before the 124th annual show ended at Madison Square
Garden. He was spotlighted on Monday in a taped television segment
recounting the show's history.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher was on the staff of The Times from 1927 to 1976,
working as sportswriter, copy editor, picture editor and makeup
editor. After retiring, he continued to cover major shows for The
Times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when he announced he was about to retire from all his
writing activities, the Garden spotlight at the Westminster show
picked him out and Roger Caras, the public-address announcer, told
the spectators of Fletcher's long association with dog shows. He
received a standing ovation and called it ``the most touching
moment of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, his aching knees did not allow him to stand too long at
one time, so he covered Westminster's two-day show from a
wheelchair. He fought off laptop technology, writing his stories on
a battered portable typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher had a keen knowledge of the sport's history. Covering
the 1983 Westminster show, he wrote how ``the clock was turned back
26 years in Madison Square Garden last night when a black and tan
Afghan, Ch. Kabik's The Challenger'' was named best in show. He
noted that it was the first time an Afghan had won since 1957, when
Ch. Shirkhan of Gradeur triumphed, and he told his readers how an
Afghan is ``an aristocrat, dignified and aloof.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fletcher's tall frame bent to advancing years, his
expertise did not. Each year, after the Westminster field of 2,500
champions had been reduced to seven, he telephoned his office and
told the editors to look for photos of a certain dog because he
thought that dog would win best in show. For his last seven
Westminsters, he picked the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Ralph Fletcher was born May 20, 1906, in New York City.
He received a bachelor's degree from City College, where he was the
campus correspondent for The Times and The New York Post, then
worked briefly as a copy editor for The Post before joining The
Times.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he started spending all of his work time covering
the dog-show world, with columns in the Thursday and Sunday papers
and shows every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He won frequent writing awards from the Dog Writers of America,
in 1965 sweeping the prizes for reporting, columns and magazine
articles.
</P>
<P>
   He received more mail than any other Times sports-department
colleague. He advised generations of readers what breed of dog to
buy and how to train the dog.
</P>
<P>
   When he lived on Long Island, he owned many dogs. They included
a Dalmatian who won her championship as an 11-month-old puppy, a
dachshund, a Boston Terrier and a golden retriever. When he moved
to an apartment in Queens, his dog-owning days ended because, he
said, ``The city is no place for a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is survived by two sons, Winston, of Niceville, and
Carey, of Honolulu, from his marriage to the former Rita Beers, and
11 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cared about the sport and knew about it,'' said Caras, the
president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. ``He had a sense of humor. I once called him the Walter
Lippmann of the hydrant set, and he loved it.'' &QL;

POLICE OCCUPY LOWER EAST SIDE GARDEN AND ARREST 31 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The narrow lot on East Seventh Street, wedged between
two apartment buildings and showing the remains of last fall's crop
of vegetables and herbs, would hardly seem capable of attracting
attention in the bustle of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday morning it managed to capture, for a moment, center
stage in the city, encapsulating the fight that has been going on
for years over the hundreds of community gardens that have sprung
up on city-owned lots, many with official encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as the city was sending bulldozers and the police to
clear out the tiny community garden known as Esperanza Garden, the
state attorney general was sending lawyers to court to try to stop
them, and dozens of protesters were chaining themselves to cement
blocks that they had buried in the garden months ago to prepare for
just this moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest pitched battle between the Giuliani
administration, which wants to reclaim the properties to make way
for low- and middle-income housing, and community advocates who see
the gardens as invaluable solace and scenery in a city dominated by
asphalt and concrete. The fight has been waged in the courts, the
news media and the neighborhoods, and has at times even attracted
celebrities like Bette Midler, who helped rescue 112 other lots
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza Garden has managed to draw intense devotion on the
Lower East Side. Just hours before the court hearing was to begin,
demonstrators who had spent the night guarding the garden were in a
tense standoff with police.
</P>
<P>
   They had chained themselves to concrete blocks and fences in
hopes of preventing the garden from being razed. They were chanting
songs.
</P>
<P>
   And as often seems to be the case when the community gardens are
at stake, confusion reigned.
</P>
<P>
   Before a judge could weigh in on the merits of the state's case,
the city acted. Police waded into the demonstration, arresting 31
people and scattering dozens of others. A work crew with a
bulldozer, backhoe and chain saws then set to destroying all traces
of the garden, which had been in existence since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who hopes to sell the lot to BFC
Properties, a developer, says this lot and hundreds of others like
it can be used to ease a housing shortage. The lots will create
housing for people who can least afford it, he said, and the city's
plans are legal and sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live in an unrealistic world then you can say
everything should be a community garden,'' Giuliani said. ``Then
where would people live where they are able to get affordable
housing?''
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to the city's plans includes the court challenge
from Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, who says that the lots,
which had once fallen under the city's program to encourage
community gardens, should be considered parks, which could only be
sold after state environmental review or by an act of the
Legislature.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that this is a determination the
courts should make,'' Spitzer said. ``This is an unfortunate
display of the mayor preventing the judicial process from
operating.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Tuesday's actions left some of the gardeners and
sympathizers bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wreaks havoc on the conscience,'' said Joel Kupferman, a
staff lawyer for the New York Environmental Law and Justice
Project. ``I am crestfallen.''
</P>
<P>
   The police action also created a scene. In recent months, as it
seemed sure that the city would evict the gardeners, they fortified
land they had come to see as their own.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the concrete blocks they chained themselves to,
the gardeners erected a tripod to stand watch, and built a
sculpture of a large tree frog, or coqui, which in Puerto Rican
legend is said to repel attackers. The frog had room inside for at
least two people.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the fortifications failed to hold.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:15 a.m., police began towing away cars on the street, while
the protesters gathered around a fire. By 7 a.m., the crowd of
protesters had grown to 150. They chanted: ``New York City has got
to breathe. More gardens, more peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they raze this garden, we'll take it back,'' said
Michael Shenker, a resister. ``We'll take two for every one they
destroy. Giuliani, Fooliani! We're going to haunt Giuliani like the
Furies from Greek mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 10 a.m. the officers converged, cutting Shenker
and other protesters free and carting them off to local precincts.
Although the protesters had hoped to delay the city until Spitzer's
lawyers could argue their case in court, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the protesters was removed by 11:30. The court did
not finish hearing the state's motion until early afternoon, at
which time Justice Richard D. Huttner of state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn blocked the city from moving against 174 other lots until
the court meets again next month.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the case said the judge separated Esperanza Garden
from his ruling because it is the subject of a separate proceeding,
filed by the neighborhood, that has been rejected by the courts and
is now under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The legal distinction mattered little. By the time the order was
issued, Esperanza Garden was no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible to me,'' said Ariane Burgess. ``It took 22
years to create this beautiful space, and they completely destroyed
it in a couple of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   As Burgess spoke, the creak and rumble of the bulldozer could be
heard from the lot, where all of the garden's structures and
plantings were being crushed, including the frog. A woman wandered
by, carrying a burlap scarecrow.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the 31 protesters were charged with trespassing
and would be held overnight for morning court appearances. Some
were also charged with obstructing justice and resisting arrest,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was unmoved by the timing of the arrests, and
by Huttner's temporary restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are considering appealing that,'' he said. ``I would ask
people to consider how hard it is to get an apartment in New York,
how the vacancy rate is nonexistent. I mean, something has to
give.''

NETS LOSE BIG AS VAN HORN REMAINS HOME
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Rowe, the president of the Nets, said that
things would be different and that changes would be made in the
second half of the season. He said he would attend road games, get
a closer look at the team's problems and play Mr. Fix-It.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe was sitting about 15 rows behind the Nets' bench Tuesday
night, and neither his presence nor the All-Star Game break did any
good. With Rowe glowering and his arms crossed, the Nets were
routed like a practice squad by the doleful Atlanta Hawks, 103-86,
at the Philips Arena. It was the Nets' eighth defeat in their last
10 games and it dropped them to 19-31.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets played without Keith Van Horn, their second-leading
scorer. Van Horn's wife, Amy, gave birth to a baby girl early
Tuesday morning, and Van Horn chose to remain in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Dikembe Mutombo was the star for the Hawks (20-28), recording 21
points, 13 rebounds and 11 blocked shots to notch his first triple
double in four years. It was the third of his career. Alan
Henderson also scored 21 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, and Jim
Jackson scored 20.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury led the Nets with 27 points. Lucious Harris, the
only other Net to score in double figures, added 15.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets in shambles, losing huge leads in close losses and
being routed by poor teams like the Hawks, Coach Don Casey's job
would seem to be in jeopardy. The Nets' ownership clearly wants to
keep him for the remainder of the season, but the club's plight is
getting so bad that a change may soon have to be grudgingly made.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Van Horn did not talk to Rowe, General Manager John Nash
or Casey about his decision to skip the game. Nash said Van Horn
spoke to Gary Sussman, the Nets' director for corporate
communications, and Ted Arzonico, the team's trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Nets' officials were miffed at Van Horn's
absence, but Nash said that there was no team policy on this
situation and that it depended on the individual. ``I think we're
all disappointed,'' Nash said. ``Keith has had great success
against Atlanta, but family business is important to him, and I
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who has come under fire for his declining production,
averaged 24 points and 9 rebounds in two games against the Hawks
this season. He recorded 28 points and 10 rebounds in a 97-89 loss
earlier this month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After being whipped for most of the first half, the Nets
mustered a third-quarter charge that nearly made a game of it.
Marbury, scoring on drives and jump shots, popped for 15 to help
cut an 8-point halftime deficit to 4, 57-53.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta re-established the cushion, pushing the lead to 11 at
one point, but Marbury, who made three 3-pointers in the third,
kept the Nets within striking range. His final 3-pointer of the
quarter made it 68-62 with a minute left. But, as if able to swat
away the Nets at will, the Hawks ran off 6 points in the quarter's
final minute to take a 12-point advantage into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burrell started in Van Horn's place, and was anything but
the spark he has often been when coming off the bench. He struggled
in guarding Henderson, who at 6 foot 9 is two inches taller than
Burrell. Henderson, who burned Van Horn for 22 points in their last
meeting, recorded 6 points and 8 rebounds in helping Atlanta build
a 26-12 first-quarter lead. Burrell, on the other hand, managed one
rebound and two fouls in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury tried in vain to make up for Van Horn's absence by
taking the offensive load upon his shoulders. Appearing rusty after
the All-Star Game break, he missed 11 of 14 shots in the first
half, finishing with 9 points and 2 assists. Kerry Kittles (7
points) and Harris (6) provided support, but it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the dominance of Mutombo, the Hawks took a 46-38 lead
into the locker room. They led for the entire half, pushing their
advantage to as many as 16 points in the second quarter.

KNICKS HAVE NO MATCH FOR MAGIC OF CARTER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In the fourth quarter, a grim-faced lineup of Knicks
starters stared at the game as if it was a reflection off a
fun-house mirror.
</P>
<P>
   This was too distorted, too exaggerated to be real. But this is
what the presence of the Toronto Raptors' Vince Carter can do to a
team. He simply made them surrender.
</P>
<P>
   After he began Tuesday night's game with a series of uncanny
fadeaway jumpers to score 15 of his 29 points in the first quarter,
he left a frustrated Latrell Sprewell to pick up the pieces of his
10-point, 5-turnover performance.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter began to pass out of the Knicks' pursuit, he
created openings for his teammates so they, too, could join in a
91-70 victory at the Air Canada Center Tuesday night. It was so out
of hand, an irate Coach Jeff Van Gundy pulled his starters after
they fell apart during an 8-point third quarter that left the
Knicks behind, 76-53.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was behind the Knicks' worst night of the season, but he
was aided by the loose interior defense of Patrick Ewing, who could
not stop the spindly Tracy McGrady as he leaped for putbacks and
scored 18 points. After three solid performances by Ewing, he took
a step back and finished 3 for 12 with 7 points and 9 rebounds.
Carter was also helped by the aggressive Charles Oakley, who came
up with the loose balls and 15 points against his old team.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Marcus Camby, in the midst of rehabilitating his
injured right knee, was coming out of his bandages wanting to help.
In the end, the Knicks, led by Allan Houston's 17 points, had no
athletic answer for the Raptors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not as if Carter sneaked up on them. For the entire
All-Star Game weekend, he was the center of the circus atmosphere,
swooping in for dunks as if he was a trapeze artist. With cameras
flashing, Carter displayed the unique talent the league is hungry
to flaunt in the post-Jordan era.
</P>
<P>
   He aimed to please in the first half Tuesday, scoring 20 points
at Sprewell's expense and giving the Raptors a 53-45 lead. At one
point, before the Knicks found Houston lurking in the shadows after
a stream of misses by Ewing, they were down by 18 in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Any momentum the Knicks had by closing the Raptors' lead quickly
evaporated in the third quarter as a series of hustle plays by
Oakley fueled an 11-2 run. It was the beginning of a disastrous
stretch for the Knicks, who scored a season-low 8 points in the
third and trailed, 76-53, entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was not scoring as much, but he did not have to. With
Sprewell and Co. chasing him, Carter was finding the open man, like
Doug Christie, who hit a 3-pointer to put the Raptors up, 64-47,
midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The flustered Knicks _ a point emphasized when Sprewell let the
24-second clock expire without taking a shot _ were getting beaten
from every direction. From the outside, where Christie lurked, to
the inside, where McGrady popped up under the chin of Ewing for
dunks and putbacks.
</P>
<P>
   So the Raptors are not a Carter-only team. It only seemed that
way at the beginning. To open the second half of the season, Carter
used the first quarter as Act 1. For 12 minutes, he was neon and
Sprewell could not stand the glare. The tighter Sprewell played
Carter, the more horizontal Carter became on his fadeaway jumpers.
Once, Sprewell tried to keep Carter in front of him only to watch
the Raptors star shake him with a ball fake and then glide in for a
dunk in Ewing's face with 3 minutes 58 seconds left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was his quarter. While Carter scored 15 first-quarter points,
Ewing was 3 for 10, Sprewell was 1 for 4 and the Knicks' All-Star,
Houston, had taken just one shot. By the miserable end, the Knicks
were down, 32-16.
</P>
<P>
   They fell behind by 18 before their pride kicked in during the
second quarter. After watching John Wallace get roughed up by
Carter, Sprewell came back into the game and gave it another try.
Maybe Carter was exhausted or maybe Sprewell was getting more help,
but the defense started forcing Raptors misses and the Knicks had
an opening.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Knicks stopped relying on Ewing and looked to
Houston to exploit the slow defense of Dell Curry. Houston came on
to score 13 second-quarter points and led a 13-2 run to pull the
Knicks to 45-42. They were within 2 at 47-45 after Larry Johnson
hit a 3-pointer, but then they came apart again. Two turnovers
later, and the Raptors were ahead, 53-45, at the end of a first
half Sprewell wanted to forget. He headed into the tunnel 2 for 8,
while Carter finished 8 for 12 with 20 points.

ERVIN LITKEI, 78, COMPOSER OF MANY PATRIOTIC MARCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ervin Litkei, a music business executive who owned
several companies but whose passion was the composition of
patriotic music _ including marches dedicated to every U.S.
president since Franklin D. Roosevelt _ died on Feb. 8 at his home
in Manhattan. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Andrea Fodor, said the cause was a pulmonary embolism.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when few composers devote themselves to overtly
patriotic works, Litkei, who came to the United States from Hungary
in 1948, made it his specialty. Several of his marches, including
``The President Lyndon Baines Johnson March'' and ``The President
George Bush March,'' were played at the inaugural ceremonies for
those presidents. For the inauguration of Bill Clinton, Litkei
supplied not only ``The President Bill Clinton March,'' but also
``A Salute to the First Lady March,'' apparently the first (and so
far only) march ever composed for a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Litkei commemorated historical events beyond inaugurations in
his marches. ``The Captured 50'' was a tribute to the hostages held
in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. ``The Torch of Peace'' was composed
during the Gulf War. For the American bicentennial celebrations in
1976, Litkei composed ``The Bicentennial March,'' produced a
concert of patriotic music in New York's Central Park, and
published ``The Bicentennial Music Book.''
</P>
<P>
   He commemorated the 1959 meeting of President Dwight D.
Eisenhower and the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev with ``The
Common Ground,'' an album for RCA that included his arrangements of
Russian folk songs and American popular standards. He later
composed ``A Salute to President Gorbachev'' in honor of the former
Soviet president.
</P>
<P>
   Also among Litkei's works are several large orchestral scores,
including ``Peace and Remembrance,'' a piano concerto, and ``The
Atlantic and Pacific Suite,'' a six-movement symphonic piece.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the soundtracks for several films and television
productions, including ``The Golden Cage'' _ a film about the
Hungarian revolution of 1956 _ and the A &AMP; E cable television
channel's biographies ``General Omar Bradley,'' ``Norman
Rockwell,'' ``Milton S. Hershey: The Chocolate King,'' and
``Admiral (Bull) Halsey.''
</P>
<P>
   Litkei was born in Budapest in 1921 and studied music at the
Music Conservatory of Hungary and architecture at the University of
Hungary. After World War II, he worked as a journalist and an
architect in Budapest. He also began composing marches in the style
of John Philip Sousa.
</P>
<P>
   He composed the first of his tributes to U.S. presidents, ``The
Franklin D. Roosevelt March,'' when he was still living in Hungary.
``He was more than God to me,'' Litkei said of Roosevelt in a 1991
interview, adding that the cadence of his march came from watching
marching American soldiers. ``They didn't have heavy steps like the
Germans or Russians. When Americans are marching, you can feel the
lightness.''
</P>
<P>
   Litkei left Hungary for the United States in 1948. He worked for
several years in Hollywood, writing songs for films and translating
the lyrics of American hits into Hungarian.
</P>
<P>
   He also founded several distribution companies for recordings
and accessories, among them Olympia Record Industries, the Arovox
Record Corp. and Galiko Music and Film Enterprises, all of which he
sold to the Rank Organization for a reported $11 million in 1989.
After the sale, he continued as president of Leona Music
Publishing, Jade Panther Corp. of America, Hanlit Publications,
Aurora Records and JazzMania Records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Litkei is survived by a daughter, Dr.
Cathy Litkei Greene of Highland Mills, N.Y., and four
grandchildren.  &QL;

<P>
   The move comes three weeks after the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration threatened to bar new planes until America West
improved its maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Than, after a review of the carrier's operations, the FAA de
termined that America West can expand its fleet and maintain the
aircraft to the required stand ards, FAA spokesman Mitch Barker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA concluded that there was no need for restrictions, which
is exactly what America West expected, company spokes woman Patty
Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West will add 14 new Airbus aircraft to its

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Ricky Rudd ended his first race in the Texaco
Ford by sliding across the finish line on the roof of his car. That
would be enough to rattle some drivers, or at least anger them. But
Rudd walked away smiling after the wild finish to the Bud Shootout
last weekend.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why was Rudd so happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is no pressure on me now,'' Rudd said. ``The
pressure left when I sold my race team at the auction in December.
Now all I have in front of me is opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, Rudd's new teammate, won the all-star race, and
Rudd walked away from the accident without a scratch. He was
smiling because he knew he was in contention. That's a situation he
believes will be true most of the time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six months, Rudd has gone through the biggest
transition of his racing career. It has included moments of
profound sadness, along with times of great joy.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to make his 24th start in the Daytona 500 on
Sunday, this time from the front row, Rudd summarized how things
have changed for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I love about racing is here, and everything I
despise about racing is gone,'' he said. ``There is no payroll to
worry about and no parts to buy. All I have to worry about is
driving the race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd was his own boss for six years as the owner/driver of the
Tide Ford. He handled it well, winning six times and finishing with
68 top-10 finishers over that span. But it became increasingly
clear the owner/driver concept was falling behind the multicar
teams. Rudd was losing ground, and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driver/owners were successful when single-car teams were
successful,'' Rudd said. ``When these things started to become a
big business, it started taking the driver/owner situation out of
the equation a little bit. You had to expand, and an owner/driver
cannot handle all those ends. Basically, we were being spread too
thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd was the only Winston Cup driver to win at least one race
every year from 1983-1998, but he was running at the back of the
pack more often than he was at the front in the last two seasons.
When Tide announced last summer that it was leaving Rudd for the
new team Cal Wells was starting, Rudd realized it would be
difficult to keep his team together. He thought he owed it to the
people who worked for him to try to find another sponsor, but it
wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   By September, Rudd knew his time as a team owner was over, but
his time as a driver was changing for the better. He would take
over in the car that was the first love of team owner Robert Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Yates won his first championship last year with Jarrett in the
No. 88 Ford, but the No. 28 car has lagged behind since the death
of Davey Allison in a helicopter crash in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   More tragedy came when Ernie Irvan barely escaped with his life
in a crash at Michigan in the Texaco car in 1994. Irvan returned
but never was the same and was replaced two years ago by rookie
driver Kenny Irwin, who didn't live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   So Yates jumped at the chance to hire Rudd, whose first Winston
Cup race was 25 years ago. Rudd, 43, has been a solid driver for
two decades, but now he has a chance to prove he can rank among the
elite of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has all the potential in the world,'' Rudd said. ``I
think the chemistry is in place to do great things. Now it's up to
us to go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd learned last season what a difference it can make to have a
Yates-prepared engine in your car. He ran the last five races last
year with a Yates engine in the Tide Ford and finished in the top
seven in three of those events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a good taste of how things could be at the end of last
year,'' Rudd said. ``But any time you start work with a new
organization, even though I have been around a long time and Yates'
organization has been around a long time, you still have to blend.
The chemistry has got to blend, and it has to click.''
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry with the new team blended well enough for Rudd to
earn a spot in the front row at Daytona next to Jarrett, who will
start on the pole. Yates was so overcome with emotion after seeing
his drivers end up 1-2 in qualifying he was in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shows what we can do this year as a team,'' Yates
said. ``With Ricky here, I think we have two drivers and two cars
that can finish in the top five in points.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates allowed Rudd to keep eight employees from his former team
and add them to the Texaco team, including crew chief Michael
McSwain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing it does is speed up the communication
process that can take weeks or months to develop,'' Rudd said.
``Mike is a super-talented crew chief, and he is surrounded by a
lot of talented people now. We had quality people before, but we
didn't have enough of them. We kept the best and merged them with
the Texaco team. You could not have asked for it to blend better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's streak of winning at least one race in 16 consecutive
seasons came to an end last year, but he's confident he can start a
new streak this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many reasons why this team is a step up from where I
was,'' Rudd said. ``The motor program, you cannot say enough about
that. Everything is here. We just have to pull it together and make
it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd said pulling together means working with his teammate and
doing everything he can to make sure one of the Yates cars wins
another Winston Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you can work through the personalities and stuff
and have both teams help each other, then it's definitely a plus,''
Rudd said. ``Usually it depends on who's driving that other race
car. Dale Jarrett and I go back about 15 years. I have nothing but
total respect for what Dale has been through and where he is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have to look at the personalities of the crew chiefs.
If the drivers get along and the crew chiefs don't, it's going to
be a struggle. But I've known Todd Parrott (Jarrett's crew chief)
since he was 10 years old. I feel like we're all close.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd believes it will be easier for him to keep harmony now than
it was as a team owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have a better relationship with the crew now,'' he
said. ``When you're the owner, they treat you differently and look
at you differently. You can't really be one of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rudd is thankful for the six years he spent as the head man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every driver needs the experience called ownership
sometime in their career,'' Rudd said. ``You walk in those shoes,
and you see some of the difficulties guys have as car owners. I
think from that side alone, I have gained more respect for what it
takes to keep these things going.''
</P>
<P>
   All Rudd has to keep going now is the No. 28 Taurus, hopefully
with the wheels on the asphalt instead of pointing toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel better prepared than I have ever been on any race
team that I have been with in many, many years,'' Rudd said. ``It
feels good starting a season by knowing you have a chance to win
every week.''

 HARRY PRICHETT Sr., 79, CREATOR OF EARLY ATTEMPT AT INTERACTIVE(sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harry William Prichett Sr., an architect of
television's first attempt at interactive broadcasting with the
1950s children's program ``Winky Dink and You,'' died on Feb. 5 at
Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Prichett was a graphic artist at an advertising agency when he
had the idea of turning the television set into a toy and teaching
aid for children. He and a partner, Edwin Brit Wyckoff, a writer,
developed the concept into a highly successful program, which began
a four-year run on CBS in 1954 with Jack Barry as host.
</P>
<P>
   The show returned, with 65 color cartoons, and ran in
syndication from 1969 to 1973. It was revived yet again in the
1990s as a video kit featuring newly digitized cartoons and new
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Winky Dink'' also came with a kit containing a
thin, transparent Magic Screen that young viewers could stick onto
the home set, along with Magic Crayons and a Wipe-Away Woobie
Cloth. Young fans liked the show so much that the network broadcast
it both on Saturdays and Sundays. At its peak, the show drew some
25,000 letters a week from viewers asking for the Magic Kit, which
cost 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   When the show began, the title character, Winky, would tell
viewers to put the plastic sheet against the screen and rub it with
the cloth to force out air bubbles and make the sheet stick. Then
Winky and his dog, Woofer, would go on an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Usually Winky ran into trouble and asked the children to help by
drawing something on the screen, like a bridge over a river. Winky
and Woofer would scoot across the bridge and ask the children to
erase the bridge, leaving the villains stranded. Winky regularly
ran afoul of parents whose offspring would apply their Magic
Crayons directly to the television screen rather than to the
protective transparent sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Prichett was born in Philadelphia and trained at the
Philadelphia School of Art. He first went to work in New York as
assistant to the designer Paul Rand.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he served as an art director and top executive at
various agencies and was associated with the Instructional Resource
Center at the State University of New York at Albany and the Media
Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He directed IBM
World Trade's production staff in Europe and produced award-winning
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Kerry W., of Anchorage, and
Pamela P. Vainsman of Manhattan; a son, Harry W. Jr., also of
Manhattan; and three grandchildren.

GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY TACKLE COMPUTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Some 25 high-tech companies met with
President Clinton top aides Tuesday and agreed they'll work
together to help prevent future attacks on the Internet, so long as
the government does its part, securing its own computers, funding
research and otherwise staying out of their way.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, along with several civil liberties groups and
universities, reached their agreement even as the FBI sought to
question several hackers about last week's Internet attacks, which
slowed or cut off access to at least eight large Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The government's attitude Tuesday, helpful but not intrusive,
won praise from several organizations attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of Internet security is something to be solved by
industry, not by government, and there are many things that can be
done to improve it, without expanding government or infringing on
privacy,'' said Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President seems to understand that and accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said the administration
will work with the high-technology industry ``to build a solid
security foundation for the economic miracle the Internet has
become.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the government will make sure its own computers
aren't contributing to the problem, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the government could modify and enforce federal
computer-crime laws, provide more money for research and
development, and promote information-sharing in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The government is eager to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies and the sector they represent is about 8 percent
of our employment, and they represent over 30 percent of our
economic growth,'' Clinton said. ``The trick is going to be how to
do what needs to be done on security and privacy and still keep
(the Internet) flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded optimistically, ``I don't think we ought to leave
here with this vast sense of insecurity. We ought to leave here
with a sense of confidence that this is a challenge that was
entirely predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   No data is known to have been altered or stolen in the attacks.
No reliable estimate of overall economic loss has emerged, though
some sites were shut down for several hours during the business
day.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks may be been led by hackers known by the screen names
cooolio, mafiaboy and nachoman, whom the FBI said it's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's much too early to call them suspects. We want to talk
to them,'' said a Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley and Attorney General Janet Reno
attended the White House meeting, as did science advisor Neal Lane;
Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget; and
Sandy Berger, director of the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Several the companies hit during last week's attacks were
represented, including megaportal Yahoo! and auction giant eBay.
Representatives of Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett
Packard, Computer Associates and 3Com also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Amazon.com wasn't invited, though it was affected by
the attacks, said company spokeswoman Patty Smith. Also targeted
last week but absent from the meeting were CNN.com, Excite.com,
Buy.com, and online traders E-trade and Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few companies sent their chief executives. Most sent
presidents, chief information officers or senior vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Before their meeting, the group formulated a list of
recommendations for the government, said Alan Paller, director of
research for the SANS Institute, which comprises 98,000 people
concerned with Internet security.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the government should: lead by example in buying
and using security technology, increase public awareness of the
security challenge and what to do about it, increase research
investment, establish a trusted mechanism for sharing security
information, improve training of security technicians, and pay
heightened attention to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of the six things we thought were important were right on
(Daley's) plan,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Though launched by one or more hackers,
distributed-denial-of-service attacks like last weeks' can't
succeed without the unwitting help of universities, companies and
even individuals who don't completely secure their computers and
networks against entry. These can either unknowingly host the
computer code that sends out the Internet-clogging packets of
useless information or amplify those packets in volume so they
become a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week's incidents were ... the first wake-up call for us
in government to make sure our systems have adequate protections,
and all of us are checking our systems at the direction of the
President,'' Commerce Secretary Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Daley) had an idea of how difficult it was to
secure computers, that it was a whole series of actions that need
to be done,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Podesta said, the government will play a supportive role
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Of foremost importance is the government's ``giving a home for
cooperative action'' to the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure
Security, a year-old undertaking by 80 transportation, energy,
communications and high-tech companies to develop mechanisms for
sharing security information across industries, Paller said. The
partnership, which first convened last December in New York, will
meet in Washington again next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments, as well as federal agencies, will
join that partnership, the administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-tech concerns alone, a total of 38 companies and ten
high-tech trade associations have committed to sharing information
and working together to focus on cyberattacks and counter-measures,
said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we can force somebody to tell something they've
found out _ I can only implore them _but everyone realizes now that
we're in this together, and at some point the worm may turn on
them,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   If such information-sharing would violate antitrust laws, or
would put companies at risk of revealing competitive secrets under
the Freedom of Information Act, those laws will be re-examined,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another government move to improve Internet security is
Clinton's request for $50 million in his fiscal 2001 budget to
create the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection,
another research and development organization. He said he has asked
for another $4 million in fiscal 2000 to jump-start the Institute,
which will be housed at the National Institute of Science and
Technology in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Science advisor Neal Lane and National Security Council
coordinator Dick Clarke are scheduled to meet Friday with members
of the president's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology
to help set a research agenda on computer network security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also proposed creating a program to create a federal
``cyberservice,'' in which people can be trained in security
measures and then work for some period, all in exchange for
forgiveness of debts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's attacks came at a propitious time in the Internet's
evolution, said Whitfield Diffie, corporate information officer for
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   January's loosening of export restrictions on highly encrypted
software will provide an incentive for companies to create more
security enhancements for the international market, Diffie
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a global problem,'' Diffie said. ``The 21st century is
going to be a century in which the growth of prosperity is going to
follow the growth of the Internet the way the growth of an embryo
follows the growth of the nervous system. For the first time, the
U.S. has a vested interest in the security of computers
worldwide.''

THOMSON PUTS `TRIBUNES,' OTHER PAPERS ON BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phoenix area's Tribune newspa pers and other papers owned by
Thomson Corp. are being put up for sale as the Toronto-based media
and information giant fo cuses on its Internet-related busi nesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson put about 130 news papers on the auction block Tues day.
It will keep its flagship publication, the Globe and Mail in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The company's properties in Arizona are the East Valley and
Scottsdale Tribunes, the Sun City Daily News-Sun and the Yuma Daily
Sun, all dailies; as well as weeklies Ahwatukee Foothill News,
Surprise Today and Glen dale Prospector.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sale comes less than four years after Thomson
purchased the East Valley and Scottsdale Tribunes. The Tribunes are
Thomson's largest U.S. news paper operation.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been determined whether the 130 newspapers will be
sold as one entity or broken up, said Stuart Garner, president and
chief executive officer of Thomson Newspapers, the Stam ford,
Conn.-based subsidiary that's up for sale, adding the company has
received a ``signifi cant amount of interest'' from potential
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson expects the deal will close during the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Wittmer, the Tribunes' publisher and corporate vice
president responsible for the Ari zona properties, said there has
been some anxiety among the 560 workers. But she added that the
Phoenix area's second-largest newspa per operation after The
Arizona Republic is an established busi ness with a strong
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area officials reacted with surprise to see their
one-time home-grown newspapers sold again. Among the newspapers
that had been rolled into the Tribune masthead, only to see their
names disappear, were the Tempe Daily News, Scottsdale Progress,
Mesa Tribune and Chandler Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose the name of who you are, I think you lose a
little bit of the community,'' said Charlie Deaton, president of
the Mesa Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa hasn't had a locally owned newspaper since the late 1970s,
when Cox Enterprises bought the Tribune. ``I guess the days of the
local news are a thing of the past,'' Mesa Mayor Wayne Brown
lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Mayor Sam Cam pana said she hoped the new owners will
make a long-term commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tribune provides daily coverage and we need that voice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Johnson, senior vice pres ident of news and executive edi
tor of The Republic, said it's too early to know what the proposed
sale would mean to the Phoenix area's publishing competition.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson had $6.2 billion in total revenue in 1998. Nearly 85
percent of its sales come from publishing specialized informa tion
such as legal analysis, bro kerage research, educational textbooks
and medical journals.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson is focusing more these days on providing informa tion
online and through CD-ROMs and computer software, according to
Hoover's Online.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson expects within five years to have 80 percent of revenue
generated by electronic products and services, Richard J.
Harrington, Thomson's president and chief executive officer, said
in a prepared statement. &QL;

AMERICA WEST FREE TO ADD JETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - The FAA will allow America West to add aircraft to
its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes three weeks after the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration threatened to bar new planes until America West
improved its maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Than, after a review of the carrier's operations, the FAA de
termined that America West can expand its fleet and maintain the
aircraft to the required stand ards, FAA spokesman Mitch Barker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA concluded that there was no need for restrictions, which
is exactly what America West expected, company spokes woman Patty
Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West will add 14 new Airbus aircraft to its
fleet of 124 Airbus and Boeing planes this year, with the first
arriving Friday and five more by the end of May, she said.
</P>
<P>
   America West is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan to in
crease capacity 10 percent per year over the next three years, she
said. That includes adding new markets and increasing fre quency on
existing routes.
</P>
<P>
   America West will add service to New Orleans; Hartford, Conn.;
Spokane, Wash.; and Boise, Idaho, by early May. &QL;

DEFENSE SEES RUSH TO JUDGE IN CASE OF MOTHER AND SON ACCUSED OF
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for the mother and son accused of murdering
an Upper East Side woman opened their defense Tuesday by describing
the case as a miscarriage of justice comparable to the cases of the
boxer Rubin Carter and of Richard Jewell, who was wrongly accused
of planting a bomb at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetorical flourishes comparing the defendants, Sante and
Kenneth Kimes, to Carter, who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder before his conviction was overturned, Jewell and
others drew angry retorts from Justice Rena K. Uviller of state
Supreme Court in Manhattan, who frequently interrupted the opening
statements by the defense lawyers, Michael Hardy and Mel A. Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was a rush to judgment,'' said Sachs, who is
representing Kenneth Kimes. ``The evidence will show this case is
akin to Richard Jewel and Hurricane Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Uviller, who interrupted Sachs' opening statement 19 times,
replied: ``Mr. Sachs, your time is up. We are not talking about
Hurricane Carter, we are not talking about Sacco and Vanzetti, and
we are not talking about Abraham Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statements, the lawyers argued that the Kimeses
had been wrongly caught up by the public's demand that the police
quickly discover what happened to the woman, Irene Silverman, who
was 82 when she disappeared on July 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's body has never been found, and prosecutors have been
forced to build a complex circumstantial case against Kenneth
Kimes, 24, and Mrs. Kimes, 65, who the prosecutors say killed
Silverman as part of an elaborate scheme to seize control of her
$10 million town house on East 65th Street.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutors began laying the foundation of that case Tuesday
afternoon with a witness, Mengistu Melesse, 32, who worked as a
caretaker for Silverman for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Melesse described how Silverman never let anyone use her house
keys, which were found in Kenneth Kimes' possession when he was
arrested, according to prosecutors. Kimes was renting a
$6,000-a-month apartment in Silverman's town house. Melesse also
testified that Silverman kept $10,000 in crisp bills neatly
arranged in envelopes in her closet; the prosecution had noted on
Monday that $10,000 in new bills was in Mrs. Kimes' handbag when
she was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, Hardy, who is representing Mrs. Kimes,
said the circumstantial case being presented by the prosecution
would not prove that the Kimeses murdered Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theory is like mist on glass,'' he said. ``We, ladies and
gentlemen, through our cross-examination and witnesses will clear
that mist so you can see the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's opening drew some admonishment from the judge _ she
interrupted him three times, including in one instance when he said
that some of the prosecution's evidence was based on hearsay. The
judge told the jurors that she would decide what was hearsay.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the judge's ire was directed toward Sachs. Every
time he said the prosecution's case was weak because it lacked
forensic evidence like blood, DNA or hair, Uviller rolled her eyes
toward the clock, frowned and stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence will show there is no DNA,'' Sachs said. ``DNA is
like the finger of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Uviller said, ``Let's keep the finger of God out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the course of her interruptions, Uviller accused Sachs of
impermissibly characterizing evidence as weak, exceeding his role
as a lawyer, wrongly referencing other cases and discussing optical
illusions.
</P>
<P>
   The interruptions had at least two jurors struggling to hide
their laughter. One lowered her head as a broad smile crossed her
face, and another held his hand over his face, chuckling visibly
when the Uviller called Sachs to the bench to berate him privately.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs was planning an hour-long opening, but after 45 minutes,
Uviller sent the jurors to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Mr. Sachs,'' she said. ``I believe your opening is
concluded.''

`HURRICANE' MOTIVATES A REAL CRITIC
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cal Deal admires Denzel Washington's skill in front of a camera,
but he did not applaud Washington's nomination Tuesday for the best
actor Oscar. Deal maintains a Web site titled, ``Hurricane Carter:
The Other Side of the Story,'' and it portrays a lying thug who
bears little resemblance to the martyr played by Washington in the
movie ``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appalls me to see a man I consider a triple-murderer put on
a pedestal,'' said Deal, whose view is controversial, to say the
least. It is absent in the movie and in much of the press coverage
of the case. But it is not unique, either, at least not among those
who have been following the case as long as Deal has.
</P>
<P>
   Deal is in some ways an unlikely crusader against Carter. He
describes himself as a liberal Democrat who opposes the death
penalty because innocent men have been put on death row. And he
started out thinking that Carter was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first interviewed Carter in prison in 1975,'' Deal
said, ``I assumed he'd been framed based on what I'd read in The
New York Times and the Newark Star-Ledger.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal, now 50, was then a reporter for the Herald News in Passaic
County, N.J., where Carter, a middleweight boxer, had been
convicted of killing three people at a bar in Paterson in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke for a couple of hours in prison, and he was very
passionate and persuasive,'' Deal said. ``I came out more convinced
that he was innocent. But there was one thing that gave me doubt.
We offered to arrange a lie detector test to bolster his case, and
he adamantly refused to take it. Then we went out and checked out
some of the things he told us, and we found out he wasn't telling
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal became one of the few journalists to interview the
witnesses extensively in the case. He challenged many aspects of
Carter's story, including his assertion that he had passed a lie
detector test administered by the police shortly after the murders.
Deal and colleagues with the Herald News reported in 1976 that
Carter had actually flunked the test.
</P>
<P>
   Deal's Web site contains what he says is the report from that
first test, as well as many court documents, news articles,
interview transcripts and a map illustrating the theory that Carter
fled the bar after indiscriminately shooting at white patrons to
avenge a murder that night of a black man by a white man. The site
(www.graphicwitness.com/carter) subjects Bob Dylan's song,
``Hurricane,'' to a line-by-line analysis that is not kind to
Dylan's reportorial abilities. It also contrasts Carter's portrait
in the film with his criminal record of robbery and assault, and
with accounts of his violent past. One magazine quotes his bragging
about the time he slugged an uncooperative horse. In other articles
he is accused by a woman _ one of the fund-raisers for his defense
_ of beating her so badly that she had to be hospitalized. Carter
denied her accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's lawyer, Myron Beldock, called Deal's Web site ``a
scandalous attempt to remake history and distort the facts.'' He
said he believed the lie detector report was a forgery, possibly by
the police, and faulted Deal for presenting evidence that was
``thoroughly discredited'' during Carter's retrial in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But that second trial, like the first, ended in Carter's
conviction. (And while Carter considers himself a victim of the
white legal system, the jury included two blacks.) Carter was never
exonerated; he was released in 1985 when a federal judge ruled
there had been procedural errors during the second trial, and
prosecutors decided not to try him a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Deal continued to follow the case after leaving New Jersey for
other newspapers and eventually for a new career running a graphics
service in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``People tell me I should write a
book about Carter, but I don't want to make any money on this,'' he
said. ``I'm just doing the Web site out of a sense of right and
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal said he was not happy to see Carter recently welcomed at
the White House and the United Nations. Nor was he pleased when
Washington presented Carter to the audience at the Golden Globe
awards by saying, ``This man right here is love. He's all love.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal said, ``I just wish I could sit down with Denzel Washington
or Bob Dylan and explain the facts to them. It's irresponsible of
them not to do their homework. Carter's defenders have seized on a
few inconsistencies in the case, but if you look at the big
picture, it fits together. He's guilty.''

MOHEGANS TO ANNOUNCE AN $800 MILLION CASINO EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Straight out of the depressed backwoods of
southeastern Connecticut, an incongruous image emerges: a
glittering 40-story hotel, a 10,000-seat sports arena and a second
casino building featuring a perforated-steel planetarium 150 feet
in diameter on its ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But that _ and more _ is what Mohegan Indian tribal leaders will
unveil Wednesday as part of a planned $800 million expansion, the
latest volley in the battle for gambling dollars being waged by
Connecticut Indian tribes against one another and by both together
against the moguls of Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year-old Mohegan Sun casino, in Montville, 128 miles
from New York City, plans to offer visitors a sprawling
entertainment complex built to rival the enormously lucrative
Foxwoods Resort Casino run by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe 10
miles to the east in Ledyard.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Mohegans' expansion is complete, probably in two years,
both tribes expect Connecticut's gambling industry to significantly
cut into the drawing power of better-known casinos in this country
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make Connecticut much more a force compared to
Atlantic City,'' said Mitchell G. Etess, executive vice president
of marketing for Mohegan Sun, now the fourth-largest casino in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bob DeSalvio, a vice president of marketing at Foxwoods Resort
Casino, went a step further, saying, ``I think that Connecticut is
becoming a very powerful force in the gaming industry nationally
and internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the Mohegans' gambling operation is also
expected to double the 20,000 daily visitors to their casino and
add 4,000 jobs to the entire complex, which currently employs 5,500
workers, Etess said.
</P>
<P>
   The $325 million Mohegan Sun opened in October 1996; the much
larger Foxwoods Resort Casino opened in Ledyard in 1992. The two
tribes are the only two in Connecticut recognized as tribes by the
federal government, a necessary prerequisite to opening a casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohegans expect that their new casino's debut, expected in
April 2002, will push gross gambling revenues to ``well over a
billion'' dollars annually from about $750 million, Etess said.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the casino expansion project, designed by the New York
City firms of Kohn Pedersen Fox and Rockwellgroup, is expected to
add a total of 4 million combined square feet of gambling, retail
and entertainment space.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the monolithic hotel tower will be a landmark visible
from Long Island, across Long Island Sound, its designers say.
Inside, natural light will filter into the new casino and refract
off crystals and panels _ 26,000 square feet in all _ of
translucent woven multicolored beads, said David Rockwell, an
architect with Rockwellgroup. Where the existing casino has an
Earth-based theme, the new casino is meant to convey the notion of
sky, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Above the new casino's slot machines and gambling tables will
hang a giant steel planetarium with a 65-foot cropping of backlit
black onyx, Rockwell said. The hotel lobby will feature 10 abstract
wooden sculptures in the form of trees whose arching canopies will
be made of beads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the chance to create something that is much more
than just a casino,'' Rockwell said in an interview Tuesday. ``This
is going to take it to a way, way different level.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more conventional plane, the project blueprints also call
for a cavernous retail mall and what Mohegan Sun officials say will
be the largest ballroom in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Grand as the $800 million construction project is, it will leave
the Mohegans' casino complex measurably smaller than Foxwoods,
which the Pequot leaders have called the world's largest casino.
The expanded Mohegan Sun, for instance, will have 280,000 square
feet of gambling space, compared with 315,310 square feet at
Foxwoods. The new Mohegan hotel, which will rival the tallest
structure in Connecticut, City Place 1 in Hartford, will have 1,200
rooms; Foxwoods has 1,416.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohegans were planning to release further details of the
casino's dimensions and design at noon Wednesday at Rockefeller
Center.
</P>
<P>
   From a labor standpoint, the casino expansion ``is a wonderful
thing,'' said Donald M. Peppard Jr., a professor of economics at
Connecticut College in New London. ``Ten years ago, this area was
sort of an employment disaster.'' On the other hand, there is
already a shortage of able workers. Once the casino begins hiring,
he said, ``If you're another employer around here, you're going to
be pulling your hair out.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppard said that roughly half the gamblers at the casino were
Connecticut residents.
</P>
<P>
   In New London, about 15 miles south of the casino, most people
welcome the expansion, said Riochard Brown, the city manager. ``I
think the expansion is positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the expansion is meant to steal some of the monstrous
revenues from Foxwoods _ which industry analysts have estimated to
be over $1 billion a year _ Mashantucket Pequot leaders said they
wished their rivals well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're firm believers that the project that they're putting
forth is actually very good for the region,'' DeSalvio said,
adding, ``We wish them well.''

NASA FINDS WAYS TO KEEP MAP MISSION ON SCHEDULE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA grew increasingly optimistic Tuesday that a growing list of
fuel conservation measures aboard the shuttle Endeavour will enable
it to complete an Earth mapping mission despite a setback earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The list of ways to either eliminate or ease off fuel-consuming
maneuvers grew to 18 Tuesday, including two discovered unexpectedly
as the shuttle crew expelled wastewater and astronaut Gerhard
Thiele pedaled furiously on an exercise bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   In combination, the measures could enable the Endeavour
astronauts to continue mapping the Earth's major land masses with a
powerful radar system through Sunday night, their objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite optimistic that we are not going to fold our tent
early,'' said NASA's Milt Heflin, mission operations director.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was jeopardized over the weekend when a tiny
nitrogen-fueled thruster on the tip of the shuttle's 200-foot-long
radar mast stopped functioning. The thruster helped to aim a radar
receiver at the tip of the mast. The loss forced shuttle steering
jets to take over the aiming task. The higher-than-expected fuel
use aboard Endeavour threatened to force an early end to the
mapping unless conservation measures were found quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I'm talking about are nickel, dime and quarter
sorts of gains,'' Heflin said as he spelled out steps that allow
the shuttle crew to let up slightly on the accuracy of their
antenna pointing as well as skip or ease up on the rate of other
maneuvers. ``But if you do them over hours and days, you can build
up to where you have mission completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is thinking of anything it can do to help. Everyone
is getting into the act, which is great.''
</P>
<P>
   One controller noticed that a lot of fuel was being used to
steady Endeavour as wastewater flowed constantly through an
evaporator in the shuttle's radiator. He suggested saving fuel by
jettisoning the fluid in periodic bursts.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had to pass on one fuel-saving method because of the amount
of human energy required.
</P>
<P>
   While Germany's Thiele was exercising on the cycling machine
Tuesday, flight controllers detected a slight improvement in the
position of the shuttle and the mast. The momentum of the wheel was
nudging the shuttle in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele's pedaling had the same effect as a gyroscope on the
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was actually a noticeable difference,'' Heflin said.
``It's real.'' Nonetheless, there were no plans to pull the shuttle
astronauts away from radar operations to exercise more.
</P>
<P>
   As they orbit the Earth, Endeavour's astronauts are beaming
radar signals at the rippled terrain below. As they bounce back
into space, the signals are gathered by antennas in the shuttle's
payload bay and on the tip of the mast and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings will be processed with computers to convert the
signals into elevation readings of the Earth's terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The new maps will have at least twice the accuracy and much more
detail than any previous global topography, according to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Tom Farr, the deputy chief scientist for the mapping
mission, said the mapping effort is right on schedule despite
concerns over fuel usage.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, the shuttle had mapped nearly 30 million square
miles of terrain, or just over 60 percent of the mission goal. The
area is equivalent to all of the land within the continents of
Africa, North and South America combined.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13 million square miles had been scanned at least
twice as of Tuesday, about one-third of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major geographical features obtained Tuesday
included San Salvador, the first landfall for Christopher Columbus
as he reached the new world; the lost city of Ubar on the Arabian
peninsula, an ancient trading center; and Mount Everest in Nepal,
the world's highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the great scientific flights we've had on the
space shuttle, as far as being able to produce useful information
to the people of Earth _ you, me and everyone else,'' Endeavour
astronaut Janet Kavandi told a group of students gathered at
Sitting Bull College in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief question-and-answer session from orbit, Kavandi
told the students the more accurate topography would make it safer
for airline pilots as they approached airports in foggy weather as
well as improve highway and bridge construction.

 &HT;    Bush surge talk of the town
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Bill Beck is leaning toward voting for John
McCain in South Carolina's Republican presidential primary after
watching Tuesday's nationally televised debate on big-screen
televisions in a popular nightspot here.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Beck, 47, was torn between McCain and Bush. But with
two children in the military, he said he likes McCain's view that
the federal budget surplus be used to bolster U.S. armed forces and
veterans benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting next to him, Beck's friend, Tom Shea, said he had
gained new respect for long-shot Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keyes does not waver from his stands,'' said Shea, 53, sitting
at the bar of Jillian's, a cavernous old train station rented out
by McCain's staff for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Though support for Bush was largely absent amid the McCain
supporters eating chicken wings and drinking beer, the Texas
governor's recent emergence as the frontrunner is the talk of South
Carolina as it prepares for Saturday's pivotal primary.
</P>
<P>
   And one viewer was impressed by the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Penn, 24, a Charleston fireman, is still undecided but said
Bush ``carries himself as though he is already president. McCain, I
think, is trying to push too hard for votes. I'd wish he'd relax
more.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain ``needs to show that he is the real thing and convey that
in a decent fashion without attacking George Bush,'' said Virginia
Derby, 52, a McCain supporter from New Orleans who traveled with
the campaign in New Hampshire and now in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Derby said she was pleased that McCain
''appeared calm...not strident.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A president has to keep his cool,'' said Dyann Trosten, 46, a
McCain supporter. ''Bush is desperate; that is why he came out
punching. He is too antagnostic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to see something new - not something polished,'' said
John Bass, 35, an engineer in Columbia who supports McCain. But he
worries that recent Bush ads portraying McCain as too liberal might
sway conversative South Carolinians to vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain drew loud applause from the crowd of several hundred when
he called for an end to negative ads, but neither he nor Bush could
agree who was responsible for starting them.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jordan, a computer salesman in Myrtle Beach, said he
expects Bush to win the South Carolina primary and the Republican
nomination. As a McCain supporter, he said, ''I think they'd be a
pretty good team in the fall, if they weren't so vicious to each
other now.''

ALVIN M. LIBERMAN, 82, EXPERT IN STUDY OF SPEECH PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin M. Liberman, a retired professor of psychology and
linguistics whose innovative research was influential in the study
of speech perception, died on Jan. 13 at a hospital in Mansfield
Center, Conn. He was 82 and lived in Mansfield Center.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications after open-heart surgery, said Dr.
Michael Studdert-Kennedy, a psychologist and colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was a former president and director of research at
Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, Conn., which is affiliated with
Yale University and researches speech and reading.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his research was devoted to speech perception, or the
way people identify the consonants and vowels that make up words.
He was particularly intrigued by the question of why the sounds of
speech are so much swifter and more effective in conveying
linguistic information than are any other sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speech is not an arbitrary signal that just happened to be
available as language evolved,'' said Studdert-Kennedy, another
former president of Haskins, explaining the insights yielded by
Liberman's work. ``Rather, speech is an integral part of language
itself. Consonants and vowels, the discrete elements essential for
a sizable lexicon, do not combine like beads on a string, but are
overlapped, or encoded, into syllables. Speed is thus purchased at
the price of complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, Liberman, his wife, Dr. Isabelle Yoffe
Liberman, and others at Haskins Laboratories conducted research
about reading. An expert on reading disabilities, Isabelle Liberman
died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Their studies are credited with having done much to bring
recognition of the concept that children who have trouble learning
to read almost invariably are unable to learn easily how to break a
word into its component consonants and vowels.
</P>
<P>
   While conducting research at Haskins, Liberman was on the
faculty at the University of Connecticut and was head of the
psychology department there in the 1960s. He was also an adjunct
professor of linguistics at Yale for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and
the National Academy of Sciences. He received the Distinguished
Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological
Association and the Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental
Psychologists. In 1997, he received the Outstanding Scientific
Contribution Award of the Society for the Scientific Study of
Reading.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Joseph, Mo., Liberman received bachelor's and
master's degrees from the University of Missouri and a doctorate in
psychology in 1942 from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Mark, of Philadelphia, and Charles,
of Milton, Mass.; a daughter, Sarah Ash of Raleigh, N.C.; and nine
grandchildren.

 &HT;    Room at the table for squabbling
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ If Tuesday night's debate of the three
surviving Republican candidates has any lasting impact on the
election, it may be remembered as the battle of the elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Scrunched around an odd-shaped table with suspendered
interviewer Larry King, the candidates were seated close enough to
each other that they had to look chummy when this session began and
increasingly crowded as the debate heated up.
</P>
<P>
   The elbows got sharper when the debate turned to the way the
candidates on either end of the table, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Arizona Sen. John McCain, have been waging their South Carolina
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going out to 202 countries,'' said the candidate in the
middle, Alan Keyes, after Bush and McCain had a sharp exchange over
their respective negative ads. ``Is this kind of pointless
squabbling what we really want them to see?''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes somewhat undercut his own stance on pettiness moments
later when tossed out the accusation that McCain's campaign has
been serving beer to underaged volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative broadcaster's position at this table had a
considerable effect on how the debate turned out.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of this 90-minute encounter, South Carolina's
voters had the chance to hear Bush and McCain spell out some
important differences, and not just those that have come up
frequently in the campaign. McCain, for instance, voiced a greater
willingness to intervene in foreign emergencies such as Rwanda than
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be times when a superpower has to do things that
other countries don't have to do,'' McCain said. Bush couched his
answer much more narrowly in terms of national interests.
</P>
<P>
   But any voters who expected to see a decisive face-off between
the two was frustrated by the candidate in the middle. Throughout
the session he was an insistent buffer, stealing the thunder of the
other two Republicans and filling airtime like a seasoned pro.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason he was sitting at the table, Keyes asserted, is
because he articulates ``better than anyone else'' the GOP's
conservative principles. That articulateness was honed in a
call-back radio format not unlike what King employs.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a better forum, in fact, if Keyes could have
debated King and left Bush and McCain to go directly at each other.
</P>
<P>
   At first wink, it would seem McCain probably was hurt most by
the refracted nature of the debate, because he needs to convince
voters that his message stands out from the standard political
signal noise.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also has a message he needs to get across, not just for
Saturday's primary but for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the question: Who can lead?'' Bush said, reiterating a
point he has been making since the beginning of his campaign. He
labored mightily to stand out as the answer to that question, but
at times seemed visibly impatient with the debate and frustrated
about getting his points in.
</P>
<P>
   McCain charged that ``the Republican party has lost its way''
and needs to open itself _ to the sort of independents and
Democrats who might be drawn to vote for him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has talked about opening the party, but not so much,
in this debate. For the next four days, with the nomination on the
line, it will be reliable Republican votes he'll be chasing.

IN HOT DEBATE, BUSH AND MCCAIN COLLIDE OVER CAMPAIGN'S TACTICS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page)  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In a barely controlled debate that revealed the
depth of their mutual anger, Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain lashed into each other's negative campaign tactics Tuesday
night, refusing to drop the subject even when the moderator, Larry
King, urged them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, McCain stated that Bush ``should be ashamed'' that
a surrogate had accused McCain of abandoning the cause of veterans.
Bush refused McCain's demand that he apologize, instead insisting
that McCain stop impugning his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, the last before Saturday's crucial South Carolina
primary, was by far the most freewheeling and intense of the
Republican contest so far. The debate ranged across nearly every
issue that has come up in the Republican race, and then a few more.
With only Alan Keyes sitting between them, the candidates argued
forcefully over abortion, policy toward Russia, taxes, Social
Security, the don't-ask-don't-tell policy on gays in the military
and the reform of the campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   But their most heated exchanges came early in the 90-minute
debate on CNN, when King asked about the conduct of the campaign.
Bush immediately accused McCain of being first to break a promise
not to run negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shook hands, and unfortunately he ran an ad that equated me
to Bill Clinton,'' Bush said, sounding exasperated. ``You can
disagree on issues. We'll debate issues. But whatever you do, don't
equate my integrity and trustworthiness to Bill Clinton. That's
about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, steely but furious, immediately responded by citing an
event early this month in Sumter, S.C., in which J. Thomas Burch
Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans
Committee, complained that McCain had opposed measures dealing with
both Agent Orange and gulf war syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can understand this, George, but that
really hurts,'' McCain said. ``You should be ashamed. You should be
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, the most conservative candidate in the field, had been
expected to spend the evening criticizing McCain. Instead he worked
to appear above the fray and condemned both of his opponents,
saying there were more important issues to discuss than campaign
tactics. King also tried to switch the subject, but McCain pressed
on, demanding to tell about negative telephone calls about him that
he said were being made to South Carolina voters by the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then pulled out a McCain flier criticizing his tax cut
plan, accusing McCain of continuing his attacks despite a new vow
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the earlier debates among the Republican
contenders, a significant portion of the debate involved foreign
policy questions. The candidates were asked what aspects of the
nation's foreign policy they would change. Both Bush and Keyes
criticized American policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
   McCain urged a particularly aggressive approach toward what he
called rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd institute a policy that I call rogue state rollback,'' he
said. ``I would arm, train, equip, both from without and from
within, forces that would eventually overthrow the governments and
install free and democratically elected governments.'' He added,
``Until those governments are overthrown, they will pose a threat
to U.S. national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain also tangled over when it was appropriate for
the United States to intervene in foreign conflicts. Bush said he
would authorize the use of armed forces when it is in the
``nation's strategic interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Europe is in our national strategic interests. The
Far East is in our national strategic interests. Our own hemisphere
is in our national strategic interests. The Middle East _
protecting Israel _ is in our national strategic interest. And I'll
give you one clear example in our own hemisphere. If for whatever
reason somebody tries to block passage through the Panama Canal, as
president of the United States, I will make sure the Panama Canal
remains open for trade. It's in our interests to have a hemisphere
that is peaceful and open for trade.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Bush his analysis ``wasn't that simple,'' saying
``There are time when our principles and our values are so offended
that we have to do what we can to resolve a terrible situation. If
Rwanda again became a scene of horrible genocide, if there was a
way that the United States could stop that and beneficially affect
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But we can never say that a nation driven by
Judeo-Christian principles will only intervene where our interests
are threatened, because we also have values. And those values are
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates sparred across a range of social issues. Keyes
unleashed a scathing attack on Bush for campaigning at Bob Jones
University and not condemning its policy banning interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does leadership exist'' he asked, in going to a university
where there are serious questions of bigotry and ``risking
nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what George W. Bush did,'' Keyes said. He also
implicitly criticized McCain, speaking of those ``who stay away''
and do not confront the issue. He told how he went to Bob Jones,
and said he was a black Roman Catholic married to an
Indian-American woman.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush protested, saying ``Please don't insinuate in any way
shape or form'' that he accepted bigotry, Keyes shot back, ``You
said nothing about the religious bigotry and racial bigotry that
had in fact to be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part McCain said wryly, ``Well, Alan I've taken a few
risks in my life.'' He said he had not been invited to speak at Bob
Jones. If he had, he said he would have started any speech by
saying the ban on interracial dating ``is stupid, it's idiotic and
it's incredibly cruel for many people.'' He added that he has an
adopted daughter from Bangladesh and that he would ``stand up and
fight against those'' who would limit her life choices.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the candidates segued into Bush's refusal to meet
with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group. McCain said, ``I, as
president of the United States and as nominee of my party, will
meet with, not necessarily agree with, every member of the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   All three tried to make the most forceful case for their
candidacy. Bush stressed his executive experience as governor of
Texas, saying of his two opponents, ``These are good men. Don't get
me wrong. But I've been there.'' McCain said he was the one to
reconstitute the Reagan coalition of Republicans, independents and
Democrats. Keyes scoffed at both men as not forceful enough,
saying, ``I question their ability to articulate on the moral
issues of our time.''

GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY TACKLE COMPUTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Some 25 high-tech companies met with
President Clinton top aides Tuesday and agreed they'll work
together to help prevent future attacks on the Internet, so long as
the government does its part, securing its own computers, funding
research and otherwise staying out of their way.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, along with several civil liberties groups and
universities, reached their agreement even as the FBI sought to
question several hackers about last week's Internet attacks, which
slowed or cut off access to at least eight large Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The government's attitude Tuesday, helpful but not intrusive,
won praise from several organizations attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of Internet security is something to be solved by
industry, not by government, and there are many things that can be
done to improve it, without expanding government or infringing on
privacy,'' said Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President seems to understand that and accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said the administration
will work with the high-technology industry ``to build a solid
security foundation for the economic miracle the Internet has
become.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the government will make sure its own computers
aren't contributing to the problem, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the government could modify and enforce federal
computer-crime laws, provide more money for research and
development, and promote information-sharing in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The government is eager to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies and the sector they represent is about 8 percent
of our employment, and they represent over 30 percent of our
economic growth,'' Clinton said. ``The trick is going to be how to
do what needs to be done on security and privacy and still keep
(the Internet) flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded optimistically, ``I don't think we ought to leave
here with this vast sense of insecurity. We ought to leave here
with a sense of confidence that this is a challenge that was
entirely predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   No data is known to have been altered or stolen in the attacks.
No reliable estimate of overall economic loss has emerged, though
some sites were shut down for several hours during the business
day.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks may be been led by hackers known by the screen names
cooolio, mafiaboy and nachoman, whom the FBI said it's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's much too early to call them suspects. We want to talk
to them,'' said a Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley and Attorney General Janet Reno
attended the White House meeting, as did science advisor Neal Lane;
Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget; and
Sandy Berger, director of the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Several the companies hit during last week's attacks were
represented, including megaportal Yahoo! and auction giant eBay.
Representatives of Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett
Packard, Computer Associates and 3Com also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Amazon.com wasn't invited, though it was affected by
the attacks, said company spokeswoman Patty Smith. Also targeted
last week but absent from the meeting were CNN.com, Excite.com,
Buy.com, and online traders E-trade and Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few companies sent their chief executives. Most sent
presidents, chief information officers or senior vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Before their meeting, the group formulated a list of
recommendations for the government, said Alan Paller, director of
research for the SANS Institute, which comprises 98,000 people
concerned with Internet security.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the government should: lead by example in buying
and using security technology, increase public awareness of the
security challenge and what to do about it, increase research
investment, establish a trusted mechanism for sharing security
information, improve training of security technicians, and pay
heightened attention to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of the six things we thought were important were right on
(Daley's) plan,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Though launched by one or more hackers,
distributed-denial-of-service attacks like last weeks' can't
succeed without the unwitting help of universities, companies and
even individuals who don't completely secure their computers and
networks against entry. These can either unknowingly host the
computer code that sends out the Internet-clogging packets of
useless information or amplify those packets in volume so they
become a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week's incidents were ... the first wake-up call for us
in government to make sure our systems have adequate protections,
and all of us are checking our systems at the direction of the
President,'' Commerce Secretary Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Daley) had an idea of how difficult it was to
secure computers, that it was a whole series of actions that need
to be done,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Podesta said, the government will play a supportive role
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Of foremost importance is the government's ``giving a home for
cooperative action'' to the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure
Security, a year-old undertaking by 80 transportation, energy,
communications and high-tech companies to develop mechanisms for
sharing security information across industries, Paller said. The
partnership, which first convened last December in New York, will
meet in Washington again next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments, as well as federal agencies, will
join that partnership, the administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-tech concerns alone, a total of 38 companies and ten
high-tech trade associations have committed to sharing information
and working together to focus on cyberattacks and counter-measures,
said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we can force somebody to tell something they've
found out _ I can only implore them _but everyone realizes now that
we're in this together, and at some point the worm may turn on
them,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   If such information-sharing would violate antitrust laws, or
would put companies at risk of revealing competitive secrets under
the Freedom of Information Act, those laws will be re-examined,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another government move to improve Internet security is
Clinton's request for $50 million in his fiscal 2001 budget to
create the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection,
another research and development organization. He said he has asked
for another $4 million in fiscal 2000 to jump-start the Institute,
which will be housed at the National Institute of Science and
Technology in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Science advisor Neal Lane and National Security Council
coordinator Dick Clarke are scheduled to meet Friday with members
of the president's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology
to help set a research agenda on computer network security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also proposed creating a program to create a federal
``cyberservice,'' in which people can be trained in security
measures and then work for some period, all in exchange for
forgiveness of debts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's attacks came at a propitious time in the Internet's
evolution, said Whitfield Diffie, corporate information officer for
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   January's loosening of export restrictions on highly encrypted
software will provide an incentive for companies to create more
security enhancements for the international market, Diffie
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a global problem,'' Diffie said. ``The 21st century is
going to be a century in which the growth of prosperity is going to
follow the growth of the Internet the way the growth of an embryo
follows the growth of the nervous system. For the first time, the
U.S. has a vested interest in the security of computers
worldwide.''

 &HT;    Chastain praises women's league plan
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's best women's soccer players may have a professional
league of their own by 2001. And young girls may have a new source
of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my soccer career is due to the fact that I had a
(North American Soccer League) team to watch,'' said defender
Brandi Chastain, who became famous for ripping off her jersey and
revealing a black sports bra after the U.S. beat China in the World
Cup final last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how excited I was to watch George Best, Pele
and Franz Beckenbauer when I was a kid,'' she said. ``They were my
heroes. I can't wait for young girls to see us compete and for us
to give something back to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, investors announced plans for the Women's United
Soccer Association, which would begin play in April 2001 It would
be the first professional women's league in the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are leagues for women in other countries, such as England,
Italy, Germany, Sweden and Brazil, but most players aren't paid.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. players said that during the World Cup, some foreign
players expressed interest in playing in an American pro league.
The WUSA eventually would like to sign international stars, but
currently the emphasis is on recruiting Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of talented post-college players out there who
have been waiting for something like this,'' said former U.S.
women's coach Tony DiCicco, an adviser to the WUSA.

 &HT;    McCain, Bush continue to point fingers
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ George W. Bush and John McCain traded charges
of negative campaigning Tuesday in the final debate before
Saturday's primary here.
</P>
<P>
   The informal setting _ the set of CNN's Larry King Live -_
belied a tense atmosphere that included sharp exchanges on a number
of topics throughout the 90-minute debate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Bush he ``should be ashamed'' of appearing at a
campaign event with a veteran who questioned McCain's commitment to
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain's ad comparing his trustworthiness to Bill
Clinton's was ``as low a blow as you can give.''
</P>
<P>
   King made no attempt to interrupt the squabble, though, as Bush
and McCain recited grievances against one another stemming from
several heated weeks of campaigning for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stunned Bush, the national front-runner, two weeks ago
with a landslide victory in New Hampshire's primary, and South
Carolina shapes up as a pivotal test for the two men.
</P>
<P>
   A confident Bush time and again cast himself as a reformer and
as the voice of experience in his battle with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have come lately to the reform agenda. I've been there
for years,'' McCain said in reply.
</P>
<P>
   In response to King's questions about whether it has become a
``dirty campaign,'' McCain and Bush continued the finger-pointing
that has marked the race for the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said McCain started it with an ad questioning Bush's
trustworthiness and comparing it to Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of smiled my way through the early primaries and got
defined,'' said Bush. ``I'm not going to let it happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Bush started it by having his surrogates compare his
policies to Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn on the radio, turn on the television, unfortunately now
pick up the telephone and you will hear a negative attack against
John McCain,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ,And then, his voice taking an even more serious tone, McCain
complained about a Bush event at which Thomas Burch, leader of a
little-known veterans organization, stood next to Bush and charged
that McCain has done little for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can understand this, George, that really
hurts,'' said McCain. ``That really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded by saying he respects McCain's military record
and ``that man wasn't speaking for me,'' though he appeared at a
Bush rally.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then tried to turn it around, recalling that former New
Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman, a McCain backer, criticized the
Christian Coalition as ``bigots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you don't believe that, do you?'' Bush asked McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is entitled to his opinion,'' McCain replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``So is this man,'' Bush said, referring to the veteran who
criticized McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes,the other Republican candidate, noted that the debate
was beamed to more than 200 countries. ``Is this kind of pointless
squabbling really what we want them to see?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   King , in trademark shirt sleeves and suspenders, also led Bush
and McCain into a discussion of the campaign's major theme: Who's
the Washington insider and who is the outsider? King noted that
Bush is the favorite of the GOP establishment, including the
party's governors and senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a look at the three of us and decided that I ought
to be the leader. They are looking for fresh voices from outside,''
said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, pulling out a stump-speech line, noted that he is never
picked as the Senate's ``Miss Congeniality'' and has railed against
the ``iron triangle of special interests, money and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My credentials are well-known,'' he said. ``But I'll tell you
the Republican Party has lost its way. They have selected an
establishment candidate. I don't blame them for doing it. They lost
the last two presidential elections. They lost the last two
congressional election.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, McCain sought to counter charges that he is
insufficiently committed to the his party's position against
abortion rights. He said he and Bush share the same position -- a
constitutional ban on abortions with some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes told McCain and Bush they were both being inconsistent by
refusing to rule out abortions when it might involve members of
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth can you represent a party that would take away
from every other American woman what you would give to your
daughter?'' Keyes asked McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences extended to less contentious issues as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the use of the American military should be restricted
to instances involving ``our national strategic interests.'' He
also said he would use force to make sure the Panama Canal remains
open.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said, ``It's not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said he would support a government program
to get prescription drugs to older Americans. The other candidates
said they would not.

U.S. JUDGE APPROVES $8 MILLION ATTICA SETTLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ A federal judge approved a settlement Tuesday
in which New York state is to pay $8 million to the inmates who
were tortured after the 1971 Attica prison uprising, paving the way
for the end of one of the longest and messiest chapters in criminal
justice history.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Judge Michael A. Telesca of federal District
Court did not come as a surprise. Last month, the judge unveiled a
settlement proposal that would allot $8 million for inmates and $4
million in lawyers' fees, without requiring that the state admit
any wrongdoing or liability. And Monday, all but one of the 16
former inmates and inmates' relatives who attended an unusual
hearing here said that they supported the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the absence of any last-minute snags was a great relief
to all parties, given all the legal delay and legerdemain that has
dogged the case for almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon consideration of all the relevant factors as discussed in
this decision,'' Telesca wrote, ``I find that the amount of the
proposed settlement is fair, adequate and reasonable under all of
the prevailing _ and compelling _ circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven guards and 32 prisoners were killed during the September
1971 uprising, which lasted four days and ended catastrophically
when state troopers stormed the Attica Correctional Facility in
western New York. More than 80 people were wounded, making it the
bloodiest prison incident in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates had originally seized control of one yard to protest
poor living conditions inside the prison, taking 49 guards as
hostages. But after the unexpected assault by state troopers, law
enforcement officials and prison guards engaged in what a federal
court later described as an ``orgy of brutality'' against the
inmates, forcing many to crawl naked over broken glass while
beating them with nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, lawyers representing the more than 1,200
prisoners who were in the yard during the reprisals filed a
class-action suit against prison and state officials. The case
stalled for years, but in January, with many of the inmates ailing
or already dead, all parties decided to settle at the behest of
Telesca.
</P>
<P>
   In the next day or two, the judge plans to release a
questionnaire that will seek to determine the nature and extent of
each inmate's injuries. The inmates will have until July 7 to
complete the questionnaire, which will be available at the federal
courthouses in Rochester and Buffalo, as well as the offices of the
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The allocation of the $8 million is to be based on the severity
of those injuries. And each inmate _ or survivor of a deceased
inmate _ will have the opportunity to be interviewed by the judge.
When all the claims have been identified and determined, the judge
will issue a final order.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the inmates' lawyers expect that perhaps 500 former
and current inmates will file claims, and that the money will be
divided up by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely gratified and relieved that the last chapter
is going to start,'' said Ellen Yacknin, one of the inmates'
lawyers, who is also associated with the Greater Upstate Law
Project here. ``It's going to be a lot of work, but we are
committed to meeting every person and making sure that each claim
is considered by the judge as thoroughly as possible.''

<P>
   If advertisements already seem to be everywhere, just wait. New
technology now makes it possible to place multiple Web-based
marketing on vending machines, ATM's and even office equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One such device, e-Port, has been developed by USA Technologies,
a small Pennsylvania company, and is backed by IBM. It enables
customers to order items from Web sites using a device that can be
attached to a machine that dispenses soft drinks, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken an everyday ordinary device, a credit card
device, and turned it into an Internet-anywhere appliance, '' said
Stephen P. Herbert, president and chief operating officer at USA
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The device offers marketers an opportunity to use interactive
advertising outside the home, particularly in high-traffic
locations like airports, hospitals, sports arenas, employee lounges
and dormitories. Such technology represents just the latest
variation in the rapidly growing out-of-home media category, which
includes not only billboards and transit advertising but
nontraditional sites like public restrooms and airport baggage
carousels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a fusion of some new technology with an extremely
old marketing technique,'' said Alan Gottesman, who follows the
advertising and media industries as managing director of West End
Communications/Consulting in New York. ``The age-old business
strategy is: Find some place where people are going to be and put
an ad there.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Port, for example, can be put on a beverage machine, near the
coin and cash slots. A large touch pad is equipped with a credit
card scanner and color touch screen that features a series of
electronic advertisements that rotate every 10 seconds. A consumer
who presses on an ad on the touch screen is directed to a page from
the advertiser's Web site that has been preloaded into the machine.
Customers can then make instant add-on purchases by touching the
screen or they have the option of being connected to the
advertiser's operator via a built-in speakerphone. The merchandise
can then be delivered to the buyer's home. Customers can also enter
e-mail addresses to receive additional information or coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gault, vice president for the distribution industry at IBM
Global Services in Somers, N.Y., described the e-Port as ``a very
disruptive technology,'' meaning that it will lead to new marketing
possibilities for consumer-goods companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to allow them to develop new sources of revenue, to
expand the reach of their products through a physical location and
it's also going to give virtual companies physical outlets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is persuaded that Internet advertising banners and
e-commerce Web sites need to be available everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the world wants any more advertising on every
damn machine they walk by,'' said Jack Trout, president of Trout &AMP;
Partners, a Greenwich, Conn., marketing strategy firm. ``It's
called the endless hustle, and I think enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Technologies and IBM, which introduced the e-Port last
month, are in negotiations on locations for the devices. The e-Port
is an outgrowth of USA Technologies' self-service terminals, which
allow users to operate fax machines, copiers or personal computers
by using a credit card. The terminals have been installed in about
400 hotels.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Global Services will manufacture the machines, install and
service them. The e-Port does not have browsing capability, but it
does offer other services like access to news, weather reports,
directions and maps and the ability to check personal e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   USA Technologies is holding its own agency review for its
advertising and marketing account, with billings estimated at more
than $1 million. Herbert said the company was talking to three to
five undisclosed agencies, with a decision expected within 60 days.

GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY TACKLE COMPUTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Some 25 high-tech companies met with
President Clinton top aides Tuesday and agreed they'll work
together to help prevent future attacks on the Internet, so long as
the government does its part, securing its own computers, funding
research and otherwise staying out of their way.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, along with several civil liberties groups and
universities, reached their agreement even as the FBI sought to
question several hackers about last week's Internet attacks, which
slowed or cut off access to at least eight large Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The government's attitude Tuesday, helpful but not intrusive,
won praise from several organizations attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of Internet security is something to be solved by
industry, not by government, and there are many things that can be
done to improve it, without expanding government or infringing on
privacy,'' said Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President seems to understand that and accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said the administration
will work with the high-technology industry ``to build a solid
security foundation for the economic miracle the Internet has
become.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the government will make sure its own computers
aren't contributing to the problem, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the government could modify and enforce federal
computer-crime laws, provide more money for research and
development, and promote information-sharing in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The government is eager to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies and the sector they represent is about 8 percent
of our employment, and they represent over 30 percent of our
economic growth,'' Clinton said. ``The trick is going to be how to
do what needs to be done on security and privacy and still keep
(the Internet) flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded optimistically, ``I don't think we ought to leave
here with this vast sense of insecurity. We ought to leave here
with a sense of confidence that this is a challenge that was
entirely predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   No data is known to have been altered or stolen in the attacks.
No reliable estimate of overall economic loss has emerged, though
some sites were shut down for several hours during the business
day.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks may be been led by hackers known by the screen names
cooolio, mafiaboy and nachoman, whom the FBI said it's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's much too early to call them suspects. We want to talk
to them,'' said a Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley and Attorney General Janet Reno
attended the White House meeting, as did science advisor Neal Lane;
Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget; and
Sandy Berger, director of the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Several the companies hit during last week's attacks were
represented, including megaportal Yahoo! and auction giant eBay.
Representatives of Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett
Packard, Computer Associates and 3Com also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Amazon.com wasn't invited, though it was affected by
the attacks, said company spokeswoman Patty Smith. Also targeted
last week but absent from the meeting were CNN.com, Excite.com,
Buy.com, and online traders E-trade and Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few companies sent their chief executives. Most sent
presidents, chief information officers or senior vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Before their meeting, the group formulated a list of
recommendations for the government, said Alan Paller, director of
research for the SANS Institute, which comprises 98,000 people
concerned with Internet security.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the government should: lead by example in buying
and using security technology, increase public awareness of the
security challenge and what to do about it, increase research
investment, establish a trusted mechanism for sharing security
information, improve training of security technicians, and pay
heightened attention to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of the six things we thought were important were right on
(Daley's) plan,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Though launched by one or more hackers,
distributed-denial-of-service attacks like last weeks' can't
succeed without the unwitting help of universities, companies and
even individuals who don't completely secure their computers and
networks against entry. These can either unknowingly host the
computer code that sends out the Internet-clogging packets of
useless information or amplify those packets in volume so they
become a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week's incidents were ... the first wake-up call for us
in government to make sure our systems have adequate protections,
and all of us are checking our systems at the direction of the
President,'' Commerce Secretary Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Daley) had an idea of how difficult it was to
secure computers, that it was a whole series of actions that need
to be done,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Podesta said, the government will play a supportive role
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Of foremost importance is the government's ``giving a home for
cooperative action'' to the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure
Security, a year-old undertaking by 80 transportation, energy,
communications and high-tech companies to develop mechanisms for
sharing security information across industries, Paller said. The
partnership, which first convened last December in New York, will
meet in Washington again next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments, as well as federal agencies, will
join that partnership, the administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-tech concerns alone, a total of 38 companies and ten
high-tech trade associations have committed to sharing information
and working together to focus on cyberattacks and counter-measures,
said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we can force somebody to tell something they've
found out _ I can only implore them _but everyone realizes now that
we're in this together, and at some point the worm may turn on
them,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   If such information-sharing would violate antitrust laws, or
would put companies at risk of revealing competitive secrets under
the Freedom of Information Act, those laws will be re-examined,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another government move to improve Internet security is
Clinton's request for $50 million in his fiscal 2001 budget to
create the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection,
another research and development organization. He said he has asked
for another $4 million in fiscal 2000 to jump-start the Institute,
which will be housed at the National Institute of Science and
Technology in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Science advisor Neal Lane and National Security Council
coordinator Dick Clarke are scheduled to meet Friday with members
of the president's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology
to help set a research agenda on computer network security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also proposed creating a program to create a federal
``cyberservice,'' in which people can be trained in security
measures and then work for some period, all in exchange for
forgiveness of debts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's attacks came at a propitious time in the Internet's
evolution, said Whitfield Diffie, corporate information officer for
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   January's loosening of export restrictions on highly encrypted
software will provide an incentive for companies to create more
security enhancements for the international market, Diffie
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a global problem,'' Diffie said. ``The 21st century is
going to be a century in which the growth of prosperity is going to
follow the growth of the Internet the way the growth of an embryo
follows the growth of the nervous system. For the first time, the
U.S. has a vested interest in the security of computers
worldwide.''

VALLEY RESIDENTS SLAIN, 1 HURT IN MEXICO SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border are trying
to understand why three mem bers of a Phoenix household were gunned
down Sunday at a reli gious shrine not far from the beaches of
Rocky Point.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Nichol Jr. and his wife's son-in-law, Juan Santana,
were shot to death along Mexi co's Highway 8, about midway between
the border and the popu lar vacation spot in Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the Mexican town of Sonoita said Nichol's wife, Diane,
was wounded twice but managed to climb into her pickup truck and
drive to Lukeville on the border. She was airlifted to Good
Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from her hospi tal bed late Tuesday, Nichol vowed
to assist investigators and asked that her privacy be re spected
``during this extremely difficult and sorrowful period.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, no arrests were reported in Mexico, and investi
gators remained puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Montes Samaniego, lead investigator at the Sonoran
Attorney General's Office, said robbery had been ruled out as a
motive. Mexican police hinted at some sort of vendetta but pro
vided no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the week end sojourners got caught in a
ruthless, terrifying assault by at least two men who drove up
behind the trio.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Diaz Trejo, a Sonoran medical examiner, said Stephen
Nichol, 45, was shot in the head and died instantly inside the
shrine. Santana, 26, was shot several times and ran toward the
highway before he fell to the ground. A final shot to the head
ended his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Jensen, port director for the Customs Service in Lukeville,
said Diane Nichol, 36, was going into shock when she drove up late
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could barely walk,'' he said. ``She had significant blood
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officers went into a rescue mode as soon as she arrived
with bullet wounds to the chest and shoulder, Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service rangers from the nearby Organ Pipe Cactus
National Monument pro vided emergency medical assist ance until an
emergency helicopter arrived to take the victim to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A Good Samaritan spokes woman said Nichol asked author ities not
to release any information, including her medi cal condition.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Officer Bob Ragsdale said a homicide detec tive,
working with Mexican au thorities, interviewed Nichol on Tuesday
and is to meet with authorities in Sonora Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said he was told that the killings were motivated by
robbery, but he declined to re lease any other information.
</P>
<P>
   KFYI-AM also reported that the shootings occurred during a
robbery. The station, quoting Diane Nichol's daughters, said she
threw money at the bandits, who then opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place at a shrine honoring the Virgin of
Guadalupe along the road to Puerto Penasco, a popular haunt for
Arizonans known as Rocky Point.
</P>
<P>
   The shed-size shrine of blue and white stucco _ topped by a
metal roof and a white wooden cross _ sits along a deserted stretch
of road surrounded by empty beer bottles, dirty diapers and empty
plastic oil cans.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe tops a small altar,
surrounded by dozens of votive candles. Her gaze falls on
blood-stained beige tile, and blood is splattered across the walls.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, friends gathered outside the Nichols' West
Valley home in a middle-class neighborhood of horse properties near
Van Buren and 67th streets.
</P>
<P>
   They said Stephen Nichol, an air-conditioning technician, had
lived in the house six years. He married Diane, a truck driver, two
years ago and brought her two daughters into the home.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Nichol's news release identifies Santana as her
son-in-law. He moved into the family home about a month ago,
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Aguilera said she spoke with Nichol, who fears for her
life and asked Aguilera to not divulge information about the family
or the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera said the couple occa sionally spent weekends in Rocky
Point. Nichol is Catholic, she said, and may have stopped at the
shrine for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera and others called the Nichols wonderful neighbors. Un
til Diane recuperates, Aguilera said, she will tend the family's
horses, pigs, dogs, chickens and ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Moore said Stephen Ni chol was a hard-working, friendly
and generous neighbor who fixed her refrigeration system and paid
for repairs to a common fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a really nice guy,'' agreed Kate Rakoci, Ste phen
Nichol's boss at Russell AC Inc. for three years. ``Very pro
fessional. Always had a smile on his face.''
</P>

   Roughly a century ago three daughters of a dying order of
gentility looked to the distant metropolis of Moscow as a symbol of
deliverance. They were the Prozorov girls, the unhappy heroines of
Chekhov's ``Three Sisters,'' and it was always clear in the play
that told their story that they would never escape the drabness of
their shared existence. By the end, they could hope only that life
might be brighter for the generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably just as well that the Prozorovs aren't around to
check out the title characters of Nilo Cruz's ``Two Sisters and a
Piano.'' This rasping sigh of a drama, which opened Tuesday night
at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, presents  &UR; two  &LR; daughters of a
 &UR; dead  &LR; order of gentility looking once again to Moscow as a symbol
of deliverance.
</P>
<P>
   They too are trapped in a life of unbearable monotony, measured
out in the stitches of the knitting with which they occupy their
endless, empty hours. ``I could knit a whole bedspread for this
island with all the lost days,'' exclaims one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Island? That's right. This is Havana in 1991. And Maria Celia
and Sofia, artistic, refined types like those Prozorovs, experience
a flutter of joy when news reaches them from Moscow, heralding in
this case the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   These women, you see, are not prisoners of just existential
ennui; they are under house arrest after two years in jail for
having signed a manifesto for greater civic liberty, and the
promises of Moscow seem destined to go unfulfilled once again.
Chekhov's metaphor of captivity has become in Cruz's world a
political reality.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit parallels and contrasts between works separated by
100 years set off intriguing resonances that ``Two Sisters''
doesn't quite generate on its own. Working with more inherently
sensational material than Chekhov ever grappled with, the
Cuban-American Cruz has nonetheless come up with a play that
somehow seems more old-fashioned than its Russian antecedent. ``Two
Sisters and a Piano'' is a more straightforward and less fanciful
work than Cruz's earlier play at the Public, ``Dancing on Her
Knees,'' the tale of a transvestite and two tangoing angels.
``Sisters'' is, in many ways, more confident and fully realized.
</P>
<P>
   Under Loretta Greco's direction, with Adriana Sevan and Daphne
Rubin-Vega in the title roles, ``Sisters'' fitfully evokes a poetic
appreciation of the visions of phantom lives bred in circumscribed
existences, like the fantasies of the prisoners in Manuel Puig's
novel ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   It's when the drama turns to direct confrontation among its four
principal characters that it is, curiously, at its least involving
or believable. When Sofia and Maria Celia are dreaming, caught up
in reveries of the past or an alternative present, the play has its
own gently hypnotic rhythms; when the story wakes up to the real
world, it turns into conventional melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sisters are forbidden to leave their colonial family
homestead _ represented as a state of mind, tenuously anchored by a
few essential possessions, in Robert Brill's minimal set _ Cruz has
provided Maria Celia (Sevan), a celebrated fiction writer, and the
younger Sofia (Rubin-Vega), a pianist, with suitors who come to
visit. There is Victor Manuel (Gary Perez), the piano tuner fancied
by Sofia, and Lt. Portuondo (the handsome, severe Paul Calderon),
who courts the older sister by reading aloud letters, confiscated
by the government, from her beloved emigre husband.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's the steamy attraction between Portuondo and Maria
Celia that leads to the evening's fateful turn of plot, the real
chemistry is between the sisters themselves. Rubin-Vega, who
created the role of Mimi in ``Rent,'' is a restive kitten in a cage
here, all hyperdeveloped senses and thwarted erotic desire.
</P>
<P>
   The role could be a lurid cliche, bringing to mind those
frustrated bad girls of 1950s movie soap operas, but Rubin-Vega
softens the character with an air of arrested childhood, of
innocence in search of corruption. Sofia's jitteriness becomes the
evening's clearest and most affecting indication of the toll taken
by the sisters' isolation. It also plays exquisitely off Sevan's
magnetically self-possessed Maria Celia, who is all vertical
rigidity to the melting postures of Sofia, who is given to falling
to her knees in supplication or homage.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's staging is most comfortable and fluid in the scenes
between the women. (Maria Celia's monologues, letters to her
husband meant to display her distinctive literary gifts, can be a
bit embarrassing.) There are some charming comic moments between
Sofia and Victor Manuel and one very picturesque sexual tableau
enacted by Sevan and Calderon. But in both the writing and the
performance, the men exist more as devices than characters.
</P>
<P>
   The production's high point, accordingly, is a dance performed
not by either pair of potential lovers but by the sisters. It
begins self-consciously with Maria Celia trying to coax Sofia out
of a pout but turns into a sad, funny and sexy pas de deux, as the
women segue from vampy improvisation to a heartfelt clinch.
</P>
<P>
   Subliminal incest is not what's going on here. Instead, each
woman is completely imagining herself, for just one fragile moment,
in a remembered embrace from another time and another place far
beyond the walled world in which they have been frozen for so long.
</P>

CLANCY TO COME BACK?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC forward Sam Clancy, who broke his right foot
last month, said Tuesday he has set a goal of returning to the
lineup on March 3, when the Trojans play at California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's feeling good. There's no pain,'' Clancy said. ``I can run
up the steps with no pain.'' But Clancy said he would not rush back
if his foot was not completely healed and wouldn't do anything to
risk further injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my foot is not feeling the way it should, then I won't come
back,'' Clancy said. ``I don't know how good it's going to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added that if for some reason he cannot play in
Berkeley, he definitely expects to play the final week of the
Pacific-10 Conference season against the Washington schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy is scheduled to undergo X-rays next week. In the
meantime, he exercises by swimming or riding a stationary bicycle.
He also does some light shooting before practices.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy said it has been more difficult the past two weeks for
him to sit and watch USC (13-9, 6-4) lose four of its past five
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration is not playing and seeing my team do poorly,''
Clancy said. ``Since we haven't done as well, it puts a little
pressure on me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst feeling for Clancy came last week, when he sat in
street clothes during the 83-78 loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That killed me. My heart just ate at me and it was terrible,''
Clancy said. ``Being on the sidelines, I thought I could make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby said he didn't want expectations to be too
high when Clancy returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sam coming back, the question is how effective is Sam
going to be?'' Bibby said. ``Sam is not going to be the savior. He
hasn't played for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Turner likely finished: The news wasn't as good on injured
forward Jarvis Turner, who is expected to miss the rest of the
regular season with a broken left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close to looking like he's not returning,'' Bibby said.
``Maybe if we can get to the tournament, hopefully Jarvis would
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Where's the spark?: USC forward Brian Scalabrine said one
reason the Trojans have struggled has been the lack of contribution
from the bench. It's one of the few times all season that anyone
has admitted USC's bench has become its Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our team and our guys going 40 minutes, you're not
getting any spark off the bench,'' Scalabrine said. ``The guys out
there are either doing it or else. We're not getting a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Traffic advisory: Fans attending USC's women's basketball
game Thursday at the Sports Arena against Arizona at 7 p.m. should
be aware the Coliseum is hosting two soccer games that evening,
which are expected to cause traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
   __ Day off: Bibby gave the Trojans Tuesday off, which was USC's
fourth day off in the past week, before heading to Arizona today.

GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY TACKLE COMPUTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Some 25 high-tech companies met with
President Clinton top aides Tuesday and agreed they'll work
together to help prevent future attacks on the Internet, so long as
the government does its part, securing its own computers, funding
research and otherwise staying out of their way.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, along with several civil liberties groups and
universities, reached their agreement even as the FBI sought to
question several hackers about last week's Internet attacks, which
slowed or cut off access to at least eight large Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The government's attitude Tuesday, helpful but not intrusive,
won praise from several organizations attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of Internet security is something to be solved by
industry, not by government, and there are many things that can be
done to improve it, without expanding government or infringing on
privacy,'' said Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President seems to understand that and accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said the administration
will work with the high-technology industry ``to build a solid
security foundation for the economic miracle the Internet has
become.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the government will make sure its own computers
aren't contributing to the problem, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the government could modify and enforce federal
computer-crime laws, provide more money for research and
development, and promote information-sharing in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The government is eager to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies and the sector they represent is about 8 percent
of our employment, and they represent over 30 percent of our
economic growth,'' Clinton said. ``The trick is going to be how to
do what needs to be done on security and privacy and still keep
(the Internet) flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded optimistically, ``I don't think we ought to leave
here with this vast sense of insecurity. We ought to leave here
with a sense of confidence that this is a challenge that was
entirely predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   No data is known to have been altered or stolen in the attacks.
No reliable estimate of overall economic loss has emerged, though
some sites were shut down for several hours during the business
day.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks may be been led by hackers known by the screen names
cooolio, mafiaboy and nachoman, whom the FBI said it's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's much too early to call them suspects. We want to talk
to them,'' said a Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley and Attorney General Janet Reno
attended the White House meeting, as did science advisor Neal Lane;
Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget; and
Sandy Berger, director of the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Several the companies hit during last week's attacks were
represented, including megaportal Yahoo! and auction giant eBay.
Representatives of Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Hewlett
Packard, Computer Associates and 3Com also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Amazon.com wasn't invited, though it was affected by
the attacks, said company spokeswoman Patty Smith. Also targeted
last week but absent from the meeting were CNN.com, Excite.com,
Buy.com, and online traders E-trade and Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few companies sent their chief executives. Most sent
presidents, chief information officers or senior vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Before their meeting, the group formulated a list of
recommendations for the government, said Alan Paller, director of
research for the SANS Institute, which comprises 98,000 people
concerned with Internet security.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the government should: lead by example in buying
and using security technology, increase public awareness of the
security challenge and what to do about it, increase research
investment, establish a trusted mechanism for sharing security
information, improve training of security technicians, and pay
heightened attention to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of the six things we thought were important were right on
(Daley's) plan,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Though launched by one or more hackers,
distributed-denial-of-service attacks like last weeks' can't
succeed without the unwitting help of universities, companies and
even individuals who don't completely secure their computers and
networks against entry. These can either unknowingly host the
computer code that sends out the Internet-clogging packets of
useless information or amplify those packets in volume so they
become a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week's incidents were ... the first wake-up call for us
in government to make sure our systems have adequate protections,
and all of us are checking our systems at the direction of the
President,'' Commerce Secretary Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Daley) had an idea of how difficult it was to
secure computers, that it was a whole series of actions that need
to be done,'' Paller said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Podesta said, the government will play a supportive role
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Of foremost importance is the government's ``giving a home for
cooperative action'' to the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure
Security, a year-old undertaking by 80 transportation, energy,
communications and high-tech companies to develop mechanisms for
sharing security information across industries, Paller said. The
partnership, which first convened last December in New York, will
meet in Washington again next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments, as well as federal agencies, will
join that partnership, the administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-tech concerns alone, a total of 38 companies and ten
high-tech trade associations have committed to sharing information
and working together to focus on cyberattacks and counter-measures,
said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology
Association of America, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we can force somebody to tell something they've
found out _ I can only implore them _but everyone realizes now that
we're in this together, and at some point the worm may turn on
them,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   If such information-sharing would violate antitrust laws, or
would put companies at risk of revealing competitive secrets under
the Freedom of Information Act, those laws will be re-examined,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another government move to improve Internet security is
Clinton's request for $50 million in his fiscal 2001 budget to
create the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection,
another research and development organization. He said he has asked
for another $4 million in fiscal 2000 to jump-start the Institute,
which will be housed at the National Institute of Science and
Technology in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Science advisor Neal Lane and National Security Council
coordinator Dick Clarke are scheduled to meet Friday with members
of the president's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology
to help set a research agenda on computer network security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also proposed creating a program to create a federal
``cyberservice,'' in which people can be trained in security
measures and then work for some period, all in exchange for
forgiveness of debts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's attacks came at a propitious time in the Internet's
evolution, said Whitfield Diffie, corporate information officer for
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   January's loosening of export restrictions on highly encrypted
software will provide an incentive for companies to create more
security enhancements for the international market, Diffie
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a global problem,'' Diffie said. ``The 21st century is
going to be a century in which the growth of prosperity is going to
follow the growth of the Internet the way the growth of an embryo
follows the growth of the nervous system. For the first time, the
U.S. has a vested interest in the security of computers
worldwide.''

AMERICA WEST FREE TO ADD JETS

<P>
   (Phoenix) - The FAA will allow America West to add aircraft to
its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes three weeks after the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration threatened to bar new planes until America West
improved its maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Than, after a review of the carrier's operations, the FAA de
termined that America West can expand its fleet and maintain the
aircraft to the required stand ards, FAA spokesman Mitch Barker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA concluded that there was no need for restrictions, which
is exactly what America West expected, company spokes woman Patty
Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West will add 14 new Airbus aircraft to its
fleet of 124 Airbus and Boeing planes this year, with the first
arriving Friday and five more by the end of May, she said.
</P>
<P>
   America West is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan to in
crease capacity 10 percent per year over the next three years, she
said. That includes adding new markets and increasing fre quency on
existing routes.
</P>
<P>
   America West will add service to New Orleans; Hartford, Conn.;
Spokane, Wash.; and Boise, Idaho, by early May. &QL;

THOMSON PUTS `TRIBUNES,' OTHER PAPERS ON BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phoenix area's Tribune newspa pers and other papers owned by
Thomson Corp. are being put up for sale as the Toronto-based media
and information giant fo cuses on its Internet-related busi nesses.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson put about 130 news papers on the auction block Tues day.
It will keep its flagship publication, the Globe and Mail in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The company's properties in Arizona are the East Valley and
Scottsdale Tribunes, the Sun City Daily News-Sun and the Yuma Daily
Sun, all dailies; as well as weeklies Ahwatukee Foothill News,
Surprise Today and Glen dale Prospector.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sale comes less than four years after Thomson
purchased the East Valley and Scottsdale Tribunes. The Tribunes are
Thomson's largest U.S. news paper operation.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been determined whether the 130 newspapers will be
sold as one entity or broken up, said Stuart Garner, president and
chief executive officer of Thomson Newspapers, the Stam ford,
Conn.-based subsidiary that's up for sale, adding the company has
received a ``signifi cant amount of interest'' from potential
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson expects the deal will close during the second half of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Wittmer, the Tribunes' publisher and corporate vice
president responsible for the Ari zona properties, said there has
been some anxiety among the 560 workers. But she added that the
Phoenix area's second-largest newspa per operation after The
Arizona Republic is an established busi ness with a strong
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area officials reacted with surprise to see their
one-time home-grown newspapers sold again. Among the newspapers
that had been rolled into the Tribune masthead, only to see their
names disappear, were the Tempe Daily News, Scottsdale Progress,
Mesa Tribune and Chandler Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose the name of who you are, I think you lose a
little bit of the community,'' said Charlie Deaton, president of
the Mesa Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa hasn't had a locally owned newspaper since the late 1970s,
when Cox Enterprises bought the Tribune. ``I guess the days of the
local news are a thing of the past,'' Mesa Mayor Wayne Brown
lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Mayor Sam Cam pana said she hoped the new owners will
make a long-term commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tribune provides daily coverage and we need that voice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Johnson, senior vice pres ident of news and executive edi
tor of The Republic, said it's too early to know what the proposed
sale would mean to the Phoenix area's publishing competition.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson had $6.2 billion in total revenue in 1998. Nearly 85
percent of its sales come from publishing specialized informa tion
such as legal analysis, bro kerage research, educational textbooks
and medical journals.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson is focusing more these days on providing informa tion
online and through CD-ROMs and computer software, according to
Hoover's Online.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson expects within five years to have 80 percent of revenue
generated by electronic products and services, Richard J.
Harrington, Thomson's president and chief executive officer, said
in a prepared statement. &QL;
