DON'T BUY TRADE DEFICIT DESPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY HEASTER, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday's wire story on June's record $30.6 billion U.S. trade
deficit showed how badly this economic statistic is misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a reasonably cogent account, it fell into the
trap of calling the shortfall ``the sole blot on an otherwise
vibrant U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Piffle! If anything, U.S. trade shortfalls are incontrovertible
proof of a vibrant economy. This reality bears repeating with some
frequency, because the trade imbalance invariably gets worse press
than it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The last time we had a trade surplus, in fact, the economy was
in the doldrums and had been for years. The reason for the surplus
was diminishing consumer power in an economy critically dependent
on consumption for its growth. Between inflation and rising tax
burdens, overall American consumption had stagnated, which meant
less-than-dynamic demand for imported wares.
</P>
<P>
   With the current expansion tracking toward its 10th birthday
early next year, the story these days is one of unprecedented
consumer vigor. This has meant rising demand for foreign goods and
services. Meanwhile, the market for U.S. exports hasn't grown as
much as demand for imports because foreign fortunes have lagged the
record-setting U.S. run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the worry that as foreign holdings of
dollar-denominated assets swell, America is increasingly vulnerable
to having to make good on its mounting debts. This fear, however,
assumes most all U.S. debtors will someday want to be repaid at
once, which isn't likely. This explains why doomsayers so far have
been wrong in warning that chronic trade deficits eventually will
impoverish America.
</P>
<P>
   As long as America remains a bastion of growth and an oasis of
political stability, it will continue to attract foreign capital in
many forms in amounts adequate to U.S. economic needs.
</P>
<P>
   Another misperception the story dealt with was claims that the
deficit reflects failed administration trade policies. Critics
contend these failures represent a betrayal of American workers who
have lost jobs to foreign labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   This contention seems bizarre in the face of the fact that the
jobless rate is lower than it has been for a generation, and since
1980 the U.S. economy has created more than twice as many jobs as
all the rest of the G-7 countries combined. In truth, the jobs that
have moved abroad are those that American workers either no longer
will do or that they can no longer do competitively, which is the
way the world works.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that anyone in America who wants to work is
working, and those qualified for the best-paying jobs aren't having
trouble getting them.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, June's deficit was fattened by purchases of
foreign oil at prices nearing 10-year highs. If it hadn't been oil,
though, it would have been something else. The more money we spent
on energy, the less we had to spend on other consumables.
</P>
<P>
   The really good news was that exports surged almost as much as
imports, which reflects continued strength of the U.S. economy.
This will mean more money in consumer pockets to buy more imported
wares, which implies continued humongous trade deficits, which,
despite media reports to the contrary, won't be a bad thing for
Americans.

APPEAL TO RICH, POOR MAKES DEL MAR MOST POPULAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ A middle-aged man watches intently as the odds
for the second race flash on an overhead monitor, his right hand in
the pocket of his pressed slacks and the other clutching a track
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, who do you like?''
</P>
<P>
   The man glances to his right, toward the voice, and spots a
20-something dude in a surfing T-shirt, knee-length shorts and
dirty white sneakers, clutching nothing but a beer in a plastic
cup.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, the land of
juxtapositions and a treasure not known to many Southern California
racing fans because of its location in north San Diego County.
Which is not to say the track is unpopular, by any measure.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar, founded by entertainer Bing Crosby in 1937 and long
known as a playground for his Hollywood buddies, now attracts an
eclectic group of young and old, male and female, rich and poor, a
desirable mix that every track strives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executives from other tracks come here,'' Del Mar spokesman
C.P. ``Mac'' McBride said, ``and they say, 'Where in the world did
you get all these young people?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar's summer season lasts less than two months (July
26-Sept. 13), which draws average weekday crowds of 14,000-16,000,
doubling that of the averages of Hollywood Park or Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The track hosts its premier event, the 10th Pacific Classic, on
Saturday, and it is a perfect opportunity for a Del Mar neophyte to
experience one of the country's most popular, scenic and historic
racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   For those thinking of making their initial trek south to Del
Mar, here is a primer for the first-timer. Keep in mind that where
you should go at Del Mar depends largely on what you would like to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   A good percentage of the people you will encounter have only a
vague awareness that a sport is actually taking place on the
premises, and if they bet, they usually pick winners based on their
favorite color or number.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the crowd you prefer to hang with, proceed straight to
the infield. It's strictly a fraternity environment, just without
the house and swimming pool. Local college students enjoy the
summer sun, not quite as much as they enjoy the concession stands
that serve a variety of adult beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see them after around the fourth or fifth race,''
one track employee said. ``They're really a lot of fun then.''
</P>
<P>
   The video board, and most of the main track, is mostly invisible
from the infield, which doesn't seem to bother its inhabitants, who
often bring along lawn chairs and coolers.
</P>
<P>
   If you forgot the sunscreen, or you came up a few years short of
Generation X, there's still plenty of fun to be had on the other
side of the track. The grandstand is five levels high, with each
level seeming to have its own individual feel and ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth level: This is for the diehards, the serious handicappers
who are hard at work 90 minutes before the first post, hunched over
in general-admission seats. There is little flair to this floor,
just a couple concession booths and a bathroom or two, but the
regulars don't seem to mind the lack of amenities.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth a trip to the top though, for one race anyway. From a
seat at the top of Section 18, you have a clear view of the track,
obstructed only by a few supporting beams, and over your left
shoulder, you can see the Pacific Ocean, just a few hundred yards
away. Remember, this is Del Mar, ``where the surf meets the turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth level: For those willing to spend a couple extra dollars,
the box seats on the fourth floor offer the best view of the track.
This is also the level of the Turf Club, where the track's elite
reside.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to escape the traditional stadium fare of hot dogs
and peanuts, give the ``Trifecta Carver'' a try.
</P>
<P>
   Third level: There's a lot going on here, and it takes a while
to walk around and soak in the atmosphere. Make sure you stop by
the elevator/stairs areas, and look at the pictures of Del Mar's
past. When Del Mar was remodeled in 1993, race officials remained
sensitive to the track's glorious past, and made sure to leave many
visual reminders around the track.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of tips: First, if you need a quiet place to
handicap, head for any one of three small, enclosed rooms that
offer a concession booth and several small tables where the
horseplayer can watch the monitor and make some tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is a small balcony just beyond the Pizza Hut stand
that offers a perfect, unobstructed view of the paddock area. But
beware, this is designed as a smoking area.
</P>
<P>
   Another balcony houses a booth for a local radio station, which
plays rock music and gives away promotional items.
</P>
<P>
   As a side note, there isn't much difference between the
grandstand and the clubhouse, except for the three extra dollars
you have to pay at the gate. The food options are essentially the
same, and the accommodations are no more plush. On the third floor,
it might be more fun to be in the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Second level: The main attraction here is on the clubhouse side,
the Clubhouse Terrace Cafe. The track converted several rows of box
seats into an outdoor cafe. For $68, you get four clubhouse
admissions and a table for four for the afternoon, where you can
watch the entire race card and have food brought to your table.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is similar to Santa Anita's ``Finish Line'' restaurant,
but Del Mar's cafe puts you closer to the action. The cafe has
become so popular that advance orders must be made.
</P>
<P>
   First level: This is the heart of Del Mar, where generations and
genders mingle near the paddock and crowd the rail to yell and
encourage their picks. It's also the best place to enjoy the
track's Spanish Mission architecture and brand new video board.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe you'll even make money, but at Del Mar, you
probably won't mind if you go home with a lighter wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make it fun for everybody,'' McBride said. ``If you
just want to play the horses, that's great. If you want to come and
party, that's great. If you want to do more than just bet on
horses, we think we'll be able to accommodate that.''

LAWMAKER URGES KANSAS AND MISSOURI TO SEEK MORE FUNDS FOR
RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JULIUS A. KARASH, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid heightened interest in research and development, Kansas and
Missouri must work together to obtain their fair share of federal
funds for life sciences research, U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that basic and applied research conducted by
local universities, hospitals and research centers are the economic
development engines for inventions and discoveries that stimulate
creation of start-up companies,'' Roberts said in a luncheon
address at the Kansas City Club.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' speech was part of a two-day tour of health- and
technology-related facilities in the Kansas City area and Lawrence,
including Midwest Research Institute, Children's Mercy Hospital,
the University of Kansas Medical Center, the Higuchi Biosciences
Center at the University of Kansas and the Stowers Institute for
Medical Research, currently under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said several major universities on the East and West
coasts receive a total of more than $1.5 billion in federal
research support every year, compared with about $100 million for
the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our respective states are not getting a fair share of federal
research,'' Roberts said. ``Kansas City can garner a critical mass
for life sciences if you will join me in working together to
increase federal funding for life sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   To help achieve that goal, Roberts said, he will encourage
representatives of the National Institutes of Health and other
federal agencies to come to Kansas City and visit various research
and health sites.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, Roberts visited with officials of the Kansas
City Area Life Sciences Institute, which is working on plans to
turn Kansas City into one of the nation's top 10 biomedical
research and development sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do this, we'll get further and further behind,
because our competition in other states is so fierce,'' Roberts
told John M. Edgar, co-chairman of the Life Sciences Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Life Sciences Institute aims to raise $300 million for
communitywide research and development over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar said the institute will submit a business plan to the
boards of its two sponsoring organizations, the Kansas City Area
Development Council and the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City,
on Sept. 8. The two boards will vote on the plan at subsequent
meetings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for Kansas City,'' Edgar said.
``It's also a great challenge.''

COMPANIES REPORT THAT 1.1 MILLION HAVE GONE FROM WELFARE TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY KEVIN MURPHY, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief executives of Sprint Corp. and several other
companies reported Tuesday that a welfare-to-work program they
helped launch four years ago had put 1.1 million people to work for
22,000 employers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint was among five corporations nationwide that pioneered the
Welfare to Work Partnership, a government-assisted program to train
and employ welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of
Westwood-based Sprint, and other corporate chiefs gave a report on
the program Tuesday to President Clinton, who described it is a key
part of welfare reform passed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the report to the president said welfare recipients who want
jobs still face transportation and child care hurdles, and it
recommended that federal subsidies be extended when the 1996
legislation is revisited in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean the job is done,'' Eli Segal, a Clinton ally
and the president of the Welfare to Work Partnership, said at a
news conference Tuesday. ``There are still many people left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has touted welfare reform as a major achievement of his
administration, and he was quick to commend corporations Tuesday
for hiring so many welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many of these companies have learned, welfare recipients
are productive workers who want a hand up, not a handout,'' Clinton
said. Overall, welfare rolls have been halved, to about 6.3 million
people, in four years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has hired about 250 people off public assistance rolls
under the program, including most of about 60 persons who work at a
customer service call-in center opened at 18th and Vine in Kansas
City three years ago, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success has been phenomenal in terms of the quality of
workers we've gotten, the jobs they've done, their attendance and
their reliability,'' Esrey said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey was singled out for addressing the transportation problem
for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at where the potential workers were, and it was
right in the heart of the inner city,'' Esrey said. ``We moved the
jobs where the people were, and that really solved the
transportation problem.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Esrey said in an interview that he doesn't think the
federal government should keep putting the same amount of money
into the welfare-to-work program, as recommended in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great effort, but there are times when you get
something going and you have to keep it going, but you also have to
get out of the way,'' Esrey said. ``I don't think we should keep
funding at those levels. That's a Washington reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Welfare to Work Partnership has gotten about 22,000
companies to pledge to hire at least one person off welfare. The
partnership has used a $10.5 million Department of Labor grant and
private donations to run the program and provide job training.
</P>
<P>
   Employers that hire people off welfare can get federal subsidies
for training, child care and transportation, and are eligible for
tax credits. The program is part of about $16.5 billion in the
federal budget for welfare programs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal welfare money is dispersed as grants to the 50 states.
The partnership Tuesday recommended no cuts in funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's investment should be sustained to help states
tackle the difficult barriers faced by the `hardest to serve'
recipients remaining on the roll and those who have already left,''
the written report said.

NATIONAL DEBATE EXPECTED TO HEAT UP OVER PROPOSED CHANGES FOR
MISSOURI RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY MICHAEL MANSUR, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Democratic hopefuls for the White House
may have just floated down the Mississippi, but national politics
soon may focus on the Big Muddy, the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   In this season of political flurry, a national battle is shaping
up over whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must alter the
Missouri River's flow to protect an endangered fish and two birds.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development came Tuesday. Missouri Attorney General
Jay Nixon filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, saying the federal agency had failed to take a
crucial step in saving the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fish and Wildlife Service had followed federal law, Nixon
said, it might not be necessary to drastically alter the Missouri's
current flow.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Wildlife recently told the Corps of Engineers that it
must alter the Missouri's flow, allowing for bigger releases in
spring and allowing shallower water in summer. The more natural
flow would help restore the pallid sturgeon and two birds, the
piping plover and interior least tern. But Missouri officials have
fought this plan, saying it could increase flooding and harm the
barge industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon joined several other Missouri political leaders who have
called for the Clinton administration to halt its effort to
overturn the current operation of the Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan, in a letter to President Clinton last week,
asked that the service be directed to re-evaluate its push to alter
the Missouri's flow.
</P>
<P>
   Without any change, it would likely result in ``an increase in
the risk of flooding river communities and agricultural land will
occur, and states along the river will suffer serious economic
damage to their river-based transportation and agricultural
industries,'' Carnahan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Kit Bond and John Ashcroft also have mounted a campaign to
derail the Fish and Wildlife Service's effort. They wrote earlier
this month to Vice President Al Gore, asking him to stop the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman used a float down the
Mississippi this week to start their campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The river battle pits downstream Missouri against most states
upstream, which have long pushed for changes in the river's
operation to fill reservoirs from Montana to South Dakota. Missouri
politicians, however, have warned that giving up any water might
lead to disastrous consequences, such as upstream states selling
water in times of plenty instead of letting it flow to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   This battle may soon reach the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, of upstream South Dakota, in
recent weeks has stalled Bond's effort to add legislative language
that would preclude the corps from altering the Missouri's flow. A
senate debate between the powerful senators could be coming after
the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri politicians also say they have been left out of the
evaluation of how the river should be operated. And they suspect
the Fish and Wildlife Services' efforts are not based on proven
scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, in his lawsuit filed Tuesday, said the Fish and Wildlife
Service had failed to conduct surveys of critical habitat on the
Missouri, something the federal Endangered Species Act requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish and Wildlife won't conduct the mandatory habitat survey
to inform the public where these two species live and how to best
save them,'' Nixon said. ``At the same time, they are using these
two species as a pretext to secretly put pressure on the corps to
alter the flow of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service and environmental groups, however,
have countered that the service's draft ``Biological Opinion'' is
based on the best available scientific studies. The service sent
the draft to the corps July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The draft opinion's recommendations included restoring habitat
for the fish and birds, especially shallow water areas and side
channels; altering flows out of Fort Peck and Gavins Point dams,
allowing for a rise in spring flow one year out of three and a
reduced summer flow; adapting a new type of management that would
allow for future alterations in the river's operation to benefit
fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   A final biological opinion should be issued in September, wrote
Ralph Morgenweck, the wildlife service's regional director, in a
recent opinion piece sent to several Midwest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes, Morgenweck added, will not wreak floods
and other problems on downstream Missouri users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recommended changes in river management will keep all the
dams in place, help conserve fish and wildlife and allow farmers
and river communities to continue to receive the benefits of flood
protection, navigation and hydropower when the basin's citizens
need them most,'' Morgenweck wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed flow changes probably would have little effect on
the river's traditional uses, even on the barge industry that has
said it cannot survive any change, said Chad Smith of American
Rivers, a national river conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps of Engineers data, assembled in its effort to develop
a new operation plan for the Missouri, back up that position, Smith
added.
</P>
<P>
   Given such entrenched positions and the high stakes, it might
not be surprising that the battle over the Missouri has attracted
such national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has elevated to a national issue,'' Smith said. ``We're
talking about the long-term health of the nation's longest and one
of its most historically significant rivers. And we've got to
decide whether to kill it or restore it.''

MITSUBISHI MOTORS ADMITS CONCEALING COMPLAINTS ABOUT DEFECTS SINCE
'77 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 3rd, 13th and 24th grafs with details of recall)  
 By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Mitsubishi Motors admitted Tuesday that it had
systematically concealed customer complaints about tens of
thousands of defective automobiles since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The admission by Mitsubishi, Japan's No. 4 automaker, came a
month after its top executive had denied accusations that it had
covered up repeated instances of problems that included faulty fuel
tanks, fueltank caps, clutches, crankshafts and brakes.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the admission, the company announced recalls based on
defects found in 88,000 cars and trucks, adding to a recall of
532,000 vehicles announced last month. The recalls, which are
expected to cost the company about $69 million, mostly affect
vehicles sold in Japan. But while Mitsubishi officials in Japan
said the recall would in- clude 50,000 vehicles exported to the
United States, the company's U.S. arm, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of
America, said only about 10,000 vehicles were involved.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that the defects caused any serious or
fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. and Japanese law, automakers are required to notify
the government about defects reported to them by customers. By
ignoring this requirement, Mitsubishi had avoided potentially
costly recalls, which are considered especially humiliating for a
Japanese auto company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely apologize to the drivers of our cars,'' said
Katsuhiko Kawasoe, president of Mitsubishi. ``My job is to work to
regain the public's trust in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how such a pattern of deception could have gone
on for so long without the knowledge of high-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   But Kawasoe, who said he had no knowledge of the coverup until
it was documented in an internal investigation submitted to the
government Tuesday, promised that the company would punish those
who were directly responsible. He also said he and other top
Mitsubishi executives would take a salary cut to acknowledge their
accountability. Kawasoe said, however, that he did not intend to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation found that Mitsubishi employees would
repair the defects but would mark the customer complaints with the
initial ``H'', short for ``hitoku,'' which means conceal, or
``horyu,'' which means defer or hold, the internal investigation
showed. None of these complaints were reported to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's Transportation Ministry said it was studying
possible penalties for Mitsubishi because of the coverup, including
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what kind of sanctions the company might face in
the United States. But the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Tuesday it was interested in how Mitsubishi had
handled safety information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have asked Mitsubishi if any of the activities in Japan
have a bearing on vehicles sold in the United States,'' said Tim
Hurd, a spokesman for the safety administration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles being recalled in the United States were all
imports from Japan. Pierre Gagnon, chief operat- ing officer of
Mitsubishi's American sales unit, said the product recalls would
have a minimal impact on U.S. operations or sales.
</P>
<P>
   The admission of a coverup could further damage the already
troubled image of Mitsubishi, maker of such models as the Montero
sport utility vehicle, Galant sedan and Mirage compact, at a time
when it is trying to stimulate sales through alliances with
DaimlerChrysler, the German-U.S. automaker, and Volvo of Sweden.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mitsubishi is the second major Japanese manufacturer to confront
a recall scandal in the past two weeks. Bridgestone/Firestone has
been the object of intense negative publicity since the company
announced Aug. 9 that it would replace 6.5 million potentially
dangerous tires, most of them on sport utility vehicles sold by
Ford Motor Co. in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Mitsubishi's admission Tuesday Kawasoe visited the
Transportation Minister, Hajime Morita in Tokyo, apologizing in a
deep bow that was widely reported in the Japanese media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole state of affairs is, in a word, the result of a lack
of respect for rules and regulations on the part of the company
officers and employees involved,'' Kawasoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month when rumors of a coverup first began to circulate,
Kawasoe had said they were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors turned into a scandal after Transport Ministry
officials, evidently acting on an anonymous telephone tip,
discovered a pile of customer complaints in a company locker room
during an inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of hiding evidence that could lead to a recall in
Japan is not new. Recalls, particularly for automakers, are
considered an enormous humiliation. Japan's automotive
manufacturers are acclaimed year after year for the superior
quality and durability of vehicles, often beating their American
competitors in consumer tests.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Heavy Industries was fined in 1997 for repairing defective
vehicles without reporting the defects to the government, which
could have led to a recall.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a law that prohibits such coverups, the Road Vehicles
Act, was toughened after the Fuji Heavy's violation. But the
monetary penalty is still light. Although the steepest fine was
quintupled to 1 million yen, that is only about $9,200 at current
exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi said the recalls of vehicles exported to the United
States cover leaking break fuid in the Montero, a potentially loose
chassis joint on the Galant and and a potentially loose engine
shaft on the Mirage. Owners will be notified by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives in the United States, however, said the
recall af- fected 10,000 1995 and '96 Galants for possible
fuel-tank cracks and 344 Monteros overlooked in a 1996 recall. They
added that 34,000 Mirages from 1995-97 might be recalled for
possible failures of crankshaft pulley bolts.
</P>
<P>
   The negative publicity of Mitsubishi's coverup could compound
its overall problem of weak sales at home and abroad. The company's
domestic sales in the first six months of this year fall 3.2
percent compared with the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales, meanwhile, rose 5.3 percent and and
Honda Motor Co.'s sales rose 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Mitsubishi also has taken a beating, particularly
in the past few weeks as rumors of the coverup frightened
investors. The shares fell 2.1 percent Tuesday to 429 yen or about
$3.94, and are down 15 percent from their high for the year of 497
yen reached early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi's competitive problems were a major reason why it
agreed to an alliance with DaimlerChrysler, which took a 34 percent
stake in the company under a deal signed less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler officials in Japan and the United States
declined to comment about the coverup. But Karin Funke, a
spokeswoman for the company at its headquarters in Stuttgart, was
quoted by Dow Jones newswires as saying it would not affect their
relationship. ``This is a matter that concerns Mitsubishi alone,''
she was quoted as saying.

CANDIDATE WOULD CREATE A COMMISSION TO EXAMINE POLICE PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY KAREN DILLON, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he is elected president, George W. Bush plans to create a
national commission that would examine controversies that have
arisen in law enforcement and the criminal justice system in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The commission could result in sweeping changes not seen since
1967, the last time a U.S. president convened such a group, several
law enforcement officials and legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Al Gore did not commit to establishing a
commission but would deal with problems in a strong fashion if he
saw evidence that action was needed, said Alex Zaroulis, Gore's
Missouri spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore issued statements to The Kansas City Star in
response to questions the newspaper posed about drug forfeiture
abuses and in response to a call from the International Association
of Chiefs of Police for a commission.
</P>
<P>
   The police chiefs association asked the presidential candidates
to support a national commission to investigate perceived police
and criminal justice abuses. One of those issues, the association
has said, is drug forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Michael D. Robinson, president of the police chiefs
association and director of the Michigan State Police, said law
enforcement in America today has lost the public's trust and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand at a critical point in our history,'' Robinson said.
``We in many cities have worse tensions between police and the
community than at any other time in recent history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, Bush's deputy press secretary, said the Republican
candidate expected the commission ``to evaluate changing demands
and challenges facing law enforcement and our justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the reputation of law enforcement and the
criminal justice system has been hammered coast to coast from such
controversies as illegal seizures, racial profiling, forced
confessions from suspects, and police beatings and shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Several aspects of the judicial system also have come under
fire, such as the death penalty and crowded prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Voegtlin, legislative counsel for the police chiefs
association, said the organization was pleased with Bush's support,
adding that the association hoped Gore, too, would respond to keep
the issue bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Drug forfeitures were the subject of a series of stories The
Star published in May showing police across the country were
evading state laws to improperly keep millions of dollars in cash
and property seized in drug busts and traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have laws that prohibit police from directly
benefiting from seizures in drug cases, because they see that as a
dangerous conflict of interest. Several states send the money to
public education. But police are able to keep much of the money by
handing seizures off to federal agencies, which keep a portion and
return up to 80 percent to police.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear that allowing police to profit from fighting crime
can lead to other abuses such as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what is driving some of the racial-profiling problem
is this economic motivation to make large numbers of (traffic)
stops,'' said John Crew, director of the Campaign Against Racial
Profiling arm of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore's state, Tennessee, has some of the least
stringent state forfeiture laws in the country. Even so, the
Memphis Police Department has been under investigation by a number
of agencies, including the FBI and the state auditor, for
corruption in its handling of drug money. Last month four
high-ranking employees were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports existing forfeiture laws, as well as more funding
for both law enforcement and education, Zaroulis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Star found that in Texas, where Bush is governor, police
publicly acknowledge that they bypass state law and use federal
law, which makes it easier for them to forfeit money and keep much
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the police chiefs association began considering a
national commission as a result of its research into the
racial-profiling controversy that has exploded across the country
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not take us long to recognize that there are issues
that affect the public's confidence in the entire criminal justice
system,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 national commission under President Lyndon B. Johnson
was effective, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission worked a year and a half, producing 200 specific
recommendations involving all levels of government, as well as
civic, business and religious organizations, according to the
police chiefs association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission and its recommendations marked the beginning of
a sea change in our methods for dealing with crime and the public,
and built the framework for many of the exemplary programs that
continue today,'' according to the police chiefs association.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations came at a time of rioting in many major
cities, increasing police brutality and high crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations were community policing, better
fingerprint recognition systems and a single, uniform police
telephone number, which has evolved into 911, officials for the
police chiefs association said.
</P>
<P>
   A recommendation for a national commission was met with praise
from many organizations around the country, but at the same time
they cautioned that it should not become another blue-ribbon
committee report that is quickly shelved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Eric Sterling, president of The Criminal Justice
Policy Forum in Washington and former counsel for the House
Judiciary Committee, said his organization has supported such a
commission for a number of years. But he cautioned that Congress
authorized a commission after the Ruby Ridge FBI standoff in Idaho,
but its report was a ``nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew, who has worked on police reform issues for 15 years, said
unless politicians find the will to stand up to law enforcement,
the commission recommendations would barely see daylight. He
pointed to the powerful anti-reform police organizations as a huge
barrier that politicians can't get over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police misconduct persists on a widespread basis in the United
States not because we don't know the solutions,'' Crew said. ``It's
because we lack the political will to implement those solutions.
The question is whether a presidential commission would increase or
decrease that political will.''
</P>
<P>
   But a commission could find it difficult to bridge the huge
philosophical divide over issues such as the war on drugs, said
Roger Pilon, a constitutional expert and vice president for legal
affairs with the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think tank.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some problems are ``simply intractable,'' said
Pilon, who nonetheless supports creation of such a commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Forfeitures Endanger American Rights, a national
organization that opposes the drug war, has endorsed the concept of
a commission but remains concerned that major issues such as police
corruption would not be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   But the police chiefs association should be commended for taking
such a controversial stand, said association member Joseph
McNamara, who was a police chief in San Jose and Kansas City and a
national expert in policing at the Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it deserves credit for this kind of call for candid
self-analysis,'' McNamara said.  &LR; tag1:To reach Karen Dillon, call

NEW JERSEY'S EFFORT TO RECRUIT MINORITIES FOR STATE POLICE FALLS
SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Despite a well-advertised effort to bring more
blacks, women and Latinos into the New Jersey State Police, only 15
of the 105 cadets scheduled to enter the academy next month are
black or Latino, and just one is a woman, according to statistics
released by the agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, the agency settled a discrimination suit filed
by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
by agreeing to scrap several requirements that many black
applicants considered discriminatory. The state also pledged to
make aggressive attempts to advertise and recruit in black and
Latino neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But in releasing the recruitment numbers Tuesday, the state
police superintendent, Carson Dunbar Jr., said he was disappointed
that the agency's attempt to diversify its ranks would leave the
percentage of minority troopers virtually unchanged, at 14 percent.
About 3 percent of the 2,800 current troopers are women, Dunbar
said, so the new class actually represents a decrease in the
percentage of women.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar said the strong economy was partly to blame for the
lackluster results, because many female and minority applicants had
found better-paying jobs and decided not to finish the screening
process.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that the agency's reputation remained
tarnished in many black and Latino neighborhoods because of the
Justice Department's highly publicized investigation into
discrimination by troopers and the state's admission that some
officers had engaged in racial profiling for years _ problems that
preceded his appointment last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you there's a quick fix for this
problem,'' said Dunbar, who became a New Jersey trooper himself in
1973 and was the only minority officer in his class. ``The real
answer is, it's going to be a long process.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to specify what racial breakdown the force ultimately
hopes to reach, saying that he did not want to give the mistaken
impression that the state police were adopting a quota system. New
Jersey's population is about one-third minority, and the settlement
with the NAACP the state agreed to try to broaden the demographics
of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Some elected officials said they were dismayed that the state
had failed to deliver on its promise to increase minority
representation on the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state police have missed a golden opportunity to change
its institutional image,'' said Leroy Jones Jr., a Democratic
assemblyman from Essex County. ``Clearly, they need to reassess
their approach and re-examine who they are using as consultants in
recruiting more minorities into the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some current troopers have also complained that the state
lowered its physical fitness requirements for new recruits, in an
attempt to help female applicants. During the last two years, the
state eliminated its pull-up, broad jump and vertical jump
requirements, and applicants who fail the physical test may now
take it repeatedly until they pass.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar defended the less stringent requirements, saying they
still allow the state police to winnow out those applicants who are
physically unsuited to perform the job.
</P>
<P>
   The state police worked with several consulting firms to revise
the application process and add screening that tests candidates'
temperament and decision-making abilities, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about strength, it's about what kind of person
you are,'' Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   The state police are scheduled to begin a new recruiting drive
next year and will work with the National Organization of Black Law
Enforcement Executives and the National Association of Women in
Policing to try and expand the number of female and minority
candidates. The state police may place more emphasis on reaching
out to women's sports teams, Dunbar said, and will continue to
recruit at schools and community events in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that his own experience in law enforcement
recruiting, for both the State Police and the FBI, had taught him
not to expect quick results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen that rapidly,'' he said. ``What I would like
to see is steady increases.''

DANTZSCHER ARRIVES HOME TRIUMPHANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM McCONNELL  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINA, Calif. _ Tuesday, as she has for the past eight years,
Jamie Dantzscher donned her workout clothes, put up her hair,
packed her gym bag and headed to the Charter Oak Gymnastics Center
in Covina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned onto the street where the gym is and I saw all these
TV news vans and a couple fire trucks and a bunch of cars parked
out front,'' Dantzscher said. ``I thought 'Oh my gosh, what's
happened?'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Dantzscher entered the gym and was greeted by a
big cheer from her Charter Oak Gliders teammates that it hit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me?'' she said, totally surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old from Palmdale knew then, for real and for
certain, that her Olympic dream had come true.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a certificate from U.S. Congressman David
Dreier, accepting congratulations from a couple hundred fans and
teammates, doing a half-dozen media interviews and hugging what
seemed like half the kids in Covina, Dantzscher knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``About halfway through all this today it finally dawned on me,
once and for all,'' Dantzscher said. ``I made the team. I'm an
Olympian. All that work, all those years, it all paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, with all these people and all the flowers and
balloons and banners and the interviews, I just wanted it all to go
away. You know, clear the gym and let me practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I felt all the love here. And that made me realize what
I've accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-1, 105-pound dynamo has accomplished plenty. As
perhaps the longest of longshots at last weekend's U.S. Olympic
Trails at the Fleet Center in Boston, Dantzscher overcame her lack
of national recognition and lack of international competition - as
well as two falls during her balance beam presentation - to earn
one of six spots on the U.S. women's gymnastics squad.
</P>
<P>
   She and her Gliders coaches, Steve and Beth Rybacki, depart
today for a week of training in Texas. From there, next stop is
Sydney and the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Jamie, all this still hasn't hit home yet,'' said
Steve Rybacki. ``The U.S. Trials were just incredibly stressful.
But she did a great job. I'm so proud of her, all that she has
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, up until the past couple years the big star of our
little gym was Vanessa Atler. Everyone just assumed Vanessa would
make the U.S. team. But she didn't, and Jamie did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie kept working hard, kept getting better. She is a quiet
person, but a fierce competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may talk about her falling on balance beam (at the
Trials), but the important thing to remember, and I think the thing
that impressed Bela Karolyi and the U.S. coaches, was the fact she
picked herself up and got right back up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are going to try to take it that one last step. We
know the Russians are going to be tough, all the competition at the
Games is going to be tough. But Jamie is capable of great things,
of accomplishing the unexpected. She already has.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Trials were an ordeal for Dantzscher, her coaches and
the family members and friends who were in attendance at the Fleet
Center. But she kept her cool, screened out all the politics
involved in the selection process and came through was a solid
all-around performance, especially in floor exercise, her strongest
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident of her chances, but still I knew I was going
to be a nervous wreck,'' Beth Rybacki said. ``So I told myself to
stay in control, be confident, be patient. Then Jamie fell on the
beam. Then she fell again. At that point, I just looked up and said
to myself, 'OK God, enough with the patience. Help my girl!'
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when all this hit home for me? This morning. I was
getting ready to come over here for the ceremony and the mailman
brought our mail to our door, stared at me for a moment and said
`Hey, I saw you on TV! You're that gym lady!''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Rybacki, as a 14-year-old, made the U.S. Gymnastics team in
1980. Unfortunately, that happened be the Moscow Games, which the
U.S. boycotted. So, 20 years later, Dantzscher will take up the
torch and represent the Charter Oak Gymnastics Center, and the
U.S., in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie making the team does have a special meaning for me,''
Beth Rybacki said. ``It kind of brings things full cycle, completes
the circle that I started back in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, mainly, I am just so happy for Jamie. She has shown
incredible growth since she came to us as an 11-year-old. She
worked hard, never gave up, got better and better, overcame so many
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's a tremendous accomplishment for our gym, and I think
for the world of gymnastics. It shows that the Olympic dream is
still alive, that a little girl from a little gym in a little town
like Covina can achieve a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she'd like to do it all again in six weeks time,
Dantzscher wasn't stumped for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, if it gets me out of my workout.''

 CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR SIGNS CYBER PIRACY BILL INTO LAW  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, CALIF. _ California Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday
signed a bill that will help protect individuals from being
victimized by ``cyber pirates'' who register the names of other
persons as Internet domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco, declares that it is an unfair business practice to
register an Internet domain name of another person with ``bad
faith'' intent.
</P>
<P>
   The new law ``makes a simple statement that a person should not
have to pay someone who steals their name to get it back,'' Burton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making cyber piracy an unfair business practice gives
individuals whose names are taken in bad faith an important tool to
fight back,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The law closes a gap in recently enacted federal law by
including protections for names that are not trademarked and for
the names of promising newcomers who may not meet federal
``sufficiently famous'' standards but whose names might be pirated.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers protection for the heirs of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   This law also makes it illegal to ``squat'' on a name until the
person whose name is being used offers money for the site. The
federal statute applied only if the person ``squatting'' went to
the person and demanded money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a ``squatter'' has registered the name of the
local real estate agent, but the agent then wants to start a Web
page using the domain name, the agent could take the squatter to
court.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, courts can order violators to restore money or
property acquired by such practices and can order a fine of $2,500
per incident.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed without a dissenting vote in the Legislature. It
was supported by the Screen Actors Guild, the Motion Picture
Producers Association of America and the Recording Industry
Association of America.

X GAME PLAYERS DOIN' THE CHOPSTICK LIKE MICK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Aliving wage of $9 an hour seems like a good
idea, although it depends on what your definition of ``living'' is,
and that's tough to define since we still can't all agree on what
the definition of ``is'' is.
</P>
<P>
   An hour of hard labor, nine bucks, after taxes, will get you a
gallon of gas and a triple-frappe-cappa-chilly-cino, and if you can
bum a smoke, you'll be livin' la vida poco.
</P>
<P>
   A few bargains still lurk. The X Games are a sweet deal, free
admission. The Games will cost you an arm and a leg only if you are
a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   And for what might seem like a back-alley, counterculture kind
of event, the crowds seem well-behaved, they aren't terrorizing the
city the way your standard Aluminum Siding Assn. conventioneers
will do.
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging to watch the X spectators solve the city's
transportation problem. Several hundred of the fans found parking
spots on one small street corner. What they were parking was
skateboards, at a skateboard-check stand, but still.
</P>
<P>
   The X Games are considering a return to San Francisco for a
third consecutive year, and I don't know if that's a good idea. The
Games still have that edgy youthful rebellion feel to 'em, and
there's danger that the athletes might be getting San
Franciscoized.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday about 600 of the Games participants partied at Le
Colonial, the hip Vietnamese restaurant in the old Trader Vic's
alley.
</P>
<P>
   I kind of like to picture the X Games stars eating PBJs and Moon
Pies in the shade of the Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   But no, there they were, chop-sticking at a place so hip-chic
that Mick Jagger dined there a couple nights earlier. So it's a
young-youth-meets-long-in-tooth-youth kind of a joint.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, somebody should hire Mick to do S.F. restaurant
reviews, as much as he gets around town. Or beg him to get off the
dining circuit and get back into the studio. I like him better as a
rock mobster than as an eater of rock lobster.
</P>
<P>
   WARRIOR is a term that gets tossed around a lot in sports.
</P>
<P>
   A guy is saluted as a warrior if he plays hard even though he's
in the middle of a contract dispute or a battling a case of
athlete's foot.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Smith fits a purer definition of the term. He battled his
way into basketball. He was a nobody from George Washington High
who, at USF in the early '70s, went from nonscholarship walk-on to
All-American guard.
</P>
<P>
   Then Smith was a second-round draft pick of the Warriors and
helped them win the NBA title his rookie season. He had a great
nine-year pro career.
</P>
<P>
   Now Phil is battling again. In September of '98 he was diagnosed
with multiple myeloma, a form of bone cancer twice as prevalent in
blacks as in whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the weather for a while,'' is how he explained it
when I talked to him Tuesday. He said his cell count has just taken
a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor didn't say `remission,' but I know this is a real
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil lives in San Diego with wife Angela and their five kids,
and he says he does a little fishing and coaches his 10-year-old
son's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   USF has invited Smith to a luncheon on Sept. 27 to dedicate
scholarship-endowment plaques to Phil and Art Zief Jr., whose dad
is a former USF basketball benchwarmer (and big Phil fan) who is
building the school a new law library.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's USF and Warrior teammates are invited. It's not a
sympathy event, it's a modest celebration of a modest Warrior.
</P>
<P>
   YOU THINK San Francisco is prim and grim when it comes to
smoking, you should check out Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   John Konstin of John's Grill faxes a notice posted in his
Vancouver hotel room warning guests that a British Columbia law
``forbids our employees from entering guest rooms where smoking has
taken place within the past 60 minutes. This includes housekeeping,
guest services, private bars, room service and engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   What if the room is on fire? Do firefighters have to wait in the
hall until the embers cool?
</P>
<P>
   Konstin also reports that a pack of Winstons in Vancouver costs
$7.85, which will really put a dent in a kid's allowance.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TIME to begin the beguine, but instead, Gore and Bush are
debating the debate.
</P>
<P>
   They can't agree on the where or the when or the who, and given
a chance, they probably would quibble over the why and the
backstage hors d'oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   The rift is so serious that they're probably going to have to
have a series of debate debates, the ground rules of which will be
harder to hammer out than the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   At least the fighting gives the candidates' bobos, lackeys &AMP;
flunkies something to do. And don't ask me which are which. Those
titles are strict designations of the Candidate Toadies Union.
</P>
<P>
   SEVERAL READERS have suggested scrapping the traditional system
of selecting a president in favor of the  &UR; au courant &LR;  ``Survivor''
format. Put the candidates on an island with only essential tools,
like blow-dryers and speechwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine idea,'' says Lauren Auerbach, ``as long as Cheney doesn't
wear a swimsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a risk, that one candidate would go Speedo, or
worse, to show that he has nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   I'm leery of that after seeing ``Space Cowboys,'' one scene of
which features graphic rear nudity of the four 70-year-old
astronauts _ 280 years of tush.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was artistically photographed and deeply intrinsic to
the plot, but I didn't finish my bon-bons.

 GROW A BUSINESS: NO BUSINESS SITE DOES IT ALL  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scores of business-resource Web sites pitch
themselves as meccas where small businesses can find virtually all
they need to operate successfully.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cahners In-Stat Group ( &LR; www.instat.com &LR; ) ranks 19 of
these online business centers. Although the sites are making
progress, the Scottsdale, Ariz., high-tech market-research firm
concludes they have a long way to go. Interviews with
small-business leaders show that while many enjoy timely and
relevant information online, ``they are still uncertain about
procuring services online.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the right mix of content, community and
services is yet to be found in any one player, though partnerships
promise that this will soon change,'' said Kneko Burney, an In-Stat
research director. She estimates that online business-center
revenues will mushroom from $200 million this year to more than $1
billion by 2003, and traffic will jump from 5 million visitors a
month to tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Burney defines online business centers as ``the ultimate
shopping center for business'' _ a place to do everything from
build a Web site to purchase goods and services, to talk with peers
and tap experts and manage operations. In-Stat reviewed 34 business
centers but excluded popular small business sites that are
subsidiaries of companies like Microsoft, Yahoo, IBM or Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Inc.com and Office.com tied for the No. 1 spot in In-Stat's
ranking of top business-center sites in the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Here are In-Stat's top 10 online business centers:
</P>
<P>
   -- Office.com, backed by WinStar Communications' chief executive
officer and broadband innovator Bill Rhouhana, reportedly holds the
most promise to deliver business/technology services ``seamlessly''
to the small-business market. The site's partners and in-house
experts provide plenty of services including trends, news and
gossip on 16 industries, 120 subindustries and 10 business
management areas.
</P>
<P>
   -- Inc.com, created ``for the business builder who's long on
work and short on time,'' offers fast and intuitive access to a
range of solutions, products, information and advice.
</P>
<P>
   -- DigitalWork.com provides easy-to-use online services
organized into workshops to let small businesses complete routine
tasks like marketing, finance, sales and human resources easily and
at low cost online.
</P>
<P>
   -- Entrepreneur.com, created to broaden Entrepreneur magazine's
service, aims to provide quality information, tools and community
activities to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Onvia.com, the first of the online business centers to go
public, is primarily a business-to-business marketplace for
small-business buyers and sellers. It also offers news, how-to
advice, business tools, downloadable forms, worksheets and
checklists.
</P>
<P>
   -- Allbusiness.com offers free tools and content to aid HR,
finance, legal and other work-related tasks. Its experts, strategic
alliances and links to online communities all help ease the strain
of starting and expanding a business.
</P>
<P>
   -- BizToolsPlus.com offers entrepreneurs and small businesses a
range of tools such as Web site building and hosting, business
incorporation and planning, payroll services, discounted long
distance, personal post office, online printing, 401(k) plans,
company health insurance, messaging and communication services,
office supplies search engine, administrative templates and package
tracking.
</P>
<P>
   -- SmallOffice.com helps small-office and home-office owners
build their business online with Web sites and business listings,
advice on marketing, hiring and other subjects as well as lively
discussion boards and product reviews.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dbusiness.com provides industry-specific news, e-commerce
services, business tools, and investment and research resources for
small businesses in major cities.
</P>
<P>
   -- SmartOnline.com offers proprietary online tools and resources
to start a business, build a Web storefront and manage money,
marketing and most everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Cahners In-Stat did not include in its study the scores of
online business sites that do just one or two things like
facilitate online purchases or manage human resource activities.
Burney explained, ``We looked at only 34 companies that try to
bring everything together for small businesses in an integrated
package so users don't have to leave your domain.''

NETWORTH: RATING STOCKS BY RATING THE ACCURACY OF ANALYSTS
WHO  COVER THEM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back on July 5, this column posed the questions:
Are some stock analysts smarter than others? And if so, can
investors make money by following the shrewd ones?
</P>
<P>
   The answers, based on the results of an unscientific experiment
that ran with the column, are yes and maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The column focused on StarMine, a San Francisco startup that
uses data-mining technology to track and rate brokerage-firm
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine gives analysts stars (one is worst, five is best) based
on the accuracy of their earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Then, StarMine comes up with its own earnings estimates _ named
SmartEstimates _ by using a secret formula that gives more weight
to estimates from top-rated analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Great theory. But does it work?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, StarMine gave me a list of 11 companies that it
expected to beat the consensus earnings estimate for the quarter
ended in June, and eight companies that were likely to fall short
of the consensus. (The consensus is simply the average of all
analyst estimates.)
</P>
<P>
   The results were pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine's predictions were ``directionally correct'' for 16
companies, and wrong for only two. (One company, Roper, is late
reporting earnings and I got tired of waiting.)
</P>
<P>
   That means StarMine was right 89 percent of the time, ignoring
Roper. Of course, StarMine gave me its very best ideas. Over the
long term, on thousands of stocks, StarMine claims it is
directionally correct 74 percent of the time. The company can't
predict by how much a company will beat or miss estimates _ only
the direction.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine's upside picks included three airlines, which blew away
both the consensus and SmartEstimates. Thanks to a strong economy,
everyone wanted to take a vacation, and the airlines didn't have to
engage in their usual summer fare war, explains David Lichtblau,
StarMine's vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a hero, analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter was consistently out front in revising in the
correct direction across multiple (airline) stocks,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine also accurately predicted that five energy companies
would exceed estimates. Energy companies did well across the board
as oil and natural gas prices soared.
</P>
<P>
   (Actual and consensus earnings were calculated by IBES, an
earnings research firm, and were from continuing operations.)
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the second question: Can investors make money
by paying more heed to brighter analysts?
</P>
<P>
   Here the answer is less conclusive, but more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine's ``upside predictions'' were up 2 percent on average;
its ``downside predictions'' were down 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad average, but on a company-by-company basis, there was
little correlation between earnings and stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Among companies that met or exceeded consensus estimates, half
showed an increase in their stock price and half showed a decrease.
Among those that missed estimates, four stocks went down and two
went up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens,'' concedes Lichtblau.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, earnings drive stock prices, but in the short
term, stocks react to all kinds of things _ revenue expectations,
profit margins, rumors, fear and greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our methodology works across all industries in predicting
(earnings) surprises. In terms of stock price movements, it works
better in certain sectors than others,'' Lichtblau says.
</P>
<P>
   In technology, stock prices are highly linked to earnings. ``A
surprise will really move a stock,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In our little experiment, chipmaker Integrated Device Technology
showed the biggest stock gain _ 35.4 percent _ after it beat
earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the price of energy stocks are less sensitive
to earnings, and more responsive to oil and gas prices, which
weakened in July.
</P>
<P>
   In general, growth stocks are more likely to move on earnings
surprises than value stocks, Lichtblau adds.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine also has discovered that when the consensus estimate is
a loss, and its SmartEstimate is an even bigger loss, the
SmartEstimate is not a good predictor of stock price.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the consensus is a loss, and the SmartEstimate is
a profit, or when the consensus is a profit, and the SmartEstimate
is an even bigger profit, then the SmartEstimate is a good
stock-picking tool, but only for a large number of companies.
</P>
<P>
   StarMine's products are designed for institutions that invest in
hundreds or even thousands of stocks. Most of its customers are
``quantitative'' investors looking for mathematical anomalies, not
fundamental research.
</P>
<P>
   Pankaj Agrrawal, director of quantitative research at Villanova
Capital, says he tested StarMine's software and found that ``it
does add value. This whole industry is driven by expectations of
earnings. If there's any instrument that can give us a finer
insight into whether a company is going to declare earnings that
are above or below expectations, we'd like to know. StarMine has a
very smart algorithm to predict that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, ``The power of the system lies in diversification.
If there are 10 stocks, and you buy one, it's not necessarily going
to perform. If you buy seven, maybe it could work.''
</P>
<P>
   He says investment clubs could use SmartEstimates because they
buy a lot of stocks. He also says individuals could use it as one
part of a broader investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   By late Septemeber, StarMine will start providing SmartEstimates
for most stocks on its Web site,  &LR; www.starmine.com &LR; . It will also
highlight the five companies most likely to surprise on the upside,
and the five most likely to miss estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be free, but probably won't be posted until
a few days after StarMine's institutional clients get it.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I asked StarMine to give me a few new picks.
With all the usual caveats, here they are:
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, StarMine says Potash Sask Corp. (ticker symbol
POT) will earn 43 cents, better than the consensus estimate of 38
cents. It predicts Micron Technology (MU) will earn $1 per share;
the consensus is 88 cents.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, StarMine bets Carrier Access (CACS) will earn
30 cents, missing the consensus estimate of 32 cents. And even
though airlines did well last quarter, it says US Airways (U) will
earn only 30 cents; the consensus is 42 cents.
</P>
<P>
   STARS VERSUS PAWS: StarMine isn't the only Web site that will
use top analysts to guide investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldogresearch.com, which already rates analysts (with paws
instead of stars), in the next month will add a feature called
``bones.''
</P>
<P>
   When a top-rated analyst makes a dramatic change away from the
consensus earnings estimate, the stock will get a bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will be able to see for which stocks a major shift
has taken place,'' although they won't know by how much or who made
the call, says Brent Johnstone, Bulldog's co-president.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldog uses research from Cornell University finance Professor
Charles Lee, who has found that certain revisions in earnings
estimates are a good long-term predictor of stock prices.

 E-TRADE SETTLES REPORTING CHARGES  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ E-Trade Group, the No. 2 online broker, agreed
Tuesday to pay $20,000 to settle charges it failed to file routine
reports with regulators, the second time in four months industry
watchdogs have sanctioned the firm.
</P>
<P>
   NASD Regulation, the National Association of Securities Dealers
unit that polices the securities industry, censured Menlo Park,
Calif.'s E-Trade and imposed the fine because the broker didn't
provide required data on the short-interest positions of its
customers in Nasdaq stocks during a 28-month period ending in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In May, NASD Regulation also slapped a $20,000 fine on E-Trade
for not responding on time to regulatory requests for information
about customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's failures to follow standard industry procedures were
products of the firm's headlong growth, plus its roots in the
wild-and-wooly Internet world, analysts said. The firm has recently
adopted policies and hired staff to make sure it obeys the rules,
the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is definitely mindful of the growing pains they
have had in the past and has taken corrective action,'' said
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Glenn Schorr.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting short interest to the stock markets every month is an
administrative task all brokers must perform. While brokers are
occasionally punished for filing inaccurate information, ``it's not
common for a firm that has reporting obligations to not report at
all,'' said Stephen Luparello, NASD Regulation's executive vice
president for market regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In settlement documents, the regulatory group accused E-Trade of
failing to put in place a system to ensure that the firm complied
with security laws and regulations. Specifically, NASD Regulation
said, E-Trade didn't identify a company official responsible for
making sure the firm obeyed those rules and didn't have adequate
compliance procedures.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade said short-interest reports fell through the cracks
after it took over administrative and record-keeping functions from
an outside firm in 1996. ``Procedures were not established to
capture and submit short interest information,'' the company
admitted in a statement submitted to NASD Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to file the reports ``was absolutely inadvertent,'' said
E-Trade spokesman Patrick De Chiro. ``We of course take our
regulatory compliance responsibilities very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   After NASD Regulation pointed out the reporting failure to
E-Trade, the firm adopted new procedures and began providing the
data monthly. It took regulators nearly two years to decide on
punishment because they needed to analyze at length whether
E-Trade's reporting failure damaged the stock market, Luparello
said.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's actions meant that short-interest data released by
Nasdaq from 1996 through 1998 were inaccurate, though probably not
enough to make a meaningful difference, NASD Regulation eventually
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Investors take short positions when they sell a stock they don't
own, temporarily borrowing it from another account. They do so in
hopes the stock price will fall, allowing them to pocket the
difference when they later buy shares to replace the stock they
borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Market pros avidly crunch Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange
short-interest data each month, looking for signs that investors
expect a company's shares to fall.
</P>
<P>
   From September 1996 to September 1998, about the period when
E-Trade failed to report short interest, the firm's total accounts
skyrocketed from 91,000 to 544,000, swamping the firm's
administrative capacity.
</P>
<P>
   As the firm has matured, it has moved to stabilize its
operations. Two months ago, E-Trade hired security industry veteran
Charles Nalbone as its chief compliance officer. Nalbone previously
oversaw regulatory compliance for Bear Stearns, a well-regarded
old-line Wall Street firm.

 OLD-TIME SERVICE AT OAKLAND HARDWARE STORE  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, CALIF. _ At Ace Ellis Hardware in North Oakland,
Calif., one-on-one customer service is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Personal assistance is not a policy handed down by some
touchy-feely chief executive. It is simply the best way for the
54-year-old store to stay in business in its neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   To deter shoplifters, most of the family-owned shop's supply of
bolts, wire, hammers and spackle are behind a front counter.
Customers line up to ask questions and request merchandise, which
helpful staffers retrieve from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Ace Ellis, of course, is not the first business in a rough
neighborhood to eliminate self-service. Minimarts, liquor stores
and gas stations are known to put up counters and, in extreme
circumstances, bulletproof glass walls.
</P>
<P>
   But in this era of huge, impersonal home-improvement centers,
the counter has become Ace Ellis' secret weapon. A cult of
in-the-know do-it-yourselfers happily drive there from miles around
_ forgoing nearer hardware stores in spiffier neighborhoods _ for
guaranteed face time with Ace Ellis' knowledgeable staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know everything _ plumbing, heating, fixtures _ and they
have enormous patience explaining it to you,'' said Greg Greer, a
Lafayette painting contractor and landlord who shops at Ace Ellis
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get what I need quickly and easily and I'm out the
door,'' said Greer. ``The prices are very fair.''
</P>
<P>
   By adapting to its surroundings, Ace Ellis has managed to stay
in business while a neighboring grocery store, bank, restaurants
and pharmacies have all closed their doors.
</P>
<P>
   And the store, crammed from floor to ceiling with merchandise,
is thriving, pulling in annual sales of $200 to $250 per square
foot, said co-owner Paul Eames.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with $88 for the average independent hardware
store, according to the National Retail Hardware Association.
Co-owner Barbara Eames, Paul's sister, says one-on-one service
gives employees a chance to boost sales and help customers at the
same time. ``We always ask, `Do you need gloves with that shovel?'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's a very 18th century model,'' said Paco
Underhill, a retail consultant and author of the book, ``Why We
Buy: The Science of Shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how stores used to be _ you walked in and said, `This
is what I need,' and they gave it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In another anachronistic twist, Ace Ellis, which serves about
250 customers a day, is one of a handful of retailers not using a
computer to track inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Barbara and Paul Eames and their employees carry the
locations of 20,000 items in the store and an adjacent warehouse
around in their heads. When goods are sold, they note it on a
clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Ace Ellis business model wouldn't work on a large scale,
said Underhill. However, ``There are people who can buck all of the
trends and be able to create a viable business because they care.''
</P>
<P>
   Ace Ellis has stuck it out through difficult times. The store,
at 5424 Martin Luther King Jr. Way, was built in 1946 by Hubert
Ellis and Bill Eames. As a teenager, Eames worked at Ellis'
hardware store on College Avenue a few miles away. Ellis closed
that shop and, after World War II, the two became partners.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Martin Luther King Jr. Way was called Grove Street,
and the area was populated by working-class Italian families and
retirees. Eames bought Ellis' share of the store in 1954 but kept
the historic name. (The Eameses joined the Ace buying cooperative
in the early 1970s and added ``Ace'' to the store's name.)
</P>
<P>
   The construction of elevated BART tracks above Grove Street in
the late 1960s and early '70s ``crucified everybody'' doing
business there, remembers Bill Eames, now retired.
</P>
<P>
   Grove Street was torn up for several years. Sometimes Ellis
Hardware brought in as little as $50 a day _ not much for Bill and
Catherine Eames, who were raising nine young children.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, crime was increasing in North Oakland. Many
local businesses, including a Hagstrom grocery store and Bank of
America, closed their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Ace Ellis continued to serve the neighborhood despite growing
racial tension. Black Panther founder Bobby Seale and his father
were customers, remembers Bill Eames.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the store suffered a spate of crimes,
including several armed robberies. Once, nighttime burglars melted
the back door with acid. Another time, Paul Eames arrived at work
one morning to find a pool of blood on the floor under a broken
skylight. The store's ceiling still has four patched holes from
robbery attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never really got very much,'' said Eames, because the
store doesn't stock many big-ticket items.
</P>
<P>
   Shoplifting was also a problem, prompting the decision in the
late 1970s to install the counter. ``It was either get out or do
the counter,'' Eames said. Shoplifting incidents dropped from once
per week to about once per year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nine Eames children, who were raised in Lafayette,
worked in the store at one time or another, ``kind of like musical
chairs,'' said Paul. In 1985, Paul and Barbara Eames and brother
Patrick, who happened to be working there full time, bought out
their father's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Patrick Eames sold his stake to his two siblings
and opened his own store, Eames Hardware and Supply in Pleasant
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult to gauge the effects of competition, the
Eameses have not noticed any impact from the enormous Home Depot
that opened in nearby Emeryville in 1994. ``We felt it for one or
two months, max,'' said Paul Eames.
</P>
<P>
   Ace Ellis recently stopped advertising _ a practice it had
started when Home Depot opened _ and noticed no change in sales or
traffic, Eames said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to stay competitive with good service _ that's the
whole strategy,'' Eames said. ``I hear complaints at the counter
all the time, (with) customers saying, `If I ever go there again,
shoot me.' We'd almost like to be across the street from Home
Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, California's economic boom is starting to hit North
Oakland, and crime appears to be declining. Home prices have
doubled during the past 18 months, and some are going for $450,000
or more, said Greer, who owns rental property in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood's rising tide, of course, gives Ace Ellis a
lift, letting it sell even more hinges, switch plates, posthole
diggers and vials of Liquid Wrench.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there are no plans to remove the counter.

 TV ADS STAY OUT OF CALIFORNIA _ FOR NOW  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the third presidential election in a row, California could
be disappearing from the Republican political radar.
</P>
<P>
   While GOP officials continue to insist that they will challenge
Democratic nominee Al Gore for the state's 54 delegates, California
is not one of the 21 ``battleground'' states where Republican
George W. Bush began running television ads this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do expect to have ads in California later in the
campaign,'' said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign.
``It's a state that Gov. Bush takes seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   California Republicans have heard that line before. In 1992 and
again in 1996, national campaign directors said they were fighting
for the state while quietly directing their resources elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``With five or six key congressional races in the state, there's
been a lot of pressure for the party to keep someone campaigning in
California,'' said Bruce Cain, a political science professor at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``George Bush has tried to
say all the right things and show the flag ... but it's been
symbolic all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Democrats' post-convention bounce in the polls putting
Bush and Gore in a virtual tie heading into the fall campaign,
Republicans are likely to start focusing their efforts on the
states where they believe they have the best chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   That's what those 21 states represent, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious buy in the major media markets of 21
states,'' he said. ``It is a significant and serious ad buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the Bush campaign purposely avoided buying ads in
the nation's three biggest states because of the cost of doing
business there.
</P>
<P>
   A look at those states, however, suggests other reasons
Republicans might want to stay out of the ad wars. California and
New York are considered strong states for Gore, while Bush's home
state of Texas is a slam-dunk for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is running ads in all but one of the nation's next
seven largest states, avoiding only New Jersey, which shares the
expensive New York media market.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who began running ads Tuesday in 17 states, also is
avoiding the big three of California, New York and Texas. But his
advertising is going head-to-head with Bush's in big electoral vote
states such as Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan suggested the Bush ad campaign could be expanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor Day is the typical start of the campaign, so I would
expect to see an ad campaign starting then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While talk is cheap, television ads in a state the size of
California are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing a campaign in Indiana, and I spent $2 million,''
said Arnie Steinberg, a Republican media consultant. ``It would
probably cost $9 million to get the same exposure in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding off on spending the millions needed for a California ad
campaign makes sense for both parties, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be wise to monitor the situation and be
prepared to put money in later if they need to,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   That also would allow Bush and Gore to keep the spending at the
minimum if the California contest begins to look like a runaway.
</P>
<P>
   While a poll conducted early this month by the Public Policy
Institute of California showed the presidential contest in the
state tightening up, Gore has shown consistent strength in
California, which in recent years has become a growing Democratic
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that the Bush campaign will decide to spend time
and money in California,'' said Bob Mulholland, a spokesman for the
state Democratic Party. ``But if you look at the Republicans in
California, they don't have any deckhands. We'll have Sen. (Dianne)
Feinstein and Gov. (Gray) Davis running up and down the state for
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles last week also
gave Gore a huge boost in the state, Mulholland said. Four nights
of television and page after page of stories in local newspapers
can't help but have an effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't buy that kind of coverage,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting Bush will abandon the state completely.
Dick Cheney, the GOP vice presidential candidate, spent the past
two days in Redlands, Bakersfield and Santa Barbara, for example,
while Bush is tentatively due back in California in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fight for the 270 electoral votes needed to become
president, the money will be spent where it will do the most
political good. And if Republicans decide that money earmarked to
take on Gore in California would be better spent in the Midwest,
that is what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bush could make some ad buys in the Central Valley and
the central coast, swing areas where television is relatively
inexpensive,'' said Cain of UC Berkeley. ``That way he could keep
his finger in the water and also keep the party happy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush stays off the California airwaves completely, it would
be another blow for state Republicans, who have had little to cheer
about in recent years. It also could hurt other Republicans when
they come into the state to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe California Republicans would donate tons of
money and get nothing in return,'' Cain said.

 DAVIS SEEKS U.S. AID FOR LOW-INCOME ELECTRIC BILLS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As electricity rates continue to soar in
Southern California, Gov. Gray Davis sought federal funds Tuesday
from President Clinton to help low-income people pay their power
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully urge you to exercise your authority to release
Federal Emergency Contingency Funds to the State of California,''
Davis wrote in a letter to the president. ``My highest priority for
those funds would be to dedicate them to addressing the needs of
those in the San Diego area.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been under growing pressure to find ways to relieve
the impact of deregulation of California's electricity market. In
San Diego, the first city to feel the full effects of deregulation,
power bills have more than doubled in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the federal assistance would be targeted at families
earning less than 60 percent of the state median income.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a family of four earning about $33,000 would be
eligible for assistance with its power bills. For individuals, the
income level would be about $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not specify how much assistance would be made
available to each recipient.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that low-income people do need help paying
sky-high electricity bills, consumer activists said it appeared
that Davis may have his priorities misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that deregulation is not working,'' said
Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights in Los Angeles. ``What the governor needs to do is
admit that deregulation is a disaster and undo it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything short of that,'' he added, ``is like putting a
Band-Aid on an open wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman for Consumer Action, a San Francisco
grassroots organization, said she found it ironic that ``the state
went to so much trouble to deregulate its electricity industry and
is now running to the feds for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have warned that the surging power bills in San
Diego will be mirrored throughout the state as other utilities lift
a freeze on electricity rates.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. has said that its
customers could feel the impact of deregulation as early as next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has called for investigations of power generators by state
and federal regulators. He has charged power companies with gouging
consumers as California's demand for juice far outstrips available
supply.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the state Public Utilities Commission voted to cap
electricity bills in San Diego for most ratepayers. Local
officials, however, criticized the measure as too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in Sacramento are now preparing their own
rate-freeze measure to provide relief to Southern California
electricity users while a long-term fix is sought for the state's
energy woes.

EDITORIAL: THE KURSK AND THE KREMLIN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 23:,
</P>
<P>
   For a week and a half, the tragic plight of the 118 officers and
sailors trapped aboard the sunken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk
drew expressions of compassion and offers of assistance from around
the world. But for most of this period, Russia's president,
Vladimir Putin, seemed aloof and distant. He declined, during the
most critical days, to cut short his Black Sea vacation and go
immediately to the site where his presence could have energized the
navy's rescue operations and would, at any rate, have symbolized
the government's concern at a moment of national tragedy. Only
Tuesday did he finally visit the submarine's home base to console
grieving relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to know if more active leadership on Putin's part
could have saved lives. But his performance has been disheartening
for those who hoped to see a more democratic Russia shedding the
habits of secrecy and indifference to human suffering that marred
so many centuries of czarist and Soviet rule. If Putin hopes to
build the strong democratic state he often speaks of, he must learn
some hard lessons from the Kursk affair. In a democracy, public
appearances and ceremonies are a key part of leadership, and
symbolic shows of concern can do much to heal a nation's grief.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's government was slow in informing its own people and the
world of the desperate situation aboard the Kursk. The first
official announcements came two days after the vessel plunged to
the bottom of the Barents Sea, and British and Norwegian help was
not accepted until four days after the sinking. Putin let two more
days go by before breaking off his vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Such public callousness would be unthinkable in any Western
democracy. But it is a long, sad tradition in Russia, dating back
to czars like Ivan the Terrible, Alexander III and Nicholas II, and
Soviet-era tyrants like Stalin. Putin is not in that league, but as
a Soviet-era KGB agent he was raised in the Russian autocratic
tradition, which values state interests above human life. Democracy
cannot be built on such foundations, nor in the long run can
political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Another unfortunate legacy of Russian history is the heritage of
government control and manipulation of vital information. Even a
reformer like Mikhail Gorbachev initially tried to conceal the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. But Gorbachev came to
understand that democratic reform in Russia required a more open
and candid government and a free and independent press.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other lessons to draw from the Kursk disaster.
Undoubtedly, Russia needs to spend more money on maintenance and
safety for its submarine fleet. Plans for international
coordination in future rescue attempts should be prepared in
advance. NATO and Russia both should move away from close shadowing
of each other's submarines that can lead to accidental bumpings,
although an explosion and not a collision seems to have sunk the
Kursk. But the most intriguing question is whether this tragedy can
educate Putin in the arts of compassionate and accountable
leadership.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: BAIL FOR WEN HO LEE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's case for refusing bail to Wen Ho Lee,
the former Los Alamos scientist accused of improperly downloading
and copying classified nuclear weapons data, has been seriously
weakened by revelations that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
lead agent in the case provided misleading testimony in two
separate bail hearings last December.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's guilt or innocence will ultimately be determined at trial.
But given the government's misrepresentations and new evidence
suggesting that the case against Lee is weaker than first thought,
fairness demands that Lee be granted bail while he awaits trial.
Because of the gravity of the charges, he should continue to be
kept under strict surveillance, with monitoring devices and any
trips from his home approved by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest last December, Lee has been held in solitary
confinement, and even in shackles, because the government contends
he poses an extraordinary threat to national security. This picture
was created in part by the testimony of Robert Messemer, the lead
FBI agent, indicating that Lee engaged in deliberate deception when
he downloaded classified information onto computer tapes, seven of
which are now missing.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Messemer admitted in court that his previous
statements under oath were incorrect. He originally said Lee had
told another scientist at Los Alamos that he wanted to borrow his
computer to download a resume. But in FBI interviews and grand jury
testimony the colleague did not mention a resume, and  &UR; said  &LR; Lee
had only said that he wanted to download ``some files.''
</P>
<P>
   Messemer had also testified that Lee did not disclose contacts
he made with Chinese scientists during an approved trip to Beijing
in 1986. But in fact, Lee filed a report on those contacts after
the trip. In addition, Messemer said last December that Lee had
sent letters to several overseas institutions seeking employment.
The government apparently is now operating under the theory that
one of Lee's motives for downloading data was to impress potential
employers. But Messemer admitted this week that while letters were
found on Lee's home computer, there is no evidence they had been
sent or received.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer's erroneous statements are not the only troubling
aspect of the government's case. The government has insisted that
the data Lee downloaded were the ``crown jewels'' of the nuclear
defense system and argues that Lee must be kept in prison because
he might transfer nuclear secrets to China or other countries. Yet
John Richter, a former top nuclear weapons designer at Los Alamos,
and Harold Agnew, former director of Los Alamos, have said that the
downloaded data would not be useful to a foreign power, and that
much of the information is already in public records. Lee has
indicated that he was making backup copies of the data, and that
his actions were in line with his job.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, scheduled for November, will be the arena to examine
the full case against Lee. The FBI's misstatements to the court,
however, cast troubling doubt on the integrity of the
investigation.

INSURANCE NOMINEE PLEDGES NEUTRALITY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Retired Justice Harry Low sailed through his first
confirmation hearing to become insurance commissioner Tuesday, but
the San Francisco native offered few details on how he would
approach critical insurance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Members of an Assembly committee questioned Low repeatedly about
his ability to be not just an impartial judge, but an advocate for
consumers. Low said that as commissioner he will ``administer'' the
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that my role as insurance commissioner will be to
fairly and impartially administer the laws as the Legislature
enacted,'' said Low, who will become the highest-ranking Asian
American in state government if he is confirmed. ``However, the
laws are also directed toward the protection of consumers, and I
intend to enforce the laws. However, as commissioner you must be
fair to everyone, and that includes businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis named Low, a former state appeals court justice,
to serve out the remaining two years of former Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush's term. Quackenbush resigned earlier
this year to avoid almost certain impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly committee approved Low on a unanimous bipartisan
vote, and his confirmation is also expected to sail through an
Assembly floor vote, and votes in the state Senate later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Low said he would resign from all other activities, including
his current job as a mediator and arbitration judge. Two
independent lawyers reviewed the rulings he made while on the bench
and said they were extremely thoughtful and fair.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers and consumer advocates were clearly concerned
that Low's self-described neutrality is not pro-consumer enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has not promised the consumer that he will be there
for them,'' Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights said after the hearing. ``He has a huge move to make toward
the position of being an advocate rather than a judge. He's no
longer a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, also said she was
concerned about the language she heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard the word `tough,' '' she said. ``Although
evenhanded and fair are good, I think tough implies that there will
be rigorous enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Low said he would be tough if companies were clearly wrong, but
often repeated his desire to be seen as fair to all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be fair, and I hope that the public _ and the public
includes businesses _ views me as a fair person,'' he said. ``I
can't say I'd necessarily be an advocate for one group or another.
I see my role as an administrator _ to administer the laws and I
intend to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, also
cautioned Low against being influenced by Davis, who received
significant campaign contributions from insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters in California made a decision to create a
constitutional officer with this position, and now we have a
situation where the executive made the choice, not the voters,''
Hertzberg told Low. ``It's difficult when our allegiance is to
someone who appointed us to remember that we must be independent,
and to represent all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Low repeated his pledge not to accept any money
from insurance companies or any other donors. And while this would
make it difficult to seek the office in two years, Low has not yet
ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also asked a series of questions on issues ranging
from the Northridge earthquake claims, low-cost auto insurance and
workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Mishandling of the earthquake claims brought down Quackenbush,
and Low said he supports efforts to try to get the settlements made
with insurance companies voluntarily rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Low also said that upon taking the office he will immediately
take steps to improve morale, hire staff and investigate whether
the state should be paying Quackenbush's legal fees.

 EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A LOOK BEHIND AL GORE'S PUNCH LANGUAGE Byc.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Tuesday's Times, Katharine Q. Seelye documented the use of
``working families'' as a thematic catch phrase in speeches by Vice
President Al Gore and his surrogates. This technique of disciplined
repetition is similar to that used by Gov. George W. Bush to give
brand-name status to ``compassionate conservatism.'' In either
party, it is all part of a process that Stuart Stevens, a Bush
strategist, calls ``finding a language'' for a candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   To my ear, an especially striking part of the language of this
year's presidential contest has been Gore's use of the word
``fight.'' It is hard to recall an acceptance speech with more
pugilistic imagery than that delivered by Gore in Los Angeles last
Thursday. The indisputably bellicose Richard Nixon had only one
``fight'' in his 1972 acceptance speech. Gore used ``fight,'' or
derivative verbal and noun forms, 23 times. Often, of course, the
construction was about ``fighting for working families,'' a
combination designed, as Seelye reported, to underscore the message
of economic populism that dominated the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   But even when it is tactically selected, the language that
candidates choose tells us something about their inner lives,
personal histories and psychological comfort zones. Bush, for
example, really does come from a three-generation family political
tradition that believes that conservatism should be leavened with a
paternalistic kind of caring. That is why George Bush the elder had
to wriggle so hard to get into Ronald Reagan's ideological suit,
and may also provide a clue as to why Bush is always insisting that
he will not enter the White House wearing ``borrowed clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, does the language of combat tell us about Gore and
others who use it on the stump? I thought first of a very different
kind of Southern presidential candidate, the late George C. Wallace
of Alabama. ``The fighting judge'' never seemed to feel fully alive
unless he had a posture of aggression toward a world of entitled
power _ the federal government, the Kennedys, the fraternity boys
at the University of Alabama _ that he always suspected of looking
down on him. Gore does not seem burdened by feelings of personal or
regional inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   But he does long to be perceived as a conviction politician. His
cleanup chores in the Clinton administration have undermined that
image with the public and, one suspects, within Al Gore as well.
Fighting words provide a way for Gore to depict himself as more
resolute than President Clinton and more reliable than his
attractive but untested opponent. Both thoughts figured in Gore's
observation that ``the presidency is more than a popularity
contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people'' in which one must
sometimes ``pick the hard right over the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A reading of ``The Prince of Tennessee,'' by David Maraniss and
Ellen Nakashima, convinced me that fighting words serve some other
purposes for Gore as well. On one level, they link him to a
longstanding Democratic oratorical tradition. As Jimmy Carter noted
in his 1980 acceptance speech, Democrats like to see themselves as
``the party of a courageous fighter who knew how to give 'em hell _
Harry Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the pugnacious populist seems especially important to
Gore, perhaps because it eases an inner anxiety about his
privileged background. On a more personal level, verbal warfare
connects the vice president to his father, a New Deal Democrat who
preferred lunch-pail issues over the austere campaign oriented
toward defense policy that Gore ran in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss and Nakashima write that slashing debate is Gore's
instinctive response to virtually every competitive political
situation. The record bears them out. In all his campaigns since
1976, Gore has felt more secure, more grounded _ and been more
successful _ when on the attack. His dismantling of Bill Bradley in
the Democratic primaries continued the pattern. And in the last few
days, Gore has rocked Bush, who looked very wobbly on the stump
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans still insist they can turn Gore's bellicosity
against him with accusations of class warfare. But Gore may face
another more subtle danger. Constant feistiness can wear out
political audiences, especially in a time when suburban moderates
do not feel particularly threatened by the greedy forces conjured
by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush's macro bet for the campaign is that voters are
sick of what he calls ``bitter arguments.'' At this point, Gore is
drawn by strategy and instinct to the opposite view. His message is
not the blurry and Bushian ``I care,'' but an updated version of
Harry Truman that could be summed up as ``Let's get ready to
rumble.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls make Gore's bet on smash-mouth politics look smart at
the moment. But it is a close question as to whether he could play
another game if later opinion surveys showed a public weariness
with his continuous announcements that it's fight time in America.

LEGISLATIVE OVERHAUL OF NURSING HOMES ANTICIPATED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The Legislature is expected to approve a major
overhaul Wednesday of how the state oversees California's 1,400
nursing homes, after weakening some provisions to satisfy Gov. Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of changes, the bill quadruples fines for
nursing homes found to have caused the death of a resident and
requires the state to respond within 24 hours to the most serious
complaints about care.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor vetoed a stronger bill last year because
he disagreed with language requiring nursing homes to increase
staffing. Mandatory staffing requirements have been eliminated this
year at his request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly all it could be, but we pushed the rock
halfway up the hill,'' said Sen. John Vasconcellos, D-Santa Clara.
``We had a great bill last year but the governor vetoed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, D-San Francisco, whose tougher
nursing home standards bill was nixed by the governor last year,
described his measure this year as a ``wonderful start.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100,000 beds in California's 1,400 nursing
homes. The state has been grappling with improving care for more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 federal study found that 30 percent of California's
nursing homes cause death or serious harm to their residents.
</P>
<P>
   During a June heat wave, two residents of a Burlingame nursing
home died. The Department of Health Services cited Sunbridge Care
and Rehabilitation and fined the home $141,000 for those deaths and
several other serious violations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state Department of Health Services issued 29
citations charging nursing homes with causing a patient's death.
That's up from 14 such citations issued in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There were an additional 253 citations for serious harm caused
to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill that is expected to pass Wednesday, fines for
those violations increase from a maximum of $25,000 to $100,000
when death occurs and from $10,000 to a maximum of $20,000 for a
serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   To advocates for the elderly, the most significant improvement
in care would be increased staffing _ and better staff training.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley's bill last year required that by 2003, staffing hours
would increase from 3.2 hours to 3.5 hours per patient per day.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto, Davis said that increase would have been too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley's current bill merely says the Legislature wants to see
the staffing hours rise _ it does not mandate such an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Training is increased by 10 hours _ six hours of instruction on
abuse and four hours on Alzheimer's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current bill, nursing assistants _ the people who aid
patients in caring for themselves _ are required to have 150 hours
of training, some on-the-job, some in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires only half that much training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manicurists and pedicurists have to have 1,600 hours of
training,'' said Pat McGuiness of the California Advocates for
Nursing Home Reform in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who cares for your toenails has 10 times more training
than someone who looks after your parents,'' McGuiness said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's budget contains $210 million in state money to boost
the reimbursement nursing homes receive for patients covered under
Medi-Cal, the state's health care program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, $80 million is earmarked for salary increases
for nursing home staff.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's budget contained money for a 5 percent pay increase.
The $80 million is an additional 7.2 percent increase, Shelley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the pay raise, the average hourly wage of a nursing
assistant was $6.90, said Shelley.
</P>
<P>
   McGuiness said the bill started out even weaker than it ended
up. When introduced, it represented what changes Davis was willing
to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor had a lot of proposals in there we were opposed
to because they would have weakened the enforcement system we have
right now,'' McGuiness said.
</P>
<P>
   McGuiness credited Shelley and Vasconcellos with prodding Davis
to make the bill stronger _ although not as strong as she and other
advocates wanted it to be.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Quicker Response to Complaints
</P>
<P>
   The bill also improves the way the state handles complaints
about care, McGuiness said. The state would now respond to
complaints of possible serious harm or death within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been real problems with timeliness of response,''
McGuiness said. ``Sometimes the response comes after the death.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Klutz, deputy director of licensing and certification at
the Department of Health Services, said this year's bill grants the
department stronger enforcement powers.
</P>
<P>
   The department would have the power to appoint a temporary
manager for a nursing home found to be endangering the lives of its
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also gives the department the power to issue a
probationary license, if a nursing home does not meet state
standards.
</P>
<P>
   If care is not improved within six months, the state can demand
that a new owner take over.
</P>
<P>
   The department also inspects nursing homes to see whether they
meet federal care requirements. But if an inspector finds a nursing
home is not meeting federal requirements, that information cannot
be used to revoke the home's state license.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley's bill would allow inspection findings to affect state
licensing.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also orders the department to stagger the schedule of
annual inspections to better gauge day-to-day living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no party that's 100 percent happy with the bill and no
party who is 100 percent unhappy with it,'' said Judy Citko, vice
president of the California Healthcare Association, which opposed
the bill because of the increased fines. ``That's the sign of a
compromise.''

   CAMPAIGN-MILITARY (Washington) _ Ever since President Clinton

Now he finds himself _ by all accounts reluctantly _ at the center
of a highly partisan debate over the state of the American

the administration, on one hand, while at least indirectly
underscoring some of the Republican criticisms leveled against it.

by the companies themselves. Some investment strategies are based
in part on those numbers. But how good are those numbers? Only as
good as the reports from brokerage firms, which are required to add

<P>
   BOSTON _ As you might expect, the Red Sox were in high spirits
Tuesday afternoon, the pleasure of Monday night's thrilling
overtime comeback as fresh as the uniforms clubhouse man Joe
Cochran and his crew hung in each locker.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez cavorted around the yard wearing a do-rag in the
colors of the Dominican flag, his baseball cap nowhere in sight.
Carl Everett took batting practice, then donned a headset and
fielded questions on a radio talk show that has been less than
flattering to him.
</P>
<P>
   And Brian Daubach, the architect of not one but two dramatic
late-inning rallies Monday, signed autographs for kids clustered
around the Sox dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Then, regrettably for those who wanted the good times to keep on
rolling, the game began and the Sox were in tall grass once again,
and this time they were in way over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   They spotted Anaheim one too many leads Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, falling,
11-4, to the Angels and tossing away a chance to move ahead of the
field in the wild-card race before a crowd of 33,163 in Fenway
Park, the 39th straight sellout.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox bounced back once for starter Tim Wakefield, rallying
from a 4-0 deficit to tie the score in the fourth, then
disintegrated in a six-run fifth that assured Mo Vaughn of his
first win in eight tries in Boston since he began wearing a halo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to keep us in there as long as I could,'' said
Wakefield, who has allowed 18 hits and 13 earned runs in his last
two starts, in which he has pitched a total of 10 2/3 innings, and
has gone more than a month since running off four straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fifth, I just couldn't get an out. It's not easy to
swallow, but I'm still going to work hard and try to keep a
positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, whose single touched off the deciding rally, said even
before the win that he just might have to stop by his favorite
nightclub, the one where customers throw as many dollar bills on
the stage as the Angels sprayed hits around Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn, I missed that plane that came by,'' Vaughn said of the
plane that flew over Fenway Monday night pulling a ``welcome back''
banner from the establishment in which he stopped by a time or two
during his term with the Sox. ``That's what me and Nomar were
laughing about on his way back to the dugout that night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 14 hits, six in the fifth inning, giving Vaughn
as many wins against the Sox here as he has had handshakes with Sox
general manager Dan Duquette. They met behind the batting cage
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `Hi' to him when I saw him,'' Vaughn said. ``I told
somebody the other day, `You got to work at being angry at
somebody, and I'm not going to do that.' I'm not focused on
negatives. I'm a happy guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It cheered Vaughn that his reception here wasn't the same wall
of booing that greeted him upon his return a year ago. Cheers could
be heard, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised by the fan reaction,'' Vaughn said. ``I
just felt like it's been two years, they've taken the time to think
about what happened with the whole situation. I'm not saying they
agree with it, but they took the time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense gave Wakefield plenty to think about, too.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus, the third baseman out of UCLA who could have served
as the model for Disney's Hercules, had three doubles and scored
three runs. He had reached base on eight straight plate appearances
(four doubles, four walks) until he lined to left in his last
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Orlando Palmeiro, filling in for Darin Erstad, the
injured major league hits leader, had two doubles and two singles,
driving in three runs and scoring another. Everyone in the Angels'
lineup except Kevin Stocker reached base, and while there were no
home runs on a night the flags were blowing out toward left field,
the Angels had six doubles.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox offense, meanwhile, expired around the same time
Garciaparra was cut down at the plate on a strong relay from
shortstop Stocker after Troy O'Leary's double in the fourth. Lou
Merloni already had scored on O'Leary's hit to tie the score at 4
when Garciaparra was cut down, catcher Bengie Molina holding onto
the ball even as Garciaparra planted his toe in the catcher's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last Sox hit of the night off Kent Mercker _ the
lefthander whose cameo appearance with the Sox last season included
a Game 1 start in the ALCS _ and two relievers. Mercker, the fifth
straight lefty starter the Sox have faced, stranded six runners in
the first three innings, but combined with relievers Al Levine (two
innings) and Lou Pote (one) to hold the Sox hitless over the final
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the ball good, we hit a lot of balls good,'' said Sox
manager Jimy Williams, who didn't name names but could have cited
catcher Jason Varitek, who crushed four balls and had only one
single off the pitcher to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who missed three months because of a brain hemorrhage
he suffered in May, won for the first time since he was on the
mound last Sept. 29 in Chicago, in the game that clinched a
wild-card spot for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to see him on the mound again,'' Red Sox pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan said of the likable Mercker. ``I talked with him
in Anaheim about what happened to him. He said it felt like someone
hit him in the back of the head with a bat, and it stayed that way
for three days. He was on every kind of painkiller. Morphine,
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jokes now about what happened to him. After what he went
through, I'm happy he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, Mercker helped drop the Sox a half-game behind
the surging Cleveland Indians in the wild-card race. Oakland also
fell a half-game back, while the Angels pulled within 2 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had promised visitors that the Angels were the type of
team not easily brought down, even after losses as painful as
Monday's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team doesn't get knocked down much,'' Vaughn said. ``Bad
things happen, but they don't affect these guys.''

A REARMED RAMON MARTINEZ WOULD HELP RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shhh. Don't tell Ramon Martinez what it's like to
``Shuffle off to Buffalo.'' Let him experience for himself the
majesty of a bus ride with the Pawtucket Red Sox on the New York
ThruWay. Tell him Bison Stadium is like Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   And hope that he gets the message.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who are sending the 32-year-old righthander to
Buffalo for a rehab start Friday, will need him at his best for the
September marathon of games that will have great bearing on the
playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Martinez came out of nowhere to help the Red Sox
make the playoffs. He started the season on the disabled list but
by June he not only made the roster but also started four games,
posting a 2-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   In two playoff appearances last year, Martinez was 0-1. He
pitched 5 2/3 innings of a 9-3 victory over Cleveland in the
Division Series but did not get the decision. He was the losing
pitcher in Game 2 of the ALCS against the Yankees, a 3-2 setback in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt what the man can do,'' said Red Sox pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan. ``The man is a big-time pressure pitcher, a
clutch pitcher. If there is somebody on this team besides Pedro
(Martinez) you would rather give the ball to, it will be Ramon or
Bret Saberhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been doubts about Ramon in recent weeks. He is
currently on the disabled list because of a contusion on the right
knee. Adding to that is a growing concern that his delivery is
flawed, so it is clear why the Buffalo trip is a must.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's 8-6 record is not bad, but a 6.14 earned run average
in 21 games makes the club nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see Ramon make an adjustment of about 6 inches,''
said Kerrigan. ``That means making an adjustment in his delivery.
The idea is to be more strike-efficient. If you have a good
delivery, you're going to have a better potential to throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox aren't asking him to perform miracles. But they'd like
to see the 10-year veteran tighten up his game for the final month
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   To the same end, Pete Schourek pitched Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night in
Pawtucket, and Saberhagen also will work Friday. The Sox know the
toughest part of the season is ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams, looking to the September crunch, said,
``We have six days and eight games, including back-to-back splits.
So that is why you need starting pitchers. Somebody's got to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is not like we have a regular rotation. We take one game
at a time. Other than that, I don't know how it's going to line
up.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Ramon Martinez will be in Buffalo Friday night.
He can't afford to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to make adjustments in this game,'' said
Kerrigan. ``I don't care if it's your first year in the big
leagues, your fifth, 10th year. This game is all about
adjustments.''

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS CONSIDER BILL CAPPING ELECTRICITY RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS lede to clarify)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mount- ing political concern over what many are
describing as deregulation run amok in the electricity market in
San Diego prompted a major but incon- clusive battle in the State
Assembly today over a bill that would place a broad cap on power
costs in the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the state utility commission narrowly approved a
partial rate cap for San Diego, the first city in California to be
deregulated, but many people said they believed it was too little
to help customers being hit with bills that have doubled or tripled
in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, the bill, which was passed previously by the
state Senate by 28-0, had still not been voted on, and it was
facing resistance because of the expected costs to the state,
perhaps many hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But several legislative aides said late Tuesday that it appeared
that supporters of the measure did not have enough votes yet to
pass it, and that its fate was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, skyrocketing power rates in San Diego, the first
city in a pioneering state program, has suddenly become a source of
concern because of the unexpected rate increases. Deregulation was
undertaken because the Legislature believed it would prove an
antidote to what were already high power rates in the state,
roughly 50 percent above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deregulation plan, passed in 1996 with the expectation
that it would be phased in over many years, utilities had to sell
off their power generating plants and then purchase electricity
through a state-controlled exchange. San Diego was opened before
other cities because of a merger of its various utilities to form
Sempra Energy.
</P>
<P>
   But many critics have complained that the market was opened
before there was a sufficient supply of electricity available,
skewing prices upward. The strong economy and the added burden of
people turning on their air conditioners during summer added to
demand, and correspondingly, the jump in wholesale power rates,
which in turn have been passed along to retail consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the state, from Gov. Gray Davis to the chairman
of Sempra Energy, have accused some of the wholesalers of price
gouging, and the government has written President Clinton urging
him to initiate a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence, Mr. President,'' the Davis wrote in
his letter dated Aug. 10. ``San Diego consumers have paid an
enormous price for deregulation in a market that no one believes is
functionally competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Golding, San Diego's mayor, said in an interview that she
supported deregulation, but that the timing had been so badly
planned that some sort of market intervention by government was
necessary to spare the city's economy major problems in what had
been its best economic expansion after suffering through a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, it takes a very long time to go from a bad
economic climate to a good one, but almost no time to go the other
way, and that's what I'm afraid could happen here,'' said Golding.
``I don't think this bill is the right long-term solution, but I
chose to support it because it is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the California Public Utility Commission narrowly
approved a measure that would cap power costs in the city, but only
for small businesses and residents who used 500 kilowatt-hours of
electricity per month or less. That left many people unsatisfied,
particularly since a variety of users, from public schools to high
technology companies that have boosted San Diego's economy in the
last decade, would see no improvement in their power bills.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the State Assembly to resume its debate of the new
bill, which is sponsored by two San Diego area legislators, state
Sen. Dede Alpert, and Assembly member Susan Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would rollback prices to their levels in June, before
rates began to skyrocket, order the state utility commission to
place a firm cap on rates at that level, and create a mechanism for
passing along excess profits to consumers. The bill would also
require an investigation of the increase in rates.

WINNING IS RELATIVE FOR MERCKER NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From strictly a numbers standpoint, Kent Mercker's
pitching line for the Angels Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night wasn't bad. He gave up
nine hits and four earned runs in six innings. He was credited with
the win in Anaheim's 11-4 drubbing of the Red Sox, for whom Mercker
pitched last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, raw statistics, without explanation, mean nothing in
the case of Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   His triumph on the field was his first since last Sept. 29 at
Chicago, when he clinched the wild card for the Red Sox. But the
real victory for Mercker has to do with off-field things that most
people take for granted _ such as waking up every day. He truly is
grateful to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who signed as a free agent with the Angels before the
season, suffered a cerebral hemorrhage May 11 and collapsed on the
mound. He said it was a terrifying experience, compounded by the
fact that doctors still don't know the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought when that happened was, `Am I going to live?
Am I going to see my kids again and be able to watch them grow up?'
'' said the 32-year-old Mercker, who has two daughters. ``That was
answered yes, and that was fine for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the worst that came through this whole situation was I
could never play baseball again, great. I still had a long enough
career and got to have fun and life goes on. To be able to do that
and play baseball again, every time I take the field now, I look at
it that, `This could be your last time doing it, so have fun doing
it, so go as hard as you can.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I don't want to lose. But when you're facing Nomar
(Garciaparra) you don't put so much pressure (on). I'm at inner
peace with myself to say, `You know what? Just make the best pitch
you can make right here, it doesn't have to be perfect, just make a
good pitch and see what happens.' I used to be a little more keyed
up but I'm able to relax a little bit more and I think in the long
run, that's going to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night, he made his third _ and longest _ start of the
year, throwing 91 pitches, 50 for strikes. The Angels jumped ahead,
4-0, after two innings but the Red Sox tied it in the fourth. In
the top of the fifth, the Angels staked Mercker to a 10-4 lead and
in the bottom, he responded with a one-two-three inning to give
Anaheim momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled,'' he said. ``I'm just glad we won. Tonight was
erratic. Coming back here and pitching here for the first time, I
was a little excited. I really didn't have much of a clue out
there. It was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being up, 4-0, I wanted to hold that lead but gave those up.
From my experience, that's what deflates a team, when you put up
four and they get four right back. I was mad at myself for that.
Then, when we got the six, I said, `Whatever I had to do right
there to get three outs in a row, I had to do it.' We had a six-run
lead, just go out and throw strikes, I was able to do that the last
two innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker said he no longer has any health concerns. When he first
came back, he was watched very closely by medical personnel. They
monitored his blood pressure after any activity to make sure it
wasn't elevated. Everything was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was basically the equivalent of being struck by
lightning,'' he said. ``Why that happens, you don't know, and why
this happened to me, nobody knows. But I'm assured that from all
the tests I did, there's no underlying problem that someone missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fortunate and blessed every night I get to pitch a
game. Three months ago, I didn't know if I was going to live, let
alone pitch again.''
</P>
<P>
   After his ordeal, a simple headache would cause him to worry
that something was wrong. Now, he says, he knows there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the peace of mind to know that when I get a headache or
if I don't feel right, there's nothing wrong,'' he said. ``The
first couple of weeks, if I got one, I kind of sat down and braced
myself a little bit because I definitely don't want to experience
that again. But I was assured by the doctors that I was going to
get headaches like I did before, and I'm going to get lightheaded,
but don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `I've got a thousand pictures here you can take
home and every time you get a headache look at them, you're fine.'
Really, I'm better off than anyone else because no one else has had
those tests. I feel fortunate.''

COWBOYS ROOKIE DEFENSIVE BACK EMERGES WITH CONFIDENCE INTACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Rookie Kareem Larrimore emerged from his weekend
trip to the Denver burn center (read: Mile High Stadium) still
holding the job of starting left cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   He started, he played, he got toasted.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-round pick from West Texas A&AMP;M was beaten deep,
stuffed on the run, and inexplicably lost his technique _ but not
his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to worry about my confidence. This was my one
learning experience ... (and) I learned,'' Larrimore said of the
job he inherited from Kevin Smith while sitting in front of the
Valley Ranch locker he inherited from Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore became a force-fed starter when Smith left the team
two weeks ago to contemplate retirement. And injuries that will
keep fellow rookie cornerbacks Mario Edwards and Dwayne Goodrich
out of the final preseason game against the St. Louis Rams haven't
hurt Larrimore's chances of keeping the job, either.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, more than ever, is under the microscope. But he is a
raw talent who has responded slowly in each of his two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've got to get him ready to go earlier in the game,''
said Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer, who saw a
rejuvenated Larrimore in the second half Saturday night against the
Broncos after benching the rookie for the final two minutes of the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is looking harder at Larrimore, or wants him to succeed
more, than owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larrimore has inordinate physical skills. I think he had the
third fastest time (4.34-second 40) at the NFL combine,'' Jones
said. ``But a player also has to have instincts to play this game
... and not necessarily will more repetitions make someone a better
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Kareem Larrimore has instincts (to play NFL
cornerback), but we don't know at this time. He has to show
somebody, and show himself, that he's got the instincts to play the
game at this speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore refuses to use his West Texas A&AMP;M roots as an excuse.
He said he has experienced firsthand the speed gap between Division
II college football _ and junior college before that _ and the NFL
by having to cover Joey Galloway in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can't be any faster than Galloway,'' Larrimore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I was at a Division II school in the first
place was because of my home situation,'' he added, referring to
his family's request that he leave the mean streets of Los Angeles
by any means possible. ``I'm not using Division II as an excuse,
either. I'm here now.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened against Denver?
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore played the first half in a Mile High fog. He was worn
out by Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith, who have 16 NFL seasons between
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't focused at first,'' Larrimore said. ``Coach Zim
pulled me. He didn't have to say anything. I knew just by looking
at him, he wanted me to get my head in the game. I did get the
chance to go back in, and I played like I should after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Ryan McNeil, who has become an instant starter for the
Cowboys at right cornerback _ Sanders' old spot _ can empathize
with Larrimore and what he calls ``growing pains.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, McNeil was Detroit's top draft pick (second round)
among a trio of rookie cornerbacks, including Greg Jeffries and
Kevin Minniefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a similar situation. But the disadvantage I had, I
held out and didn't report until a week before our first game,''
said McNeil, who started two games as rookie but did not become a
full-time starter until his second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kareem is going to be fine as long as he sticks with what the
coaches and veteran players tell him. It's more technical than
anything else. Physically, he's real quick for as big (5-foot-11,
190) as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   In 11 days, the Cowboys begin playing for keeps. Donovan McNabb
and the Philadelphia Eagles are expected to bring a game plan into
Texas Stadium with Larrimore's name written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get a lot of balls thrown at him because he's a
rookie,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   At least Larrimore doesn't have to wonder if he will get a
chance to make amends.

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Officially placing cornerback Kevin Smith on the
reserve/retired list topped a flurry of moves by the Dallas Cowboys
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The others included the trading of receiver Jeff Ogden to Miami
for a seventh-round pick in 2002 and the waiving of running back
Michael Black.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys roster stands at 71, but it should dwindle by one in
the next couple of days. Only injury concerns are delaying the
release of quarterback Paul Justin, who is bothered by a elbow
contusion.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the move could happen before
Thursday's preseason finale with the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has not made an official retirement announcement. His
agent, Steve Zucker, said the nine-year veteran will take his time
before making a decision. Smith has a congenital degenerative disk
in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jones said Smith agreed to being placed on the retired
list to help out the Cowboys. The maneuver frees up about $750,000
in salary cap space, in addition to clearing a roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it was just another example of how good the embattled
Smith has been to the Cowboys throughout his career, including
restructuring or reducing his salary in each of the past five years
to help with the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also reiterated that he wants Smith to join the Cowboys as
a coach or consultant this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the decisions with Ogden and Black came down to
numbers. The Cowboys liked both players, but neither was going to
make the team's final roster because of better players at their
respective positions.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden's departure likely means that Joey Galloway, Raghib
Ismail, Jason Tucker, Wane McGarity and James McKnight are locks
for the roster with Chris Brazzell and Damon Hodge on the bubble
for the final spot or two.
</P>
<P>
   Black was the odd man out for the third running back spot behind
Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren. Michael Wiley, who pocketed a
$100,000 bonus as the team's fifth-round draft pick, is the
front-runner in the battle with rookie free-agent Troy Hambrick,
who is a likely practice squad candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker with Ogden, who has been sidelined since the
beginning of training camp with a variety of leg injuries, is that
the Cowboys were able to get something instead of letting him go
for free.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was in need of receiver because of a season-ending hip
fracture to Lamar Thomas. The Dolphins wanted Ogden because of his
familiarity with their offense. Chan Gailey, the Cowboys' coach the
past two seasons, is Miami's offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Ogden said. ``It's a system I'm familiar with.
It's a coach I know. And he knows me.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Linebacker Barron Wortham (sprained knee) practiced Tuesday
for the first time in three weeks and could play against the Rams.
It will likely be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tight end David LaFleur (strained groin) also practiced
Tuesday as the Cowboys are trying to gauge if he can play Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Receiver Jason Tucker, running back Emmitt Smith and
cornerbacks Charlie Williams, Mario Edwards and Dwayne Goodrich
will not play Thursday.

HAYES COULD GET SPOT IN COWBOYS' RING OF HONOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday
that Bob Hayes tops the list of a number former players he's
considering for induction into the team's Ring of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   There's no questioning Hayes' on-the-field credentials. The
former Olympic champion sprinter forced teams to invent the zone
defense to combat his speed. And he still owns 21 team records.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's also no discounting Hayes' off-the-field
issues. Hayes, who played with the Cowboys from 1965-1972, served
10 months in prison for a drug conviction. He also was admitted to
substance-abuse centers on three different occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who said no decisions on a 2000 Ring of Honor induction
have been made, backed of his consideration of Hayes by saying that
he is the player most mentioned by the fans as a deserving
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, wants it clear that he hasn't gone soft on image
issues and is sensitive to the problem regarding Hayes' possible
induction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really get it when it comes to perception, role model and
off-the-field issues,'' Jones said. ``If it wasn't for those
issues, he'd already be there. I'm grappling with the same things
the Hall of Fame thought about (when considering Lawrence Taylor).
Should the point of emphasis be on the field? You start taking on a
lot when you start looking at judgment after careers. You start
covering areas that society in general hasn't found answers to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it's easy to keep Hayes out but he is trying to
evaluate how he can get a deserving candidate like Hayes in. nn

FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER INDICTED FOR RAPE PLEADS NOT GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
  By AL BAKER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTROSE, N.Y. _ Months ago, when a special-education teacher
here said she had unfairly been forced to resign in the face of
salacious rumors that she had had sex with teen-age boys from her
school, many in this bucolic river town in northern Westchester
County rallied to her side.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors became headlines on Monday, when Marci Stein, 28, was
indicted on charges of statutory rape, sodomy and sexual abuse of
three male students, ages 14 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   But as the weight of the allegations sank in around town on
Tuesday, many people said they still supported Stein, a member of a
family with deep roots in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe it's true,'' said Harry DiPietro, the
owner of Da-Ro's Corner Store. ``You and I know that with
indictments you only hear one side. I would hope that when it all
comes out she'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who was released without bail, stood silently on Tuesday
in the driveway of her ranch house in the village of Buchanan, her
eyes covered by dark sunglasses, as her husband, Adam, told a
reporter the accusations were false.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't be a bigger lie,'' said Stein, a federal marshal
and a veteran of the Persian Gulf War, waving his arms for
emphasis. ``Everyone supports us _ except for the school board and
the kids and the parents and, of course, the district attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam and Marci Stein and their parents graduated from Hendrick
Hudson High School. Their grandparents were on the school board, he
said. Her father is a well-known local electrician. His father is
the building inspector in Tarrytown, a few miles south on the
Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Stein seemed a touchy subject to many here.
Some people expressed shock; some refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred J. Donahue, the mayor of the Village of Buchanan, did not
return calls seeking comment. An aide to Linda D. Puglisi, the
supervisor of the Town of Cortlandt, which encompasses the hamlet
of Montrose, said that on the advice of the town's lawyer, she and
the Town Council would not comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But those who did comment included Jeanine Pirro, the
Westchester County district attorney, who said Stein had taken
three male students to her home for individual tutoring sessions
and wound up raping and sodomizing them in incidents between April
1999 and last January.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were interviewed by the authorities after a teacher
overheard talk in school about the sexual allegations and alerted
school officials, who conducted an investigation and called the
state police.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Stein fondled the boys as they sat
at their desks in school and at subsequent encounters in her home
after school had sexual intercourse with one of them and committed
sodomy with two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this case is pointedly all about a betrayal of
trust,'' Pirro said Tuesday, a day after Stein pleaded not guilty
in Westchester County Court to charges in a 17-count indictment.
``We send our children to school for them to be educated and never
do we expect this kind of thing to happen, nor do we anticipate it
nor do we imagine it.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Stein resigned and filed a federal civil rights
lawsuit against the district, accusing officials of spreading false
rumors about her and threatening to fire her after she had two
years on the job. Her supporters held a candlelight vigil in front
of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lovett, Stein's lawyer in the civil rights lawsuit,
said Tuesday that Stein would be acquitted at trial and vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is a beautiful example of character assassination
from the school district up to the district attorney,'' he said.
``It is a lot of grandstanding to ruin the reputation and career of
a young woman. And they are going to pay.'' John Mancuso, who is
acting as Stein's lawyer in the criminal matter, did not return
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   School officials refused to comment, citing the pending lawsuit
against the district. But Joan Thompson, the Hendrick Hudson School
District superintendent, released a statement defending the
district's investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct by
Stein. It said the decision to remove her from her job was
``necessary for the protection of the student body.''

MERCKER A WINNER FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It had been nearly a year since Kent Mercker last won a
major- league game, but to him it was a lifetime ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the 11 months that have passed seem so distant,
but rather what he experienced between then and now. Specifically,
the brain hemorrhage that threatened his life on May 11 when
pitching in Anaheim for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker didn't pitch particularly well in the Anaheim Angels'
11-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox Tuesday night at Fenway Park.
But the fact that he was pitching at all and competing is the
recurring theme.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if getting that first win since the hemorrhage was
significant, Mercker said, ``No. What's significant for me was to
pitch, period. If I get no-decisions every game for the rest of my
life and our team wins, that's what matters.'
</P>
<P>
   In his third start since returning to the mound, Mercker gave up
four runs and nine hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see Merck on the mound and see him compete really
gives us a lift,''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia said, ``We've seen what he's been
through. I saw him the day after he had a hemorrhage in his brain.
From not knowing if he'd ever pitch in a major-league game again to
winning a game, that's about as full-circle as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll always have injuries that threaten a guy's season or
career, but this puts a different perspective on what the game's
all about. It's a great thing to witness.'
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia was also happy to witness the Angels bounce back from
Monday's disappointing loss. The Angels are awaiting word on the
protest they filed, but the players showed they have put that game
out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got 14 hits, including four from Orlando Palmeiro and
three each from Troy Glaus and Garret Anderson. They also played
sound defense and made one play in particular that changed the
momentum of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had rallied from a 4-0 deficit to make it 4-3 in the
fourth inning. They had two runners on with two out when Troy
O'Leary hit one into the left-center-field gap. Lou Merloni scored
from second to tie the game and Nomar Garciaparra tried to score
from first.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels' relay - center fielder Anderson to shortstop
Kevin Stocker to catcher Bengie Molina - nailed Garciaparra at the
plate to keep the game tied at 4. The Angels then scored six runs
in the top of the fifth to go up, 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we played a real strong game,'' Scioscia said.
``That was a key play when O'Leary hit the ball in gap, but we made
a perfect relay. That's a big play we kept the score tied and it
gives us a chance to get back on top in the next inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the first for the Angels at Fenway Park since
ex-Red Sox Mo Vaughn joined the team. The Angels went 0-6 last
season here and lost Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win moved the Angels to within 2 games of wild-card leader
Cleveland. They remained 5 games behind American League
West-leading Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the Angels' second win in three games without Darin
Erstad, who is out with a muscle strain in his left ribcage. And
Tuesday's game was significant because Palmeiro - playing in
Erstad's spot in left field and hitting leadoff in the batting
order - had a big game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the four hits, he also drove in three and made a diving
catch in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlando's our little secret weapon,'' Scioscia said. ``The
guys were joking with Ersty, calling him Wally Pipp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great we can fill holes when guys are hurt,''
Palmeiro said. ``That's what championship teams do when players get
hurt. We don't miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels improved to 4-4 with one to play on what was expected
to be a critical East Coast trip.

RIDEAUX EXPECTS TO BE EXTREMELY BUSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ Darrell Rideaux is officially listed as a
!ital!co!off!- starter at cornerback. However, he will be
!ital!the!off! starter when USC plays Penn State on Sunday, and he
already knows what to expect when the Nittany Lions see the
diminutive 5-foot-8 sophomore in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they see me, it will be audible (at) Rideaux,'' he said.
``I expect a lot of balls coming my way early. The first couple
days of hell week, our offense did that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting for an offense to test Rideaux. The other
cornerback, Kris Richard, is 6 feet, so it makes sense for a
quarterback to go at the shorter player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that this year I've been through the fire,''
Rideaux said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be his third straight start after filling in the final
two games of the 1999 season for the injured Antuan Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux fended off a challenge from Chris Cash, considered one
of the top junior college cornerbacks in the country last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, USC recruits the best in the country,'' Rideaux
said. ``I was considered to compete for a starting job. We don't
care about that. Obviously, Chris has strengths and I have
strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than expected: Senior offensive lineman Trevor Roberts
will miss the Kickoff Classic with a strained foot, and there is
now some concern he might not be ready for the Sept. 9 game against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back,'' Roberts said. ``They can't keep me out that
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Lenny Vandermade will start in place of
Roberts at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   Knight leaves: Linebacker Darryl Knight, the younger brother of
former USC players Ryan and Sammy Knight, has quit the team
``because of personal issues and is a little unsure'' whether he
will play football again, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has fallen off the depth chart and watched his role
decrease since last spring to the point where he played on the
scout team.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen on road: Hackett said he will take eight true freshmen
to the Kickoff Classic, although it is a ``one-game decision,'' and
some players could redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends Gregg Guenther of Taft High and Alex Holmes of
Harvard- Westlake, quarterback Matt Cassel of Chatsworth, wide
receiver Keary Colbert, offensive lineman Joe McGuire, tailback
Chris Howard, strong safety Matt Grootegoed and defensive tackle
Kenechi Udeze made the travel squad.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther, who missed most of last week with a sore back, has
practiced this week and is available to play.
</P>
<P>
   Don't drink the water: The Trojans ordered plenty of bottled
water for the game to prevent a problem they encountered in the
1996 Kickoff Classic: About 20 players came down with flu after
drinking contaminated tap water at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey switch: USC will wear its home cardinal jerseys against
Penn State even though the Trojans are the visiting team. Penn
State has opted for its white jerseys because of the heat. The
current forecast for East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday is partly
cloudy with a high of 82 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Game captains: Linebacker Zeke Moreno, defensive tackle Ennis
Davis, tailback Petros Papadakis and center Eric Denmon have been
named game captains. Simmons, who is redshirting after having a
stomach tumor removed, is a ``special captain,'' according to
Hackett.

ZDENEK FINALLY GETS HIS CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jason Zdenek doesn't have much to show for his
first four years with the UCLA football team, except maybe a few
bumps and bruises acquired during his time with the scout team in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   All that is about to change, as Zdenek, a fifth-year senior who
has appeared in just two games during his college career, is on the
verge of securing a starting position as the Bruins' free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything I've been preparing for,'' said Zdenek, a
graduate of Chaminade High in West Hills who played with the
first-team defense in Tuesday's brief scrimmage. ``Year after year,
all the meetings, lifting weights and conditioning, and now I'm
getting the chance to actually show it on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   To this point, the list of Zdenek's on-field accomplishments is
brief. He was on the field for 17 snaps during the second half of
the Bruins' blowout of Boise State last year, and participated n
kickoff coverage for one game in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's not much glory, especially with all the hours Zdenek
spent toiling away as scout-team fodder for the Bruins' offense.
It's also not much experience, considering the importance of the
free safety position to the Bruins in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the past three seasons, the free safety has led or
tied for the team lack in total tackles, including Joey Strycula
(69 tackles in 1999), Larry Atkins (94 in 1998) and Shaun Williams
(68 in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Zdenek's dedication to the Bruins' off-season conditioning
program, as well as his strong play over the past two weeks, have
helped to calm the nerves of coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at most teams, usually the weak inside linebacker
and the safety are the leading tacklers, for whatever reason,''
Toledo said. ``They are the last line of defense, so you want a guy
back there who's not going to miss a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason has made great strides. He's got a lot more confidence
(and) he's got a great understanding of what we're trying to do.
He's got great character and he's the kind of guy you want in your
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Payback time: Toledo, upset with poor blocking during a
scrimmage Tuesday, decided to teach his offensive linemen a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo stopped play, handed the ball to one of his linemen and
instructed him to hold it up, like a quarterback preparing to throw
a pass. Then, Toledo told a defensive lineman to ``sack'' the big
man. The defensive linemen didn't hold back, and every offensive
lineman had to receive one crushing tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to show the offensive linemen what it's like to
play quarterback,'' said Toledo, who added that it was the first
time he tried the drill at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I wanted them to know that it's no fun to be holding
the ball back there and getting hit in the side of the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvement: Right guard Oscar Cabrera, recovering from a high
ankle sprain, worked out with a trainer during Tuesday's practice
and hopes to begin light practice with his teammates by the end of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera, who participated in agility drills for the second
consecutive day, said he felt no pain and estimated that he is
``about 80 to 85 percent'' healthy. His status for next week's
season opener against Alabama in still in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last go around, my senior year,'' Cabrera said,
``and I was hoping it would be injury free, but that's the way it
goes sometimes.''

ANGELS BELIEVE THEY CAN WIN THEIR APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Anaheim Angels filed their protest of Monday
night's game with the Major League office Tuesday and said they
believe there's a chance it will be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels protested the game because of a call at third base
Monday when no umpire was in the vicinity of the play. Second-base
umpire Derryl Cousins finally called Tim Salmon out at third. The
Angels' protest is based on the contention that if Cousins was out
of position to get a good look at the play, he should have asked
for help from the other umpires. But Cousins refused.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could not cite a specific rule, but combined
different rules in the rule book to support their case. Cousins
said Tuesday he was the umpire out of position, that he should have
been covering third base when third-base ump Jerry Meals wandered
into the outfield to see if a Bengie Molina's popup had been
caught. Cousins also admitted that after watching replays, he
missed the call at third, but said the Angels have no grounds for
an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a protestable issue,'' Cousins said. ``They're
spinning their wheels. ... There's human error in everything. If we
err on safe-out, or ball-strike, there's no recourse. It's part of
the game, just like a guy making an error. I can't imagine this
type of magnitude with 1 months left in the season, but everybody's
playing like it's the seventh game of the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't at least ask for help, Cousins said: ``We're
more interested in getting the play right than looking like fools.
But you can't change every play. You can't make every call by
committee. Neither one of them (first- or third-base umps) said
they could tell me anything. ... There was nobody that had anything
to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia was not satisfied with Cousins'
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're telling me a big play like that is not worth asking for
help?''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia asked. ``How many times does a play like that happen?
If you feel in your heart you did not see the play well enough to
make an accurate call, you have a responsibility to ask for input
to make a better call.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman asked the league office to
expedite the matter because the Angels and Red Sox are not
scheduled to meet again this season after today. The Angels have
Thursday off, but the Red Sox are scheduled to play in Kansas City.
Paul Beeston, Major League Baseball's chief operating officer, will
make the final decision on the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Pine-tar hopes: The last time an appeal was upheld was in 1983,
which became known as the ``pine tar'' incident with the Royals'
George Brett. Brett had a home run taken away because the umps
ruled the pine tar was too high up on his bat. But the protest was
upheld and the game was replayed from the moment of the home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals starting pitcher that day was current Angels pitching
coach Bud Black.
</P>
<P>
   Karl signed The Angels signed pitcher Scott Karl on Tuesday and
assigned him to Single-A Lake Elsinore, where he'll start
Thursday's game. That would put him on schedule to start Aug. 29,
the next time the Angels need a fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, 29, began the season in the Rockies' starting rotation,
but was designated for assignment Aug. 15. He was 2-3 with a 7.68
ERA for Colorado in 17 appearances, including nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Finley honored: Ex-Angels pitcher Chuck Finley will be honored
before Friday's game at Edison Field for being named to the club's
all-time team. Finley, the organization's all-time winningest
pitcher, will pitch for the Indians against the Angels on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad stays out: Darin Erstad missed his third consecutive game
with a muscle strain his his left ribcage, putting a dent in his
quest to challenge the all-time hits record of 257.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, whom Scioscia said has an ``outside chance'' of playing
today, leads the majors with 189 hits and is on pace for 243.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher close: Pitcher Tim Belcher threw a simulated game
Tuesday and was impressive, according to Scioscia. Belcher threw
about 60 pitches in three innings and is close to going out on a
rehab assignment.

2 MISSING AFTER SWIM IN HUDSON
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two mentally ill teen-age boys from a state
psychiatric center in Brooklyn were missing in the swirling waters
of the Hudson River near Ossining, N.Y., Tuesday night after they
went swimming in a prohibited section of the river during a camping
trip, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Two counselors on the trip, from the Brooklyn Children's
Psychiatric Center, were watching when the boys, ages 15 and 17,
went into the water at Croton Point Park, said Sgt. Donald McArthur
of the Westchester County police.
</P>
<P>
   One counselor nearly drowned trying to rescue the boys, McArthur
said, and was being held for observation at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The counselors had been told by a park employee earlier in the
day that swimming was forbidden at the spot, but it was not clear
whether the counselors allowed the boys to swim or if the boys
disobeyed them, the sergeant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard suspended the search for the teen-agers around
8:30 p.m., after five fruitless hours, said Susan Tolchin, a
spokeswoman for the Westchester County executive's office.
</P>
<P>
   The search was to resume Wednesday morning, though the police
said they doubted that the boys had survived.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, whose names were not released, live in a state-run
residence on the grounds of the psychiatric center, in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, the authorities said. They were part of a group
of six patients and four counselors who went on an overnight trip
to stay in bungalows at the park, a 508-acre county preserve on the
east side of the Hudson about 35 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The campers were apparently looking for a place to swim, but
even the official park beach is now closed on weekdays because of a
shortage of lifeguards, McArthur said. ``I believe someone from the
group questioned whether swimming was available,'' he said. ``The
parks people we spoke to said that this particular group had been
instructed that they could not swim just prior to the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 3 p.m., McArthur said, all six of the patients and two
counselors hiked down a steep hill and across a field of boulders
to Teller's Point, a desolate area where the Croton and Hudson
Rivers meet and riptides and crosscurrents twist through the water.
``No Swimming'' signs are prominently posted at the point, Tolchin
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what led up to the boys' decision to jump into
the river, but they soon began struggling in the current, McArthur
said. A counselor, Lenox Gabriel, 47, went into the water to try to
rescue them, but he started going under, McArthur said.
</P>
<P>
   Two county police officers responding to a 911 call dived into
the water and pulled Gabriel out, but the boys had disappeared, the
sergeant said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel was in stable condition Tuesday night at Phelps Memorial
Hospital in Sleepy Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   All afternoon and into the evening, by air, by water and by
land, teams searched the area from the Tappan Zee Bridge, five
miles south of the park, to Peekskill, five miles to the north. The
tide was coming in when the boys went into the water but it had
turned by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   New York City police divers searched the river while a city
police helicopter circled overhead. Dozens of local, county and
state police officers and firefighters scanned the banks, and the
Coast Guard searched in its boat, Tolchin said. As hope and
sunlight began to dim and members of the boys' families began to
arrive, crisis counselors were called to the park, said Roger
Klingman, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health, which
runs the psychiatric center.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur said he doubted the boys would be found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to be optimistic,'' he said, ``but if they haven't
gotten ashore the chances are pretty slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn Children's Psychiatric Center, a cluster of nondescript
institutional buildings on Bergen Street near Ralph Avenue in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, serves young people with serious emotional
disturbances.

SURGERY CAN'T STOP JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson had
surgery at 8 a.m., was in recovery in the afternoon and arrived at
Dodger Stadium a few hours before first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   You know, just another Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough son of a gun,'' Dodgers team physician Dr. Frank
Jobe said. ``I had the same operation six weeks ago and I couldn't
manage a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had arthroscopic surgery on his left rotator cuff to
repair his labrum, remove a bone spur and repair his clavicle, Jobe
said. The recovery time is three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the thought of taking some time off to recover
crossed Johnson's mind, he was given clearance by the Dodgers'
medical personnel to return to the bench Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that's over,'' Johnson said. ``It's something I
needed to have done because it was getting worse and worse. I'm
glad it's over. The last three weeks it's been kind of painful. If
(bench coach) Jim Tracy can go in and have his knee scoped and show
up at work, I could go in and do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did take pain medication before arriving at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cora gets call: For the first time this season, Alex Cora
started at shortstop when the opposition started a left-hander.
Cora, in a platoon with Kevin Elster, did make two starts at second
base in place of the ailing Mark Grudzielanek in July.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried to protect the 24-year-old Cora in his first
full-blown stint in the big leagues, and Cora's done well in his
limited exposure to left-handed pitchers. He's batting .266 .333 (8
for 24) against left-handers and .258 (54 for 209) against
right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Perez to start: Lefty Carlos Perez is back in the starting mix.
Well, at least for a day. With the Dodgers facing a doubleheader
Friday in Chicago and games stacked up for the next week
thereafter, the Dodgers are turning to the enigmatic Perez to start
the second game of the twin bill.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is 4-6 with a 5.36 ERA but was yanked from the starting
rotation after giving up five runs in four innings Aug. 1 in
Pittsburgh. Afterward, Perez and Johnson got in a shouting match.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez has found a niche in relief. He's allowed four runs in
22 innings, and was hoping to parlay that, along with a strong
start in Chicago, into a possible return to the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make that decision, I'll be happy,'' Perez said.
``It's kind of tough (in the bullpen). Sometimes I have to wait at
least five, six days to pitch in a game. I'd like the opportunity
to pitch two, three times a week, but I don't have that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Left fielder Gary Sheffield's run at Duke
Snider's franchise home run mark was put on hold. Sheffield was a
late scratch with flu-like symptoms and replaced by Jim Leyritz,
who made his first start in left field. It was Leyritz's fourth
start since joining the Dodgers in mid-June. ... Grudzielanek is in
a 2-for-22 stretch, so he was rested and F.P. Santangelo started at
second base. ... After throwing out three would-be base stealers
Monday, Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley nailed Fernando Seguignol
trying to steal second in the second inning. ... The Dodgers will
announce the signing of No. 1 pick Ben Diggins (17th overall)
today. Diggins, who will receive a $2.2 million signing bonus if he
passes his physical in the morning, is expected to report to the
instructional league in a few weeks.

DODGERS HIT SIX HOMERS IN ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It was a freaky, crazy night that could be capped
only by the most unexpected of all things, an offensive explosion
leading to a Los Angeles Dodgers win.
</P>
<P>
   MVP candidate Gary Sheffield sat out with flu-like symptoms and
it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros had two homers and drove in four runs - in one
inning - and switch-hitting Todd Hundley dropped the right-handed
portion of his arsenal and had three hits, including a three-run
homer against a lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Davey Johnson had shoulder surgery in the morning and
managed at night.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Dodgers hit a season-high six home runs and
routed the Montreal Expos 14-6 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium in a game
that was about as illogical as can be conceived. It was so strange
the Dodgers even made it possible to forget just how awful the past
three weeks have been.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Karros and Hundley star, but the Dodgers had two
runners thrown out at home plate in one inning, saw starter Ismael
Valdes hit his first career homer but not hold a three-run lead
after five innings and watched Hundley throw out his fourth
would-be base stealer in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   It made for a jovial clubhouse and brought a smile from Johnson,
whose day began with morning surgery to repair a damaged left
rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to cut on the right one tomorrow,'' Johnson said.
``Then I got a couple legs left. Whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a baffling night leading up to the Dodgers' nine-run
sixth inning, capped by their most productive inning since scoring
nine runs in an inning April 24, 1998, against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Karros homered to break a 5-5 tie to lead off the sixth against
reliever Julio Santana. It was the 500th extra-base hit of Karros'
career. Willie Davis and Steve Garvey are the only other two Los
Angeles Dodgers to reach that mark.
</P>
<P>
   Then Karros hit a three-run homer to finish the inning, making
him the first Dodger to hit two homers in an inning. It's been
accomplished 21 times in the National League, the last coming when
St. Louis' Fernando Tatis hit two grand slams off Dodgers
right-hander Chan Ho Park last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice one was the one that broke the tie, leading off the
inning,'' said Karros, who reached 30 homers for the fifth time in
his career. ``The (second) at-bat, I was trying to hit a fly ball.
I was surprised (no other Dodger did it). You think somebody would
do it in the `50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz followed Karros' first homer with a walk and Adrian
Beltre singled. Santana was replaced by lefty Scott Forster, and
Hundley smashed a three-run homer, his 22nd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Hundley stopped batting right-handed during an
August series in Montreal last season because of frustration. He
worked during the offseason and was off to a strong start this
season, but he slumped lately. Hundley, who was batting .216 (11
for 51) with three homers, 10 RBI and 17 strikeouts right-handed,
is batting .344 left-handed. Hundley said he made the decision to
stop switch-hitting after talking with his dad, former big-league
catcher Randy Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Monday) night I decided to bag it,'' Hundley said. ``It comes
to a point, where as a team, you have to get it done. Left-handed,
I know at least I can put it in play with runners on base. I just
don't feel confident right-handed. There's no reason to do it. I
feel so confident left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is getting the job done. If I can drive the
ball like that, I might as well stay with it. I hit two balls hard
up the middle and a homer.''
</P>
<P>
   A late replacement for the ailing Sheffield, who was scratched
from the lineup an hour before game time, Leyritz did his best
impersonation of the MVP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz homered in his first at-bat, something Sheffield's done
40 times, and had an RBI single in the fourth. He also made a
diving catch along the left field line in the fifth, and slammed
into the wall after catching Fernando Seguignol's bases-loaded
liner in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in six years I've been out there,''
Leyritz said. ``It was fun. I hadn't been out there in a while, but
I've been taking fly balls and working.''

MARINERS STOP THEIR EIGHT-GAME SKID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ You want easy? Go solve Rubik's cube.
</P>
<P>
   You want hard? Be the Mariners trying to end an eight-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   After scratching, clawing and sweating to build up a five-run
lead entering the ninth inning, the Mariners almost saw it all slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going like this, it's never easy to break out of
it,'' left fielder Rickey Henderson said. ``They always make it
hard on you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Henderson who supplied the final piece to the puzzle of
the slumping Mariners, running down Dean Palmer's bases-loaded bid
for a grand slam 410 feet from home plate as Seattle survived a
near-firestorm in the ninth inning to score an 8-4 victory over
Detroit Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners rode into the ninth feeling pretty good about
themselves for a team that had lost eight in a row. They'd finally
gotten a break when Mike Cameron's two-out line drive in the eighth
landed on the left-field chalk line for a two-run double that broke
a 3-3 tie. And they'd finally gotten a breakout hit when Alex
Rodriguez crushed a three-run homer in the top of the ninth for an
8-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to center field to start the bottom of the ninth,
Cameron said to Henderson that Rodriguez had put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You can't say that,' '' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   And, sure enough, with one out and two on, the eight-game
octopus snared the Mariners in its tentacles one more time.
Rodriguez had a possible game-ending double play ball hit to him,
but the ball kicked away from him for an error.
</P>
<P>
   That brought home a run and led to the exit of reliever Jose
Paniagua. Closer Kazuhiro Sasaki walked the first batter he faced,
Bobby Higginson, and the Tigers, who had won seven of eight, had
the potential winning run at the plate in Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron looked at Henderson and said, ``I never should have said
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki fell behind former AL MVP Gonzalez 2-1, but after a visit
from pitching coach Bryan Price, came back to strike out Gonzalez
on a nasty forkball. Up stepped Palmer, who got behind 0-2, then
jumped on a low forkball. The ball screamed into the gap in
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron never had a chance at the ball. But Henderson said he
wasn't letting this game get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to climb the wall if I had to, to catch this
one,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need to, but just barely. The Comerica left-field wall
juts straight out from near the left-field line, angling deep into
left center, and ``I needed every inch of it,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Higginson said in the ghostly quiet of the Tigers'
clubhouse, ``Comerica got us again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki, who made good on a weekend promise by sprinkling salt on
the three sets of steps that lead from the visitors' dugout to the
field before the game to try and drive the malevolent spirits from
the Mariners' doorstep, greeted reporters after the game in
crystal-clear sign language. He symbolically mopped at his brow,
then tapped his heart a couple of times. It had been that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just was thinking to myself, `Don't go out. Don't go out,'
'' Sasaki said through interpreter Allen Turner. ``The salt
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkling salt is a long-standing superstition among Japanese
baseball players as a way to end a long losing streak. He
sprinkled, and the Mariners finally won. At least for one night,
salt was the spice of life for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it took, be it salt or sweat, the Mariners were willing
to go the distance to get this one in the bag. Eight games is a
long time to go without a win. For a first-place team trying to
hold off challengers in its division, it's about two grains of salt
short of forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win tonight, that took more than the monkey off our
backs,'' Rodriguez said. ``It was like a 500-pound gorilla. Now we
can go back to work, working on a two-game winning streak.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the win, the Mariners received strong starting pitching
from Freddy Garcia, who gave up three runs early, then pitched
scoreless baseball from the fourth until turning the ball over to
the bullpen with two outs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   To win, the Mariners got good two-out hitting from Carlos
Guillen, Mark McLemore, Cameron and Rodriguez. Guillen had an RBI
single in the second, McLemore an RBI double in the fourth. Like
Cameron's two-run double and Rodriguez's three-run homer, those
hits came with two out.
</P>
<P>
   To win, the Mariners got good defense, too. Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense was great tonight, except for me,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, the winning pitcher, started pounding his glove the
moment he saw Juan Encarnacion's grounder in the ninth head
Rodriguez's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying, 'All right. It's over,' '' Paniagua said. But it
wasn't, the ball eluding a frustrated Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough play, but not so tough that I shouldn't have
made it,'' the shortstop said. ``This game will test you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said things had gotten bleak enough that the Mariners
had held a players-only meeting Saturday in Cleveland, the first of
its kind this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got pointed out that there aren't many teams that have lost
seven or eight in a row and have still been in first place,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's lead over Oakland, down to two games in the AL West on
Sunday, is now 31/2 games after the A's lost 14-6 in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   As Price said, ``Now we can exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   Breathing is a good thing.

   (UNDATED) _ A country may transform its government. It can
abolish its former ideology, revamp its economy and remove most of
the physical barriers between itself and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   What Russia cannot do, however, as Moscow's handling of the
Kursk disaster demonstrated, is to change the obsession of its
rulers with keeping up appearances at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Every schoolboy knows about the stage-set villages that Prince
Gregory Potemkin put up to impress Catherine the Great, Emperor
Joseph of Austria and the King of Poland when they visited the
newly conquered territories of southern Russia in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later the Marquis de Custine wrote in the volume
that immortalized his journey to Russia that for those living
there, ``to conceal is useful, to feign is essential. A sincere man
in that country would pass for mad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, deliberate feigning turns into willful
self-deception. Thus officialdom's instinctive reaction to the
tragedy which played itself out in the Barents Sea, obeying that
ancestral impulse to maintain secrecy, and illusion.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, as so frequently in Russian history,
rational government has given way to a familiar brew of
incompetence and wishful thinking, topped off by half-truths and
downright lies.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has always been schizophrenic about Western Europe
and its contemporary patron power, the United States. Tugging it
one way is a superiority complex born of a belief in Russia's
special mission; pulling no less forcefully in the opposite
direction is a sense of inferiority at their country's
indisputable, ultimately unconcealable, economic backwardness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia cannot be understood with the mind alone,'' it has been
claimed in an effort to square this circle.
</P>
<P>
   Many a frustrated foreigner will vouch for the truth of the
observation. Unfortunately, it does not quite explain why it took
so long to enlist the aid of the outside world to try to save the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the delay appears to have had much in common with
another instinct shared by czars, general secretaries and
presidents alike: that the fate of individuals is nothing compared
to the raison d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the interest of the State was not only to avoid
compromising military secrets but also, it would seem, to avoid any
suggestion that the foreigners were better.
</P>
<P>
   So the foot-dragging, the absurdly ponderous first contacts
through NATO in Brussels, before permission _ too late _ for
Britain to send its rescue craft.
</P>
<P>
   This behavior, too, is of a pattern _ from the 30,000 laborers
who died in the bleak and marshy Neva delta so that Peter the Great
could have his new capital, St. Petersburg, ``a city built on
bones,'' to the hundreds more who perished following the order that
the Winter Palace should be rebuilt within two years of the fire of
1837.
</P>
<P>
   As Custine remarked, ``A ruler can be popular in Russia without
attaching great value to the lives of Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   In time of conflict the casualties would be immeasurably
greater. During the First World War, sometimes 25 percent of
recruits were sent to the front without arms, instructed to take
what they could from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   So it was, too, in the even more desperate struggle against
Hitler. The bravery and sacrifice of ordinary Russian soldiers
defies belief. But they were also propelled by the savage
discipline of penal battalions, the gulag and summary executions.
</P>
<P>
   According to archives, no fewer than 422,000 members of the Red
Army would ``atone with their blood for the crimes they committed
before the Motherland'' during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   And now Vladimir Putin, who for almost a week preferred to
remain at a Black Sea holiday resort rather than fly to Moscow or
Northern Fleet headquarters at Severomorsk to take command of the
rescue effort, declining to summon immediate help from abroad to
tackle a tragedy which was gripping the world.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin however may find himself in a trap created by
the very speed of recent history. Russia is caught between two
mindsets: an old one, inherited from Soviet times and most visible
in the military establishment which obeys the old xenophobic raison
d'etat _ and a civil society with an opposition and a functioning
press, ever more resembling the West.
</P>
<P>
   Not very long ago, the foreigner visiting Russia would be
allowed to see only Great Parks of Socialist Achievements and the
Bolshoi Ballet; he would not learn about the squalors of rural
life, unchecked industrial pollution _ and certainly not about the
plight of the most modern submarine in the national fleet, lying
mortally wounded on the seabed 100 miles off Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   And so the great myth of U Nas Luchshe, ``It's better with us,''
would be publicly preserved, and along with it the eternal
trade-off between Russia's rulers and their much oppressed subjects
_ that in return for their sacrifices and hardships, these ordinary
citizens could derive the satisfaction of belonging to a country
respected beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   That bargain has now collapsed.The illusion has been shattered,
and our attitude to Russia now is less fear than condescending
bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian media, meanwhile, were this time providing the first
details of a humiliating national tragedy within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   How different from Chernobyl, just 14 years ago, when only after
a fortnight did Mikhail Gorbachev provide a first proper account to
his own people _ and then one as much a tirade against the Western
press as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But that was how the military initially behaved over the Kursk.
First, the suggestion that the accident was not critical, that all
was in hand; then dark mutterings about a collision with a foreign
vessel; only finally could Russian pride bring itself to concede
that a massive forward explosion might have been to blame.
</P>
<P>
   And now the extraordinary spectacle of Russian newspapers
mocking the official obsession with official fears that ``if even
one Russian sailor is saved from a Russian submarine with foreign
help, this will end in a political catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure of how things have changed is that while Putin has
thus far been faithful to tradition in his handling of the crisis,
his methods could indeed produce a political catastrophe _ for
himself. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ A country may transform its government. It can
abolish its former ideology, revamp its economy and remove most of
the physical barriers between itself and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   What Russia cannot do, however, as Moscow's handling of the
Kursk disaster demonstrated, is to change the obsession of its
rulers with keeping up appearances at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Every schoolboy knows about the stage-set villages that Prince
Gregory Potemkin put up to impress Catherine the Great, Emperor
Joseph of Austria and the King of Poland when they visited the
newly conquered territories of southern Russia in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later the Marquis de Custine wrote in the volume
that immortalized his journey to Russia that for those living
there, ``to conceal is useful, to feign is essential. A sincere man
in that country would pass for mad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, deliberate feigning turns into willful
self-deception. Thus officialdom's instinctive reaction to the
tragedy which played itself out in the Barents Sea, obeying that
ancestral impulse to maintain secrecy, and illusion.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, as so frequently in Russian history,
rational government has given way to a familiar brew of
incompetence and wishful thinking, topped off by half-truths and
downright lies.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has always been schizophrenic about Western Europe
and its contemporary patron power, the United States. Tugging it

special mission; pulling no less forcefully in the opposite

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIRUT _ How many countries do you have to visit to declare a
state? Does an albatross follow PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to Iran,
France, South Africa, China, Russia, Indonesia, Japan?
</P>
<P>
   There were times, when he returned last week, that one was
tempted to ask whether Arafat the ``terrorist'' _ the pre-Oslo,
pre-``peace' Arafat _ would have garnered more support in the Third
World than the 1993 ``peace'' partner of the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The West may rest assured. The Russians, the Indonesians _ even
the Egyptians _ have understood the equations of what we call the
peace ``process.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat should not declare a state on Sept. 13 and, almost
certainly, will not do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does he tour the world to gather support for his
`independent' state before organizing the sovereign country which
he wishes to rule?'' a Palestinian refugee official asked in Beirut
Friday evening. ``Any normal ruler would seek his people's support
for such a step before he announced independence.''
</P>
<P>
   So _ in the destitute, broken world of the Palestinian diaspora
_ goes the argument. Why did Arafat need to travel to Asia to
announce that he might ``reassess'' his declaration of a state?
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian underworld, the answers seem quite clear.
Aware that he would not receive the recognition for his
``independent'' state that he promised the Palestinians on his
triumphal return from the doomed Camp David talks, Arafat decided
to undertake a world tour to prove to his people that the
declaration of statehood could not be made on the date he promised.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than admit that his promise was a lie, he preferred
to allow the presidents and kings to urge ``moderation'' and
``restraint'' _ which is what the United States and, of course,
Israel, wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the Camp David talks remain officially secret but
Arafat's concessions _ for which read, capitulation _ are obvious.
The documents which leaked out of Camp David showed that he
accepted the presence of the Israeli army in the Jordan Valley and
the right of Israel on Palestinian land to use its army when it
feared a danger to the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no Arab army _ neither Palestinian nor any other
kind _ in the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli air force would have
the right to fly over the skies of ``independent'' Palestine. There
would be Israeli early warning stations on Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the Israelis would continue to hold not less than
5 percent of the land, including the settlements which cut the West
Bank off from Jerusalem and which also cut the West Bank in two.
</P>
<P>
   So much for sovereignty. But a state? Gone would be American
support and funds. Gone would be any American ``leverage'' _ a
laughable notion, perhaps _ over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten would be any future negotiations over Jerusalem and
the ``right of return'' of three million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned would be any hope of European support for a state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's visits to President Jacques Chirac in Paris have
already become a tired routine. Only the hardworking Le Monde
correspondent Mouna Naim ensures that Arafat's visits to France
receive anything more than a few words below the fold in her paper.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel believe that a postponement of
talks on Jerusalem and the ``right of return'' is the only way
forward. And _ aware that he and his acolytes will lose the
millions of dollars of U.S. and European support _ Arafat is in no
mood to commit financial suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will declare a Palestinian state'' became _ in Indonesia _
a determination to ``reassess'' the declaration. A visit to Moscow
received a cold response from President Vladimir Putin who urged
``further thought'' before such a step was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not just about American pressure on its world
allies. Even Egypt refused to accept a negation of the Palestinian
demand for sovereignty over the Muslim holy landmarks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that postponement _ delay, suspension _ of
Arafat's demand for a capital in Jerusalem is an incendiary topic.
But a deferment of statehood might still be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Arafat has called for a meeting of the Palestine National
Council next month to debate the call for statehood. In the
meantime, the Palestinian ``minister'' for economy has warned that
the Palestinians could not withstand an Israeli economic blockade _
one of Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak's threats _ without
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of leader allows one of his ministers to say the
Palestinians could not suffer a declaration of statehood without
ensuring that they could survive?'' an official of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arafat wanted to declare a state, he would have done it and
then sought international support. Instead, he travels around the
world to see if he'd get support before he consults his own
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And so all eyes will be upon the meeting of the Council, which
must surely urge ``moderation.'' And then he can say that the
democratically elected representatives of his own people have urged
restraint. This will mean postponement of statehood. So much for
the Sept. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Cynical, perhaps. But not without reason. With the Americans
already calling for a second summit ``peace'' conference in
November _ and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will follow
soon after a visit from American envoy Dennis Ross _ the
Palestinian chairman can insist on a very final last chance for the
``peace of the brave''; and postpone the ``state'' which he has
already declared twice before.
</P>
<P>
   The Arafat world tour may have looked impressive. It may also
have been part of the window-dressing for another Palestinian
``concession.'' Stand by, then, for the postponement of the very
last deadline. &QL;

correspondent Mouna Naim ensures that Arafat's visits to France
receive anything more than a few words below the fold in her paper.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel believe that a postponement of
talks on Jerusalem and the ``right of return'' is the only way
forward. And _ aware that he and his acolytes will lose the
millions of dollars of U.S. and European support _ Arafat is in no
mood to commit financial suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will declare a Palestinian state'' became _ in Indonesia _
a determination to ``reassess'' the declaration. A visit to Moscow
received a cold response from President Vladimir Putin who urged
``further thought'' before such a step was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not just about American pressure on its world
allies. Even Egypt refused to accept a negation of the Palestinian
demand for sovereignty over the Muslim holy landmarks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that postponement _ delay, suspension _ of
Arafat's demand for a capital in Jerusalem is an incendiary topic.
But a deferment of statehood might still be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Arafat has called for a meeting of the Palestine National
Council next month to debate the call for statehood. In the
meantime, the Palestinian ``minister'' for economy has warned that
the Palestinians could not withstand an Israeli economic blockade _
one of Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak's threats _ without
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of leader allows one of his ministers to say the
Palestinians could not suffer a declaration of statehood without
ensuring that they could survive?'' an official of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arafat wanted to declare a state, he would have done it and
then sought international support. Instead, he travels around the
world to see if he'd get support before he consults his own
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And so all eyes will be upon the meeting of the Council, which
must surely urge ``moderation.'' And then he can say that the
democratically elected representatives of his own people have urged
restraint. This will mean postponement of statehood. So much for
the Sept. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Cynical, perhaps. But not without reason. With the Americans
already calling for a second summit ``peace'' conference in
November _ and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will follow
soon after a visit from American envoy Dennis Ross _ the
Palestinian chairman can insist on a very final last chance for the
``peace of the brave''; and postpone the ``state'' which he has
already declared twice before.
</P>
<P>
   The Arafat world tour may have looked impressive. It may also
have been part of the window-dressing for another Palestinian
``concession.'' Stand by, then, for the postponement of the very
last deadline. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Chasing each other across the key electoral states
of the Midwest, the two U.S. presidential contenders were Tuesday
forced for the first time to engage each other directly in a
pre-Labor Day foretaste of the autumn campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With no fewer than six opinion polls now registering the
Democratic National Convention as a resounding success for Vice
President Al Gore, the campaign of George W. Bush slipped into
defensive mode, pounding away at the safe issues _ for Republicans
_ of education and military spending.
</P>
<P>
   There was abundant evidence, however, of a new renewed vigor in
the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee Tuesday, Gore countered head-on Republican
accusations that the country's defenses had been neglected during
the past eight years, insisting that the U.S. armed forces were
``the best prepared, the most powerful, most modern military in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited his experience of war in Vietnam (albeit as an
army reporter) as proof of his superior qualification to be
Commander-in-Chief.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush, nor his running mate, Richard Cheney, went to
Vietnam: Bush served in the Air National Guard in his home state of
Texas, while Cheney stayed in higher education and benefited from
perpetual deferments.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was addressing the annual convention of Veterans of Foreign
Wars, the main U.S. veterans association, just 24 hours after Bush
had used his address before the same audience to lament the
country's state of military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The next president, Bush had said, ``will inherit a military in
decline,'' and he received a standing ovation for his pledge: ``I
will rebuild the military power of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting back Tuesday, Gore argued that the cuts in the defense
budget quoted by Bush dated not to the Clinton years, but to the
tenure of his father, George Bush senior, at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Only last year, Gore said, the administration signed into effect
a 4.8 percent military pay increase, the largest in a generation,
with another 3.7 percent to come this month.
</P>
<P>
   In a succession of post-convention interviews _ his first
unscripted encounters with reporters for weeks _ Gore appeared
buoyed by the poll verdicts on his convention speech, which were
unanimously positive.
</P>
<P>
   The last two post-convention polls _ the Washington Post-ABC
television out Tuesday and the Reuters-Zogby poll out on Monday _
both put Gore in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the leads of 2 and 3 points respectively (in
projections including the Reform and the Green parties) were within
the margin of error, this was the first time either poll had showed
Gore ahead since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush insisted that the tightening of the race was what
they had forecast all along, and observers noted that a realistic
indication of the state of play would emerge only around Labor Day
(Sept. 4), when the Democratic Convention was as far in the past as
the Republican Convention is now.
</P>
<P>
   They noted also that Bush had raised seven times as much money
in July as Gore, although more frugal spending has left Gore with
more in his war chest (an estimated 6.4 million dollars) than Bush
(4 million).
</P>
<P>
   A new hint of defensiveness could be detected in the Bush
campaign, however, as the two candidates approach their next big
test: the televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   The commission that organizes and sets the rules for the debates
made its proposals more than a month ago; but as Ari Fleisher,
Bush's senior adviser made clear this week, the Bush camp has still
not agreed either the number of the debates or their venue.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has proposed three presidential debates _ in
Boston, Raleigh and St. Louis _ and one vice-presidential debate,
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   At least in public, the line of the Gore camp _ which regards
debating as one of their candidate's strengths _ is the more
debates the better.
</P>
<P>
   The post-convention polls have also brought a perceptible shift
in the approach of the U.S. media. After months of treating Vice
President Al Gore as the underdog, they are now looking at the two
campaigns through a different prism.
</P>
<P>
   It is Gore, with his Jewish running mate and passionate
wife-kissing, who has tweaked the imagination, while Bush faces new
questions of style _ about his mangled English _ and substance: the
generous retirement package awarded to his running mate, Cheney,
and his reluctance to cash in his company shares. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ Some very odd questions are surfacing in the Middle
East about Colonel Moammar Qaddafi's latest adventure in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is the ``Qaddafi International Association for
Charitable Organizations'' which is run by the colonel's
26-year-old son, Seif, and which is supposedly mediating for the
release of the 24 hostages in the Philippines?
</P>
<P>
   Why does it have no address listed in the Libyan capital of
Tripoli? And why has an organization which can rustle up a jet, a
medical team and negotiators so swiftly never been heard of before?
</P>
<P>
   Why have so few people recalled that Qaddafi sent money and
weapons to the Moro Liberation Front in the Philippines shortly
after he staged his coup d'etat over King Idris in 1969? Qaddafi
turned up to witness the subsequent autonomy agreement with Manila.
</P>
<P>
   And when a breakaway of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
rejected the autonomy agreement, they changed their name to Abu
Sayyaf: the very same Abu Sayyaf organization which now holds the
hostages in the Philippines. It was this same group which, in 1995,
called for the lifting of U.N. sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Qaddafi has weaved many a tangled web in his time, but
few as complex as this. Nor one as strange in its nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi's son is called Seif el-Islam, which means, literally,
the two-edged sword of Islam. And ``Abu Sayyaf'' _ the name of the
kidnap group _ means, in Arabic, ``father of the sword-bearer.''
Just a coincidence, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And then _ for those who enjoyed the revelations in the French
press last week that France was supporting the Qaddafi initiative
in order to get its own hostages freed _ there is the weird story
of the good ship ``Silco.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Silco'' was a rustbucket cruising off the North African
coast with five Belgians and a Frenchwoman on board when on Nov. 8,
1987, it was commandeered by members of the ruthless Palestinian
``Fatah Revolutionary Council'' led by Abu Nidal.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions remain that the ship was in fact seized by a Libyan
naval gunboat. But for two years, the world played along with the
fiction that Abu Nidal's group, which was then based in Tripoli,
was holding its prisoners in an unknown location.
</P>
<P>
   Then on April 10, 1990, one of the Belgians, Fernard Houtekins,
and his French lover, Jacqueline Valente _ along with a child born
in captivity _ turned up in Beirut, courtesy, so we were informed
at the time, of Colonel Qaddafi's ``mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Abu Nidal's local office in Beirut even invited
a squad of Belgian diplomats to negotiate for the other hostages. I
was present when they arrived to chat to the local Abu Nidal
representative, who was to be assassinated a few meters from the
same office a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgians diplomats thanked Colonel Qaddafi for his
``mediation.'' French President Francois Mitterand formally thanked
Qaddafi for the ``decisive role'' he played in securing the release
of the Belgian and his French woman friend.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, the two were handed over by armed Palestinians to a
senior French intelligence agent called Philippe Rondot.
</P>
<P>
   Rondot, it transpired, had been involved in the negotiations
with Libyan emissaries for the hostages' release. Where is Rondot
now, one wonders? In France? Or in the Philippines?
</P>
<P>
   And where, finally, has the $24 million offered by the Libyans
for the Philippine hostages' release actually come from? It's a lot
of money for a charity to throw around.
</P>
<P>
   And if it goes to the Abu Sayyaf group, will any of it be
returned to the man who so generously supported their parent
``liberation'' organization three decades ago: Colonel Moammar
Qaddafi? &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ Some very odd questions are surfacing in the Middle
East about Colonel Moammar Qaddafi's latest adventure in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is the ``Qaddafi International Association for
Charitable Organizations'' which is run by the colonel's
26-year-old son, Seif, and which is supposedly mediating for the
release of the 24 hostages in the Philippines?
</P>
<P>
   Why does it have no address listed in the Libyan capital of
Tripoli? And why has an organization which can rustle up a jet, a
medical team and negotiators so swiftly never been heard of before?
</P>
<P>
   Why have so few people recalled that Qaddafi sent money and
weapons to the Moro Liberation Front in the Philippines shortly
after he staged his coup d'etat over King Idris in 1969? Qaddafi
turned up to witness the subsequent autonomy agreement with Manila.
</P>
<P>
   And when a breakaway of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
rejected the autonomy agreement, they changed their name to Abu
Sayyaf: the very same Abu Sayyaf organization which now holds the
hostages in the Philippines. It was this same group which, in 1995,
called for the lifting of U.N. sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Qaddafi has weaved many a tangled web in his time, but
few as complex as this. Nor one as strange in its nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi's son is called Seif el-Islam, which means, literally,
the two-edged sword of Islam. And ``Abu Sayyaf'' _ the name of the
kidnap group _ means, in Arabic, ``father of the sword-bearer.''
Just a coincidence, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And then _ for those who enjoyed the revelations in the French

``Fatah Revolutionary Council'' led by Abu Nidal.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``Bienvenidos. Se Habla Espanol.'' The sign welcoming
customers to a hair salon in a suburban shopping mall assured them
Spanish was spoken there.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the sign disappeared from the shop
window. Soon after, according to Hispanic former employees,
managers of the Regis Hairstylist Salon in North Riverside, Ill.,
ordered them to speak only English, even on their breaks and to
Spanish-speaking customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several hairstylists allege that they lost their jobs in 1997
for defying the rule and speaking their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has made
a federal case out of it, filing a class-action discrimination
lawsuit last year against Minneapolis-based Regis Corp., which
operates salons in malls across America.
</P>
<P>
   As immigrants from non-English-speaking countries flow into the
United States, businesses and institutions increasingly face a
foreign-language test: How best to cope with new workers and new
customers whose first language is not English?
</P>
<P>
   The question is laden with obstacles and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of English as the sole language of American business
and political life is being challenged, swamped by new demographic
and market realities. More than 16 million legal immigrants have
entered America since 1980. One in five children in America is
either an immigrant or the U.S.-born son or daughter of an
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group, native Spanish speakers, represents an
important labor pool and a rapidly expanding economic force, with a
buying power last year of $383 billion, up 84 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller in numbers, but more affluent, Asian-Americans saw their
buying power leap 102 percent in the decade, to $228.6 billion,
according to estimates from the Selig Center for Economic Growth at
the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue here isn't just a legal question. It is: How does
American business manage a diverse work force? How do you balance
new realities and historic assumptions, many of them unflattering,
about immigrants?'' said Christopher Ho, a senior staff attorney at
the San Francisco-based Employment Law Center, a national worker
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. efforts to penetrate the global marketplace, and keep pace
with the new diversity in America, have companies big and small
scrambling to hire bilingual employees.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal police forces, hospitals, congressional offices and
other government organizations also seek out bilingual employees or
provide language training for existing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sense that we need it more to succeed in the economy than
we did before,'' said Pat DiCerbo of the National Clearinghouse for
Bilingual Education at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the work place diversifies and the need for bilingualism
grows, so too has the imposition of English-only rules by companies
claiming that the restrictions are necessary for workplace safety
and rapport.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Gomez, 39, a Mexican native and one of the Chicago
hairstylists who claims she was forced from her job, speaks English
at home with her three American-born children. But she felt it only
natural to speak Spanish at work with clients from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed silly to me, because we're in a free country and
my clients speak Spanish, too. It just doesn't make sense,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Regis, which operates 5,000 salons in the U.S.,
Canada and the United Kingdom, declined to comment on the case when
reached by telephone at their corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not prohibit employers from requiring their
workers to speak only English. But EEOC regulations can require
companies to demonstrate that the English-only policy is necessary
for conducting business or maintaining safety and that it does not
discriminate. Courts have ruled that an employer's language policy
must be reasonable and justifiable, and not a blanket policy that
extends to off-work activities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, English-only is acceptable among air traffic
controllers or in a hospital, and perhaps even in a business
setting to maintain continuity, but not to prevent workers from
chatting in their native language at the water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC only began tracking complaints about English-only rules
in 1996 and has seen them rise. In 1996, the agency filed 77
English-only charges, compared to 253 last year. Likewise, cases
involving discrimination based on national origin have increased as
employers take advantage of workers' unfamiliarity of the U.S.
workplace and ignorance of their legal rights. Allegations of
harassment have risen tenfold between 1986 and 1999, according to
the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has grown significantly,'' said David Grinberg, a spokesman
at the EEOC's Washington, D.C., headquarters. ``The trend we see
are immigrants in low-wage jobs who become the target of egregious
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho believes many employers enact English-only rules in the
mistaken belief that they are sanctioned by the wave of largely
symbolic English-only resolutions. About two dozen states,
including Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Colorado, have
passed measures or ballot initiatives making English the official
language over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 259-169 to make
English the nation's official language. But the measure has failed
to advance to a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as English-only efforts persist, corporate marketing
efforts in Spanish and other languages are at an all-time high,
according to Raoul Lopez, senior vice president of Strategy
Research Corp. in Miami. The marketing research firm founded in
1971 is having its best year ever supplying data on Hispanic buying
trends to Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, $1.7 billion was spent on Spanish-language
advertising in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable. It's the fastest-growing minority group in
the United States with enormous buying power,'' said Lopez. ``There
is a growing momentum in the market for companies to expand their
efforts under an umbrella of the top three minority groups _
Hispanics, African Americans and Asian-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Prudential Atlanta/Georgia Realty opened a
bilingual office to serve suburban Hall County's booming Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, the consumer products giant, last fall
launched a multicultural marketing effort including a magazine
called Avanzando con tu Familia (Advancing With Your Family).
Debuted last fall, it is distributed free to 4.5 million Hispanic
households and includes a blend of advertising and helpful tips for
mothers and homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also spends heavily on Spanish-language radio
and television, is testing similar grassroots efforts to build
relationships with Asian American and African-American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, as the demographics of our customers change, we
want to change with them,'' said Maria Molina of Procter &AMP; Gamble's
multicultural marketing division. ``It's the right thing to do, and
it makes business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In large cities like Los Angeles, Houston and Miami, native
Spanish speakers can live their everyday lives without the need for
English.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all ATM cash machines in the United States offer
English or Spanish options as the first selection of any
transaction. This year, in an effort to count everyone in America,
the Census Bureau offered questionnaires in six languages: English,
Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls show that a majority of immigrants consider learning
English or improving their English skills is a top priority to get
ahead in America. Census figures show that more than 60 percent of
Spanish-speaking immigrants are fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   Market studies show that the rate of assimilation among
Hispanics is accelerating as their affluence is growing. About 75
percent of Hispanic households in the United States are classified
as middle or upper class, according to market researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a market study by Strategy Research Corp. showed that
for every Hispanic adult identifying more with the general U.S.
population, seven were aligned more with the Hispanic culture and
market. By this year, the ratio had dropped to 1 to 3, with
substantially more Hispanics were moving toward the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, immigrants will assimilate over time. But
will employers ease up on English-only rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is always tough,'' said Ho, the worker-rights advocate.
``But as we're faced with the reality that we need these people to
fuel the current economy, perhaps it will propel employers to
rethink these kinds of rules.''

<P>
   Managers used to have only two choices when it came to getting
employees from distant locations together to discuss information:
Send them by plane, train or automobile to meet in person, or set
up an audio conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another alternative. A Web conference _ essentially
an audio conference with visuals _ enables managers to communicate
visual information to a group and yet never ask them to leave their
offices.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   To launch a Web conference, the manager who's organizing it just
asks interested parties to log onto a URL. at the same time,
participants dial into an audio conference. (Putting out both audio
and visual information simultaneously on computers is possible but
still considerably more primitive and unreliable.)
</P>
<P>
   What the participants see is a screen that the meeting
coordinator controls. He or she can present visual information in
any format, from streaming video to PowerPoint slides to notes in
Word. Other optional features include chat lines, group white
boards and note-taking devices.
</P>
<P>
   As with any relatively new technology, there are glitches. First
is the Web itself. It can go down at the user end, be maddeningly
slow or annoy users with its sometimes sophomoric interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Web conferencing technology is still imperfect. The more
complicated the visuals, the slower and jerkier they can appear.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, to be successful in this new genre, the meeting
organizer must coordinate the smooth delivery of the visuals with a
successful audio conference. Either one of these tasks can be
daunting for the average stressed-out businessperson. Doing both at
once may be beyond the grasp of many.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these hazards, the use of Web conferencing is
spreading rapidly. For example, brokerage houses are beginning to
use it to hold analysts' briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a quarterly basis, they used to do a teleconference and now
they'll do a Web-based meeting. The presenter will send out a slide
show and the audio to maybe 300 to 400 analysts and investors
around the country,'' says Mike Archer, president of PresentPLUS, a
Web conferencing company based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those people will not interact very much,'' Archer adds.
``They won't use any of the interactive tools that are available
even in a Java (Web) format. It's one-way communication.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other companies are beginning to do training with
smaller groups of employees using Web conferencing with interactive
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Web conferencing is so inexpensive,'' Archer says,
``Hewlett-Packard and Rockwell Automation both do training shows
twice a month. That way, even though the information is not
terribly critical, they can get it out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Reed Hoke III, publisher of Direct Marketing, identifies
another use for Web conferencing: ``The small businesses that I
deal with belong to direct marketing clubs that sponsor regional
meetings with phenomenal speakers,'' he says. ``But people can't
get there. This technology is going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales presentations similarly become much more cost-effective
when delivered over the Web, if only because salespeople can reach
many more customers without leaving the office. It remains an open
question as to how many new customers can be brought in using the
relatively impersonal Web format, but the Web can be used to
communicate regularly with well-established customers.
</P>
<P>
   The economics are often compelling. For somewhere around $5,000
per site per hour-long event, companies can set up fully
interactive rooms for their employees to hear the latest strategic
thinking or fiscal year plans.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Web conferencing may never completely replace the
dynamics of a face-to-face meeting. The technology is still in its
adolescence and has its awkward moments. Links go down, screens are
small, the video can be blurry depending on the available bandwidth
and the quality of the equipment. Moreover, we humans are animals,
and we learn to trust each other by getting physically close
together.
</P>
<P>
   But after contemplating the time or expense involved in yet
another round of travel to distant places for a meeting with work
colleagues, remember that there is an alternative to the meeting
... and it's virtual.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At most companies, giving or getting a performance appraisal has
all the appeal of a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers often loathe doing appraisals. If they thought they
could get away with it, they'd skip the repulsive chore entirely,''
observes a new study of best-practice performance management by the
American Productivity &AMP; Quality Center, or APQC, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are finding ways to abolish formal these
unpopular evaluations. Even so, most organizations grit their teeth
and plow ahead, if only because they feel a need for some way of
assessing employees' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the results and outputs that a reliable
performance appraisal system can deliver,'' APQC says.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is changing on the appraisal front. In the past,
performance appraisals were often treated as a charade in which
employees, like the children of Lake Wobegon, were all rated above
average.
</P>
<P>
   No more. According to the APQC, best-practice companies now
believe that ``too few employees are terminated each year for poor
performance,'' and so are focusing their performance-management
systems specifically on weeding out noncontributors. These
companies are also beginning to single out star performers for pay
increases and other rewards not available to the majority of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, performance-appraisal systems are now likely to
have teeth _ and employees are increasingly likely to be graded and
ranked like students in high school.
</P>
<P>
   This development presents managers with a dilemma, and not just
because assessing job performance is harder than grading answers on
a math test. The most successful work environments are those in
which people feel a sense of teamwork _ ``we're all in this
together'' _ and do whatever is required at the moment rather than
sticking to rigid job descriptions. Stratification and rankings
don't exactly encourage this collaborative attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the fear of losing your job because you're rated in
the bottom tenth. If politics creeps into the rankings _ and it may
_ the resentment will fester like mold on last week's vanilla
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a manager to do? One solution is to work with the
company's human resources department to ensure that the appraisal
system is perceived as fair.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the APQC says, many companies actively solicit
employee involvement in shaping the system, and then make a point
of surveying employees to assess its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A second solution: Make sure the employees' performance reviews
focus on variables within their control. People are responsible for
their attitudes and work habits. They can't be held accountable for
performance problems caused by poor training, inadequate equipment
or conflicting instructions from management.
</P>
<P>
   Putting teeth in performance appraisals won't necessarily make
them more popular. So long as they're perceived as fair, though, it
may make them more effective.

</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   To launch a Web conference, the manager who's organizing it just
asks interested parties to log onto a URL. at the same time,
participants dial into an audio conference. (Putting out both audio
and visual information simultaneously on computers is possible but
still considerably more primitive and unreliable.)
</P>
<P>
   What the participants see is a screen that the meeting
coordinator controls. He or she can present visual information in
any format, from streaming video to PowerPoint slides to notes in
Word. Other optional features include chat lines, group white
boards and note-taking devices.
</P>
<P>
   As with any relatively new technology, there are glitches. First
is the Web itself. It can go down at the user end, be maddeningly
slow or annoy users with its sometimes sophomoric interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Web conferencing technology is still imperfect. The more
complicated the visuals, the slower and jerkier they can appear.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, to be successful in this new genre, the meeting
organizer must coordinate the smooth delivery of the visuals with a
successful audio conference. Either one of these tasks can be
daunting for the average stressed-out businessperson. Doing both at
once may be beyond the grasp of many.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these hazards, the use of Web conferencing is
spreading rapidly. For example, brokerage houses are beginning to
use it to hold analysts' briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a quarterly basis, they used to do a teleconference and now
they'll do a Web-based meeting. The presenter will send out a slide
show and the audio to maybe 300 to 400 analysts and investors
around the country,'' says Mike Archer, president of PresentPLUS, a
Web conferencing company based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those people will not interact very much,'' Archer adds.
``They won't use any of the interactive tools that are available
even in a Java (Web) format. It's one-way communication.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other companies are beginning to do training with
smaller groups of employees using Web conferencing with interactive
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Web conferencing is so inexpensive,'' Archer says,
``Hewlett-Packard and Rockwell Automation both do training shows
twice a month. That way, even though the information is not
terribly critical, they can get it out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Reed Hoke III, publisher of Direct Marketing, identifies
another use for Web conferencing: ``The small businesses that I
deal with belong to direct marketing clubs that sponsor regional
meetings with phenomenal speakers,'' he says. ``But people can't
get there. This technology is going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales presentations similarly become much more cost-effective
when delivered over the Web, if only because salespeople can reach
many more customers without leaving the office. It remains an open
question as to how many new customers can be brought in using the
relatively impersonal Web format, but the Web can be used to
communicate regularly with well-established customers.
</P>
<P>
   The economics are often compelling. For somewhere around $5,000
per site per hour-long event, companies can set up fully
interactive rooms for their employees to hear the latest strategic
thinking or fiscal year plans.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Web conferencing may never completely replace the
dynamics of a face-to-face meeting. The technology is still in its
adolescence and has its awkward moments. Links go down, screens are
small, the video can be blurry depending on the available bandwidth
and the quality of the equipment. Moreover, we humans are animals,
and we learn to trust each other by getting physically close
together.
</P>
<P>
   But after contemplating the time or expense involved in yet
another round of travel to distant places for a meeting with work
colleagues, remember that there is an alternative to the meeting
... and it's virtual.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At most companies, giving or getting a performance appraisal has
all the appeal of a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers often loathe doing appraisals. If they thought they
could get away with it, they'd skip the repulsive chore entirely,''
observes a new study of best-practice performance management by the
American Productivity &AMP; Quality Center, or APQC, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are finding ways to abolish formal these
unpopular evaluations. Even so, most organizations grit their teeth
and plow ahead, if only because they feel a need for some way of
assessing employees' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the results and outputs that a reliable
performance appraisal system can deliver,'' APQC says.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is changing on the appraisal front. In the past,
performance appraisals were often treated as a charade in which
employees, like the children of Lake Wobegon, were all rated above
average.
</P>
<P>
   No more. According to the APQC, best-practice companies now
believe that ``too few employees are terminated each year for poor
performance,'' and so are focusing their performance-management
systems specifically on weeding out noncontributors. These
companies are also beginning to single out star performers for pay
increases and other rewards not available to the majority of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, performance-appraisal systems are now likely to
have teeth _ and employees are increasingly likely to be graded and
ranked like students in high school.
</P>
<P>
   This development presents managers with a dilemma, and not just
because assessing job performance is harder than grading answers on
a math test. The most successful work environments are those in
which people feel a sense of teamwork _ ``we're all in this
together'' _ and do whatever is required at the moment rather than
sticking to rigid job descriptions. Stratification and rankings
don't exactly encourage this collaborative attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the fear of losing your job because you're rated in
the bottom tenth. If politics creeps into the rankings _ and it may
_ the resentment will fester like mold on last week's vanilla
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a manager to do? One solution is to work with the
company's human resources department to ensure that the appraisal
system is perceived as fair.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the APQC says, many companies actively solicit
employee involvement in shaping the system, and then make a point
of surveying employees to assess its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A second solution: Make sure the employees' performance reviews
focus on variables within their control. People are responsible for
their attitudes and work habits. They can't be held accountable for
performance problems caused by poor training, inadequate equipment
or conflicting instructions from management.
</P>
<P>
   Putting teeth in performance appraisals won't necessarily make
them more popular. So long as they're perceived as fair, though, it
may make them more effective.

AFTER A WASTED OPPORTUNITY, THE ELEPHANT LINGERS 

</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the vice president's women and all the vice president's men
did their best to make him likable.
</P>
<P>
   The affable Joe Lieberman praised his moral center and the
winning Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg said he cared about the
dispossessed and cute Tommy Lee Jones said he was brotherly and the
charming Karenna said he was fatherly. Twinkling Tipper beat the
drum for him.
</P>
<P>
   The message was, he's decent, good and caring. With all that,
who needs cool and clever. But there's still the elephant in the
living room, the thing he can't lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton could have chased the elephant, because he's
responsible for its being there. But he tiptoed around it like
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton also had kind things to say about Al Gore at the
Democratic convention, but he could have done more.
</P>
<P>
   He could have still done the walk, given his dazzling speech and
then asked for quiet. Then he could have said something like, ``Now
I'm going to bring up a difficult subject,'' and shake a teacherly
finger as he does.
</P>
<P>
   He could have said, ``My personal mistakes belong to me, not Al
Gore. I'm paying for them. He shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have said, ``I wounded my family and embarrassed my
country. It is my shame. Al Gore had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. The place would have been so silent you could have
heard a balloon bounce. Everyone else would have looked down at
their knees or chewed their top lip as Clinton does when he's
having an emotional moment.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still didn't get it, he could have explained, ``Al
Gore's job was to be my second. He did what vice presidents are
supposed to do. There are those who think he should have attacked
me. But they don't understand the job of vice president. His job
was to stand in the wings, prepared to run the country. He couldn't
do that if he was also denouncing me.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have added, ``Al Gore didn't just prove his loyalty to
me during those bad times. He proved his loyalty to America. Now
give it a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras would have frantically sought Hillary and Chelsea, who,
having been tipped to the addendum, would be holding hands and
looking resolute. Reporters would have leaped to their laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately everything else that was said that night might
have ended up on the jump page. But it could have chased the
elephant and said ``boo'' to the elephant keepers, because even
though it's the president's elephant, his enemies are feeding it.
</P>
<P>
   They say things such as, Al Gore should rebuke the president
loud and clear for his shameful ways.
</P>
<P>
   They say the two are Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee and that no one
will ever be able to look at Al Gore without thinking of Bill
Clinton, by which they mean only the naughty Clinton, not the one
who had anything to do with prosperous times. This guilt by
association concept somehow does not apply to Gerald Ford and
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   They'd have us fault Al Gore for not going on the Jerry Springer
show and duking it out with his boss.
</P>
<P>
   They like the elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is said to enjoy metaphors. He sees the elephant, but
it's not his to talk about. It never was.
</P>
<P>
   Some will argue that Clinton already spoke of these things to an
evangelical gathering, but that wasn't L.A. with the whole world
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say that we're supposed to put this unseemly mess
behind us, but how many people have? Even those enraptured by
Clinton's princely speech had flickering thoughts that ranged from
``big jerk'' to ``what a waste of greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day Tipper will write her book and let us know how often Al
came home and hit his head against the wall and wished he could cut
and run.
</P>
<P>
   Right now all we know is that during the very bizarre period
when the White House was everyone's dirty joke and the presidency
was under siege, the vice president played Steady Eddie, stayed the
course and said nothing, even though he might have been thinking,
``Jeesh, Bill. You are such a train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things could have turned out entirely differently.
Clinton might have resigned and then Gore would have become
president. By now we would know how equipped he is to run a country
and whether a stiff demeanor and a propensity toward
intellectualizing get in the way of achieving things such as
equitable health care and spending more on education.
</P>
<P>
   By now we'd know if he was good for the economy, good for
working families and committed to fairness. We'd know the guy for
who he really is, minus the elephant.

   BEIJING _ Ding Meiyuan likes to go out in a nice dress and feel
pretty, but those thoughts will have to wait at least another
month. She is preparing for the Olympics, and at 227 pounds, her
biggest concern is that she'll lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me now, eating is first; training is second,'' she said
after a workout one afternoon recently.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old fisherman's daughter is the women's
weightlifting world champion in the super-heavyweight division, 75
kilograms and over. Some say that makes her the world's strongest
woman. But she is not the heaviest.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the slimmest of all her competitors,'' said Wei Di, who
heads the weightlifting program. ``The rest of them weigh at least
265 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's weightlifting will make its debut as an Olympic sport
next month at Sydney. With world records in four of the seven
weight classes, China's team is heavily favored to win several gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women on China's national team come from peasant
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese women are good at enduring hardships,'' Wei said.
``For those from the countryside, this is a path to a better
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding grew up in a fishing village near the port city of Dalian
in northeastern China. Like many on the team, she started training
when she was just 12, after a coach decided she had the right body
type and convinced her to enroll in a state-run sports school,
which is where almost all Chinese Olympic athletes are trained.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years on the Liaoning provincial team, she moved up
to the national team at age 15. At 19, she won three gold medals
and broke two world records at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok.
Last November, she won the world championship in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only Chinese woman picking up medals in Bangkok.
She and her teammates won all seven weightlifting gold medals and
broke world records seven days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Liaoning Daily newspaper, the women's
weightlifting team has not shown its true strength in international
competitions for fear of dominating the sport too heavily and
jeopardizing the chances of it becoming an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Ding's strongest rival is Agata Wrobel, the 19-year-old world
record-holder from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As for the American team, ``there's one kid who's pretty good,''
said Zhang Wenxi, the women's weightlifting coach.
</P>
<P>
   At 17 and 300 pounds, Cheryl Haworth of Savannah, Ga., is the
U.S. national champion and America's best chance for a women's
weightlifting medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can maybe get a bronze,'' Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
   Since China has been allotted just four slots for women's
weightlifting, Zhang and Wei say they are still deciding on the
final line-up, which will be announced August 27. Everything from
competitors' performances to menstrual cycles are being factored
into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the team to win gold has been building. With
recent injuries and doping scandals in swimming, diving and track
and field _ high-profile events for which China had high Olympic
hopes _ women's weightlifting is one of the few events China feels
confident about.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese state-run media have been talking about a gold medal
sweep for all four women. Zhang says he feels secure about at least
three golds.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic medals also come with financial rewards in China's
state-sponsored sports system. Gold medalists will receive 80,000
yuan, or almost US$10,000, which is the equivalent of 20 years'
income for many farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But sports is starting to get commercial sponsorship too. For
example, all athletes who win medals will be required to wear
clothing from Chinese manufacturer Li Ning during the medal
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The weightlifting team, so far has not attracted much corporate
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are not very interested in weightlifting,'' Wei
said. ``We hope after these Olympics we'll get more support.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, they have to get the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team works out three to five hours a day at a
Beijing gym. Ranging in age from 19 to 26, they repeatedly hoist
barbells to their chests and over their heads. For several hours
each week, they also do mental exercises, which Zhang says involves
deep breathing and recalling their best performances from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The team has experts in Chinese medicine monitoring each athlete
and giving them pills made of ginseng and deer antler to enrich
their blood and energy levels.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Ding lifts more than 30,000 pounds a day. To sustain
her, she eats four meals a day and snacks as much as she wants to.
Her arms are big, but her thighs are massive.
</P>
<P>
   At first, building bulk was hard on her psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be skinny,'' she said. ``I weighed only 40 kilograms
(88 pounds).''
</P>
<P>
   After getting big, ``I didn't like to go outside because I
thought I was too fat. I felt like everyone was looking at me,''
she said. ``But now, doing this sport, I have to be like this.
After I stop training I'll lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   One thought keeps her going when she longs to be thin again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about when I'm in Australia getting my medal,
listening to China's anthem, how other girls won't be able to do
this,'' Ding said.

   The pressure on the team to win gold has been building. With
recent injuries and doping scandals in swimming, diving and track
and field _ high-profile events for which China had high Olympic
hopes _ women's weightlifting is one of the few events China feels
confident about.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese state-run media have been talking about a gold medal
sweep for all four women. Zhang says he feels secure about at least
three golds.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic medals also come with financial rewards in China's
state-sponsored sports system. Gold medalists will receive 80,000
yuan, or almost US$10,000, which is the equivalent of 20 years'
income for many farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But sports is starting to get commercial sponsorship too. For
example, all athletes who win medals will be required to wear
clothing from Chinese manufacturer Li Ning during the medal
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The weightlifting team, so far has not attracted much corporate
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are not very interested in weightlifting,'' Wei
said. ``We hope after these Olympics we'll get more support.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, they have to get the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team works out three to five hours a day at a
Beijing gym. Ranging in age from 19 to 26, they repeatedly hoist
barbells to their chests and over their heads. For several hours
each week, they also do mental exercises, which Zhang says involves
deep breathing and recalling their best performances from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The team has experts in Chinese medicine monitoring each athlete
and giving them pills made of ginseng and deer antler to enrich
their blood and energy levels.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Ding lifts more than 30,000 pounds a day. To sustain
her, she eats four meals a day and snacks as much as she wants to.
Her arms are big, but her thighs are massive.
</P>
<P>
   At first, building bulk was hard on her psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be skinny,'' she said. ``I weighed only 40 kilograms
(88 pounds).''
</P>
<P>
   After getting big, ``I didn't like to go outside because I
thought I was too fat. I felt like everyone was looking at me,''
she said. ``But now, doing this sport, I have to be like this.
After I stop training I'll lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   One thought keeps her going when she longs to be thin again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about when I'm in Australia getting my medal,
listening to China's anthem, how other girls won't be able to do
this,'' Ding said.

 &HT;    TAX COURT RULING MAY COST TEXAS BLUE CROSS MILLIONS
 &HT;    Attn: Texas papers.
 &HT;    By JERRY MOSKAL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Texas Inc. may be
liable for millions of dollars in additional federal taxes under a
precedent-setting U.S. Tax Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stephen J. Swift ruled Friday(cq) that the insurer did not
qualify for savings under a rule approved by Congress as part of
the 1990 Omnibus Reconciliation Budget Act (OBRA).
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross had sought $14.8 million in tax deductions under the
rule for both 1992 and 1993, but the Internal Revenue Service found
it did not qualify, and demanded $5.27 million in additional taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too soon to know whether we will appeal,'' said Richard
Bromley, one of four Chicago tax attorneys for Blue Cross. ``We
haven't had a chance to talk to our client yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress enacted the rule to cushion insurers against huge tax
bills arising from OBRA's change in the way insurance companies
must report reserves set aside for estimated claims.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the companies used the full original estimated
liability of claims, but the law changed that to a ``net'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy D. Williams of Chicago, one of the Blue Cross tax
attorneys, explained Tuesday that OBRA required insurers to take
into account amounts they recover from other sources when reporting
their loss reserves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, a company anticipating a $10,000 claim is
required to reduce that by $2,000 it recovers from salvage or
another insurer, and report the reserve at $8,000. The difference
would be taxable.
</P>
<P>
   But OBRA included a rule, invoked by the Blue Cross, that
granted coordination of benefits (COB) deductions to some insurers
affected by the new reporting requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Under COB, two insurance companies insuring the same patient
coordinate the benefits they pay. This is a common situation in
households with two working parents whose dependents are insured by
different companies through the parents' employers.
</P>
<P>
   COB designates the company insuring the parent with the earliest
birth date in the year as the primary carrier, and the insurer of
the other parent as the secondary insurer. COB provides that the
primary insurer pay 80 percent of a claim and the secondary insurer
the balance.
</P>
<P>
   But Swift ruled that the Texas insurer did not qualify for the
special COB deductions. The judge also found Blue Cross could not
take deductions under alternative IRS rules known as ``safe
harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromley, one of the Blue Cross attorneys, said a decision on
whether to appeal would be made later.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the company's tax liability under the new ruling
must be computed under Tax Court rules. ``That will take a couple
of months. So we have time before we decide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a decision is entered based on Swift's opinion, either side
in the case will have 90 days to seek a review of the findings by
the U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Bromley said the ruling would set a precedent in all similar
cases unless it is overturned by the Court of Appeals or another
insurer obtains a contradictory ruling from another tax court
judge.

<P>
   LOST-CLIMBER (Undated) _ Three times in a row, a challenging ice
face up the southern route of a 14,000-foot peak named Cerro San
Francisco in the Andes Mountains had defeated Jim Weinman. The
32-year-old mountaineer and extreme adventurer took a fourth stab
at the glaciated summit in June. It was to be his last. By PAUL
GRONDAHL.
</P>
<P>
   CAFFEINE (Undated) _ The alarm goes off; you stumble out of bed.
And before you grab your toothbrush or let the dog out, you grab a
hot cuppa joe. It's your morning wake-up call. By midafternoon
you're restless and headachy. You grab a crisp dollar and head to
the pop machine for your ``fix.'' It's caffeine, and it seems
harmless enough (in moderation, of course). But could caffeine be
America's ``newest nicotine''? By SCOTT SIMONSON.
</P>
<P>
   FORGED-AUTOGRAPHS (San Antonio) _ Some people look at precise,
carbon-copy forgeries of famous athletes' signatures and are
astounded. Others marvel at the meticulous scientific techniques
now used by experts to determine if an autograph is authentic. But
to veteran San Antonio collector Howard O'Desky, the most amazing
aspect of the sports autograph industry is still the same as it
always was -- plain, old stupidity. By MIKE FINGER.
</P>
<P>
   ALCOHOLISM-DRUG (San Antonio) _ A study by San Antonio
researchers has found a drug used to treat nausea also can curb the
destructive cravings in the type of alcoholic whom doctors find
toughest to treat. Early-onset alcoholics _ those who became
problem drinkers before age 25 _ were able to stop drinking or
significantly cut their alcohol consumption when they took the drug
ondansetron, according to the study by University of Texas Health
Science Center scientists. By CINDY TUMIEL.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCE (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WIRED-CLOTHES (San Francisco) _ Levi Strauss hopes some people
need to be so connected they can't just be carrying their
electronic gadgets; they've got to be wearing them. The jeans maker
and the Dutch electronics company Philips NV will release a line of
jackets branded IDC+. The jackets, which will only be available in
Europe and set the wearer back $600 to $900, come equipped with a
mobile phone and MP3 player, a remote control device plus ear gear
and a microphone integrated into the collar. By VICTORIA COLLIVER.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-EMPLOYMENT (San Antonio) _ It's a familiar story:
Businesses are having a tough time locating workers because the
booming economy has slashed unemployment. So they're recruiting
them from far away and paying higher wages. Except in this case,
it's taking place in Mexico. By BILL DAY.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-RAIDERS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Among the underpublicized
reasons Richard Nixon was driven from office with pitchforks were
his periodic attempts to phone in plays to then-Washington Redskins
coach George Allen. Unlike visiting China or helping cover up a
burglary, that sort of thing is best left to the professionals. On
the other hand, this seems like the perfect time to drop a quick
one in Jon Gruden's in-basket over at Raiders Galactic
Headquarters. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-JACOBS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Even after winning the 1,500 and
5,000 meters at last month's Olympic Track and Field Trials,
Oakland's Regina Jacobs knew she would not be running both events
in the Sydney Olympics. The question was which one she'd pick.
Jacobs provided an answer Tuesday. The four-time Olympian and
Stanford University graduate opted for the 1,500 over the longer
race, even though she is the American record-holder at 5,000. By
JOHN CRUMPACKER.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-BRONCOS-SLUR (Denver) _ Free safety Eric Brown said this
week he and several other black Denver Broncos felt mixed emotions
when a published report indicated that an unidentified white player
had accused linebacker Bill Romanowski of using a racial slur. By
TOM ORSBORN.

 &HT;    Wash day was hard work in rural Georgia in the '30
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    By Eloise Ozburn Riner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a little girl during the '30s, we lived on a farm in
rural Georgia and had no electricity.
</P>
<P>
   All chores had to be done by hand, and every Monday that it
wasn't raining was wash day.
</P>
<P>
   After Mom cooked a hearty breakfast of homemade biscuits,
country fried ham or sausage, gravy, grits, eggs and coffee for the
family, her wash day would get under way.
</P>
<P>
   My three brothers had the job of filling all of the galvanized
wash tubs and iron wash pots with water drawn from the well and
rounding up firewood to heat water in the iron pots.
</P>
<P>
   All beds were stripped, and the bedcovers hung outside for a
full day of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Washing for five children and two adults was hard work. Usually,
the wife of one of the laborers on the farm would help her.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were sorted as to white and colored. A flat stick
was used to beat the very dirty clothes which had been worn by the
men working in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were first scrubbed on a rub board and then boiled
in the wash pots. Homemade lye soap was added.
</P>
<P>
   Next, using the flat sticks, the clothes were carefully lifted
out of the boiling water and into buckets to be carried to the tubs
for a series of rinsing.
</P>
<P>
   After rinsing, the clothes had to be rung by hand, then put into
buckets and taken to the clothes lines where they were hung out to
dry.
</P>
<P>
   On wash day, every clothesline was used and even some low tree
branches. The whole yard was filled with clothes flapping in the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   On wash day, everybody had to watch the clouds. In case of a
quick shower, we all had to start grabbing the clothes off the
lines and trees.
</P>
<P>
   After they had dried, the next chore was to bring in the clothes
and make the beds. The fresh sheets smelled wonderful after being
in the sun all day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the clothes could be folded and put away, but a majority
of them had to be starched and ironed. You cooked the starch with
water and then strained it through a flour sack to remove the
lumps. Clothes were dipped into the starch and hung out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ironing. The clothes were sprinkled with water,
rolled up and placed in a flour sack to soak. Flat irons had to be
heated on a stove or fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ironing was practically a whole day's work in itself, and the
laborer's wife would take a share of the ironing to her house to
finish when she went home that night.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later electricity made its way through rural
Georgia, and wash day was never the same.

Steve said, describing the taste of freezer-burned cat. So how
about dog? He's had that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog has a unique flavor; you can't describe it unless you've
eaten it,'' says Steve, 48, a matter-of-fact, and yes, seemingly
sane, single Austin, Texas working man who has a drain- and
sewer-cleaning business called Econo-Rooter.
</P>
<P>
   The rat he ate disappointed Steve because it was so
unremarkable. ``The rats taste like beef. I thought it would be a
unique flavor, but it was just like beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve has a logical reason for his unusual dining approach. ``I
wanted to get over the psychological hang-ups of eating certain
foods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That skill will come in handy. In late November or early
December, Steve plans to launch a small, homemade 12-foot-by-5-foot
Fiberglas and polyurethane foam raft in the Atlantic Ocean off the
Canary Islands, near -- orthwest Africa, and take off across the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he'll be at sea for four months, and he's not taking
any food. He's planning on catching and eating raw fish. And
drinking fish juice and rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have a small sail to help propel the raft. But he'll be
depending on the winds and the currents to carry him from the
Canaries past Antigua, south of Jamaica, then north to Corpus
Christi, Texas _ a total of 5,000 miles, Steve estimates. Steve
plans to make the trip without making landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Steve is taking basic fishing gear _ line and hooks _ and he'll
have a trap for bait fish. But he won't be carrying ice or other
space-consuming amenities. His living space will be a
4-foot-by-6-foot rectangular hole, a foot deep, built into the
floor of the raft. He'll stretch a pup tent tarp over himself to
get out of the sun. And forget cooking materials. He's not taking
any. He'll be cutting up the fish and downing it raw or dried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just eat what you can eat and dry the rest,'' Steve said.
And the guy doesn't even particularly like sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least with sashimi, you've got some wasabi to go with it,''
said Steve, speaking of the hot, green Japanese mustard. But he is
taking along five gallons of water. ``I have to take my blood
pressure medication,'' Steve explained of the 5-gallon water
supply. Six months ago, he had a mini-stroke.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also be taking a small reverse osmosis pump, a unit that
turns seawater into small amounts of fresh water _ in case he comes
up short of rain or fish juice.
</P>
<P>
   Steve says his main concerns are getting flipped over by storms
and going six weeks without vitamin C, which could cause scurvy.
Instead of carrying vitamin C on the raft, he'll dangle a rope in
the water and grow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take about six weeks for the algae to start growing
on a polypropylene rope,'' Steve said. So he'll get his vitamin C
fix by eating algae.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steve Kurachi is not like most of us, he certainly
isn't a survivalist nut in the camouflage-wearing sense of the
word. He drives around town in a plain vanilla 1979 GMC van,
answering his cell phone with the words ``Econo-Rooter,'' then
going to people's homes to unclog their plumbing. He's good with
tools. He's building his raft in a friend's back yard in North
Austin. He works with the Boy Scouts. He's even shared his cat
jerky with them. Some kids have all the luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a survivalist would be a person who takes a drive at
night when it's cold and puts an extra blanket and a jacket in the
back seat,'' Steve said. ``I think people who wear camouflage and
get guns and shoot in the woods, that's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a pistol,'' said Mike Metschan, leader of Austin Boy
Scout Troop 35, who runs the troop with Steve's help. ``He will
keep crickets in his freezer. You never know when you might need a
cricket to eat. But he's a great guy. He's not overly aggressive.
He's mild-mannered. He would be great on that survival show that
was on TV. If we're going camping, especially if it's freezing,
Steve will be there. He's in his element.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no Survivalists' League covered by writers who keep
statistics. So much of this material can't be documented. But Steve
says the raft trip won't be his first venture into roughing it in
spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Steve says, he took off across the Atlantic Ocean from
the Canary Islands headed for Antigua on nine king-size,
air-inflated water-bed mattresses lashed together with rope. He
wanted to cross the ocean in a craft made out of common materials.
He says he made it 2,700 miles in two months before he gave up
about 350 miles northeast of Antigua. He had no sail. He depended
on Mother Nature to get him where he wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
   He took some food on that trip, but nothing elaborate. His daily
diet consisted of two large crackers, some bean paste and
Army-issue dessert MREs (meals ready to eat) _ ``like granola bars,
oatmeal bars and Corn Flake bars.'' But it was no picnic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of the nine water-bed mattresses popped,'' Steve said.
The sun and the elements got to them. Worrying about the last four
popping got to Steve. ``I was really stressed every time I lost a
mattress, so I only slept three hours a night,'' he said. ``I just
couldn't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those tight quarters. Steve was confined to one
of the water-bed mattresses. The others were along for flotation.
So he slept on top of one mattress _ carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``A water-bed mattress is flat, but when it's inflated, it's
like a balloon _ oval,'' Steve said. ``So if you roll one way or
another, you better be holding on to something or you'll roll off
into the water. I didn't roll off, but I was thrown off one night.
Around 1 in the morning, I was hit by a wave that was particularly
large.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he woke up about 5 feet in the air, upside down above
the water-bed mattress, then ended up in the drink. ``I slept at
night with my arms under the ropes to hold on after that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks out, a large seabird flew by and tried unsuccessfully
to land on one of the mattresses, striking terror in Steve. ``I was
afraid of his talons. So I was flapping a towel and yelling at him
for an hour or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the large fish _ he figures they were 25- to
35-pound mahi-mahi, although he never saw them _ that kept ramming
his craft at night. They were chasing bait fish under the water-bed
mattresses, and they'd end up crashing into the side of the
mattresses. ``It was like being hit by a baseball bat,'' Steve
said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve gave up the trip before he reached Antigua because he had
been praying and fasting, and he had a hunch he was supposed to
quit. So he set off his only means of communications _ an one-way
emergency signal called an Emergency Position Indicating Radio
Beacon. An Ecuadorean banana boat picked him up and took him to
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is when you get picked up by a boat, you go where
they go,'' Steve said. ``I had to take a bus through the war zone
to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does a person get into this sort of activity? Steve says
it was a matter of mouthing off when he was a student at McCallum
High School. ``When I was in high school, I used to tell people I
was going to row across the Atlantic. When I got to be 21, I
realized I was living my life as a blowhard. And that's when I
decided to build a boat and try.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Steve says, he tried to row from Wilmington, N.C., to
England in a 16-foot homemade dory. He gave up when he was blown
300 miles off course by a late winter storm. But he says he made it
1,250 miles to a position northeast of Bermuda before he stopped
rowing _ after 49 days at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Steve set off rowing in another small
homemade dory from St. John's, Newfoundland, bound for England
again. He didn't make it that time, either. The trip lasted a
couple of weeks before he called it quits after 250 miles. ``I
wasn't prepared for the extreme cold. I spent two months in bed and
a month on crutches because of my feet freezing.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the water-bed mattress adventure, Steve figures his
upcoming raft journey will be a piece of cake. ``I consider this
trip like going in a Cadillac instead of a Volkswagen, 'cause I've
got a place where I can lie down flat,'' Steve said. Instead of an
awkward-shaped, blown-up water-bed mattress, he'll be reclining on
a comparatively luxurious 2-foot-by-6-foot sheet of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   To get ready for the feel of it, Steve has been practicing
sleeping on hard surfaces. ``I have spent the last year sleeping
either on the floor or on a piece of plywood,'' he said. ``I have a
piece of plywood under the sheet on my bed. I've gotten to where I
like it. It looks like a normal bed, and I've gotten to where I
throw things on the bed and it goes clunk. I've got to stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   It will get boring out there, Steve admits. But there are mental
games you can play to keep your mind occupied. On the water-bed
mattress trip, Steve says, he built a house from the ground up in
his mind. ``I had to think of the steel and foundation and the
plumbing that went into it, because I didn't have any paper to
write on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This time he's taking a laptop computer powered by a couple of
marine gel batteries, so he can work on the book on survival he's
writing. It should be one helluva book.

 &HT;    Catching summer's last flight
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Monique has misplaced July. ``What happened to it?''
she demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day I've actually spent lounging at the
pool,'' another friend, Debbie, lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should have six months of summer, and six months of
school,'' my son proposed, counting off the days _ fewer now than
fingers _ till school starts.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like everybody's singing 'em, those end-of-summertime
blues. ``We did a lot, but there was no summer,'' Debbie said.
``Where did it all go?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Carnival-Cruise-not-taken that we're mourning. It's
the unstructured time. The time to goof off, to sleep in, to be
lazy.
</P>
<P>
   When we think of the way summer has become, the old lyrics,
``Those lazy, crazy, hazy days of summer,'' seem as quaint as that
maddening melody that reminds you of a polka band on uppers.
</P>
<P>
   Monique frets that she may have misplaced summer altogether.
``Was it really hot? Did I miss it?'' she asked. ``Because if I
did, I'm going to be really mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone assured her that she didn't miss the blistering heat _
there wasn't any, to speak of _ but she still knows that she missed
something: ``If I'm going to relax, it's going to be in the
summertime.'' This summer, it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   A moment ago it was May, and summer stretched before us,
tempting us like a brand-new book just waiting to cracked. Now,
August is flickering like the last fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   When we were kids, we faced each day like a downhill bike ride.
You careened through the day _ wheeeee! _ letting it take you where
it may: swimming at Crestwood pool, or finding the best hiding spot
during nightly games of hide-and-seek.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with both parents working, many of us are such
schedule-a-holics we feel compelled to plan and schedule our down
time _ which tends to take some of the spontaneity, not to mention
the relaxation, out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, a Sunday with no plans loomed on the calendar like
a mirage in the desert. A free day!
</P>
<P>
   With might and main, I resisted the urge to fill it. And I was
rewarded when a friend called out of the blue and wanted to see
West Side Story .
</P>
<P>
   My regrets for the summer are not for the plans I didn't make,
but for such unplanned indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   I regret that we didn't eat outside enough, didn't swat enough
flies while eating corn off the cob.
</P>
<P>
   I regret that the kids didn't run through the sprinkler enough,
didn't splash around enough in the backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   I regret that we didn't take enough evening strolls, enough bike
rides along the river.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want summer to end. Not until I've had my fill of BLTs,
of popsicles melted on the sidewalk, of drives on a country road
with the windows down in the long twilight. I want more yard
parties, more picnics, more time on the backyard chair-swing,
watching the kids play.
</P>
<P>
   As summer steals away from us, we try to wrest it back, try to
cram in as many poolside afternoons and drive-in evenings as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the summer, Debbie made a ``fun things to
do'' calendar. Now, frantically trying to check things off the
list, she finds herself haranguing the kids, ``Want to go out and
do something fun?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about we go home and relax?'' her son asked.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept. Kids know, far better than we do, that there
ain't no cure for the end-of-summertime blues.
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, just letting things happen.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Nation needs a uniform ruling on sticky issue of
affirmative action
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's neither fair nor constitutional when some American schools
can use race in school admissions and other schools cannot use
race.
</P>
<P>
   Only the U.S. Supreme Court can clear up this mess. The justices
should stop ducking lower court decisions striking down affirmative
action practices in America's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The latest monkey wrench to be tossed into the America's
affirmative action machinery came from a Georgia federal district
court ruling that said the University of Georgia's affirmative
action admission policy was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which had been making race-based admission
decisions to boost racial diversity on its campus, now has stopped
the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the university's regents are appealing the decision
to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. If the 11th circuit
upholds Judge Avant Edenfield's decision, all schools in Alabama,
Florida and Georgia will have to use race-free rules in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the club.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a
race-based admission policy once used by the University of Texas
Law School to increase black and Hispanic enrollment. The 5th
circuit court ruled that the law school's admission policy was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the 5th
circuit's ruling. Therefore, all the colleges and universities in
Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana had to stop using affirmative
action policies that used race as a factor for admission.
</P>
<P>
   These schools are at a disadvantage when they compete for
minority students who can accept race-based scholarships and
admissions from schools not under a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the
Boston Latin School's race-based affirmative action program was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Boston school board members first announced that they would
appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Then representatives of the
NAACP and other civil rights groups pleaded for the board members
to rescind their decision to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leaders argued that a Supreme Court ruling
against the celebrated school could shut down all race-based
affirmative action programs throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Latin School officials did an about-face. They voted
unanimously to live with the 1st Circuit Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens of California can't complain that their colleges
and universities cannot compete on a level playing field for
minority students. They gave referendum approval to Proposition
209, an anti-affirmative action proposal that forbids race-based
admission decisions for California colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court rejected hearing a challenge to Proposition
209, which prohibits discrimination in state programs based on
``race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin,'' language that
tracks the wording used in the Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional provision that requires ``equal protection of
the laws'' was used to abolish the South's Jim Crow laws that gave
race-based preference to white people. Now lower-court rulings
across the nation are using the same arguments to strike down
race-based affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a given that colleges across America need to have
diverse student bodies that reflect the society they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges in Texas and California have shown that extra effort
without using race as a factor can boost minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unfair, however, for colleges to compete for racial
and gender diversity in their schools while using different rules.
The Supreme Court needs to settle this matter.

<P>
   Q: Much has been written about the Confederate submarine Hunley,
which was raised recently from Charleston harbor. Where did it get
its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hunley took its name from Horace Lawson Hunley of New
Orleans, who gave not only his name, but also his fortune and life,
to the world's first successful wartime submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Hunley was deputy collector of Customs in New Orleans, as well
as a wealthy lawyer, planter, merchant and legislator. As the Web
site of the organization Friends of the Hunley explains, in the
early months of the Civil War he had realized the importance of
keeping the supply lines with Europe open ``in a way which few in
the new Confederacy understood.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late fall of 1861, Horace Hunley joined two inventors,
James McClintock and Baxter Watson, to begin construction of a
vessel that would travel underwater. In July 1863, the inventors'
third ``submarine boat'' was under construction. It would be named
the H.L. Hunley.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Hunley died when the submarine named for him was trapped
accidentally on the bottom of Charleston harbor on Oct. 15, 1863.
It was one of several times the sub sank. The final time was on
Feb. 17, his second tour was with the Marines).
</P>
<P>
   John Chafee (R-R.I.), one of two senators to die during the
current Congress, was a Marine veteran of World War II and the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Boy Scouts participating in opening
ceremonies at the Democratic National Convention were booed and
heckled. True? If so, what were the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported by the Los Angeles Times, the scouts were booed
by some of the 434 members of the California delegates while they
were leading the conventioneers in the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The Boy Scouts don't allow openly gay leaders, and
their presence onstage didn't sit well with some of the gay and
lesbian delegates. ``It's such an affront,'' said Assemblywoman
Carole Midgen of San Francisco. ``Wer Tucson, Ariz., where it had
been since retirement in September 1946.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight's two-hour ``Survivor'' finale beginning at 8 will have
a different format from the first 12 episodes, according to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   First, there will be no reward challenges, the contests that
have been held for a night on a luxury yacht, a phone call home or
a slice of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The four remaining players will compete for an immunity
challenge and then there will be a tribal council vote, eliminating
one.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a 2-2 tie vote (which has been rumored, but CBS
would not confirm), there will be no re-vote. In a tie, the person
who has accumulated the most negative votes in all tribal councils
will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be an immunity challenge among the three final
players, followed by another tribal council.
</P>
<P>
   One of the immunity challenges is reportedly a trivia contest
about the other players.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, there will be two finalists. The last seven
players voted off the island will form a jury, and they will vote
who will be the winner of the $1 million prize. The final two will
present arguments as to why they should win.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-hour finale, CBS will air a one-hour live special,
``Survivor: The Reunion,'' with all 16 castaways in a Los Angeles
studio talking about the show. Bryant Gumbel hosts.
</P>
<P>

   It started May 31 as a summer fill-in; it ends tonight, 12 weeks
later, as a summer phenom. Here's an episode-by-episode look at how
the legacy and the lunacy grew:

technology), tribe cooks dog food (beats larvae), Gervase and Joel
turn chauvinist. S'long, Joel.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers: 24.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Episode 7
</P>
<P>
   Down to single, 10-castaway tribe. Richard's alliance _ Rudy's
in _ flexes Popeye-sized muscle. Gretchen's a goner.

</P>
<P>
   Episode 8
</P>
<P>
   Off-island hijinks: CBS Web site mistakenly posts that night's
episode summary in afternoon, revealing Greg is toast. He is.
Hacker claims he invaded site to learn Gervase is the
million-dollar survivor (see Episode 10).

</P>
<P>

   It's ``Lord of the Flies'' now. Kelly rues evil alliance
membership (``I feel like Luke Skywalker,'' she says of Richard
luring her to Dark Side). Gervase's girlfriend has baby. He

</P>
<P>
   Viewers: 27.4 million.
</P>
<P>

is bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers: 28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Episode 12
</P>
<P>
   Finally, mud wrestling: five survivors roll in volcanic mud pit
for reward challenge. Kelly wins beer, then wins immunity
challenge. No more Sean. Sighs Richard, ``This maintaining some
kind of a thumb on all these peoples' personalities that I care
very little about is exhausting.'' For him? Or us?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers: 28.7 million.

   FOOD-SMOKED _ About 10 years ago I cooked in a restaurant where
the owner, perhaps unwisely, encouraged me to indulge in whatever

out of the kitchen. (Kessler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   TEEN-VEGETARIAN _ I have a young friend who decided to become a
vegetarian when she was in high school. But after sharing many
meals with her family, I began to jokingly refer to her as a
pastatarian. So many young vegetarians -- and some older ones, too
-- use the term to distinguish what they don't eat not what they
do. Families with teenage vegetarians may want to check out a new
book by Lauren Butts, a 16-year-old Oregon girl who has gathered
her favorite recipes for such favorites as wraps, pizzas,
``burgers'' and more in the ideal guidebook for the teenage
vegetarian. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   WRIGHT-LIKE _ ATLANTA _ Talk to Stephen Dull and Bill Baites
about their renovation, and within minutes the inevitable occurs:
The house repeatedly is referred to as if it were a Frank Lloyd
Wright. Wright this, Wright that _ which is not right. Well, not
entirely anyhow. The postwar Prairie Style house in Collier Hills
was designed in 1960 by Atlanta architect Robert Green, who was one
of Wright's last apprentices. But the pride these homeowners take
in its design _ and recent award-winning preservation _ could not
be greater had the 20th-century master drawn the plans himself.

   NUTS-BOLTS-COLUMN _ Most people have houses full of natural wood
furnishings, but very few people are completely sure about how to

wood over time. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 25. WITH PHOTO.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What state has been the birthplace of the most presidents? In
what states have no presidents been born?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. 1 is Virginia, birthplace of George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison,
John Tyler, Zachary Taylor and Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   States where no presidents have been born: Alabama, Alaska,
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho,
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When all was said and done, was there a profit or loss in the
Atlanta Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Atlanta Olympics broke even and the Atlanta Committee for
the Olympic Games dissolved last year. Although Olympics organizers
originally had projected a $150 million surplus, much of it to fund
amateur athletics in the city, they failed to meet that goal. In
the end, they raised and spent $1.7 billion in private funds to
stage the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently turned 50 and immediately thereafter received an
application from AARP. Where did they get my name?
</P>
<P>
   A: AARP acquires names for promotional mailings from various
sources, including public records and large compiled lists of
people believed to be at least 50, a spokeswoman for the
organization told Q&AMP;A. Such lists include, but aren't limited to,
names of magazine subscribers, mail order catalog buyers, survey
respondents, and donors to charities. Public records are the ones
most likely to have a person's age recorded, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about the Hughes Glomar Explorer? It was
a ship financed by Howard Hughes that attempted to raise a sunken
Soviet submarine in, as I recall, the late '60s. Did anyone
consider using it to attempt to rescue the Russians trapped aboard
the submarine Kursk?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the subject of the Glomar Explorer came up in a Defense
Department briefing Aug. 16, nothing conclusive was determined
about its whereabouts or whether it was still a functional salvage
ship.
</P>
<P>
   At last report _ and that was in December 1990 _ the vessel was
among scores of rusting old ships mothballed in a ``ghost fleet''
in an inland bay northeast of San Francisco. If it's still there,
there would have been no way to move it to the Barents Sea in time
to have helped with the Kursk disaster, even if it had been in good
enough shape to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   The Glomar Explorer dates to the cloak-and-dagger era between
the United States and the Soviet Union. It was commissioned in 1973
by the CIA with a cover story that its purpose was to seek undersea
mineral deposits. It was learned later that the ship actually was
designed and built to search for a sunken Soviet submarine off
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Glomar Explorer found its quarry, an accident
during the lifting operation in 1975 caused the hulk of the Russian
sub to break apart, resulting in the loss of a critical portion of
the boat, its nuclear missiles and codes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Leona Helmsley, the so-called ``queen of
mean,'' since she got out of prison? Is she still living?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, she's still living. The latest news in the life of the
80-year-old Helmsley, as reported last month by the New York Post,
is that she's planning to marry. Her beau is said to be Roger
Watkins, 50, a project manager with a New York
construction-management and engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   Helmsley has been married three times, while Watkins has been
married twice. Her last husband, Harry Helmsley, a billionaire New
York real estate developer, died in 1997. He had numerous hotels
whose advertising featured his wife as a ``queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Leona Helmsley was indicted and convicted of tax fraud in 1989,
and served 21 months in prison. It was during her 25-year marriage
to Harry Helmsley that her temper, tax-cheating and knack for
searing, headline-grabbing lines like ``only little people pay
taxes,'' earned her the moniker ``queen of mean.'' It was a title
``she has relished,'' according to the Post report.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the reporting about the West Nile virus, I haven't
seen any mention of the symptoms. What are they? And is it fatal to
humans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most people infected with West Nile virus will have no
symptoms or may have a mild flu-like illness with a fever, headache
and body aches before they recover, according to the Public Health
Division of the Georgia Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   In some individuals, particularly the elderly, the virus can
cause a serious illness called encephalitis, which is an
inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of encephalitis may include
high fever, severe headache, nausea, stiff neck, confusion, muscle
weakness, coma and _only in rare cases _ death.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur five to 15 days after the bite of an
infected mosquito. There's no specific treatment, medication or
cure for illnesses caused by West Nile virus. And there's no
vaccine to protect humans or animals against West Nile virus
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Information online:
www.ph.dhr.state.ga.us/epi/news/resources/westnile-info.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that North Korea is one of seven countries
branded by the U.S. State Department as a sponsor of terrorism.
What are the other six?
</P>
<P>
   A: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will become of the six-million-plus tires that have been
recalled as being unsafe?
</P>
<P>
   A: They will be disposed of ``according to the applicable laws
and in an environmentally sound manner,'' said Walt Sharp of
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. He didn't elaborate, but noted that
there are many uses for used tires, including recycling into new
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the Republican National Convention, Tom Brokaw
interviewed someone who referred to ``that famous 40th birthday
party'' of George W. Bush's, after which Bush decided to quit
drinking. If the birthday party was so famous, why have we never
heard about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no secrecy involved. Bush, 54, has often told of how
he quit drinking after his 40th birthday, and it has been widely
reported. Just last month, for instance, the New York Times
mentioned the party in a lengthy front-page article titled ``How
Bush Came to Tame His Inner Scamp.''
</P>
<P>
   As reported, George and Laura Bush went with a half-dozen
friends in July 1986 to celebrate their collective 40th birthdays
at the Broadmoor resort in Colorado. There was one evening when
they all stayed up late, drinking a bit too merrily.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Bush has recalled, he woke up feeling
befuddled, and quietly resolved that he would never touch alcohol
again. Friends say he told nobody, not even his wife, until weeks
after their return to their home in Midland, Texas. He simply drank
sodas instead of beers, and it was many weeks later that he finally
explained to his friends that he had given up liquor. He also has
credited a conversation with Rev. Billy Graham as a factor in his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Bush once again publicly acknowledged his
hard-drinking past in a session with a group of young people at
Teen Challenges of the Midlands, a drug-treatment facility near Des
Moines, Iowa. ``I'm on a walk. And it's a never-ending walk as far
as I'm concerned. . . . I used to drink too much and I quit
drinking. I want you to know that your life's walk is shared by a
lot of other people, even some who wear suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, incidentally, says he never considered himself an
alcoholic.

<P>
   Q: Much has been written about the Confederate submarine Hunley,
which was raised recently from Charleston harbor. Where did it get
its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Hunley took its name from Horace Lawson Hunley of New
Orleans, who gave not only his name, but also his fortune and life,
to the world's first successful wartime submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Hunley was deputy collector of Customs in New Orleans, as well
as a wealthy lawyer, planter, merchant and legislator. As the Web
site of the organization Friends of the Hunley explains, in the
early months of the Civil War he had realized the importance of
keeping the supply lines with Europe open ``in a way which few in
the new Confederacy understood.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late fall of 1861, Horace Hunley joined two inventors,
James McClintock and Baxter Watson, to begin construction of a
vessel that would travel underwater. In July 1863, the inventors'
third ``submarine boat'' was under construction. It would be named
the H.L. Hunley.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Hunley died when the submarine named for him was trapped
accidentally on the bottom of Charleston harbor on Oct. 15, 1863.
It was one of several times the sub sank. The final time was on
Feb. 17, 1864, when it rammed the federal sloop-of-war USS
Housatonic, which was blockading the harbor. All nine members of
the Hunley's crew died. Five Union sailors aboard the Housatonic
also died.
</P>
<P>
   Information online: www.hunley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand there's a Web site that will set your computer
time automatically. Do you know that address?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is one of several such sites:
http://tucows.cybersouth.com/sync95.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sens. Max Cleland and Bob Kerrey led a tribute to America's
veterans Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention. It was
mentioned in a TV interview that six senators served in Vietnam.
Who are the other four?
</P>
<P>
   A: In addition to Democrats Cleland of Georgia and Kerrey of
Nebraska, the others are Republicans Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and
John McCain of Arizona; and Democrats John Kerry of Massachusetts
and Charles Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In addition to Republican Strom Thurmond of South Carolina
and Democrat Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, are there any other current
senators who served in World War II and/or the Korean War?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, quite a few. These members of the current Senate served
in the military during World War II, according to Betty Koed,
assistant Senate historian: Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), Army; Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.), Navy; Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), Army; Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Army; Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), Navy;
William Roth (R-Del.), Army; Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), Army Air
Corps; and John Warner (R-Va.), Navy. Inouye and Thurmond served in
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   These members served in the Korean War: Ben Nighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Air Force; and Warner (his second tour was with the
Marines).
</P>
<P>
   John Chafee (R-R.I.), one of two senators to die during the
current Congress, was a Marine veteran of World War II and the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Boy Scouts participating in opening
ceremonies at the Democratic National Convention were booed and
heckled. True? If so, what were the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported by the Los Angeles Times, the scouts were booed
by some of the 434 members of the California delegates while they
were leading the conventioneers in the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The Boy Scouts don't allow openly gay leaders, and
their presence onstage didn't sit well with some of the gay and
lesbian delegates. ``It's such an affront,'' said Assemblywoman
Carole Midgen of San Francisco. ``We're going to pursue who made
this decision (to allow the scouts to participate) and why, and
make sure it doesn`t happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jeri Dilno, a lesbian delegate from San Diego,
disputed news reports that delegates booed the scouts. She also
told the San Diego Union-Tribune that the delegates meant no
disrespect. ``Our intent was to remain respectful and not embarrass
the young people that were up there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Union-Tribune item, the scouts themselves
reportedly couldn't hear the booing in the noisy Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several weeks ago that a Blue Hawaiian
helicopter had crashed on Maui. Was the cause ever determined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The twin-engine AS-355 tour helicopter dropped suddenly
before crashing in a remote area of Maui's Iao Valley on July 21,
killing the pilot and six tourists aboard, according to a report
issued by the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   While the report didn't list an official cause, it said poor
weather conditions had been noted in the crash area. Three other
pilots from Blue Hawaiian Helicopters flying within two miles of
the accident site at the time of the crash modified their tour
routes to avoid the area because of inclement weather, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter involved in the crash dropped 600 feet in 19
seconds before slamming into a mountainside, the NTSB report said.
Gilbert Dela Cruz, manager of Rotor Wing Hawaii, a Honolulu repair
company, told the Associated Press that a rapid drop is not
uncommon. He said that if a pilot saw a bank of clouds, he might
want to ``get it down and dive.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather is significant in helicopter crashes, he said, adding
that an area can appear to be open, but winds can move clouds
quickly in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Savannah, Ga., was the birthplace of the cotton
gin. But when I was growing up in New Haven, Conn., I remember
being told by teachers and my family that Eli Whitney invented it
there. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first of Whitney's cotton gins was developed in Savannah.
He had gone there in 1792 from New Haven, after graduating from
Yale, to teach and study law, but found on arrival that someone
else had taken the teaching job he expected to get. He then met
Catherine Littlefield Greene, widow of Revolutionary War hero
Nathaniel Greene, who invited him to be her guest while he studied
law.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story, guests were discussing greenseed cotton
one evening and said they couldn't grow it profitably because of
the time it took to clean. Knowing that Whitney possessed
impressive inventive and mechanical skills, Mrs. Greene told the
others that he could make a machine to clean it _ and by April 1793
he had built the first cotton gin.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, Whitney had obtained a patent for his
invention and moved back to New Haven. With the financial backing
of a partner, Phineas Miller, he began to make cotton gins.
</P>
<P>
   So while the first machine was built in Savannah, further
development was in New Haven. Other manufacturers, too, copied
Whitney's idea, so there was more than one early cotton gin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two U.S. aircraft dropped atomic bombs on Japan to hasten the
end of World War II. We know about the Enola Gay, its pilot, and
the location of the airplane today. What was the name of the plane
that bombed Nagasaki? Who was its pilot, and where is that plane
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: The plane was a B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar (sometimes
written as Bock's Car), but in either case the name was derived
from that of Capt. Frederick C. Bock, the plane's primary pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But Bockscar was piloted by Maj. Charles Sweeney, along with 1st
Lt. Charles D. Albury, 2nd Lt. Fred Olivi and a crew of 10 others,
when it flew from Tinian Island in the Marianas and dropped a
plutonium bomb over Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is on display at the U.S. Air Force Museum at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. It was flown there
in September 1961 from the desert storage facility at David-Monthan
Field near Tucson, Ariz., where it had been since retirement in
September 1946.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What state has been the birthplace of the most presidents? In
what states have no presidents been born?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. 1 is Virginia, birthplace of George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison,
John Tyler, Zachary Taylor and Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   States where no presidents have been born: Alabama, Alaska,
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho,
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When all was said and done, was there a profit or loss in the
Atlanta Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Atlanta Olympics broke even and the Atlanta Committee for
the Olympic Games dissolved last year. Although Olympics organizers
originally had projected a $150 million surplus, much of it to fund
amateur athletics in the city, they failed to meet that goal. In
the end, they raised and spent $1.7 billion in private funds to
stage the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently turned 50 and immediately thereafter received an
application from AARP. Where did they get my name?
</P>
<P>
   A: AARP acquires names for promotional mailings from various
sources, including public records and large compiled lists of
people believed to be at least 50, a spokeswoman for the
organization told Q&AMP;A. Such lists include, but aren't limited to,
names of magazine subscribers, mail order catalog buyers, survey
respondents, and donors to charities. Public records are the ones
most likely to have a person's age recorded, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know anything about the Hughes Glomar Explorer? It was
a ship financed by Howard Hughes that attempted to raise a sunken
Soviet submarine in, as I recall, the late '60s. Did anyone
consider using it to attempt to rescue the Russians trapped aboard
the submarine Kursk?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the subject of the Glomar Explorer came up in a Defense
Department briefing Aug. 16, nothing conclusive was determined
about its whereabouts or whether it was still a functional salvage
ship.
</P>
<P>
   At last report _ and that was in December 1990 _ the vessel was
among scores of rusting old ships mothballed in a ``ghost fleet''
in an inland bay northeast of San Francisco. If it's still there,
there would have been no way to move it to the Barents Sea in time
to have helped with the Kursk disaster, even if it had been in good
enough shape to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   The Glomar Explorer dates to the cloak-and-dagger era between
the United States and the Soviet Union. It was commissioned in 1973
by the CIA with a cover story that its purpose was to seek undersea
mineral deposits. It was learned later that the ship actually was
designed and built to search for a sunken Soviet submarine off
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Glomar Explorer found its quarry, an accident
during the lifting operation in 1975 caused the hulk of the Russian
sub to break apart, resulting in the loss of a critical portion of
the boat, its nuclear missiles and codes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Leona Helmsley, the so-called ``queen of
mean,'' since she got out of prison? Is she still living?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, she's still living. The latest news in the life of the
80-year-old Helmsley, as reported last month by the New York Post,
is that she's planning to marry. Her beau is said to be Roger
Watkins, 50, a project manager with a New York
construction-management and engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   Helmsley has been married three times, while Watkins has been
married twice. Her last husband, Harry Helmsley, a billionaire New
York real estate developer, died in 1997. He had numerous hotels
whose advertising featured his wife as a ``queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Leona Helmsley was indicted and convicted of tax fraud in 1989,
and served 21 months in prison. It was during her 25-year marriage
to Harry Helmsley that her temper, tax-cheating and knack for
searing, headline-grabbing lines like ``only little people pay
taxes,'' earned her the moniker ``queen of mean.'' It was a title
``she has relished,'' according to the Post report.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the reporting about the West Nile virus, I haven't
seen any mention of the symptoms. What are they? And is it fatal to
humans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most people infected with West Nile virus will have no
symptoms or may have a mild flu-like illness with a fever, headache
and body aches before they recover, according to the Public Health
Division of the Georgia Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   In some individuals, particularly the elderly, the virus can
cause a serious illness called encephalitis, which is an
inflammation of the brain. Symptoms of encephalitis may include
high fever, severe headache, nausea, stiff neck, confusion, muscle
weakness, coma and _only in rare cases _ death.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur five to 15 days after the bite of an
infected mosquito. There's no specific treatment, medication or
cure for illnesses caused by West Nile virus. And there's no
vaccine to protect humans or animals against West Nile virus
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Information online:
www.ph.dhr.state.ga.us/epi/news/resources/westnile-info.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that North Korea is one of seven countries
branded by the U.S. State Department as a sponsor of terrorism.
What are the other six?
</P>
<P>
   A: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will become of the six-million-plus tires that have been
recalled as being unsafe?
</P>
<P>
   A: They will be disposed of ``according to the applicable laws
and in an environmentally sound manner,'' said Walt Sharp of
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. He didn't elaborate, but noted that
there are many uses for used tires, including recycling into new
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the Republican National Convention, Tom Brokaw
interviewed someone who referred to ``that famous 40th birthday
party'' of George W. Bush's, after which Bush decided to quit
drinking. If the birthday party was so famous, why have we never
heard about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no secrecy involved. Bush, 54, has often told of how
he quit drinking after his 40th birthday, and it has been widely
reported. Just last month, for instance, the New York Times
mentioned the party in a lengthy front-page article titled ``How
Bush Came to Tame His Inner Scamp.''
</P>
<P>
   As reported, George and Laura Bush went with a half-dozen
friends in July 1986 to celebrate their collective 40th birthdays
at the Broadmoor resort in Colorado. There was one evening when
they all stayed up late, drinking a bit too merrily.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Bush has recalled, he woke up feeling
befuddled, and quietly resolved that he would never touch alcohol
again. Friends say he told nobody, not even his wife, until weeks
after their return to their home in Midland, Texas. He simply drank
sodas instead of beers, and it was many weeks later that he finally
explained to his friends that he had given up liquor. He also has
credited a conversation with Rev. Billy Graham as a factor in his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Bush once again publicly acknowledged his
hard-drinking past in a session with a group of young people at
Teen Challenges of the Midlands, a drug-treatment facility near Des
Moines, Iowa. ``I'm on a walk. And it's a never-ending walk as far
as I'm concerned. . . . I used to drink too much and I quit
drinking. I want you to know that your life's walk is shared by a
lot of other people, even some who wear suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, incidentally, says he never considered himself an
alcoholic.

 &HT;    Who will win? Gauging the odds on `Survivor'
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera and Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They began as 16 and now they are a quartet, ready to treat
America to a chorus of four-part disharmony. Here's the lowdown on
the ``Survivor'' Final Four:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Richard Hatch, 39, Rhode Island corporate trainer.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: The man with a plan. Manipulative, openly gay,
makes Machiavelli look like Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable moments: Going nekkid, doing a victory dance when he
won an immunity challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Who plays him in the movie? Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Why he'll win: Remember that conniving, back-stabbing colleague
who got an undeserved promotion and nobody could figure out why?
That's Richard, the Miles Drentell of Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   Why he'll lose: The island's most despised resident. If it comes
down between him and anybody (with the possible exception of
Susan), he loses.
</P>
<P>
   Chances: His naked ambition works against him. Except ... he may
have one last trick up his sleeve (if he had a sleeve).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kelly Wigles-
</P>
<P>
   worth, 23, Nevada river guide.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: Waffling lucky duck.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable moment: Boasting that she would clobber landlubber
Gervase in a canoe race, then losing.
</P>
<P>
   Who plays her in the movie? Sandra Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Why she'll win: Everything's going her way. Every time she was
about to be booted, she won the immunity challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Why she'll lose: No one can be this lucky for that long.
</P>
<P>
   Chances: 50-50. If she's immunized until the final two, probably
beats Richard or Susan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rudy Boesch, 72, ex-Navy SEAL from Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: Scrappy, politically incorrect old coot.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable moment: Spreading suntan oil on Richard's back,
although he's wondered what his Navy friends would say about his
having a gay friend.
</P>
<P>
   Who plays him in the movie? Richard Farnsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Why he'll win: Went from being the island's biggest irritant to
sentimental choice when paired with almost anybody who's left.
</P>
<P>
   Why he'll lose: After a month in the sun, can barely remember
his own name.
</P>
<P>
   Chances: Consensus favorite. After surviving early attempts to
exile him, has flown under radar while the rest picked each other
off. Crazy like a fox.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Susan Hawk, 39, Wisconsin truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: Blue-collar brawler, future WWF calendar girl.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable moment: Probed by ``Tiki Jeff'' Probst at a tribal
council, she says, ``Alliance? What alliance? Who, me?''
</P>
<P>
   Who plays her in the movie? Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   Why she'll win: Tough, insensitive, untrustworthy schemer.
</P>
<P>
   Why she'll lose: Tough, insensitive, untrustworthy schemer.
</P>
<P>
   Chances: Could be the dark horse behind Rudy, if she can
outmaneuver Richard.

</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ The latest monkey wrench to be tossed into the
America's affirmative action machinery came from a Georgia federal
district court ruling that said the University of Georgia's
affirmative action admission policy was unconstitutional. The
university, which had been making race-based admission decisions to
boost racial diversity on its campus, now has stopped the practice.

</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ When I was a little girl during the '30s, we
lived on a farm in rural Georgia and had no electricity. All chores
had to be done by hand, and every Monday that it wasn't raining was
wash day. After Mom cooked a hearty breakfast of homemade biscuits,
country fried ham or sausage, gravy, grits, eggs and coffee for the
family, her wash day would get under way. (Joe Murray, Cox News

   TEEN-VEGETARIAN _ I have a young friend who decided to become a
vegetarian when she was in high school. But after sharing many
meals with her family, I began to jokingly refer to her as a
pastatarian. So many young vegetarians -- and some older ones, too
-- use the term to distinguish what they don't eat not what they
do. Families with teenage vegetarians may want to check out a new

FOR ASPIRING CELEBS, INTERNET PROVIDING A SECRET PASSAGE TO FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MALCOLM MAYHEW   
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Danni Ashe's own words, she was once just another
``big-breasted nude model.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she's a big-breasted nude model _ with 840 million
downloads to her credit, making her the most downloaded woman in
history.
</P>
<P>
   You may not know her.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Internet, she's a star.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for Matt Drudge, an online journalist who has made a
name for himself for his often unsubstantiated scoops in the
political world; Apollo Smile, a New York-based pop
singer/actress/live-action hero who is currently negotiating a TV
series; and Cindy Margolis, a onetime cyberspace pinup who does
have her own syndicated TV show, ``The Cindy Margolis Show.''
</P>
<P>
   They're all Internet celebrities: Actors, writers and musicians
who created their own stages when they created their own Web sites.
Their audience _ Net surfers _ expands every time a new Net user
logs on.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercelebs such as these have created an alternate universe in
which status is judged by how many hits a day their site receives.
More hits, obviously, means more people are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   None of these performers had made much headway in the
entertainment business the traditional way. But the Internet
provided a secret passage to fame and success that allowed them to
bypass all the middlemen: the agents, the managers, the red tape,
the unanswered prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you gotta do is go out and buy a $500 computer, some
software and a book, and you could become (a celebrity),'' says
Gregg Wetterman, president of the Dallas Internet Society and
founder of online community GeekMeet.com. ``It doesn't have to be
some flashy, wonderful site. It just has to have a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetterman points out that Drudge's site (drudgenews.com) is not
spectacular, just intriguing. ``It's about as simple as you can
get, you know, a whole lot of text,'' he says. ``But he found a
niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Knowles did, too. Paralyzed from the waist down four years
ago in a work-related accident, the Austin-based Knowles killed
time while recuperating by building his own entertainment-news
site, aintitcool.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the site receives more than 10 million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it started off as something to keep my mind off
depressing topics, like, my legs not working,'' says Knowles, 28.
``After I started doing it, I thought, `This might be my life,
better figure out how to do it.' So I started updating it daily,
which meant a lot of research and work. After two or three months,
I started getting connections with film producers and others in the
industry. Now we've got people in China writing for us. It's like,
`Holy crap, I did this out of my bedroom?'''
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif., rock band Red Delicious also stumbled onto
luck via the Internet. A year ago, the group submitted material to
music Web site MP3.com. At the height of a music-downloading
explosion, the site prominently featured the band's music, leading
to major label interest and media coverage in magazines such as
Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a key factor in the success we've had,'' says the
band's keyboardist Rob King, who says the pop-rock group is
currently in negotiations with a major label. ``It's just getting
that buzz going, and you have to have something good and unique.
Once you have that, you can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilge Ebiri, entertainment editor for Yahoo Internet Life
magazine, says Internet celebrities haven't necessarily altered the
face of pop culture as much as they have thrown it into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already a celebrity-driven culture, but the Net has
really hastened it,'' he says. ``We're always looking for the next
big thing, and the Internet is full of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebiri says the Internet has even turned the least likeliest
candidate for the spotlight into a household name. He cites Mahir
Cagri, a Turkish man whose site momentarily caught on with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just this guy who had a home page who was, I guess,
trying to meet women from other countries,'' Ebiri says. ``But
Americans discovered his page, and he became a minor celebrity.
David Letterman had a guy on his show for a while, pretending to be
him. Whenever I would mention I was Turkish, people would ask me,
`Do you know Mahir?' Even more so than Drudge or Cindy (Margolis),
Mahir sort of symbolizes what the Internet can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has certainly done major things for Margolis, a
one-time model who now, thanks to an enormous amount of word of
mouth about her site, has her own late-night TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's somebody who owes all of her celebrity to the Net,''
Ebiri says. ``Very few people were aware of who she was a few years
ago. It seems like she came out of nowhere. People on the Net knew
who she was. People who weren't online didn't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are several advantages to being an Internet celebrity,
cybercelebs say, the dominant one being you have the freedom to
control your career. Many performers feel like they never get a
fair chance going through established channels in the entertainment
industry. They can't get in front of the top agents or producers,
and so they are frozen out of the business without ever getting an
opportunity to show what they can do. Or, if they do land an agent
or manager, they often have to compromise their vision for their
career or sign away potentially valuable rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changes all that _ it provides a venue for
performers to go directly to a large audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can actually take control of my life and my own image and
start profiting from my name,'' says model Danni Ashe, who has her
own site (danni.com) and her own online business. ``You model for
$500 a day, you sign away all your rights. The people who own your
image can do anything they want with it. It traps a lot of women.
What the Internet allows us to do is build a name and notoriety,
then be in control of our careers. It's incredibly empowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Apollo Smile, a New York-based actress and singer, says another
advantage of Internet celeb status is that it's easier to keep your
integrity intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, is a big deal, keeping your integrity,'' she
says. ``You can protect yourself on the Internet, because you're
the one in control of things. You can stay solid in the vision you
have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Apollo, like other Internet celebrities, is certainly not
opposed to gaining mainstream attention. And agents, networks and
studios are beginning to use the Internet as a sort of minor
leagues, picking up popular Net performers for TV or movie work.
Apollo is currently negotiating for a TV-series deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we want to do, expand our horizons,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as easy as setting up a Web site, though. Making it as
a cyberceleb can be a crap shoot, too _ even becoming an online
celebrity is no guarantee that you'll be able to make a living.
Luck and marketing are just as important online as off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to get lost,'' Ebiri says. ``Or to never be
found. It's a giant cacophony out there. There are millions of Web
pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as pop culture often tires of movie stars and musicians,
Ebiri says, we can easily grow weary of online personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you achieve a certain amount of celebrity on the Net, it
can get deafening,'' he says. ``That's kind of what's happened to
Drudge. We're sick and tired of hearing about him, but he's managed
to remain relevant because he does a certain amount of journalism.
His luster has faded, though, so there's often an expiration date
on (Internet celebrities), but that doesn't mean that someone who
builds their celebrity on the Net won't last as long.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles says the key to his success has been in the pacing of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved very slowly,'' he says. ``Two years ago, there were
TV offers that didn't allow me any control and book offers and
such. When we go to make those next steps, we want to make sure
everything is in place, that we're not making any hasty decisions,
because the Internet is just another medium, and you have to treat
it like that. You always have people who become famous out of any
new invention. It's not like the Internet is going to get rid of
movies or magazines. It just adds to them.''

AUCTIONING SECOND-HAND DOMAINS GIVES RISE TO ANOTHER INTERNET 
MARKET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet address www.flu.com is for sale, and its sellers
think it is worth $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The address does not lead to a World Wide Web site, and it never
has. Its estimated value seems to arise mostly because such an
easy-to-remember destination is available for sale at all.
</P>
<P>
   Because flu.com and virtually all of the other catchy Web
addresses ending in ``.com'' have already been claimed, the value
of such unused names has risen sharply. Into this speculative field
have come a growing number of companies that have built businesses
just by helping owners resell the names they no longer want or
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole market is shifting; it's now all about the secondary
market,'' said Jeff Tinsley, chief executive of GreatDomains.com, a
Los Angeles company that is one of the largest resellers of names.
``All the best names are bought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Original domain name registrations once all cost $35 a year.
That lasted, for the most part, until this year, when Network
Solutions Inc., which had a monopoly on registrations, lost its
government contract. Now, more than 50 companies compete to
register addresses, new and old, and the rivalry has driven prices
as low as $8.
</P>
<P>
   But for the best generic and catchy domain names, prices are
soaring. Early this year, several domain names sold for
astronomical amounts _ business.com for $7.5 million, loans.com for
$3 million and beauty.com for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The appraisers of flu.com evidently considered those sales when
setting their asking price June 28. Since 1995, the address has
belonged to Procter &AMP; Gamble Inc., which registered hundreds of
similar generic names like beautiful.com and scent.com. After five
years, the company has realized that it does not need so many
generic domain names. So it decided to sell them, using
GreatDomains.com to supervise the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we acquired these names, we acted to procure anything
that was potentially useful for Procter &AMP; Gamble,'' explained Terri
Carrick, a spokeswoman for the company, which is keeping domains
for its brand-name products, like Crest.com and Pringles.com. Now,
though, company officials realize that these unneeded names can be
worth money.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains has more than 1 million domain names for resale on
its site. The other leading reseller, Afternic.com, based in New
York, has just more than 250,000. Most sales are for ``com'' domain
names, but ``net'' and ``org'' names are also available, and some
companies are auctioning names with two-letter country codes, like
.tv for the tiny nation of Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Network Solutions, the one-time monopoly, launched
its own forum for reselling domain names. The company says it will
not charge either buyers or sellers a handling fee or a commission.
It hopes instead that the traffic the forum brings to the site will
generate customers for its other services, like domain-name
appraisals and Internet starter kits that include Web site design
and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, registering a name was plenty,'' said
Christopher Clough, a vice president of communications for Network
Solutions. ``It was enough to fulfill demand. It was fresh, novel
and important. But that was two years ago. Today, it is literally
not enough, because there is a very interesting dynamic happening
in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic is the rise of resellers like GreatDomains.com and
Afternic.com, which both charge a commission. At GreatDomains,
where 25 domain names have asking prices of more than $1 million,
that could mean substantial fees once the company takes 7 percent
to 10 percent from sellers. Afternic charges 5 percent to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   GreatDomains says its average auction brings in $10,000;
Afternic says its average is closer to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other arena, the domain-name broker industry includes
companies of varying size. Many smaller companies have auctioned
domain names for years. YahooAuction, owned by Yahoo, and eBay have
together listed between 10,000 to 15,000 domain names. Other sites
carry hundreds or a few thousand names, like (domain4auction/.com),
(hitdomain.com), (listadomain/.com), (dngcom.com) and
(domainmart/.com), (where www.peoplewhodontpaytheirbills.com was
for sale recently).
</P>
<P>
   Register.com, a New York company, also plans to add auctions to
its site.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley, of GreatDomains.com, said he thinks his company has
built enough of a reputation to withstand new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the fortunate position to be the clear leader in the
secondary market,'' he said. ``We've figured out what it takes to
get the names sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, meanwhile, is in no hurry to sell flu.com. The
company says it has had several inquiries, but predicted the
auction could take three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for the right customer,'' Carrick said, meaning
one who could pay $1.4 million. ``We've had these names appraised.
The listing price is reflective of the estimated value. It's like
finding valuable artwork in the attic of a 163-year-old house.''

WEB EXECUTIVES GARNER BIG BONUSES, SALARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in what now seems like another era of the Internet Age,
going to work for a dot-com company for peanuts in cash _ but piles
of stock options _ was widely seen as the quick route to
millionairehood.
</P>
<P>
   But a survey released Tuesday by PricewaterhouseCoopers
indicates that the collapse in Net and dot-com stocks seems to be
pushing companies to pay their executives more like old-economy
companies, with a somewhat bigger emphasis on salaries and cash
bonuses tied to company results.
</P>
<P>
   And in the short term, the trend is healthy for both the
companies and their stockholders, according to top analysts
withPricewaterhouseCoopers' Unifi Network, which studies executive
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to a year earlier, the most recent survey of 123
Internet companies found that the value of stock options awarded to
top company executives basically held steady, but salaries have
increased on average 9 percent and bonuses 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the average Net chief executive officer is
making an average of $175,000 to $275,000 in salary, more at
companies with bigger market valuations, and a cash bonus of
$40,000 to $110,000. Cash pay still lags behind pay in long-term
stock options worth $250,000 to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the data suggest that Net companies are starting to act
a little more like their ``old economy'' cousins by increasing
their emphasis on cash pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are starting to get it: Even if you are a dot-com or
an Internet company, you've got to start acting more like a
business,'' said Edward J. Speidel, a Unifi Network director.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, shareholder advocates have decried
multimillion-dollar pay packages for executives, especially in
cases where the company's shares delivered anemic returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many have successfully pressed companies large and small to make
more executive pay in the form of stock options whose value is
directly tied to company stock performance. A typical option
package would allow an executive to buy company stock in five to 10
years at the closing price last Dec. 31, so that the more the stock
goes up, the more profit the executive can reap.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet and dot-com companies may have overdone it, the
Unifi study suggests, and begun gradually scaling back an excessive
emphasis on options.
</P>
<P>
   Since the March tech-sector rout on Wall Street, many of those
companies' stocks are ``underwater,'' or trading well below levels
at which executives can make money by exercising options to buy
stock.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Speidel and his colleague say, a bonus of
something like $250,000 in cash tied to specific financial results
may be a much stronger incentive for Net company executives to whip
their businesses into shape than another 10,000 stock options whose
value is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonuses have gotten much larger, and that's a function of the
pressure that they're feeling from shareholders to get closer to
profitability,'' Speidel said. ``If anything, from a shareholder
perspective, that's a positive sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides creating stronger incentives to improve company
financial performance _ hard cash instead of more uncertainly
valued stock options _ the trend could also mitigate growing
problems of ``overhang,'' or big troves of unexercised executive
stock options threatening shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   The 123 companies include a cross-section of ``access and
infrastructure'' gear makers, companies selling Net software,
Internet content sites, and business-to-business and
business-to-consumer e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   Across all companies, there was a median 23 percent stock
overhang, calculated as authorized and unexercised stock options as
a percent of total shares trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies reported ``overhang'' rates as high as 64
percent. A typical comparable number for a non-technology, Fortune
200 company would be in the range of 10 percent to 12 percent,
Speidel said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this is of concern to shareholders is that, in the
case of a company with a 25 percent overhang rate, if executives
exercised all those stock options, people who now own shares would
see their effective share of ownership in the company drop by 20
percent, which presumably would drop the share price.
</P>
<P>
   No numbers for individual corporations were provided. But the
highest overhang rates, over 23 percent, were reported in
``Internet tools'' companies such as multimedia and e-mail software
and ``B-to-B'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, compared to last year, Internet companies also
slightly increased the rate at which they gave away ownership of
the company to executives through options packages, with a median
of 8.4 percent compared to 7.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a shareholder, I'd pull out my company 10-K''
earnings report ``and proxy statement and figure out what level of
dilution might be coming from these options programs, and compare
that to the revenue growth of the company,'' Speidel said.

   Now that school has started, there's no doubt there is a
five-paragraph paper about Davy Crockett in your future. Or a
spelling bee. Or a presentation about how thermometers work.
</P>
<P>
   You need resources. You need them now. And you need them to be
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Because a set of print encyclopedias can cost as much as $1,250
these days, software is the way to go; you can get a good
encyclopedia on CD-ROM for as little as $20 or $30.
</P>
<P>
   But which one? We were overwhelmed by the options we found on
store shelves, so we asked for advice from library specialists in
the Irving, Texas, school district. These people know what they're
talking about _ Irving ISD won the 2000 National School Library
Media Program of the Year award, which the American Association of
School Librarians presents to schools with outstanding library
media programs.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kienzle is the district's director of library and media
services. Kienzle, along with library systems administrator Walter
Betts, named some educational software they deem worth the
investment:
</P>
<P>
   For older students:
</P>
<P>
   A CD-ROM encyclopedia is useful for students in the upper
elementary grades through high school.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. World Book Millennium 2000 edition ($39.99-$85,99, depending
on whether you buy the Standard, Deluxe or Premiere edition)
</P>
<P>
   This encyclopedia offers clear explanations and well-organized
information. Articles are enhanced by videos, maps, pictures and
sounds, and a ``Surf the Millennium'' disk provides a simulated Web
site for each century of the past 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Book is the bedrock,'' Kienzle says. ``It's kind of the
generic encyclopedia; you can always find what you need.'' The
authority is good and the integrity is solid, she says _ you'll
never have to question World Book information.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. Encarta Reference Suite 2001 (Microsoft, $75-$100)
</P>
<P>
   The Encarta encyclopedia series is a pro at reference software.
Encarta was never a set of heavy books _ this company started out
in the electronic medium, but it has established itself as a major
player, comparable to the companies that have published book sets
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of multimedia attractions make the Encarta Reference Suite
a good choice, Kienzle says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encarta is very visual,'' she says. This is where you go, she
says, when you need a picture of Martin Luther King Jr., or you
need to know what the Eiffel Tower looks like.
</P>
<P>
   The Suite includes a multimedia atlas with fantastic graphics
and loads of easily accessible information, including facts about
indigenous animals and regional music.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. Britannica CD 2000 Deluxe (Broderbund/Mindscape, $79.99)
</P>
<P>
   This is software designed for older students: Britannica
software is solid and complete, but the material is more difficult
to digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by far probably the best reference, but it's not
designed for a fifth-grader'' Kienzle says. ``It's really at a very
academic level.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For younger students:
</P>
<P>
   Reference guides aren't as useful for the very young, Betts
says; they need software that is more general.
</P>
<P>
   ``For younger children _ preschool to second grade _ software is
designed to teach them how to use a computer to get the information
they need,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Below, his software suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4. MacMillan Dictionary for Children (MacMillan Publishing USA,
$19.99)
</P>
<P>
   This multimedia dictionary is a strong choice for younger
students, Betts says. It has 12,000 word entries accompanied by
pronunciations (it's a talking dictionary), pictures, sound effects
and word histories. The CD-ROM also features an interactive
character named Zack and educational games, including the
ever-popular hangman, that allow kids to quiz themselves. For very
young children, it's a good literacy tool, Betts says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   5. Reader Rabbit series (The Learning Company, $19.99)
</P>
<P>
   The Reader Rabbit software series is something young students _
pre-kindergarten through second grade _ might use at school, Betts
says. The programs help kids learn math and reading (as well as
basic academic and interpersonal skills) by playing with Reader
Rabbit and his friends. Games, silly songs, lovable characters and
interactive stories keep kids interested in the activity.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   6. Millie's Math House, Sammy's Science House, Bailey's Book
House (Edmark, each $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   This series is for kids in preschool through second grade, Betts
says. The programs use games and question-and-answer activities to
teach the basics. The math program teaches counting, size and
shape, basic addition and subtraction, for example, and the science
program teaches kids about weather and plants.

 &HT;    World War II game isn't merely for history buffs
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Software reviewer Dave Basinger said ``Combat
Mission'' is an excellent PC game, even though he doesn't know much
about World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He knows who won, and he's happy with the results. So all the
game maker's claims about historical accuracy and weapon
authenticity are lost on him. All he knows is that he likes playing
the combat simulation, and that's good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really, really good game,'' said Dave. ``It took a
little while to grow on me, but now that I've figured it out, I'm
really into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave said that if it weren't for school and chores, he would be
doing combat quite a bit more in the coming months. As it is, he
will have to put first things first and play this game when and if
he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been playing for a couple of weeks, and I can see
how addictive it can be,'' the 15-year-old said. ``Unfortunately,
my parents don't let me play as much as I would like to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat Mission'' is a WWII tactical warfare game for one to
two players. It combines depth of story line with ease of use in
3-D battlefield environments. According to its maker, the 3-D
effect is not just to look good; rather it improves the accuracy of
the simulation for game play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty fun and easy to play,'' Dave said. ``The graphics
aren't all that great, though. I guess that's the only downside to
it, but after you play it for a while you really don't pay that
much attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game takes players from Normandy in 1944 to Germany in 1945
on WWII's two Western fronts. Players can choose to play either
side of the conflict and battle across historically accurate plains
and villages or into the woods and cities.
</P>
<P>
   If gamers are unhappy with the scenarios, they can use the
program's editor to change the settings to suit their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Players command a force as small as a platoon or as large as a
reinforced battalion. Each man and weapon is kept track of for
maximum realism.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the game play is, Dave said the sound effects are
what really sold him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine gun fire and other sound effects were awesome,''
Dave said. ``It was like a good movie soundtrack.''

 &HT;    `Perfect Dark' fun, but expect action rather than a story
 &HT;    By Vox Day
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Perfect Dark'' is a sequel of sorts to
``Goldeneye,'' the game that brought computer-style 3-D action to
the Nintendo 64 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   While it combines nearly every annoying marketing element in the
book, ``Perfect Dark'' is simply an excellent action game.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the ability to network between machines, video games
have lagged well behind computer counterparts in the multiplayer
3-D action game first demonstrated in ``Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   While computer gamers have had a mind-boggling array of
player-modified weapons, levels and characters to choose from,
along with up to 15 teammates and opponents, video gamers have been
stuck playing with at most three opponents while peering at a
screen divided into two or four parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' changes none of that; it's a function of the
hardware technology, not the software. But it does provide a
training facility that, in its willingness to stack the odds
against you with AI-controlled simdroids, provides a fair
approximation of the pulse-rate-lifting stress and excitement that
multiplayer action does.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 different challenges in the training section, and I
found myself still playing them long after I would have finished
playing most games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I still haven't gotten to the real game itself. I
guess that's really beside the point, since the story line is the
usual mishmash of silly alien conspiracy stuff that has plagued so
many games ever since the ``X-Files'' was first televised.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is in keeping with tradition _ one of the many
admirable things about ``Doom'' was its refusal to pretend that it
had any plot or story line. ``Perfect Dark'' might as well have
done the same. It's all about the action, you see.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are good, with windows that shatter, walls that
show damage and good lighting effects. There are many weapons,
ranging from clip-emptying burst fire machines to single-shot
silencers and remote mines.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite is to have an autofiring Cyclone in each
hand; this seems to do the trick quite nicely on most enemies. I'm
impressed with this game, mostly because I really didn't expect to
see action this exciting on a single-player system setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect Dark'' is not nearly perfect, but it will certainly
give any action gamer his or her money's worth. P.S.: You need the
4-megabyte expansion pack to play the solo missions.
</P>

 &HT;    Colony Wars III: Red Sun, short on plot, heavy on carnage
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Your name is Valdemar, and you're slogging away in some future
dead-end job when a regal, bald general appears in a dream and
reveals that you are the Chosen One. For what have you been chosen?
Well, from there it gets a bit hazy. Consistently vague and random
visions may ultimately distract you from the only tangible goal of
Colony Wars III: Red Sun ($30; www. midway.com; for the
PlayStation), which is to kill everything you see. If you accept
the limitations of this objective going in, then you will be free
to appreciate the game for what it is: an enjoyable, intergalactic
shoot-em-up. With aurally and visually pleasing lasers, explosions
and spaceships, ``Red Sun'' is the gaming equivalent of a good
summer blockbuster, with a thundering, cinematic soundtrack to
match. Technically above average, ``Red Sun'' graphics feature few
rough edges, and although the close-ups of Valdemar and friends are
downright creepy, most of the full motion video scenes are
stunning. Plot junkies may find ``Red Sun'' inferior to the first
two Colony Wars episodes, as the mystery of the Red Sun is never
especially compelling. But if you relish the thought of laser
cannon carnage on its own terms, then ``Red Sun,'' with its 50-plus
missions, could be a lovely way to (after) burn an hour or six.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeremy Egner
</P>
<P>
   ($40; www.activision.com; for the PlayStation), which is a game
simpatico with the recent summer blockbuster, which in turn is
based on an immensely popular comic and cartoon franchise.
Unfortunately, the game is merely another means to brand name us
with X-Men; it has little to do with the film. In fact, it only
vaguely resembles a modern video game in the first place. Mutant
Academy is a well-drawn, well-animated 2-D fighting game _ and
that's it. There's no adventure akin to a movie plot, just the
various super-anti-heroes duking it out in a face-to-face,
side-scrolling romp. Even on the aging PlayStation console, most
fighting games are known to contain so much more than flat-action
eye-candy, such as three dimensions. Nevertheless, X-Men Mutant
Academy is a very good 2-D fighting game complete with trademark
super-moves and painful powers of mutant punishment. But it's the
weakest member in the grand amalgamation scheme of console,
cartoon, comic and cinematic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially reinventing the ``First Person Shooter'' genre,
Warren Spector's ($40; www.eidosinteractive.com; for Windows and
Mac) blends a deep and completely malleable role-playing story line
with the traditional wander-and-frag games of death and
indiscriminate dismemberment. In the game, produced by Texas' Ion
Storm and ported to the Mac by Austin's Aspyr Media Inc., cause and
effect decisions concerning in-game characters and environments
directly affect this feature-rich game. Deus Ex gives gamers the
opportunity to customize skills and skill levels with a suite of
``nanotech augmentations.'' This enhances, as an understated
example, one's strength or combat prowess while forgoing the
slippery skills of stealth or, visa versa, making the game as
frenzied and violent or intensely subdued as desired. Breathtaking
``real life'' visuals and a wholly immersive world of exhausted
chaos promise to make Deus Ex the new benchmark for digital
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shaun Conlin
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Based on a venerable Dungeons &AMP; Dragons-style pen-and-paper
game, Vampire: The Masquerade _ Redemption ($45;
www.activision.com; for Windows) drops you into an immersive 3-D
world where role-playing, action and puzzle-solving are well
balanced. That's the good news. Creeping about in the shadows as
the undead anti-hero Christof and hacking away at one's enemies or
drinking the blood of one's victims is sinister fun. The
smooth-running landscapes and special effects are detailed and
atmospheric. The controls are intuitive (toggle between third and
first person), the cinematic cut scenes are lovely and the
characters who join your party are interesting and even helpful.
But the most highly anticipated aspect of the game, storyteller
mode, in which one player builds and controls a world as the game
is running, disappoints in that it requires a sure hand at the helm
_ something difficult to find in the twitchfest of the Internet _
and generally degenerates into a free-for-all. But given the right
circumstances _ a well-built local network game with all the
players physically in a room together _ Vampire has the potential
for transcending even its worst glitches.

 &HT;    Nifty search engine vindicates ad-saturated Net software
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is inevitable, I suppose, that our society will
commercialize anything and everything remotely capable of bearing
up under it.
</P>
<P>
   Race cars are so plastered with advertising you can scarcely see
the paint. Athletes are walking (or running, or jumping or
whatever) billboards. Speaking of billboards, I see we now have
mobile billboards, dragged around town on trailers.
</P>
<P>
   So I probably shouldn't be surprised or shocked by
commercialized software. I was, however.
</P>
<P>
   A company called IWare makes a product called uWare, the beta
version of which I blithely mounted on my computer without really
knowing what it was about, other than assurances that it would
enhance my Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, it might do that, but I was about to rip it out
by the roots before I discovered that. For the most part, it is
nothing more than an advertising carrier for a host of
e-businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The program produces a new taskbar at the bottom of the screen.
Its chief features are a set of Touch Tiles and a long panel of
rotating ads for various e-businesses. The Touch Tiles it comes
with are also e-businesses. Clicking the tiles or the long panel
will take you to the specified e-business site.
</P>
<P>
   There are a herd of them, all of which have paid IWare something
to be included in uWare. Among tem are eBay and AutoNation,
Harley-Davidson and Cigar Aficionado magazine, all sorts of things.
I have not seen one, however, that I care to visit.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a tile called Deals, featuring specials that Iware
has arranged for the benefit of its audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Touch Tiles can be thrown out and replaced by items of your
own choosing. I don't see any way to get rid of the long panel,
however. Incidentally, the program says ``uWare updates daily,''
which I presume means that every day when you log onto the
Internet, the program goes scurrying off in search of newly signed
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The program, of course, is free. My indignation would be
boundless were it not.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost boundless anyway until I discovered the Search
tile.
</P>
<P>
   This is a multiengine search so nifty that I am contemplating
allowing the entire mess to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   This feature has both a ``content'' search and a ``product''
search, although it's hard to see why you couldn't find products in
a content search. Whatever the case, it employs seven of the most
popular search engines to answer your queries.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that impressed me is its exactitude. I asked it for
``blackpowder cartridge.'' Every choice it presented fit that
parameter.
</P>
<P>
   No cartridge without blackpowder, no blackpowder without
cartridge. No duplicates. Very nice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are a shopaholic, uWare may be just the ticket
for you. In that case, go to www.uware.com and download your own
copy of the beta release.

NFL'S FELONIOUS OFF-SEASON RENEWS DEBATE OVER ROLE MODELING FOR

 ATTENTION EDITORS: With seven photos, of Mark Chmura (NNS1), Rae
Carruth (NNS2), Paul Krumberger (NNS3 and NNS4), Brett Favre
(NNS5), Antonio Freeman (NNS6) and Darrell Green (NNS7). 
 By MARK O'KEEFE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Chmura wasn't just a Green Bay Packers tight end, outspoken
critic of Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct and United Way example
of what's supposed to be good and noble and true about the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was a child's hero, riding 11-year-old Paul Krumberger's
bicycle between the Lambeau Field locker room and the Packers'
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Green Bay tradition for players to accept bike rides from
kids during summer training camp, and Paul got all the autographed
photos he wanted last year. The highlight came whem Chmura took off
his leather receiving gloves, signed them, and gave them to the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul returned this summer to offer rides to players, but his
former hero wasn't there to pedal. Subsequently cut by the Packers,
Chmura awaits trial on criminal charges in another blow to the
image of what has been dubbed the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, in Paul's words, ``did something really bad to a woman
when he was drunk.'' A district attorney deemed it third-degree
sexual assault, and since the woman was a 17-year-old girl, child
enticement. If convicted, Chmura could face up to 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of players in handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuits _
even players innocent until proven guilty _ have prompted concern
over a serious public relations injury to one of America's most
popular sports.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Paul, and thousands of children like him,
vulnerable to around-the-clock media hype of football players
marketed as mythic figures? If kids copy the on-the-field moves,
flamboyant celebrations and excessive trash talking of their Sunday
heroes, will they also imitate their off-the-field behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Many players dismiss the connection, saying they don't want to
be role models. But the league reluctantly acknowledges a
responsibility to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our players to be exemplary citizens,'' NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in an interview. ``We want them to
set high standards on the field as well as off the field. I think
the reality is that they are role models, whether we like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chmura case is made richer by the former player's longtime
criticism of President Clinton. Chmura refused to attend the
traditional visit to the White House after the Packers won the
Super Bowl in 1997. After the Monica Lewinksky scandal, he
lambasted the president's morals and the message they sent to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges against Chmura are only one pro football crime
story among several that have tarnished the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Others involve Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers
receiver awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges in the
shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend, and Denver Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski, who faces felony charges in a
prescription drug case involving diet pills. The Baltimore Ravens'
Ray Lewis, the NFL's leading tackler last year, had murder charges
dropped in May in exchange for a guilty plea to obstruction of
justice in connection with a stabbing death after an Atlanta Super
Bowl party. The NFL subsequently fined Lewis $250,000.

<P>
   Psychologists say there is little doubt that in this era of
around-the-clock sports coverage and slick marketing of stars, NFL
players have some effect on the millions of children who idolize
them. But the degree of influence is difficult to measure, and
varies from child to child, dependent in part on their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the power of modeling behavior. That's
been demonstrated for years,'' said Leonard Zaichkowsky, director
of sports psychology at Boston University and a past president of
the Association for Applied Sports Psychology for North America.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he has seen no research establishing a
link between NFL and childhood behavior. Zaichkowsky said it's
similar to trying to prove that violent films make people violent.
The best evidence may be anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, child psychologist Bonnie Nussbaum said she hasn't
seen cases of post-Chmura trauma, but the story has been a
stressful undercurrent for many of the children she counsels. She
said it especially triggers old fears and responses of girls who
have been victims of sexual abuse and tells boys, if at a
subconscious level, that women are objects of domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids have the ego strength to resist that type of
behavior,'' Nussbaum said. ``But other kids are more vulnerable and
might follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Connor, a professor of psychology at California State
University in Long Beach, where he teaches a class on sport
behavior, said children will turn cynical as NFL players continue
to let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very easily turn kids against the entire sport, the
entire process and the NFL altogether,'' Connor said. ``The way
kids think, they will generalize. They'll say if Rae Carruth did
it, everyone has done it, they just haven't been caught yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my biggest concern is the disillusionment won't stop with
the football. Kids may think you bend the rules to do whatever you
can get away with in society as a whole.''
</P>

<P>
   Such cynicism was evident this summer in Green Bay, where
muscled behemoths have been riding the bicycles of children since
the 1960s. Ten boys sat on their bikes, waiting for the objects of
their football worship and rattling off the Packers' recent rap
sheet. In addition to Chmura, four other Packers have been arrested
since December, on charges of obstruction of justice (Antonio
Freeman and Rodney Artmore), drunken driving and speeding (Marco
Rivera) and possession of marijuana (De'Mond Parker).
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Chmura, Jason Wassenberg, 11, said, ``I think he's
sick. That's gross to do that. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chad Van DenLangenberg, 13: ``I'm glad he got under
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' said 13-year-old Jacob Stalberger, ``gets in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason: ``That's because some players think they can get away
with anything because they're pro football players and big
namers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do get away with it,'' retorted Scott Wick, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob: ``Look at De'Mond Parker. He had 7 grams of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the charges were dropped,'' said Luke Parlow, referring to
an arrangement that had Parker completing a court-approved drug
course. ``They shouldn't have been.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boys eagerly approached other players after practice,
asking for autographs and offering rides.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre downplayed his influence on
children. ``I don't think NFL players should be role models for
someone else's kids,'' Favre said. ``The parents should be their
own role models. It's not our responsibility. We try to live life
the right way, but nobody's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Freeman, ``My role models are my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After the obstruction of justice charge in a December traffic
accident that injured a woman, Freeman was sentenced to a year's
probation, $1,000 fine and 50 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was a Wisconsin Department of Transportation spokesman
for wearing seat belts, his likeness on 15,000 posters with the
words, ``Football is a game. Your life is not. Buckle Up.'' Police
found that he wasn't wearing his seat belt in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his conduct has hurt children, Freeman said no.
``We all make mistakes,'' he said. ``We're human.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To what extent NFL players make criminal mistakes is in dispute.
In their often-cited 1998 book, ``Pros and Cons, the Criminals Who
Play in the NFL,'' authors Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger said their
study of 509 players _ about one-third of the active NFL roster at
the time _ showed ``an eye-popping 109 (21 percent) were found to
have been formally charged (arrested or indicted) with a serious
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But a year later in CHANCE, a magazine of the American
Statistical Association, Benedict joined another author in
re-evaluating NFL arrests. They studied FBI figures for the general
population _ in this case only for assaults _ and concluded that
``the NFL rates are less than half the general population rates.''
</P>
<P>
   For players critical of what they consider distorted media
coverage, that clarification is evidence that NFL players are
better people than they are portrayed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disturbing to me that there are only one or two
incidents they seem to focus on and they don't see the good that
we're doing as far as raising and generating money for different
organizations that help people less fortunate,'' said veteran
defensive end Bruce Smith of the Washington Redskins. ``They don't
see us being mentors for children and being positive role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Darrell Green is such a mentor. After a two-hour
summer practice in Ashburn, Va., in 90-degree heat and high
humidity, Green stood on a plush, green practice field wearing a
sweat-soaked T-shirt and Redskins football pants, talking to 14
children involved with the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.
When the kids seemed restless, the defensive back called them to
attention with a firm, ``Stay with me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he retires, Green, 40, said he wants to set aside $10
million for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you take care of things they can't take away from
you,'' Green told the children. ``In sports, you can break a leg.
But no one can take your honesty away from you. No one can take
your integrity away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the locker room, Green said it is foolish to see Nike
spend millions of dollars on athlete endorsements to persuade
children to buy expensive shoes and not believe that NFL players
have a powerful influence on other types of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that thing called celebrity fame,'' Green said. ``I'm not
exploiting it from the standpoint of making dollars. But I'm
exploiting it from the standpoint of trying to access the hearts
and minds of youths and trying to turn them toward what is right,
what is honest and what is respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) \roMDUL\ &UR; - But for every moment of
attention from a Darrell Green, there seems to be a counter-moment
from a Plaxico Burress, first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, which gave him a $5.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   While children asked for autographs after a practice this summer
in Latrobe, Pa., Burress ignored them and walked to his new, shiny
Hummer, the wide-bodied vehicle based on the military's Humvee. He
drove through a sea of kids without establishing eye contact,
leaving several holding pens with confused looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fasano, 19, a ``die-hard Steelers fan'' for as long as he
can remember, witnessed the scene, which fueled the distaste he
feels for what money has done to the NFL and the tradition
established by gritty, not greedy, players like Joe Greene and
Rocky Bleier, leaders of the ``Steel Curtain'' Steelers of the
1970s, a team that won four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gaudy, flamboyant and out of touch with the world,''
said Fasano, a University of Florida student. ``That Hummer was a
microcosm of what I'm talking about. It didn't even stop for the
kids. It sped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasano traces his distaste to when his favorite Steeler, Barry
Foster, held out for more money, teaching then 12-year-old Fasano
that ``the players don't give a damn about me. They just care about
their paychecks.'' He'd have been emotionally scarred, Fasano said,
if he'd seen his hero on national television as the subject of a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, there seems to be a growing consensus that big
money in the hands of 20-something men with an adoring entourage
can be the root of some evil, sending a bad message to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can browbeat the guys into doing the right
thing,'' said Nesby Glasgow, the Seattle Seahawks' director of
player programs, a full-time position every team is required to
have. ``But we do sit down and talk about goals and aspirations,
and I may tell these guys I don't see your behavior reflecting your
goals and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also requires rookies to attend a symposium designed to
teach life skills. One of this year's speakers was Lewis, who in
the aftermath of his murder trial warned about carefully choosing
friends. The NFL says past statistics suggest that four rookies are
likely to be arrested this year, along with 12 second-year players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league for eight years and the programs have
increased 500 percent,'' said Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent
Dilfer. ``The hardest thing for me was that I was only 21 years old
when they handed me $4.5 million. I had great parents and good
people around me, but that amount of money is overwhelming. I still
made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   How can parents prevent the mistakes of millionaire athletes
from adversely affecting their children? When an incident hits the
news, they should talk to their sons and daughters about it, giving
them an opportunity to vent while discussing their family values,
psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum, the Green Bay therapist, said it was unfortunate that
she had to discuss graphic aspects of the Chmura and Carruth
incidents with her young daughter. But that, she added, is what
life is about in our society _ not just the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter just couldn't comprehend someone shooting a woman
who was pregnant. Yuck,'' said Nussbaum. ``I mean, I don't really
want to be talking to my 7-year-old about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krumberger doesn't want to be talking about what Chmura may
have done, either. But like many well-adjusted children, he is
capable of realizing that good athletes can make bad decisions that
kids should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul plays football with his buddies, he no longer imagines
that he's No. 89 cutting across the end zone for a touchdown. He's
considering selling those once-cherished Chmura gloves, as if
someone would want them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good influence on me,'' said Paul, ``until he did
that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Chmura wasn't just a Green Bay Packers tight end, outspoken
critic of Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct and United Way example
of what's supposed to be good and noble and true about the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was a child's hero, riding 11-year-old Paul Krumberger's
bicycle between the Lambeau Field locker room and the Packers'
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Green Bay tradition for players to accept bike rides from
kids during summer training camp, and Paul got all the autographed
photos he wanted last year. The highlight came whem Chmura took off
his leather receiving gloves, signed them, and gave them to the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul returned this summer to offer rides to players, but his
former hero wasn't there to pedal. Subsequently cut by the Packers,
Chmura awaits trial on criminal charges in another blow to the
image of what has been dubbed the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, in Paul's words, ``did something really bad to a woman
when he was drunk.'' A district attorney deemed it third-degree
sexual assault, and since the woman was a 17-year-old girl, child
enticement. If convicted, Chmura could face up to 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of players in handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuits _
even players innocent until proven guilty _ have prompted concern
over a serious public relations injury to one of America's most
popular sports.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Paul, and thousands of children like him,
vulnerable to around-the-clock media hype of football players
marketed as mythic figures? If kids copy the on-the-field moves,
flamboyant celebrations and excessive trash talking of their Sunday
heroes, will they also imitate their off-the-field behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Many players dismiss the connection, saying they don't want to
be role models. But the league reluctantly acknowledges a
responsibility to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our players to be exemplary citizens,'' NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in an interview. ``We want them to
set high standards on the field as well as off the field. I think
the reality is that they are role models, whether we like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chmura case is made richer by the former player's longtime
criticism of President Clinton. Chmura refused to attend the
traditional visit to the White House after the Packers won the
Super Bowl in 1997. After the Monica Lewinksky scandal, he
lambasted the president's morals and the message they sent to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges against Chmura are only one pro football crime
story among several that have tarnished the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Others involve Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers
receiver awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges in the
shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend, and Denver Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski, who faces felony charges in a
prescription drug case involving diet pills. The Baltimore Ravens'
Ray Lewis, the NFL's leading tackler last year, had murder charges
dropped in May in exchange for a guilty plea to obstruction of
justice in connection with a stabbing death after an Atlanta Super
Bowl party. The NFL subsequently fined Lewis $250,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Chmura wasn't just a Green Bay Packers tight end, outspoken
critic of Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct and United Way example
of what's supposed to be good and noble and true about the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was a child's hero, riding 11-year-old Paul Krumberger's
bicycle between the Lambeau Field locker room and the Packers'
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Green Bay tradition for players to accept bike rides from
kids during summer training camp, and Paul got all the autographed
photos he wanted last year. The highlight came whem Chmura took off
his leather receiving gloves, signed them, and gave them to the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul returned this summer to offer rides to players, but his
former hero wasn't there to pedal. Subsequently cut by the Packers,
Chmura awaits trial on criminal charges in another blow to the
image of what has been dubbed the National Felony League.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, in Paul's words, ``did something really bad to a woman
when he was drunk.'' A district attorney deemed it third-degree
sexual assault, and since the woman was a 17-year-old girl, child
enticement. If convicted, Chmura could face up to 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of players in handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuits _
even players innocent until proven guilty _ have prompted concern
over a serious public relations injury to one of America's most
popular sports.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Paul, and thousands of children like him,
vulnerable to around-the-clock media hype of football players
marketed as mythic figures? If kids copy the on-the-field moves,
flamboyant celebrations and excessive trash talking of their Sunday
heroes, will they also imitate their off-the-field behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Many players dismiss the connection, saying they don't want to
be role models. But the league reluctantly acknowledges a
responsibility to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our players to be exemplary citizens,'' NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in an interview. ``We want them to
set high standards on the field as well as off the field. I think
the reality is that they are role models, whether we like it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chmura case is made richer by the former player's longtime
criticism of President Clinton. Chmura refused to attend the
traditional visit to the White House after the Packers won the
Super Bowl in 1997. After the Monica Lewinksky scandal, he
lambasted the president's morals and the message they sent to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges against Chmura are only one pro football crime
story among several that have tarnished the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Others involve Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers
receiver awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges in the
shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend, and Denver Broncos
linebacker Bill Romanowski, who faces felony charges in a
prescription drug case involving diet pills. The Baltimore Ravens'
Ray Lewis, the NFL's leading tackler last year, had murder charges
dropped in May in exchange for a guilty plea to obstruction of
justice in connection with a stabbing death after an Atlanta Super
Bowl party. The NFL subsequently fined Lewis $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say there is little doubt that in this era of
around-the-clock sports coverage and slick marketing of stars, NFL
players have some effect on the millions of children who idolize
them. But the degree of influence is difficult to measure, and
varies from child to child, dependent in part on their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly in the power of modeling behavior. That's
been demonstrated for years,'' said Leonard Zaichkowsky, director
of sports psychology at Boston University and a past president of
the Association for Applied Sports Psychology for North America.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that he has seen no research establishing a
link between NFL and childhood behavior. Zaichkowsky said it's
similar to trying to prove that violent films make people violent.
The best evidence may be anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, child psychologist Bonnie Nussbaum said she hasn't
seen cases of post-Chmura trauma, but the story has been a
stressful undercurrent for many of the children she counsels. She
said it especially triggers old fears and responses of girls who
have been victims of sexual abuse and tells boys, if at a
subconscious level, that women are objects of domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids have the ego strength to resist that type of
behavior,'' Nussbaum said. ``But other kids are more vulnerable and
might follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Connor, a professor of psychology at California State
University in Long Beach, where he teaches a class on sport
behavior, said children will turn cynical as NFL players continue
to let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very easily turn kids against the entire sport, the
entire process and the NFL altogether,'' Connor said. ``The way
kids think, they will generalize. They'll say if Rae Carruth did
it, everyone has done it, they just haven't been caught yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my biggest concern is the disillusionment won't stop with
the football. Kids may think you bend the rules to do whatever you
can get away with in society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Such cynicism was evident this summer in Green Bay, where
muscled behemoths have been riding the bicycles of children since
the 1960s. Ten boys sat on their bikes, waiting for the objects of
their football worship and rattling off the Packers' recent rap
sheet. In addition to Chmura, four other Packers have been arrested
since December, on charges of obstruction of justice (Antonio
Freeman and Rodney Artmore), drunken driving and speeding (Marco
Rivera) and possession of marijuana (De'Mond Parker).
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Chmura, Jason Wassenberg, 11, said, ``I think he's
sick. That's gross to do that. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chad Van DenLangenberg, 13: ``I'm glad he got under
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' said 13-year-old Jacob Stalberger, ``gets in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason: ``That's because some players think they can get away
with anything because they're pro football players and big
namers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do get away with it,'' retorted Scott Wick, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob: ``Look at De'Mond Parker. He had 7 grams of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the charges were dropped,'' said Luke Parlow, referring to
an arrangement that had Parker completing a court-approved drug
course. ``They shouldn't have been.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boys eagerly approached other players after practice,
asking for autographs and offering rides.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre downplayed his influence on
children. ``I don't think NFL players should be role models for
someone else's kids,'' Favre said. ``The parents should be their
own role models. It's not our responsibility. We try to live life
the right way, but nobody's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Freeman, ``My role models are my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After the obstruction of justice charge in a December traffic
accident that injured a woman, Freeman was sentenced to a year's
probation, $1,000 fine and 50 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was a Wisconsin Department of Transportation spokesman
for wearing seat belts, his likeness on 15,000 posters with the
words, ``Football is a game. Your life is not. Buckle Up.'' Police
found that he wasn't wearing his seat belt in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his conduct has hurt children, Freeman said no.
``We all make mistakes,'' he said. ``We're human.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   To what extent NFL players make criminal mistakes is in dispute.
In their often-cited 1998 book, ``Pros and Cons, the Criminals Who
Play in the NFL,'' authors Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger said their
study of 509 players _ about one-third of the active NFL roster at
the time _ showed ``an eye-popping 109 (21 percent) were found to
have been formally charged (arrested or indicted) with a serious
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But a year later in CHANCE, a magazine of the American
Statistical Association, Benedict joined another author in
re-evaluating NFL arrests. They studied FBI figures for the general
population _ in this case only for assaults _ and concluded that
``the NFL rates are less than half the general population rates.''
</P>
<P>
   For players critical of what they consider distorted media
coverage, that clarification is evidence that NFL players are
better people than they are portrayed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disturbing to me that there are only one or two
incidents they seem to focus on and they don't see the good that
we're doing as far as raising and generating money for different
organizations that help people less fortunate,'' said veteran
defensive end Bruce Smith of the Washington Redskins. ``They don't
see us being mentors for children and being positive role models.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Darrell Green is such a mentor. After a two-hour
summer practice in Ashburn, Va., in 90-degree heat and high
humidity, Green stood on a plush, green practice field wearing a
sweat-soaked T-shirt and Redskins football pants, talking to 14
children involved with the Darrell Green Youth Life Foundation.
When the kids seemed restless, the defensive back called them to
attention with a firm, ``Stay with me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he retires, Green, 40, said he wants to set aside $10
million for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you take care of things they can't take away from
you,'' Green told the children. ``In sports, you can break a leg.
But no one can take your honesty away from you. No one can take
your integrity away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the locker room, Green said it is foolish to see Nike
spend millions of dollars on athlete endorsements to persuade
children to buy expensive shoes and not believe that NFL players
have a powerful influence on other types of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that thing called celebrity fame,'' Green said. ``I'm not
exploiting it from the standpoint of making dollars. But I'm
exploiting it from the standpoint of trying to access the hearts
and minds of youths and trying to turn them toward what is right,
what is honest and what is respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) \roMDUL\ &UR; - But for every moment of
attention from a Darrell Green, there seems to be a counter-moment
from a Plaxico Burress, first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, which gave him a $5.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   While children asked for autographs after a practice this summer
in Latrobe, Pa., Burress ignored them and walked to his new, shiny
Hummer, the wide-bodied vehicle based on the military's Humvee. He
drove through a sea of kids without establishing eye contact,
leaving several holding pens with confused looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fasano, 19, a ``die-hard Steelers fan'' for as long as he
can remember, witnessed the scene, which fueled the distaste he
feels for what money has done to the NFL and the tradition
established by gritty, not greedy, players like Joe Greene and
Rocky Bleier, leaders of the ``Steel Curtain'' Steelers of the
1970s, a team that won four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gaudy, flamboyant and out of touch with the world,''
said Fasano, a University of Florida student. ``That Hummer was a
microcosm of what I'm talking about. It didn't even stop for the
kids. It sped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasano traces his distaste to when his favorite Steeler, Barry
Foster, held out for more money, teaching then 12-year-old Fasano
that ``the players don't give a damn about me. They just care about
their paychecks.'' He'd have been emotionally scarred, Fasano said,
if he'd seen his hero on national television as the subject of a
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, there seems to be a growing consensus that big
money in the hands of 20-something men with an adoring entourage
can be the root of some evil, sending a bad message to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can browbeat the guys into doing the right
thing,'' said Nesby Glasgow, the Seattle Seahawks' director of
player programs, a full-time position every team is required to
have. ``But we do sit down and talk about goals and aspirations,
and I may tell these guys I don't see your behavior reflecting your
goals and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also requires rookies to attend a symposium designed to
teach life skills. One of this year's speakers was Lewis, who in
the aftermath of his murder trial warned about carefully choosing
friends. The NFL says past statistics suggest that four rookies are
likely to be arrested this year, along with 12 second-year players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league for eight years and the programs have
increased 500 percent,'' said Baltimore Ravens quarterback Trent
Dilfer. ``The hardest thing for me was that I was only 21 years old
when they handed me $4.5 million. I had great parents and good
people around me, but that amount of money is overwhelming. I still
made mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   How can parents prevent the mistakes of millionaire athletes
from adversely affecting their children? When an incident hits the
news, they should talk to their sons and daughters about it, giving
them an opportunity to vent while discussing their family values,
psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum, the Green Bay therapist, said it was unfortunate that
she had to discuss graphic aspects of the Chmura and Carruth
incidents with her young daughter. But that, she added, is what
life is about in our society _ not just the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter just couldn't comprehend someone shooting a woman
who was pregnant. Yuck,'' said Nussbaum. ``I mean, I don't really
want to be talking to my 7-year-old about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krumberger doesn't want to be talking about what Chmura may
have done, either. But like many well-adjusted children, he is
capable of realizing that good athletes can make bad decisions that
kids should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul plays football with his buddies, he no longer imagines
that he's No. 89 cutting across the end zone for a touchdown. He's
considering selling those once-cherished Chmura gloves, as if
someone would want them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good influence on me,'' said Paul, ``until he did
that.''

 &HT;    Playing around on the Web
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long gone are the days of painful piano lessons in
Mrs. Crotchety's parlor. No more glowering looks and accusations
that you haven't been practicing. No more ominous ticking of the
dusty metronome as you struggle to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the wonderful world of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple clicks of the mouse, you can soon be tickling the
ivories or strumming a guitar without ever having to leave the
comfort of your home. Music education has jumped on the Internet
bandwagon offering online instrument lessons _ via video, sound
and/or text _ and how-to-play-music software.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Internet's most prominent music sites, Guitar.com
offers a huge library of video guitar lessons _ both from music
instructors and from well-known musicians such as B.B. King and
Richie Havens. The site also features chord and scale generators to
help players tune their guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Rock legend Havens recently called Guitar.com one of his
favorite Web sites. ``I go here and learn,'' he said. ``They have
tablature, guitar chords and teachers that you can hook into and
learn from directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bradshaw often uses his Web site, www.cyberfret.com, as an
additional resource for the 65 guitar students he teaches each week
in Columbus, Ohio. The Web site, however, is designed primarily for
people learning the guitar on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guitar has traditionally been an instrument that people have
taught themselves,'' says Bradshaw. ``Now they have a very powerful
tool that can help them learn: the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw uses computer technology even with traditional
in-person students. He uses a computer to play background
accompaniments for songs that students are playing. With the
computer, he says, he can change the key, tempo, or even style of a
song, unlike playing along with a CD.
</P>
<P>
   One great advantage to using online technology is the
availability of multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students can watch a technique being demonstrated over and
over, or even at different camera angles,'' Bradshaw explains.
``They can listen to examples, or play along with a virtual band.
Related material can be easily accessed through linking to other
pages within the site, or to Web sites anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around 1,500 people visit Vision Music
(www.visionmusic.com) each day for guitar instruction, says site
creator and instructor Mark Stefani who lives in Tualatin, Ore.,
just outside of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers everything from an ``eye test'' to help
first-year students assess their abilities and figure out where
they need work, to a database of articles on technique, motivation
and practice. In addition, it is the host for ``Jam Central
Station,'' a round-the-clock online jam session for players of all
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stefani says his site can be a supplement for students
taking traditional music lessons, he sees it as a broader
educational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that it was serving a unique purpose in providing
musicians around the world who couldn't afford private lessons an
opportunity to learn and to be inspired,'' he says. ``This group
numbers in the thousands, including retired folks on a limited
budget, kids, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the online instructional sites are accessible
whenever you get the urge, some offer actual lessons at explicit
times.
</P>
<P>
   At www.RiffInteractive.com, students log on to a chat session at
a specific time and join 20-30 other students for guitar lessons.
An interface allows the instructor to send out music notation,
pictures, and sound and video clips. While these group lessons are
free, one-to-one lessons _ via NetMeeting's two-way streaming video
_ are $40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then every lesson is archived in a database for students to call
up at will.
</P>
<P>
   The main demographic for the online lessons are men age 16-35,
according to Riff Interactive's Steve Roeder. He says plans are in
the works for similar sites teaching drums and keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Music teachers can stake out a spot to create their lessons and
instantly post them online for their students at sites like
NotationStation.net. They can use a free online notation service
(notation is a way of writing out musical notes) provided and send
students to their own personal area on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Then students have the tools to compose, edit, print and listen
to music, along with the ability to input notation through the
keyboard or mouse, or from a live instrument via MIDI files.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of NotationStation.net is for teachers to extend
their reach beyond the classroom,'' says founder Nathaniel Weiss.
``Kids are using computers all the time, and this provides an
immersive, collaborative environment to make the music they learn
in school come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting music instruction online, there's plenty
of software available that allows would-be players to learn at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for any instructor to do is to get people to
practice,'' admits Laurie Acken picking is a style of playing
that's popular with country musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is some advantage to being able to see people show
you certain things. There are some things that you really know how
to do them or you won't be able to do it,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Though technology has its positives, Urban's sure some things
won't change. He says, hopefully, ``I don't think technology will
ever overpower creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's one other thing technology can't help you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``From almost 30 years of dedicated teaching I've learned that
you can't make people practice,'' Stefani laughs. ``The only thing
you can do is to hopefully inspire them and fuel the flame that
flickers within.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the videogame world, when players face bleak
prospects _ a hero loses ``health points,'' or a spaceship's shield
is depleted _ they have the ultimate recourse: Hit the Reset
button.
</P>
<P>
   It is an option rarely available in the business world, but
Electronic Arts, the world's leading independent game company, has
just such a fresh start in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which makes dozens of sports, action-adventure and
strategy games for PCs as well as for game consoles made by Sony,
Nintendo and others, is weathering a market in great flux. Sales
have been in a lull, awaiting the full emergence of a new
generation of faster, more powerful game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the bleak outlook on July 25, when Electronic Arts
announced a fiscal first-quarter loss of more than $42 million on
revenue of $154.8 million and warned of losses nearly as great in
the second quarter. The news was in stark contrast to the company's
modest profit in last year's first quarter. And because the report
came after the stock market's close that day, most investors had no
immediate way to vent their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, though, investors were ready to pounce _ and
they did so by bidding up the company's stock nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why such enthusiasm for a money-losing quarter? Evidently,
investors share the optimism of Electronic Arts' executives, who
during one of the game industry's cyclical downturns have been
spending heavily preparing for the future.
</P>
<P>
   EA has invested some $700 million on an ambitious two-prong
strategy that its president, 41-year-old John Riccitiello, asserts
will propel EA to new prominence in the video- and PC game
industry. And the intensely focused, hypercompetitive Riccitiello
says the strategy could help move games beyond their core audience
(adolescent males of all ages) to become an entertainment medium in
which people can interact with others across the globe and compete
with one another in a new generation of Internet-based games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being comatose on the couch, you'll be on the couch
role-playing, fantasizing, competing, shooting or driving,''
Riccitiello said, suggesting that the TV, connected to the Net,
will become the preferred medium for online game play.
</P>
<P>
   He even predicts that the popularity of Internet-based games
could surpass the appeal of TV programming because players will
become immersed in elaborate cyberworlds rather than merely
watching someone else's drama unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll interact with other people. You'll get to date, marry,
murder _ it's all there,'' Riccitiello said. ``By next summer,
these games will start to look like legitimate competition for
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The next two months should give some indication of whether EA's
big bets can pay off.
</P>
<P>
   About half of EA's investment, or roughly $350 million, has been
spent developing an online gaming site called EA.com (www.ea.com),
which begins its first public tests later this week or early next
before its official debut in September. EA.com will be going up
against a handful of already well-established game sites and will
soon face additional competition from heavyweights like Sega and
Sony, both of which have major gaming portals planned.
</P>
<P>
   The online investment includes $81 million in cash and equity in
EA.com that the company gave to America Online to make EA.com the
exclusive operator of AOL's game channel. EA plans to spin off
EA.com as a tracking stock in the first half of 2001, Riccitiello
said.
</P>
<P>
   But those millions of dollars do not include the cost of adding
a proposed fourth and fifth building to the company's Silicon
Valley campus _ a proposed increase of 315,000 square feet of space
_ in part to accommodate the expected growth of EA.com. The local
government in Redwood City, Calif., has yet to approve the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the company has devoted three floors of an existing
building to the development of online games. In cubicles, engineers
and game writers are preparing games and setting specifications. In
a modest, early-version of the EA.com control room, two engineers
oversee large video monitors that relay traffic patterns from
several sports games EA already operates online, including the golf
games Tiger '99 and PGA Tour, of which tens of thousands of rounds
are played online each month via EA server computers.
</P>
<P>
   But online gaming is only around half the big bet. The other
half is about $350 million placed on producing games for Sony's
next console.
</P>
<P>
   In October, roughly a month after the launch of EA.com, Sony
plans to make the U.S. debut of the Playstation II videogame
console, which is already a best seller in Japan and eagerly
awaited by gamers in this country. EA has gambled heavily that the
Playstation II will be a success, surpassing the 72 million
Playstation I consoles already in use worldwide. It is, in fact,
among those predicting that sales of the new machine could
eventually exceed the 100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million spent developing games for the new Sony machine
is a major investment by game-industry standards. At the same time,
EA made a controversial decision not to make games for the Sega
Dreamcast introduced last year, deeming the system would not be
sufficiently popular to justify the $3 million to $4 million it
costs to develop individual games.
</P>
<P>
   The Playstation II will be a 128-bit machine, meaning its main
chip processes information 128 bits at a time _ or effectively
twice as fast as the 64-bit chip in the current market leader, the
Sony Playstation and the No. 2 machine, the Nintendo N64. The
128-bit speed is supposed to allow startling realism, as with car
racing games that appear to be TV footage.
</P>
<P>
   The losses that EA reported last month reflect the fact that,
for much of this year, the game industry in this country has been
in a lull _ awaiting not just a new version of the Playstation, but
also 128-bit machines expected next year from Microsoft and
Nintendo. While the lull is considered cyclical within the
industry, it has nonetheless slammed the revenues of videogame
companies, sent stock prices lower across the industry, and forced
considerable consolidation among smaller game developers.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Playstation II hits the market, the company plans
to have as many as five new games for it _ titles that include SSX
snowboard racing and Madden Football 2001. Four or five additional
new titles are in the pipeline for Christmas, which could mean that
EA may have more than half the available Playstation II titles on
the market by the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the company hopes to corner 30 percent of the game
market for the Playstation II, compared with EA's 20 percent share
for the current Sony players.
</P>
<P>
   But Riccitiello insists that EA has not put all its eggs in the
Playstation II basket. He says the company diversified beyond
videogames in the last several years by beefing up its game
business for personal computers. The PC game category now
represents 30 percent of EA's total revenue. The PC share is up
from 15 percent a year ago, an increase attributable in part to the
success of the Sims series, made by EA's Maxis subsidiary. Players
build cities, neighborhoods and control day-to-day municipal
activities in SimCity, or even control individual characters in the
most recent game, the Sims.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts, however, believe that the success of the
Playstation II titles will largely determine the success of
Electronic Arts in the next two or three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Billy Pidgeon, an analyst with the research firm Jupiter
Communications, said that EA had emerged with a stronger market
position with each transition to a new console. ``The one thing
that could hurt them is if Playstation II doesn't do well,''
Pidgeon said, ``but that's hard to imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Internet gambit that presents an even riskier and
more complex challenge, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of playing computer and videogames online is nothing
new. In fact, online gaming is brimming with competitors, including
uproar.com, iWin.com, Zone.com, a site operated by Microsoft, and
WON.net, which has an extensive following. These, like at least the
initial version of EA.com, are meant for use with PCs. And some
analysts say EA will need to demonstrate it can compete in this
league.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kasavin, senior editor at Gamespot.com, an online
publication about electronic games, said that so far, EA's online
offerings, including a medieval, role-playing fantasy world called
Ultima Online, had been harder to use than many of its competitors'
services.
</P>
<P>
   But David Cole, an industry analyst and president of DFC
Intelligence, a San Diego market research firm, said the online
game market was still too new and unproven to predict winners and
losers. ``Right now, the online gaming market is fairly spread
out,'' he said. ``There is no dominant player.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said that Electronic Arts had put EA.com in a good position
by aligning it with with AOL. ``The key to online games is
distribution,'' he said, ``and with AOL they have the key
distribution point.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides operating as a separate Web site, EA.com will be the
``game channel'' on America Online, which will receive 4 percent of
the channel's revenue _ with the first $81 million in payments
already accounted for in the recent stock and cash transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Riccitiello sees an expanding opportunity in more
powerful videogame consoles and PCs, as well as faster Internet
connections. He notes that people are already playing basic parlor
games and others with simple graphics and action, like pong, on
current computer-based game sites that draw between 5 million and 6
million people. More sophisticated, realistic-looking online play
could double the size of the $13 billion videogame market in the
next five years, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity ``is on a curve pointing to the sky, and the
content is miserable,'' Riccitiello said. ``EA is going to change
all that.''
</P>
<P>
   The EA.com site will begin with 50 games, which will include
basic parlor and card games, and sports titles like Running Back
Challenge, a relatively simple game in which players try to evade a
computer-operated tackler. The company concedes it will be several
months before EA.com includes more elaborate, graphics-intensive
games.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming all goes well with the initial free trial of EA.com,
Electronic Arts plans to begin charging money for some levels of
access. Some of the games will remain free. But for the more
elaborate ones, the company plans to use a subscription model,
possibly with two tiers costing $4.95 and $9.95 a month
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Besides vying with the existing online game operators,
Electronic Arts will also be wading into online competition with
both Sony and Sega, which are also leading producers of game
software. (Nintendo, the other big console maker, also intends for
its upcoming 128-bit console, known as Dolphin, to have online
access and is exploring plans to have a gaming site.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sony Online Entertainment division operates the Station
(www.station.sony.com), a PC-based game portal offering games like
Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy online. And the Playstation division
plans to introduce an online component for the Playstation II, once
high-speed, or broadband, connections are more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Sega plans to open its own game site on Sept. 7. Sega's site
will be designed for use only with its Sega Dreamcast consoles. If
users commit to buying two years of Internet access from the
company's SegaNet service, for $21.95 a month, Sega will give them
Dreamcasts at no additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the intensity of the online play, the offline battle
promises to get nasty between EA and Sega.
</P>
<P>
   EA executives are predicting the Sega site will have limited
demand, since it restricts the potential audience to Dreamcast
owners. But Sega officials fire back that Electronic Arts will be
unable to offer consistently high-quality, realistic game play
because the company has no control over the type of hardware its
players will be using.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bellfield, a spokesman for Sega of America, said he had
played early versions of EA.com in a closed beta test _ a sort of
private dress rehearsal. The ``experience is awful,'' he said. ``EA
has not been able to rectify that, because it is always dependent
on the hardware'' owned by its users, Bellfield said.
</P>
<P>
   EA executives, meanwhile, say Sega had no business exploring
their company's private beta test. ``It's like breaking into
Lockheed in the '80s, seeing the B2 bomber sketched on the back of
a napkin and predicting it'll never fly,'' said Jeff Brown, an EA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Sega has handcuffed itself by dedicating its
online play to its own hardware. ``Building a site that is tied to
a poor-selling console starts with a tremendous handicap _ they are
building for a limited audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sniping no doubt traces to EA's decision not to develop
games for the 128-bit Sega Dreamcast, which has had sales of 2
million consoles in the United States since its introduction a year
ago, and 5.5 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 2001, Nintendo is expected to introduce Dolphin,
while Microsoft plans to jump into the fray with its 128-bit
console, the X-Box, around the same time. Riccitiello predicted
those companies could each sell 50 to 60 million consoles, and he
said EA was discussing with Microsoft and Nintendo whether to
produce games for their new machines. (Nintendo has sold about 28
million N64 consoles worldwide).
</P>
<P>
   People close to Electronic Arts expect the company to support
those platforms, and not only because they could generate
significant sales. If Nintendo and Microsoft do not thrive, Sony
could end up with no viable competition for the Playstation II,
which in turn could allow Sony to charge higher licensing rates to
videogame makers like EA that make software for its console.
</P>
<P>
   And over the long haul, healthy competition could stimulate
continued technological improvement in the machines _ which,
combined with high-speed Internet connections, could bring ever
more lifelike online play. Or so Riccitiello hopes.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to describe a day, not too far in the future, when
instead of tuning in to ABC or NBC, couch potatoes will turn to EA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, based on a mountain of evidence, that if we can
create a sports game that also is a place for you to live 24 hours
a day, seven days a week, you might actually have a better life in
cyberspace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if that happens, Riccitiello is betting that EA can have a
better life in cyberspace, too.

 &HT;    CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND AOL MERGER, TIME WARNER CHIEF SAYS
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Time Warner Chairman Gerald M. Levin came out
swinging at his critics Monday, saying they don't understand the
nature of his company's proposed merger with America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and consumer advocates who worry about the creation
of a new monopoly have ``such (a) misperception about what this is
about,'' Levin said at a high-tech conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is not intended to create a monopoly over what
content consumers can receive, but rather to vastly expand the
choices of programming and to enhance communication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, there won't be any distinction'' between television
and the Internet, he said. ``Because in fact, what we are creating
is really the first Internet-powered media-communications company
of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   By this fall, federal regulators will understand that and
approve the deal, he said. ``I don't think there are any regulatory
issues,'' he said. ``There are no business overlaps'' that would
put a choke hold on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Aspen Summit, Levin spoke on the topic of
``convergence,'' the idea that TV, telephones and the Internet are
coming together. The conference is sponsored by the Progress &AMP;
Freedom Foundation, a non-profit organization that does research on
the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Levin recounted how Time-Warner began experimenting with two-way
television long ago. ``In the early '90s, I was obsessed by the
notion of interactive television,'' he said. Though those early
tests didn't pan out technologically, they ``convinced me that
interactive, digital capability will eventually be what consumers
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in January 2000, he saw the chance to move toward
``convergence'' through a merger with AOL, the No.1 Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very big idea,'' he said, ``a watershed,'' because it
would combine Time Warner's vast media and cable operations with
AOL's 23 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Levin will become chief executive of AOL Time Warner Inc. AOL's
leader, Steve Case, will serve as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   When he first evaluated the proposal to have AOL essentially buy
Time Warner, he was befuddled because the online upstart was much
smaller in terms of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   As he studied AOL's high-flying stock price, he said he had to
ask himself: ``Is that a fluke? Is there substance to these
valuations? So I had to take a long walk in the woods to try and
figure this out.''
</P>
<P>
   When he concluded the deal made sense, ``I was affirming the
value, and the sustainability and the growth trajectory that the
Internet was going to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin says he is taking a gamble, but believes he will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am betting my company _ a very significant company,
everything from Time Magazine to Gone with the Wind _ on this
reality of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The merged company hopes to put itself at the center of the
convergence revolution with a black box about the size of a
briefcase. The box connects to a TV and a telephone line and allows
subscribers to a new service, called AOLTV, to surf the Internet
with a wireless keyboard write and send e-mail, and flash instant
messages on the same screen where they are watching television.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, AOL has been rolling out the service in eight test
markets from Baltimore to Sacramento. Within four years, nearly a
third of U.S. households will have access to interactive
television, according to projections by Jupiter Communications
Inc., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the merger fear that the future of
next-generation television could get locked up in one company's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Many ``old media'' competitors, especially the Walt Disney Co.,
NBC Inc. and USA Networks Inc., have been warning the Federal
Communications Commission that AOL Time Warner would be able to use
its cable wires to force AOL TIme Warner services and programming
on captive consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments don't ``make any sense at all,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of commentary that we are going to take
Time Warner content and it's going to be exclusively available on
AOL,'' he said. But that would never happen ``because no one has a
monopoly on creativity. And the consumer is in charge, and the
consumer is going to go where there is the best material.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, AOL would never tie its online services too closely to
Time Warner because it wants to serve all Americans, whether their
neighborhoods are served by Time Warner cable or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL's future, like the past and present of (Time Warner
networks) HBO, CNN, TBS, is to get on every platform possible,
whether that is cable, DSL, fixed wireless or satellite,'' Levin
said.

WIRELESS INTERNET CASTS ITS SHADOW (AND SUBSTANCE) IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the plates of spicy raw tuna and wasabi-crusted
tofu were cleared from the table of a Greenwich Village restaurant
one recent evening, discussion turned to probably the hottest topic
among New York entrepreneurs these days: the wireless Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the talent?'' asked Tyler Daines, a venture capitalist
who is backing a wireless Web start-up with offices in Manhattan
and Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the killer app?'' asked Gordon Gould, chief executive
of a mobile communications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why isn't this discussion taking place in California?'' asked
Andrew Seybold, a Silicon Valley wireless consultant and
industry-newsletter publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all these questions lies in New York, which is
emerging as the nation's center for wireless Internet applications,
financing and advertising. Eager to expunge the dot-com taint _ the
volatile stock valuations based on questionable, pure-play Internet
business models _ much of Silicon Alley is recasting itself in a
wireless role.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a new buzzword to describe the scene: unstrung.
</P>
<P>
   The unstrung are undaunted by some experts' gloomy forecasts
that the wireless Internet might never live up to its billing if
consumers are turned off by the current, bland offerings of e-mail
or sports scores _ served up as scanty lines of text on the tiny
screens of cellular phones and other mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, more than two dozen New York wireless Internet
companies have been created in the last year or so. The rookie
lineup includes Savos, which delivers Internet music and other
Web-based audio to mobile phones; SmartRay, a portal seeking be the
wireless Yahoo; and Upoc, which focuses on Internet text-messaging
services intended for young wireless phone enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast remains the locus of wireless technology
development. And there are many more wireless Internet services and
applications already up and running in Europe _ eagerly embraced by
people weary of balky wired telephone networks. But it is New York
that has become the fertile breeding ground for new uses and
services through wireless hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impetus is geographic. ``Manhattan has the potential
to be the center of deals between the U.S. and Europe, where the
wireless phenomenon is much stronger,'' said Mark Caron, chief
executive of MobileSpring, a so-called incubator company in New
York that is focused on wireless start-ups. What's more, he said,
``the level of creativity here is unequaled.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is New York's standing as a major
money center. A host of financiers with operations in New York are
focusing on the wireless Internet, with big players including
Flatiron Partners, a venture capital firm that has had ties with
Chase Manhattan and Softbank of Japan. Others, like Nokia Venture
Partners, the investment arm of the Finnish mobile phone giant
Nokia, are preparing to set up New York offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is getting hot very quickly,'' said Tom Kenney, a
principal at Nokia Venture Partners, who plans to move the firm's
East Coast base to New York from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The field is so new and so much in flux that no one pretends to
have firm figures on investments, jobs created or even the number
of new wireless Internet companies in New York. But many with money
agree that the mobile Internet is one of the few Net-related areas
that continues to solicit strong interest among entrepreneurs and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were among the first to carve out a space in the area,''
said Seth Goldstein of Flatiron Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The New York wireless scene is buzzing, so much so that an
online magazine has been created to cover it all: the magazine,
Unstrung, seeks to blend the sophistication of Wallpaper, an
architecture and design magazine, with the attention to detail of
trade publications like Wireless Week. Unstrung's motto is ``tied
to nothing but the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the cusp where the kids in sandals at the dot-coms
are turning their attention to wireless,'' said Josh Newman, a
former schoolteacher in the South Bronx, who help found Unstrung
and serves as its top editor. ``The opportunity to cover this
potentially huge niche was looking us right in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoking Newman's hope that Unstrung can hit it big was a panel
discussion about the wireless Internet last month held by the New
York New Media Association at NYU. The event's organizers had to
turn away about 200 people after the crowd reached the fire
marshal's limit of 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   Many were employees at Silicon Alley dot-coms who were hoping to
learn more about what was being touted as the next big thing. A
good many others were from other walks of life _ just curious about
a subject that true believers discuss with equal parts grandeur and
jargon. (``Talk spurt'' and ``location-based services'' are two
favorites in the unstrung lexicon.)
</P>
<P>
   Some people in New York's wireless Internet scene, think that
the buzz surrounding the young industry _ including the verbiage _
is risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that the hype level, combined with the lack of
knowledge about the limitations of the wireless Internet, could
turn people off in the same way pure Internet plays are falling out
of favor,'' said Brian Bodell, head of marketing strategies at
Mobile Metrics, a company providing advertising services for
wireless users. ``That's why you rarely see a wireless Internet
company with a dot-com in their name and why many companies want to
show they're not betting all their chips on wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   But certainly some established Silicon Alley Web development
companies see advantages in having a stake in wireless. For
instance, Razorfish and Agency.com, two players with international
reach that help companies develop and roll out their Web
operations, are expanding their New York wireless operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until six or eight weeks ago, we had no concrete wireless
plans for North America'' said David Eastman, Agency's head of
mobile business for Europe, during a recent trip to New York. ``But
now, we're ready to promote a knowledge bleed from London to New
York because this is where the action is.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the pure-play mobile Internet start-ups, New York's best
known so far may be Vindigo, which provides maps and information
from publications like the Zagat restaurant guides, for use on Palm
hand-helds and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   The service is not yet a true wireless Internet application,
because users must download the material through a standard,
land-line Internet connection. But the information is formatted for
relatively easy searching and reading on a hand-held device, and
the company plans to offer wireless updating as network technology
evolves.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100,000 people have downloaded the company's city guides
in six months in New York and four other urban regions, making
Vindigo one of the first applications of its kind to show potential
of spreading ``virally'' _ by word of mouth, or mouse _ and with
little formal advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating the technology which will allow content
providers to extend their brand to the wireless realm,'' said Jason
Devitt, 31, who left a job selling derivatives at D.E. Shaw, a
technology-focused investment bank, to become Vindigo's chief
executive last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' Devitt said, pointing to the frenzied activity
in Vindigo's disheveled headquarters in a gutted building in the
garment district. ``We have no time to pause and think about
whether we're going to be a big part of the location-based services
segment because we're already there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Vindigo offers a glimpse of an industry poised for
takeoff, most wireless Internet companies in New York are in the
early stages of development _ ``stealth mode,'' as people familiar
with the start-ups put it. Few have advanced beyond the first
stages of financing provided by venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sense that new applications can evolve well beyond
stock quotes or short e-mail has some people believing that local
companies have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Connolly, director of Ericsson CyberLab, a research and
development company set up in New York's financial district by the
Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson, said that ``with the
mobile Internet, it seems the transition from technology to
services is happening faster than it happened on the Web, and thus
the services focus that New York has plays a large role.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the advantage of being close to the television,
publishing, telecommunications and financial industries of New York
is a lure for anyone seeking to hop on the wireless Internet
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   But given the industry's current limitations, there is a chance
that companies focusing on applications for the wireless Internet
might be in for the rough road traveled by many a struggling
content provider for the hard-wired Web.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there are two definitions of ``unstrung'' in the
American Heritage Concise Dictionary. One is ``having the strings
loosened or removed.'' The other is ``emotionally upset.''

ADVERTISERS TURN TO SPECIALISTS TO HANDLE E-MAIL MARKETING
CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SUSAN STELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among Internet companies struggling to retain customers they
have worked so hard to get, e-mail marketing is seen as the next
best thing to being on the home page each time a customer goes
online.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, e-mail is a relatively inexpensive marketing tool,
ranging from a penny to a quarter per message, compared to $1 to $2
per piece for direct-mail campaigns in the actual world. Moreover,
e-mail provides immediate results, no small factor in an industry
where speed is critical.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the results of an e-mail campaign can be measured,
right down to the number of people who opened the message, clicked
on each link, made a purchase or forwarded the e-mail to a friend _
that is, assuming the sender has the technology to track all of
this data.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the catch. Conducting an effective e-mail
campaign is a lot more complicated than opening a new message in an
e-mail program, copying a list of customer names, typing an offer
and clicking the ``send'' button. In fact, those who manage e-mail
marketing efforts say the challenges range from basic privacy
issues, like getting permission to send e-mail to customers, to
technical hurdles in composing, sending and tracking large volumes
of mail.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, an industry has emerged to help marketers
manage their e-mail strategy, from companies that function as
application service providers, housing the infrastructure to
deliver and track e-mail campaigns, to those that license or sell
software to run e-mail campaigns. According to Forrester Research,
the market for these types of services will reach $4.8 billion a
year by 2004, up from $156 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dozens of companies hoping to benefit from this
opportunity is FloNetwork, an application service provider in
Toronto offering e-mail campaign management. The company, which has
been in business since 1993, has been focusing on e-mail services
since 1998 and now has 185 clients, including J.Crew, Continental
Airlines and Buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Brady, vice president of strategy and partnerships at
FloNetwork, said many clients had initially handled their e-mail
marketing efforts in-house, but turned to a vendor as their needs
outgrew their ability to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of the issues e-marketers face, Brady cited
formatting marketing messages so they can be read by a variety of
e-mail software, developing a system to track the response to each
campaign, and dealing with the volume of incoming mail that results
from a mass mailing, including messages that bounce back because of
invalid addresses and requests to be removed from a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is in-bound mail that most people don't think
about,'' she said. ``It's not sexy, but it's a real fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle is establishing relationships with the major
Internet service providers, like America Online, Hotmail and Yahoo.
To stem the sheer volume of unsolicited commercial mail their
members receive, many services have systems that detect and even
block bulk mailings sent into their networks. As a result, Brady
said, mass mailers often have to demonstrate they are legitimate
enterprises to make sure their e-mails reach the intended
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we'd call AOL to say, `We're going to be sending out
a million messages to AOL customers on behalf of XYZ company,'''
she said. ``And they'd say, `Great, thanks for letting us know.'
After a while we ended up establishing more formalized
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   FloNetwork and its competitors also offer technology enabling
clients to customize e-mail messages for each recipient. For
example, Barnesandnoble.com, which works with FloNetwork and
another e-mail service provider, CheetahMail, originally handled
its e-mail efforts in-house, offering customers the option to sign
up for e-mail newsletters on topics such as ``fiction'' or
``bestsellers.'' When Barnesandnoble.com decided to tap into its
customer database and send e-mails targeted to customers based on
that information, it chose to work with a vendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we really needed a partner because we wanted to
work with someone with strong technology,'' said Roe Johnson,
Barnesandnoble.com's director of online marketing. ``By using
dynamic content personalization, we're able to send someone who
lives near Union Square an announcement about a book signing in
that store.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the complexity of delivering customized messages is one
of the main reasons marketers choose to work with a technology
company specializing in e-mail services. For Wine.com, an Internet
wine retailer that merged last week with Wineshopper.com, the
ability to send highly targeted e-mail messages to customers has
sharply improved the effectiveness of the company's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Jim LaBelle, vice president of marketing for Wine.com, said that
when the company started doing e-mail marketing, it sent an e-mail
newsletter showcasing the same selection of wines to its entire
customer base. Working with Digital Impact, an e-marketing services
provider based in San Mateo, Calif., LaBelle said the company was
able to use its database on customers' purchase history to create
customized e-mail messages based on the type of wine or price range
each shopper purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've found one of our customers only buys Italian reds
above $20, why barrage him with other ideas?'' LaBelle said. The
more personalized approach, he noted, ``has resulted in a doubling
of the revenue yielded from each newsletter.''
</P>
<P>
   William Park, chairman and chief executive of Digital Impact,
said this type of return on investment is what his company
emphasizes when approaching prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of ownership is huge for companies doing it
themselves because they don't have economies of scale,'' Park said.
Among those costs are sophisticated hardware and software systems
to handle both outbound and inbound e-mail, Internet service
charges, and marketing and research employees to analyze data and
fine-tune campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The company works with more than 140 clients, including
Fidelity, Travelocity and Tower Records, and sent more than 400
million messages last quarter on their behalf. Digital Impact
typically charges 2 cents to 5 cents per e-mail message sent,
depending on the degree of personalization required and the volume
of mail the client sends.
</P>
<P>
   Park acknowledged that many companies are hesitant to outsource
their e-mail marketing efforts to a vendor. ``When we are competing
to win business,'' he said, the in-house technology department is
``generally the biggest competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   One company that manages its own e-mail campaigns is
eHobbies.com, a privately held Web site for hobbyists based in
Santa Monica, Calif. The site, which features 11 hobby categories,
sends two mailings a month to members who have signed up to receive
e-mail newsletters in a particular category.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Greenberg, vice president of online marketing for eHobbies,
said the company decided to purchase e-mail software from
MessageMedia, rather than rely entirely on third parties for its
e-mail efforts. One of the main reasons for that decision, he said,
was a reluctance to share customer information with a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that comfortable exposing our database to an outside
vendor,'' Greenberg said. Purchasing software to use in-house also
allowed eHobbies to have more control over the process of sending
mailings, he said, adding, ``With outsourcing, you're beholden to
another company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that handling everything in-house has
required more staffing, and that there have been ``some growing
pains,'' Greenberg said he was happy with the results, citing high
click-through rates and purchases in response to the company's
e-mail campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   What works for a particular company, he said, depends in part on
internal resources. ``We're fortunate to have the talent to be able
to do this in-house,'' he said. ``Not everybody has that.''

ON GNUTELLA SYSTEM, MANY TAKE FILES BUT FEW GIVE ANY BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Software programs like Napster and Gnutella
have achieved a reputation for fostering a communal spirit of
sharing among millions of music-loving computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The reality may be more selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Two scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center have
surveyed the behavior of anonymous music downloaders on the
Internet and have found that, rather than demonstrating a ``from
each, to each'' ethos, most Internet users are only taking files
and not giving any back to their electronic community.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of use of the Gnutella system during a 24-hour period
this month was conducted by Eytan Adar and Bernardo A. Huberman.
They said their research demonstrates that ``free riding'' is the
most common behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The result, they said, is a ``tragedy of the digital commons.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, if only a few users are providing files, they
would require inordinate bandwidth to meet all the requests, so the
system would be more sluggish than one where all users contributed
equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since files on Gnutella are treated like a public good and the
users are not charged in proportion to their use, it appears
rational for people to download music files without contributing by
making their own files accessible to other users,'' they wrote.
``Because every individual can reason this way and free ride on the
efforts of others, the whole system's performance can degrade
considerably _ which makes everyone worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   The results also indicate that Gnutella may not be immune from
the legal challenges facing the Napster service. Unlike Napster,
Gnutella has no single database under centralized control. But the
researchers found that the core users providing music through
Gnutella are a concentrated group.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 25 percent of the Gnutella users serve about 98 percent
of the files,'' said Adar, a Xerox computer scientist who
specializes in profiling the Internet. Moreover, the researchers
found that one percent _ 314 computers _of the users in their
survey provided 40 percent of all files made available during the
survey period.
</P>
<P>
   Those providing music through Gnutella are identifiable to other
users by their Internet protocol addresses, so the biggest
providers of files could potentially be made targets of a legal
action that could cripple the network.
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox survey was based on the activity of 31,395 computer
users who shared 3,019,405 files during a 24-hour period over a
weekend earlier this month. The researchers said that there was no
way to determine the precise number of Gnutella users but that they
thought they had surveyed a substantial portion of the network.
</P>
<P>
   The research paper, posted on a Xerox World Wide Web site 
(http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/papers/gnutella/index.htm
 l), &QL; 
comes during a bitter legal fight between Napster, the most
prominent music-sharing system, and the record industry, which says
the system is a mass copyright infringement. A federal judge's
ruling that Napster must shut down has been temporarily set aside
by an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Recording industry representatives said they were studying how
to deal with the Gnutella network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically analyzing it now,'' said Cary Sherman, senior
executive vice president and general counsel for the Recording
Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   And the behavior of the Gnutella users, the Xerox researchers
said, could simply be an artifact of the way large groups function.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to secure voluntary cooperation in very large
groups,'' said Bernardo Huberman, a physicist who is a research
fellow at the Palo Alto center. ``I don't know of a single country
in the world where taxation is voluntary.''

THE NEW ECONOMY: MANUFACTURING HEADED FOR THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, it was obvious which prominent Irwin Jacobs was
the business executive exemplar of the new economy. That would be
Irwin M. Jacobs, the computer scientist and electrical engineer who
founded Qualcomm in San Diego in 1985. He built it into a thriving
Fortune 500 company through pioneering innovations in cellular
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The other Irwin Jacobs, Irwin L. Jacobs, is an irrepressible
deal-maker and bargain-hunter based in Minneapolis. He became
wealthy by taking big stakes in Fortune 500 conglomerates in the
1970s and 1980s, usually with the goal of unlocking value by
breaking them up.
</P>
<P>
   New technology was never high on Irwin L.'s list of
fascinations. His effort to sell goods directly to consumers over
the Web (wgdeal.com, for ``world's greatest deal'') was a bust. The
only major business he retains from his days as a corporate raider
_ Genmar Holdings, the nation's second-largest leisure boat
manufacturer _ is in a labor-intensive segment of the economy that
has been among the slowest to invest in new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin L.'s image may get a cybersheen at the end of this month,
though. That is when Genmar plans to hold an open house at its
Little Falls, Minn., factory to show off a compact, enclosed
computer-controlled manufacturing system that can be remotely
operated over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will see 18-foot hulls _ which used to take eight hours
to produce _ pop out every 35 minutes. Pollution, waste and labor
will be sharply reduced, while quality will be so much higher that
Genmar is offering a lifetime guarantee instead of the industry
standard of five years. Genmar says the total cost is comparable to
that for boats made by conventional techniques _ and should become
lower over time.
</P>
<P>
   Time Magazine, given a preview tour and a sales pitch on how the
system could be adapted to many other products, called it ``the
revolution in a box'' and suggested it could make large centralized
factories ``obsolete.'' Bruce Bobbins, Jacob's publicist, calls the
process, known as virtual engineered composite, or VEC, ``the most
important manufacturing revolution in the past half century.'
</P>
<P>
   The technology was invented by Gene Kirila II and Robert
McCollum, two Pennsylvanians who envision scattering leased VEC
manufacturing cells around the world that would produce products
close to where they would be used. The expertise to run the systems
could reside at a central control center thanks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was so impressed with how well the virtual engineered
composite process had fitted Genmar's needs that he bought Pyramid
Operating Systems, the company Kirila and McCollum created in 1993
to develop VEC. Genmar's control room is hundreds of miles from
Little Falls, in Greenville, Pa., where Kirila, McCollum and an
expanding team of engineers are searching for new VEC applications.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing experts say Jacobs would be justified in bragging
about the process at any high-technology gathering. Interest in VEC
could provide the fuel for taking Genmar public, a move Jacobs has
talked about for years.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs and other backers of his technology face the
temptation to oversell VEC's future. In addition to underestimating
the costs and risks other manufacturers could encounter in moving
to their new technology, proponents of the process are probably
underestimating the strengths and potential of competing
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, as the history of robotics, machine vision and other
innovations shows, computer-based technology generally seeps,
rather than bursts, into manufacturing. The bigger the
manufacturing sector the more cautious are managers to replace
proven technologies and materials with new approaches. There is no
particular reason to believe that any of VEC's attributes,
including its ability to be controlled by remote experts via the
Internet, will change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make numbers every quarter,'' said Paul Dickard, a
spokesman for Ingersoll-Rand, which has been experimenting with VEC
for several years. ``There's always the question of which quarter
you are going to sacrifice on the altar of Internet-enabled
manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet capability is central to the vision of
virtual-engineered-composite manufacturing systems which would
serve as remote minifactories that could be set up and running
within days. But that innovation, already available in different
forms on other computerized manufacturing equipment, is only part
of what makes VEC a unique package. The other key element,
developed to keep costs down, is the use of laminated plastic skins
instead of metal as the molding frames.
</P>
<P>
   The skins are attached to supports inside the VEC cell and
composite resins are injected between them. To give the skins the
rigidity that metal would usually provide, Kirila and McCollum hit
upon the elegantly simple idea of water pressure. Before the
molding compounds are injected, the cell is sealed and the cavities
behind the skins are filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   VEC is clearly innovative enough to attract many window
shoppers, but the chances that it will lead to the wide dispersal
in manufacturing that its inventors envision are slim. Plastics
manufacturing experts say Jacobs is likely to have his hands full
simply establishing the process as a reliable system in a few
segments of industry best suited to it. Logical candidates include
other marine products like jet skis as well as bathtubs and
paneling for buildings, trucks, rail cars or specialty vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's suited for about half the volume of the plastics
composites industry,'' estimates Robert Locavara, director of
technical affairs for the Composite Fabricators Association, a
trade group for companies that make industrial components and
consumer products out of fiberglass and other plastic composites.
</P>
<P>
   That could add up to billions of dollars of production, but one
thing is for sure: even if it comes to pass, it will not happen at
Internet speed.

CONSUMERS' VIEWS SPLIT ON INTERNET PRIVACY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the continuing battle between Internet companies that want to
use customers' personal information to deliver tailored
advertisements and services and privacy advocates who want stricter
controls over how this information is used, consumers themselves
appear to be of two minds.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the finding of a survey whose results were
released Sunday night by the Pew Research Center for People and the
Press, a nonprofit group. While many consumers surveyed expressed
concern about their privacy, many also said they were willing to
share personal information with the Web sites they used. And many
Internet users in the survey sample indicated that they did not
understand how their online activities were observed and did not
take advantage of tools to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which surveyed 2,117 Americans, 1,017 of whom were
Internet users, found that 86 percent of the Internet users favored
``opt in'' privacy policies, which require Internet companies to
obtain people's permission before using their personal data. This
preference is in contrast to the policy recently negotiated by the
Clinton administration, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of
Internet advertisers, which gives Web sites the right to track
visitors unless those users ``opt out'' of being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   On a similar note, 54 percent of Internet users in the survey
said that the tracking of users by a Web site was harmful because
it invaded their privacy, compared with 27 percent who described it
as helpful because it allowed sites to tailor information to
specific consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And 94 percent of the Internet users agreed that any company
that violated its privacy policy should be disciplined _ with 11
percent of the disciplinarians saying the company's owners should
be sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this hard line, the Pew survey revealed a deep pocket of
trust among Internet users. Slightly more than half said they had
provided personal information to a Web site and an additional 10
percent said they would provide it under the right circumstances.
Only 27 percent said they would never provide a Web site with
personal information. Just less than half _ 48 percent _ said they
had bought something online with a credit card and 22 percent said
they had posted personal information on online calendars or online
address books.
</P>
<P>
   As for efforts to protect their privacy, the survey indicated
that many Internet users were either unaware of how they were being
monitored online or unlikely to take steps to prevent being
tracked. The report noted that 56 percent of Internet users could
not identify the primary online tracking tool _ a ``cookie'' file
placed on a user's computer by a Web site _ and only 10 percent of
the Internet users had set their browser software to reject
cookies.

DICTIONARY PUBLISHERS SEE PROFITS ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A logomachy _  &UR; n. an argument about words &LR;  _ is brewing on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin plans to publish the fourth edition of its
American Heritage dictionary next month, the volume's first major
overhaul in eight years. The new edition is full of changes sure to
arouse lexicographers _ color illustrations, notes on slang and a
new appendix describing Semitic as well as Indo-European roots.
</P>
<P>
   But what the publisher has most excited is happening outside the
covers, as Houghton Mifflin hustles to sell electronic versions of
its dictionary for inclusion in other companies' software, Web
sites and digital publications.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin is not alone. Its major rivals _ most notably
Merriam-Webster and Microsoft Corp.'s year-old Encarta dictionary _
are all stepping up their digital dictionary efforts to tap an
increasingly lucrative market, setting up a business contest that
philologists say will also have consequences for the way Americans
use English.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic novels may be making headlines these days, but
electronic dictionaries are actually making money. At Houghton
Mifflin, digital dictionary licensing is expected to account for
more than $1 million in profit this year, more than 10 percent of
the earnings from the company's trade and reference division,
according to Wendy Strothman, the division's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Stifled for years by low margins and flat sales, dictionary
publishers are salivating over digital sales and licensing as a new
source of revenue growth, promoting flashy new features like
audible pronunciations. But word scholars worry that the new
pressures of the online market may end up favoring well-connected
or well-positioned dictionaries _ some sniffingly cite Microsoft's
Encarta _ over more authoritative lexicons.
</P>
<P>
   Many lexicographers initially saw the advent of the Internet as
a terrific new tool, especially because it made possible electronic
texts of nearly infinite length. That impulse inspired the Oxford
University Press, for example, to revise its 20-volume Oxford
English Dictionary for the first time since its completion in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   A new online version of the OED is available to subscribers for
fees starting at $550 a year. Researchers are posting the revisions
and additions online in stages, and they expect to finish the
alphabet in about 40 volumes around 2010. Oxford University Press
has not yet decided if it will publish a new printed version, too,
said Jesse Sheidlower, its American editor.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also enables rival dictionary compilers to share a
common digital ``corpus,'' or archive of usage samples. Inspired by
the British National Corpus that was established in 1993, a group
of publishers and linguists based in New York is raising funds and
gathering material to build an American National Corpus of 100
million words in texts of all kinds, including transcript,
newspapers and novels.
</P>
<P>
   But the American National Corpus has yet to win help from many
of the nation's big dictionary publishers, who would stand to lose
the advantage of their own proprietary archives. ``We think we have
our needs pretty well served,'' said John Morse, president and
publisher of the Merriam-Webster, the United States' oldest and
best-selling dictionary, with an archive of more than 15 million
citations.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web is also a gold mine for linguistic research.
For the first time, scholars can trace the infancy of new words as
they bubble up from narrow subcultures through online discussion
groups and eventually into general use, said Michael Adams, a
professor at Albright College in Pennsylvania and editor of the
journal Dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Adams recently published a study of new coinages from the
television show ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' _ ``slayage'' and many
other -age formations, for example _ tracking their progress from
teen-age fans' Web sites to magazines like Mademoiselle. He argues
that Buffy has also spawned novel uses of ``much,'' as in
``pathetic much?'' ``morbid much?'' or ``Having issues much?''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's Encarta dictionary, billed as the first lexicon
for the Digital Age, has some lexicographers shaking their heads,
partly because they worry that it could indeed be the dictionary of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Encarta was born in the early 1990s, when Nigel
Newton, chief executive of the British publishing house Bloomsbury,
wrote Bill Gates a letter proposing to create a dictionary of
``world English.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Microsoft was paying Houghton-Mifflin to license
online versions of its American Heritage dictionary to use in
Microsoft's spell-checking software and to bundle with its Encarta
digital encyclopedia. Why pay Houghton-Mifflin, Newton suggested,
when the two companies could build a wordbook of their own?
Bloomsbury developed the dictionary, selling international digital
rights to Microsoft and the American rights to Holtzbrincks' St.
Martins Press.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture faced long odds in bookstores. Most American
consumers traditionally want a red dictionary with the name Webster
on the cover _ as in Merriam-Webster, Random House's Webster's, and
IDG Books' Webster's New World, says John Sargent, president of
Holtzbrinck's American operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the new dictionary's publishers are betting that Microsoft's
commanding position in the software market can make Encarta's name
and black cover even more ubiquitous. ``Our thinking was that,
given its use in Microsoft software, the Encarta brand would over
time become the leading reference brand,'' Sargent said. The
electronic version is available for sale with some Microsoft
software or for free at www.encarta.com
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Encarta will in fact become the new Webster
is precisely what is eating many linguists. In a forthcoming review
in the journal Dictionaries, Sidney I. Landau, author of
``Dictionaries: The Art &AMP; Craft of Lexicography,'' roundly pans
Encarta's ``cumbersome, repetitious and inconsistent style'' and
especially what he sees as its excessive political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Indian,'' an example Landau notes, is described in
other dictionaries as potentially insensitive but also widely used
among Native Americans and inextricably woven into terms like
``Indian summer.'' The Encarta issues a blanket condemnation,
calling the term ``offensive'' several times. In a few cases, the
Encarta Web site even interrupts the viewer with a ``language
advisory'' before even displaying a potentially offensive word, as
if it were a lewd movie. Such labels, Landau says, reverse most
lexicographers' understanding of their job _ to report in neutral
terms the changing shape of the language.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, another Encarta critic, worries that Encarta will succeed
despite its flaws and at the expense of its rivals. ``The problem
is that if they don't put out the best possible dictionary, because
of the access they have through the Microsoft software, they could
very well depress the sales of the four major publishers,'' said
Adams, who has worked as a consultant to American Heritage. ``Good
dictionaries would disappear and we would be left with an inferior
dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and its partners dismiss the criticism as predictable
nitpicking. Every new or different dictionary has met a similar
response from professional lexicographers, said Holtzbrinck's
Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton-Mifflin, Microsoft's previous digital dictionary
supplier, was the publisher with the most to lose from the Encarta
dictionary, which Microsoft this year began using instead of the
American Heritage. Houghton-Mifflin's Wendy Strothman said that new
digital licensing deals had ``more than made up for the loss of
that revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Strothman says Houghton-Mifflin prepares customized versions of
its digital database for a variety of clients, seeking to
capitalize on the recent interest in electronic publishing by
embedding its dictionary in electronic books or reading software.
Readers can look up any word with a click.
</P>
<P>
   When half a million fans downloaded copies of Stephen King's
electronic novella ``Riding the Bullet'' in March, for example,
some of the software programs for displaying it included a digital
version of the American Heritage dictionary, and Houghton-Mifflin
received a small royalty on each. This fall, the digital publisher
netLibrary will begin including American Heritage dictionaries with
its e-books, paying a sliding scale fee for its use. (Microsoft's
new Reader software, however, includes a version of Encarta.)
</P>
<P>
   A number of Web sites, including www.dictionary.com, have even
paid Houghton-Mifflin for use of its digital dictionary to provide
free spellings and definitions on the Web, hoping to attract
viewers and sell advertising. ``They are welcome to do that, but
our content costs us money and we want to get paid for it,''
Strothman said. ``What puzzles me is why our competitors put their
own dictionaries up on the Web for free.'' Houghton-Mifflin sells
its dictionary on CD-ROM, but does not put it on a Web site of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   That position has cost the company some business. Paul J.J.
Payack, chief executive of the newly formed company
yourDictionary.com, initially favored licensing American Heritage,
he says, because he liked its etymologies and simple definitions.
But he did not like Houghton-Mifflin's licensing-only strategy. He
wanted a dictionary that would boost his brand by building its own,
so he struck a deal with Merriam-Webster instead.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster has taken a radically different tack from
American Heritage, giving its dictionary away for free on its own
Web site (www.m-w.com) while at the same time trying to license it
to whomever it can, including America Online and the hand-held
computer maker Franklin Electronic Publishers, among others.
Recently, it also managed to strike a deal to display its Web site
on Palm devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Houghton-Mifflin, we are just a dictionary publisher,''
said Morse, of Merriam-Webster. ``We aim mainly to promote the
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The main Merriam-Webster Web site and a related site for
children offer word games and offers a free word-of-the-day e-mail
with usage and etymology tips. Morse said the site was now getting
about 20 million page views a month, at a rate of about 50,000
look-ups an hour during the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster also tracks which words users look up for
guidance in making revisions. This month's hot word: ``chutzpah,''
spurred by press coverage of vice-presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But not all lexicographers are happy about the proliferation of
Merriam-Webster's definitions online, either. ``The Merriam-Webster
is fantastic but least suited for most people who use it,'' said
Sheidlower, the American editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
``Its definitions are much more complicated and more difficult than
the other major dictionaries. The other dictionaries are accurate,
and you can use them without going nuts.''

JAPANESE WEB SITES NAVIGATE A SERENE REVENUE STREAM

 By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO -- Spurred by growing Internet use in Japan, Kazutomo Hori
in 1995 built Paradise Web, an Internet site that offered chat
lines and bulletin boards. The service thrived, but Hori could not
figure out how to get users to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talked about obtaining revenue from advertisements and
charging users with electronic money,'' said Hori, who considered
asking customers to make bank transfers or even send in stamps for
payment. ``But when will that happen? Ten years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hori's anxious days are over. Early in 1999, Japanese
wireless communications carriers, including NTT DoCoMo, DDI Corp.
and Japan Telecom Co., introduced mobile-phone-based Internet
services. The wireless Web not only increased the time people could
spend on the Internet, it gave Hori, 34, and other service
providers an easy way to collect subscription fees -- through
customers' mobile phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new business model'' for information providers on the
Internet, said Toby Rodes, an analyst with Nikko Salomon Smith
Barney in Tokyo. ``With the PC, they made a mistake and put up all
the contents for free, and you can't go back and start charging
people. With mobile Internet, there will always be price for
content.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the Japanese model can be transplanted
to North America and Europe, where markets are more fragmented and
customer tastes vary. To hedge their bets, however, foreign
companies including Yahoo and Intel have invested in some Japanese
wireless Web businesses to tap growth here or investigate the
possibility of duplicating services in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have been doing the same. NTT DoCoMo, Japan's
largest wireless carrier and the originator of the greatly popular
i-mode wireless Web service in this country, is in talks with
BellSouth and SBC Communications of the United States about
acquiring a minority stake in a wireless phone venture created by
the two regional Bell companies. NTT DoCoMo is also a partner of
one of the winning bidders for licenses to operate new
third-generation wireless services just auctioned in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the relative ease of collecting fees for wireless
Internet services has created an entrepreneurial boom. Dozens of
services, from restaurant guides to surf forecasts, have already
captured large numbers of users and new ones are announced almost
daily -- offering games, weather, traffic information, stock
quotes, even cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet companies in the United States struggle to
generate profits, many Japanese mobile-phone content providers are
in the black within months of going into business. They simply add
their fees, usually less than $5 a month, to their subscribers'
cellular phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of wireless Web services in Japan has mirrored the
success of mobile phones linked to the Internet. Since NTT DoCoMo
started its i-mode wireless Web service a year and a half ago,
almost 10 million subscribers have signed up. Two other cellular
groups, Japan Telecom Co. and three carriers due to merge into KDDI
Corp. in October, count 1.7 million and 3 million users,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo says it has more than 19,000 Web sites designed for
i-mode users. (Web sites must be formatted for Web phone use, and
each carrier adopts a different standard.)
</P>
<P>
   Cybird Co., of which Hori is president, offers 50 services to
mobile Web surfers, and has discontinued Paradise Web, its
unprofitable Internet site designed for personal computer users.
One of Cybird's most popular offerings, Nami-Densetsu, charges each
of its 85,000 subscribers 300 yen, or $2.77, a month for the wave
conditions at 147 points on Japan's coasts as well as a guide to
surf events and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Hori said most of his wireless Web projects are profitable
within several months of being introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Bandai Co., a toy maker that created the blockbuster Tamagotchi
digital pet, runs Japan's most popular mobile Internet service, a
year-old Web site called Charappa. For a monthly fee of 100 yen,
1.3 million subscribers can embellish their cell phones with
copyrighted screen-saver images of popular musicians or cartoon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers, many of them teen-agers, are happy to pay. ``It's
cute,'' said Sei Yoshida, a 17-year-old Tokyo high school student,
who showed off the image of her favorite singer, Ringo Shiina.
</P>
<P>
   One reason people who resist paying for services on their
personal computers are willing to subscribe to wireless Web
services is convenience. Not only can they pay without giving
credit card information over the Internet, but they can also find
reliable information more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Each phone company provides subscribers with a menu of services
tailored to their interests. These menus let customers sign on to a
service with a click of a button rather than finding and typing in
a complete Web address. Service providers are also vetted by the
phone companies before being added to the menu, giving consumers
added confidence in what they are buying. In Japan, an offer to buy
a celebrity's jacket or other personal effect on the Web might be
greeted skeptically if someone came across it while surfing the Net
on a desktop computer, Hori of Cybird said. ``Would anybody trust
it?'' he asked. ``But if it's on a carrier's official menu, most
people would believe it -- and 99.9 percent of the time, the thing
is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers and sellers can be confident about wireless Web
transactions, he added, because both sides of each transaction are
vetted by the phone company --sellers when they seek to join the
official menu, and buyers when they sign a contract for wireless
service.
</P>
<P>
   While customers can type in any Web address, the small,
10-button keypads on mobile phones make that burdensome. The
tailored menu offered by the carrier has become the preferred
destination for most Web phone surfers and has given the carrier
the power of life and death over the content providers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It makes a world of difference'' whether you are on the
carrier's menu or not, said Osamu Matsueda, who edits the wireless
version of Web pages for Recruit Co., which publishes employment
ads and provides a service notifying individual job seekers of
openings in their fields. Recruit supplies both official and
unofficial contents for NTT DoCoMo, which has about 800 types of
games and services on the menu of its i-mode service.
</P>
<P>
   On the cellular phone, ``people don't necessarily assume that
the service would be free,'' said Tsuyoshi Kuwabara, research
director at Wit Capital Japan. ``And the fact that the carrier
collects money for the content providers is crucial. Not having a
solid way to collect money is what makes start-up firms
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for wireless Web services, Kuwabara said, is
that being on the menu of a popular service like i-mode obviates
the need for advertising, since users often saunter into sites
without any soliciting. In a boon to copyright-conscious content
owners like record companies and publishers, the wireless Web
offers protection not known on the PC-based Internet. Since the
carrier controls the hardware and adopts the specifications, users
cannot easily duplicate digital data that is distributed to
cellular terminals.
</P>
<P>
   As promising as the wireless Web in Japan is for entrepreneurs
selling services, the biggest winners may be the phone companies
themselves as customers clock up hundreds of extra minutes a month
while surfing the Net. One entrepreneur estimated that NTT DoCoMo,
through air-time fees, makes 10 to 20 times what he does from his
service. DoCoMo also collects 9 percent of what service providers
charge their customers, for acting as middleman and bill collector.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur said that at some future point, his company
hoped to negotiate terms for it to receive at least 5 percent of
the revenue from the calling fees charged to use his service.
</P>
<P>
   Others are also eager to tap this market. Bandai has received
dozens of requests from European carriers to discuss how they might
jointly offer a service similar to Charappa outside Japan, said
Toshiki Hayashi, general manager of the company's network business.
Bandai has yet to find someone offering suitable terms. ``Some have
asked for 90 percent of the fees we charge users,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may be able to benefit, too. Takeshi Tajima, Internet
analyst at Wit Capital, estimates that there are already more than
100 Japanese companies that supply digital content to cellular
phones, and many plan to sell shares on the stock market soon.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies with connections to the United States are not
waiting for initial public offerings. Yahoo Japan recently agreed
to acquire P.I.M., a Japanese startup that is developing a
personal-information management system for the cellular phone.
``When it comes to cellular-based services, Japan is advanced,''
said a Yahoo Japan spokesman, Koichi Ichikawa. ``So we are hoping
to accumulate know-how here and provide it to the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel, meanwhile, has invested in Hori's Cybird, though neither
company would say what Intel paid or how much of the Japanese
company it bought. Intel was more forthcoming about its strategy:
to encourage mobile Internet use and thus stimulate demand for
microprocessors. For that reason, it invests in promising Internet
startups around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove a tough deal with Intel and some people might think
it would be presumptuous of a startup like us to do so,'' Hori
said. ``But we convinced them that it would be a benefit to them
since, we told them, our company could become as important as them
in the future.''

GETTING ATTACHED TO AN E-MAIL VIEWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have downloaded an .Snp file on my PC but
cannot open it. It's an attachment to an e-mail. I have tried to
get the sender to help, but no one answers me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voice in the Wilderness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR VOICE: I get that same treatment, too, although it's
usually after I start talking about the substantial raise I
deserve. I'm not greedy. I'm really not. I just want parity with
all the other columnists. I mean, let's face it, you don't see
Heloise rolling pennies at the end of the month just so she can buy
a few cans of Beanee Weenees.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry. I didn't answer your question, did I? I'm not trying
to avoid you, but this salary thing has me really torqued. It's not
like they could hire somebody off the street to do this, although
certain people will tell you that's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I'll try to keep focused. Just because somebody sends you
a file attachment doesn't mean you can open it. No matter what kind
of computer you have, you need the appropriate file viewer or
application to take a look at it, a fact that seems to escape most
people when they're glibly e-mailing their stuff back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if some overpaid public relations person sends me a
news release in Word 2000 format attached to an e-mail, I can't
open it unless I sell a couple of pints of blood so I can afford
the upgrade from Word 95.
</P>
<P>
   It should be common courtesy on any e-mailer's part to assume
that a recipient may not have the ability to open an attachment.
Almost any word-processing document can be saved as plain text and
inserted into the body of a letter, but spreadsheets and databases
are different animals.
</P>
<P>
   You're dealing with an .Snp, which is a Microsoft Access
snapshot file, sort of a picture of the report the sender has
generated from his database. Luckily, Microsoft provides a free
viewer for these files, as well as for Word and Excel documents.
Just do a Yahoo! search for ``Microsoft snapshot viewer'' or
``Microsoft Word viewer'' or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the download link, click on it. You should be
prompted to save it in a location of your choosing. I generally
save stuff to an empty folder, but that's up to you as long as you
can find the file later. When you do, double-click on it, and it
will install itself. It should also associate itself as the default
viewer for those files. That means you can just click on the
attachment from now on, and it will open automatically.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Reguarding your recent column: i am uphauled at
the blatent ignorance for terminology. The word hacker has been
LONG established. i was born on a computer, and started programming
excercises when i was 6 years old and i have been hacking ever
since. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Zero 7
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ZERO: Too bad you didn't pick up a copy of Reader Rabbit
back then. You might be able to communicate coherently or at least
express a cogent thought without embarrassing yourself. They really
don't pay me enough to deal with letters like these. I'm uphauled.

SCIENTISTS ADVANCE IN QUEST TO MAKE ELECTRONICS TINIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chemists at the University of California at Los Angeles are
reporting another advance in the effort to produce electronic
circuitry on a molecular scale.
</P>
<P>
   In an article Friday in the journal Science, the UCLA team says
it has succeeded in using a molecule to create an electronic switch
that can be reconfigured _ that is, it can be turned on and off,
and on again _ like a transistor.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research had produced molecular switches that could
change their state only once _ on to off, or vice versa _ or could
operate only for a limited time or at very low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The latest achievement is a significant step toward building a
new generation of memory devices and computers that are far more
powerful and consume less power than today's microelectronic
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The advance is part of a quest for electronic circuits that are
perhaps one-thousandth the size of today's transistors, which are
made lithographically, by etching circuits on silicon with light.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, arrays of billions of circuits would
self-assemble by means of chemical reactions, which would make
individual circuits far less costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely excited about this,'' said James Ellenbogen, a
scientist for the Mitre Corp., a government-financed research
organization, and an expert in the developing field of molecular
electronics. ``It takes your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of molecular-electronics efforts are going on around the
country, including projects at major computer manufacturers like
IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola. And earlier this year, the
Clinton administration undertook an ambitious program to spend
almost $500 million a year on research in the area, known as
nanotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the UCLA group, working with computer architects
and chemists at Hewlett-Packard, reported that it had developed a
nonreversible switch based on a molecule known as rotaxane.
</P>
<P>
   The university chemists, led by James Heath and J. Fraser
Stoddart, then began searching for a new class of molecule that
could switch back and forth _ or on and off _ from one state to
another when a small voltage was applied.
</P>
<P>
   They found what they were looking for in catenanes, a type of
organic molecule composed of two interlocking rings, Heath said.
The group has benefited from the work of Stoddart, who over several
decades has developed an international reputation for creating
unique molecules with unusual properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last fall we began looking at what Fraser had on his shelf,''
Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   The catenanes consist of two tiny mechanically interlocked rings
created from atoms linked in a circle. The group discovered that
one ring can be stimulated to move between two different states _
for instance, from one angle to another _ with respect to the other
ring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was particularly intrigued by the molecules because
they can be stimulated by either electricity or light, suggesting
the possibility of optical computing machines as well as electronic
ones, he said. Moreover, the resulting switches can operate at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A major challenge is to figure out how to address the individual
molecular switches, Ellenbogen said. So far, the research of the
UCLA. scientists and of a similar group of researchers at Yale and
Rice universities has created molecules that can be switched on and
off only in unison.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale-Rice team and a group at Harvard also reported creating
reversible molecular switches within the last year, but they
operated under more limited conditions.

YOU'LL LIKE WINDOWS ME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 4 million of you purchased Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 98
operating system, and I'm still not sure why. That rather skimpy
upgrade to Windows 95 was absurdly overpriced at $89. But lots of
you paid it, so it's no surprise that Microsoft would try again,
next month, with Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows Me.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's different. There's a lower price _ $59 for
Windows 98 users, $89 for all others _ and, this time, value for
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Some rubbish, too. For a glimpse of Microsoft at its worst,
there's the built-in Movie Maker software, Microsoft's response to
Apple's marvelous iMovie video editing software, available free
with all new Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   iMovie is an advanced video editing suite that a beginner can
use without reading a manual. The new iMovie 2 is even better, with
features like multi-track audio dubbing thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's ersatz version is as satisfying as a plastic
corsage. Movie Maker's confusing user interface may have been
created on purpose, to keep the user from realizing how little the
program can do. For instance, it won't let you generate fancy
special effects for your videos, or even basic titles. For that,
you have to run Microsoft's ancient Paint program and import your
creations into the Movie Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know _ by version 3.0, it'll be cool. But Apple got it
right the first time out. What's Microsoft's excuse?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe their engineers were mastering the secret powers of my
boyhood hero, the Russian monk Grigori Rasputin. Historians today
dismiss the legend that Rasputin's murderers poisoned, shot,
bludgeoned and drowned the fellow before he finally gave up the
ghost. Still, it's a lovely story, which might have inspired a
Windows Me feature which guards the vital dynamic link library
files, or DLLs, that make Windows work.
</P>
<P>
   Most people will never deliberately alter a DLL file, but many
programs secretly fiddle with them, often with deadly results. I
recently trashed a laptop merely by installing AOL software on it;
several vital DLL files stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   But Windows Me locks down about 800 of these DLLs. If any
program tries to tinker with one of them, Windows Me preserves the
file from ruin.
</P>
<P>
   To test the system, I renamed a vital DLL. Within seconds the
original had reappeared. Then I tried deleting the file altogether.
It reappeared. I didn't try flinging my computer into the Volga
River, but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad I failed to wreck the system; Microsoft claims that
Windows Me would still have been able to heal itself. The product
hides a compressed mirror image of the operating system in a corner
of your hard drive. If the operating system gets trashed, this
feature will supposedly resurrect it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says this feature isn't as complete as that offered by
some other firms, such as Adaptec Inc.'s GoBack software. GoBack
can restore an entire hard drive; Windows Me will rescue only
itself. But even this limited capability could be a lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   For a more obvious improvement, Windows Me offers a magically
easy way to link two or more home computers. If the Movie Maker is
clunky in that familiar Microsoft way, Windows Me's Home Networking
Wizard looks like something written by Apple programmers in their
spare time. Rarely has a Microsoft program done something so useful
in such a simple elegant way.
</P>
<P>
   First you hook up your network, either using Ethernet cable or a
wireless networking system. You run the wizard on your Windows Me
machine, with a blank floppy disk in the drive. It sets up the
computer as the hub of your home network, and loads a package of
software onto the floppy. Next, you plug the floppy into the other
Windows 95, 98 or ME computers on the network, and run the code
contained therein. And that's it. With the wizard, I added a
borrowed laptop to my home Ethernet in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The main Windows Me computer can also be your network's link to
the Internet. When it's online, all the other computers are online.
You don't have to know a blessed thing about IP masquerading or
DHCP servers; it all just works.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of this is essential. If you're happy with your
present Windows software, feel free to give this one a pass. That
goes nearly double for those not using Windows 98 _ you'll have to
pay an extra $30. But if you're one of the suckers who paid $89 to
upgrade to Windows 98, you'll probably think $59 for Windows Me is
a real bargain. And this time you'll be right.

FIRE-BREATHING WRITER VOWS TO FRY NET THIEVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By his own estimation, writer Harlan Ellison exists in a state
of smoldering animosity. He goes from zero to ballistic in about
two seconds and threatens to put ``Harlan-sized holes'' in anyone
who crosses him, especially folks who refer to him as a science
fiction writer. (For the record: He prefers the term ``imaginative
fiction.'')
</P>
<P>
   He's had it with the greasy-thumbed adolescents, the demented
fans, the human offal, the idiots, the morons, and, well, just
about everyone else on the planet. In short, the man despises most
of the human race. ``Any society that allows Pauly Shore to make a
living doesn't deserve to exist,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Angry, are we? Ellison, whose best-known short story is about a
computer that wipes out humanity, hasn't even begun.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't even gotten to the scheming thieves, the pissant
hackers, the Napster nerds, and the unholy mooches who are pirating
his work online. ``They think they are the smartest people in the
world, like Zorro, James Bond, or Billy the Kid,'' he says, adding
a few choice descriptions that are unprintable in a family
newspaper. ``I say, `You want to be desperadoes? Well, let me take
you down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, 66, who still writes with a manual typewriter and
doesn't know the difference between a server and a search engine,
has launched a one-man legal crusade to protect his work online.
(``Don't call me a Luddite! I'm talking to you on a telephone and
not two cups attached by a string!'') So far, his attorney has gone
after individuals and companies, including America Online, that
have allegedly distributed or aided in the illegal distribution of
his work. In June, he won a judgment against Stephen Robertson of
California, who admitted posting Ellison's stories online and
agreed to pay Ellison's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  But last week, a federal judge in Los Angeles decided
against Ellison in favor of AOL, ruling that the company is
protected by the ``safe harbor'' clause of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, which says that Internet access providers act as
mere conduits and are not responsible for material accessed through
their service. Ellison's attorney is considering an appeal; another
case against Critical Path, which runs the news group Web site
remarq.com, is set to go to court next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison hardly shies away from a good court battle: He's
supplemented his income over the years with lawsuits, including a
successful case against director James Cameron for appropriating
his work in ``The Terminator.'' But the tough-talking writer who
has written episodes for ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``Star Trek'' is
less than thrilled to find himself aligned with such rock stars as
Lars Ulrich of the heavy-metal band Metallica. ``I hate their
music,'' he says of the band that is suing Napster. ``And I find it
odd that I'm in bed with Metallica, Madonna, and Dr. Dre.'' In his
mind, that scenario is akin to performing bordello gymnastics with
Richard Nixon and Mae West _ just leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ellison is leading the charge for the publishing industry.
So far, most of the focus on online piracy has been on the music
and the film industries and their high-profile cases against
Napster, MP3.com, and Scour. But with the growth of electronic
books, the publishing industry is beginning to take notice of
digital book piracy. The wildly popular ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' was available for free on the Internet within
hours of its release in the stores; works by writers ranging from
Isaac Asimov to Roger Zalazny are readily available in news groups
and on pirate Web sites. Apart from technical manuals, most of the
works offered free online fall into the science fiction _ no,
imaginative literature _ genre; the Science Fiction and Fantasy
Writers Association is supporting Ellison in his suit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Association of American Publishers
launched an anti-piracy Web site and announced a strategy to combat
piracy while also promoting legal, protected books for sale online.
The book industry, which was slow to react to the Internet, was
pushed into the market when Stephen King boldly offered his story
``Riding the Bullet'' and his serial novel ``The Plant''
exclusively as e-books; illicit copies of both were available free
almost immediately after their release.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  But the book industry isn't necessarily going to come out
swinging like the film and music industries, which have taken
considerable heat for their anti-piracy crusades. ``We've seen the
public relations fallout, and we are trying to learn from those
experiences,'' says Allan Adler, vice president of legal and
government affairs for the publishers association.
</P>
<P>
   What does Ellison think of that wait-and-see attitude?
``Dinosaurs!'' He has other words, too, as you can well imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison doesn't need to worry about PR fallout: By his very
nature, he's already a publicist's nightmare. This is, after all, a
man who once brought a gun to a story meeting (``But it wasn't
loaded'') and who stormed off the set of WBUR's ``The Connection''
in Boston because host Christopher Lydon asked him why he hated
being called a science fiction writer. (``I don't write about
bug-eyed ants or Godzilla!'') Ellison even rejects the word
curmudgeon because it implies a sort of sweet irascibility; he
prefers to be described as a pain in a posterior body part.
</P>
<P>
   Angry? ``Do you think I deny the bolts standing out in my neck,
the florid countenance, the hyperventilation, the quadruple bypass
I had several years ago? I would much rather live the life of the
happy wanderer, but. . .''
</P>
<P>
   But no. There are leeches and mooches and desperadoes to take
out. Does he seriously think he can singlehandedly change Internet
culture? Does he seriously think he can stop the technology he
writes about in his, um, imaginative works? ``The average citizen
doesn't have the prayer of a snowball in a cyclotron,'' he says
with a dramatic sigh. He likes the phrase. He writes it down. He
may hurl it at someone some day.

APPLE THINKS OUTSIDE THE BOX WITH ITS IMPRESSIVE CUBE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALAN T. SARACEVIC   
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all its breakthrough technology and
acknowledged superiority in desktop computing, Apple Computer's
lasting legacy will be industrial design.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent computer maker has once again thought outside of
the computer design box, ironically producing a revolutionary Cube.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac G4 Cube, a pint-sized powerhouse of a desktop
computer picks up the industrial design legacy established by its
translucent predecessor, the iMac. By all accounts, the Cube
expands on that groundbreaking design, or rather contracts on it,
offering a sleek miniaturization coupled with clean, crisp lines.
Simply put, the Cube is a beautiful machine.
</P>
<P>
   But while the design is revolutionary, the average Mac user
won't experience a huge difference when using the Cube, at least
not until Apple's next operating system, Mac OS X, is shipped in
early 2001. Until then, the Cube is essentially a faster, smaller,
cooler-looking version of the existing G4 Power Macs on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube, which retails for $1,799, is a 8-inch by 8-inch square
computer suspended inside an industrial-strength clear plastic
casing, giving the set-up a floating feel. The machine comes
equipped with Apple's new ``pro keyboard'' and an optical, ``pro
mouse,'' both of which follow the crystalline design of the mother
Cube. Closing out the set are a pair of 20-watt, Harman Kardon
speakers, once again encased in smooth, clear plastic. The Cube
comes with no monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But combined with one of Apple's digital, 15-inch, flat-panel
monitors ($999), the Cube is, indeed, a smaller, cooler-looking
version of the powerful Apple computers that have been dominating
the desks of graphics professionals for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   No other computer company comes close to generating the level of
loyalty and adoration that Apples does. A lot of that has to do
with the commitment to design chief executive Steve Jobs has
ingrained into the company he founded more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly it reminds me of Jobs' original NeXT computer,''
said Creative Strategies President Tim Bajarin, referring to Jobs'
ill-fated company that folded in 1993. ``In some ways (the Cube) is
a new incarnation of that original idea. However, this is much more
innovative and, in many ways, represents the next generation of
computer design.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda McNulty, Apple's director of desktop product marketing,
said size was a critical component when the corporation conjured
the Cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing the size is the biggest advance,'' McNulty said.
``Having something that powerful, that's essentially silent, is an
incredible move. You have a really powerful tool on your desk, not
taking up too much space and it's unobtrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cube makes virtually no noise when it operates, thanks to an
external power source. That means no fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we design a product, we sit down and look at our customer
profile,'' McNulty said. ``You start with the needs and where you
want to get to. Basically, we got to the point where it was very
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one person gets official credit for the Cube's
design in Apple's internal, democratic design structure, Jonathan
Ive, the vice president of industrial design, is unofficially
acknowledged as the Cube's chief creator.
</P>
<P>
   At $1,799, the Cube straddles the space between the serious
computer consumer and the corporate buyer. Luckily for both, the
Cube has the guts to satisfy the professional and the polish to
soothe a new user.
</P>
<P>
   The guts include a 450-MHz G4 processor, 64MB of RAM and a 20 GB
Ultra ATA/66 hard drive. Built-to-order options will include
incremental memory expansions topping out at 1.5 GB and a processor
upgrade to 500 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the Cube are relatively few ports for peripherals,
consisting of two USB ports, two FireWire ports, a 10/100Base-T
Ethernet port and a 56K V.90 modem connector.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, the Cube has a DVD-ROM drive, an ATI RAGE 128 Pro
graphics card with 16 MB of SDRAM graphics memory, an AirPort Card
slot and 1 MB of backside level 2 cache.
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 9 includes a number of software applications, including
Apple's latest home-movie editor, iMovie 2.01, and QuickTime. Both
programs make the most of the Cube's digital roots, allowing for
television-quality viewing of video.
</P>
<P>
   Set-up was extremely easy, as is common with Apple computers.
There are only two wires connecting the Cube and the monitor. The
speakers and the keyboard plug directly into Apple monitors using
USB connectors.
</P>
<P>
   The chief drawback to the stock version of the Cube is the
relative lack of random access memory. With graphics-heavy programs
such as iMovie and QuickTime, it's often impossible to run more
than one at a time with only 64MBs in the tank. In the short-term,
a Cube user can boost virtual memory without major problems, but a
professional user will definitely want to upgrade the machine's
internal chips. To Apple's credit, there are plenty of slots
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably be nice to have more memory. But for a
professional customer, there's no right number in terms of
memory,'' McNulty said. ``There are people that will load it up
with a gig and a half of memory. We did design it so it's nice and
easy to get in and add whatever memory they need. We also wanted to
make sure we didn't bump the price point up.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other drawback centered on the Cube's ``sleep mode,``
which caused occasional crashes and was a bit sluggish to recede
when trying to revive the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Cube's nominal negatives were far outweighed by
the machine's positives. The new operating system should make a big
difference, as will the continued evolution of the high-speed
Internet access and programming.

   When local tomatoes are at their peak each summer I pull out
another of my collection of bread and tomato salads to enjoy and to
share with you.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians have always known what to do with tomatoes whether
they cook them, dry them or serve them raw. Is there anything
simpler or better than tomatoes, mozzarella and basil? And a bread
and tomato salad is based on the famous Italian panzanella.
</P>
<P>
   As the summer draws to an end and you want to get in as many
tomatoes as possible _ but you want something more filling than
tomatoes and mozzarella _ a bread and tomato salad is called for.
The basics are the bread, the tomatoes and olive oil. After that
it's a free-lance dish. This version sticks pretty close to a
classic panzanella with the whole wheat Italian bread. But the
addition of corn is strictly American.
</P>
<P>
   I could make a meal on bread and tomato salad alone, but since
most people would prefer to add a touch of protein, I suggest a
nice spicy Italian sausage, preferably one made of turkey that is
low in fat. If you want just the salad, this recipe will serve two.
</P>

   &UR; CLIFTON PARK, N.Y.: x x x too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Weinman's green tent was recovered, along with its contents:
his journal, the copy of ``Siddhartha,'' a Spanish/English
dictionary, Irish penny whistle, plate and fork from his mess kit,
brown zipper pants, green fleece pullover, fuel bottle, Boreal
trekking boots, socks, some nylon bags, food and garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing intimately his brother's climbing ritual, Bob Weinman
figured Jim left his tent at base camp early Sunday morning, June
4, after a breakfast of oatmeal and instant coffee. He packed his
ice climbing gear into a large blue backpack: ropes, helmet, ice
axes, ice tools, crampons, sleeping bag, water bottle, stove and
food.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Weinman would have paid special attention to packing his
newly repaired camera, with which he planned to document his ice
climb to the summit of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   His brother didn't find the camera or any of his other climbing
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three months after his disappearance, all Weinman's family
and friends are left with is speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Weinman might have been struck by falling rocks or a large
chunk of ice. He might have been caught in an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   For governmental records in Chile, Jim Weinman remains a missing
person. The case is open.
</P>
<P>
   His family presumes he is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible feeling not knowing what happened,'' his
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no closure yet at this point,'' said his father.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weinman plans to resume a search effort for his lost brother
in several months, after Chile's winter has passed and the snow in
the Maipo Valley has melted.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, having moved through the stage of raw grief,
the Weinmans are struggling to create a fitting tribute to their
son. His mother did not think it appropriate to publish an obituary
or death notice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a memory service for Jim Weinman is planned for
Saturday, Sept. 9, at 10:30 a.m. at the chapel of Sacred Heart
Church on Lake George, N.Y., where the Weinmans have a summer home,
scene of some of the brothers' earliest hiking and camping
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want something good to come out of all this pain,'' Jim
Weinman's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weinman is working through the pain of his loss. ``My
brother was my best friend and the best times in my life were with
him,'' he said. ``It hasn't all hit me yet. It still feels like
Jim's off on a trip and I'll be getting an e-mail from him any day
saying he's come up with a cool climb for us to do together.''
</P>
<P>
   He is left with his brother's voluminous climbing journals,
which Jim had hoped to use as the basis of a book. In one, Jim
Weinman wrote this:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mountains you are at the mercy of the elements. The
roads, buildings and artificial sense of control is replaced in the
mountains by the will of mother nature. It is both terrifying and
liberating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Returning to the land of man you breathe a sign of relief, but
deep inside you miss the freedom and beauty that only the
desolation of the mountains can provide.''

   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. _ Three times in a row, a challenging ice
face up the southern route of a 14,000-foot peak named Cerro San
Francisco in the Andes Mountains outside Santiago, Chile, had
defeated Jim Weinman.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old mountaineer and extreme adventurer wanted a
fourth go at the glaciated summit in the shadow of the volcano
Maipo.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Weinman and an Australian ice climber had nearly
been crushed by a large rock that broke off from San Francisco's
icy peak. Another time, Weinman had tried a solo ascent and turned
back because the ice was not right. A third time, he'd made a
scouting climb in search of a challenging southern route with
proper ice conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd done a lot of other peaks in the area and this one just
kept beating him,'' said Jim's brother, Bob Weinman, 31, a fellow
alpinist. ``It got under his skin. He really wanted to finish off
San Francisco before he left Chile for good, and he thought he had
good ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their parents introduced the brothers to New York's
Adirondack High Peaks as youngsters, the pair were nearly
inseparable adventurers who traveled across the Americas and Europe
in search of new alpine challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they climbed Mount McKinley (20,320 feet), the highest
peak in the United States. Often they packed skis up to the summits
of peaks so that they could ski down.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Hood and Mount Rainier in the rugged Cascade Mountains
were their favorite playgrounds during years spent eking out a
living to support their alpine sports in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the brothers climbed a mountain in Brazil named ``The
Finger of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' trademark was their climbing mascot, a Barbie doll
they photographed on summits, which earned them a squib in Outside
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Their talk was of the next climb. ``We wanted to do a ski ascent
of the north face of Everest,'' Bob Weinman recalled recently.
``Jim had turned down one Everest expedition already. We wanted to
do it together.''
</P>
<P>
   But after finishing the 2000 season as a guide in the Patagonia
region of southern Argentina, Jim Weinman headed north in early
June to face his nemesis once more in a solo ice climb up Cerro San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   During a year in South America, the native of Clifton Park had
earned the nickname ``El James'' among Chileans for his ice
climbing prowess. He had established new ice routes that were
informally named after him.
</P>
<P>
   The strong, wiry former collegiate skier at St. Lawrence
University in Canton, N.Y., stood 5-feet-9-inches and weighed 155
pounds. With a goatee, shoulder-length brown hair and good looks
(fellow climbers kidded Weinman about resembling the model Fabio
when his hair was washed and blown dry), El James was an affable
presence _ one who could travel the globe and count on the
international climbing fraternity whose names he kept in a black
address book to put him up during his adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Finding climbing partners was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim became so proficient at ice climbing and took such
technically challenging routes that nobody wanted to go with him
anymore,'' said his father, James Weinman, a senior engineer with
Lockheed Martin. Weinman and his wife, Linda, a marketing
consultant, live in Clifton Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always safe and planned his routes out very
carefully,'' his mother said. ``He'd never had any problems going
solo.''
</P>
<P>
   In early June, a hint of fall was in the air in Chile's Maipo
Valley. The weather was clear and cool. No precipitation was
predicted. Conditions were perfect for ice climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Weinman had spent the past 12 months guiding rock and ice
climbers for a French company in southern Chile and Argentina and
had earned a few days' vacation, which he planned to use before
flying to England to meet his girlfriend on June 9 and to
contemplate a break from high-altitude adventure.
</P>
<P>
   After years of working just long enough to save money for the
next expedition _ the brothers had lived together in Seattle and
Portland, Ore., and climbed peaks from California to Alaska when
they weren't windsurfing, snowboarding and skiing _ Jim was
thinking of perhaps settling down and getting a real job like his
brother, Bob, who'd become a media buyer for an Internet
advertising company in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the mountain beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, Weinman set up base camp on San Francisco at about
10,000 feet and pitched his green tent on bare ground.
</P>
<P>
   He filtered water from a nearby stream, made a dinner of pasta
and Bolognese sauce and read from his Spanish version of Herman
Hesse's ``Siddhartha,'' a novel of a young man leaving his family
and embarking on a spiritual quest. He played on an Irish penny
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   And then, before going to sleep early in preparation for the
next morning's summit ascent, Weinman made this entry at the top of
a blank sheet in his ever-present climbing journal:
</P>
<P>
   Cerro San Francisco. Pared Sur (southern route).
</P>
<P>
   They were the last words Jim Weinman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Weinman vanished without a trace on June 4. That day, a freak
storm dumped more than 6 feet of snow in the mountains, set off
avalanches, flooded cities, triggered mud slides and threw Chile
into a state of emergency that delayed any search efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Weinman was not reported missing until June 9 by his British
girlfriend. She and her mother had waited at the airport that day
for his Avianca flight to arrive in London. He was not on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Weinman's brother flew to Santiago the next day and organized a
search party with other experienced alpinists he rallied through
appeals among climbing groups in the Maipo Valley region by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   His search efforts were hampered by a lack of emergency
services, outdated technology and government inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were at home in Clifton Park, desperately seeking
assistance from the U.S. Embassy in Chile, members of Congress and
other government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so frustrating trying to do things remotely and facing
such difficulties with the weather, the bureaucracy, the lack of
resources,'' Weinman's father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile obviously isn't up to the standards of the U.S. They
just don't have the ability to carry out a real mountain rescue,''
said Bob Weinman, who ended up hiring private helicopter pilots to
conduct aerial searches and to air-drop him onto the side of San
Francisco at 13,000 feet to search, with three other experienced
climbers.
</P>
<P>
   It was June 13, nine days after Jim Weinman set out for the
summit. The few scant footprints they spotted turned out to be
tracks of rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow was just so deep,'' Bob Weinman said. ``It was too
late.''

&HT;     STUDY CITED AS `MILESTONE' IN TREATING EARLY ALCOHOLISM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CINDY TUMIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Researchers say that a drug used to treat nausea
also can curb the destructive cravings in the type of alcoholic
doctors find toughest to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Early-onset alcoholics _ those who became problem drinkers
before age 25 _ were able to stop drinking or significantly cut
their alcohol consumption when they took the drug ondansetron,
according to the study by scientists at the University of Texas
Health Science Center in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The research by Dr. Bankole Johnson, a professor of psychiatry
and pharmacology, was hailed as another milestone in the search for
treatments for alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just slowly making progress in this, in addressing it
from a biological treatment standpoint,'' said Raye Litten, health
science administrator with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism. ``A lot of people 10 years ago said you can't get a
medication to reduce somebody's urge to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture is that we have so few different kinds of
treatment for alcoholism,'' said R. Adron Harris, director of the
Waggoner Center for Alcohol and Addiction Research at the
University of Texas at Austin. ``This introduces another
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ondansetron, marketed by Glaxo Wellcome Inc. under the brand
name Zofran, is used to treat nausea in patients who are undergoing
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The drug works on the serotonin neurotransmitters, one of the
chemical messengers in the brain that helps regulate pleasure and
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research by Johnson and others suggested early-onset
alcoholics, who come from families with a marked history of alcohol
abuse, have genetic flaws that produce an abnormality in their
serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These people are problem drinkers by their early 20s. They
exhibit reckless and impulsive behavior, often experiment with
other drugs and sometimes find themselves in trouble with the law.
They complete treatment only to relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors estimate early-onset alcoholics account for 25 percent
to 30 percent of the nation's 3.5 million alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 271 subjects took ondansetron or a placebo for 11
weeks, in conjunction with behavioral therapy. The subjects were an
average age of 40 and reported consuming an average of six or seven
alcoholic drinks daily.
</P>
<P>
   After three to four weeks, early-onset alcoholics taking the
drug said they were able to significantly reduce the amount they
drank, compared to the group that got therapy and the placebo.
Blood tests confirmed the self-reports of study subjects, Johnson
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking the drug also were able to abstain from drinking an
average of 70 percent of the days during the study, compared to 50
percent for the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoholics in the study who were not early problem drinkers did
not get the same effect from the drug, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offers hope for treating the most severe alcoholic, who
is young, who goes through periods of lapses and relapses and has
problems with anti-social behavior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The finding also takes researchers further into their
understanding of the disease, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By knowing what the biology underlying these abnormalities is
likely to be, our hope for the future is that we will be able to
develop an understanding of how a person's genes play a part in
telling whether or not they will respond to a drug,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One other drug, naltrexone, is federally approved for use in
alcohol abuse and has been shown effective with certain types of
alcoholics. Another, acamprosate, is in the pipeline for approval.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism currently
is funding a study to confirm the findings with ondansetron, Litten
said. If the results are validated, the drug could represent
another potential therapy for a selected segment of alcoholism
sufferers. It also opens the possibility that drugs could be
combined to achieve a greater effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exciting to see this,'' Litten said. ``Its another
compound (that works) at different sites in the brain.''

 &HT;    Finish, not type of wood, dictates how to maintain furniture
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Is the chest of drawers in your bedroom finished
in lacquer or oil? Will it damage the surface if you set a wet
glass down on a waxed table? Should you use ammonia to clean a
butcher block?
</P>
<P>
   Most people have houses full of natural wood furnishings, but
very few people are certain about how to care for them. That's why
it's not uncommon for furniture owners to make routine maintenance
mistakes that lessen the beauty of their wood over time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the type of wood used to make furniture that determines
how it should be maintained; it's the type of finish on the wood,
according to the Michigan State University Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   Some finishes _ lacquer, shellac, varnish and polyurethane _ are
applied in layers and form a shell-like barrier between the wood
and its environment. Lacquer, shellac and varnish have been used in
furniture making for centuries, while polyurethane is a more modern
material and acts like a clear-plastic shield.
</P>
<P>
   Other wood furnishings are finished in natural oils. The oils
are rubbed onto the surface, and the wood fibers absorb them.
Oil-finished furniture generally has a smooth, warm look and a
soft, natural feel.
</P>
<P>
   Another finish occasionally found is wax. Cindy Stegman, manager
of Arhaus Furniture in Washington Township says natural beeswax is
often used in folk-style pine furniture and is found on many
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a new piece of furniture, make sure you ask what
kind of finish it has. That knowledge is critical, because the
maintenance regimen for one type of finish could easily damage
another kind.
</P>
<P>
   Your furniture retailer or the manufacturers of the furniture
should also be able to supply you with care and maintenance tips.
And ask if the retailer sells furniture-care products such as
polishes and waxes, or if he can recommend suitable products.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy your furniture cleaners and polishes outside the
store where you bought the furniture, make sure the products you
buy are compatible. Know the finish on your furniture and check the
container of the product you are considering to confirm it works
well in your situation.
</P>
<P>
   Don Parker, service technician for Bruning Clock Shop in Huber
Heights, said workers at the store regularly dust the grandfather
clocks and other wooden items with a soft white rag.
</P>
<P>
   Every two weeks or so, the wood is polished with Oz Furniture
Polish, a product supplied by a clock manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Dusting is important for all wood furniture. Going over wooden
furniture occasionally with a vacuum cleaner using a soft brush
attachment keeps dust from collecting in crevices and patterns
carved in the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Also do what you can to keep dust levels down in the house.
Change furnace filters regularly and use your range hood to keep
dust-collecting grease from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Stegman from Arhaus suggests keeping an eye on the furniture for
signs of dullness and loss of warmth. She equates polishes, wax and
oils to the moisturizers we use to keep our skin from drying, and
she said furniture in the sun or near a heat source will need to be
moisturized more often than furniture in a cool, dark, humid room.
</P>
<P>
   The moisturizer used must match the finish on the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lacquer and shellac: Stegman uses a spray polish, Guardsman,
for furnishings in the store that are finished with catalyzed
lacquers. She applies the polish and wipes with a soft cloth about
once a month _ more often for pieces exposed to heat and sun.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful when choosing a polish, not a wax, for use on
lacquered surfaces. Products incompatible with lacquers will
partially dissolve the surface, creating a tacky, sticky feel that
can be hard to correct.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid getting water on furniture finished with shellac. If you
have a spill, wipe it up immediately. Shellac is a high-gloss
finish that doesn't stand up to moisture well. Other surface
finishes are a little better, but you should avoid letting wood get
wet when you can.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oil: Replenish the luster of oil by rubbing in more oil about
twice a year. You can find oil suitable for furniture where other
furniture-care products are sold. Apply a small amount of oil to a
clean, soft rag and rub it into the surface, taking care not to
apply too much. The surface should not look wet, so you should
quickly wipe away any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Always rub the oil along the grain of the wood. To create an
even smoother surface, you can rub in the oil with ultrafine steel
wool. Minor blemishes should fade with a new coat of oil, but some
damage may require light sanding and re-oiling. If you're unsure if
you can handle a repair, consult an expert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Polyurethane: This plasticlike, modern coating stands up well
to most abuse and is often used in furniture that is likely to get
wet occasionally. You'll find butcher-block tables and cutting
boards finished in polyurethane, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Polyurethane surfaces maintain a shine and generally don't need
polishing. Wash them with warm water and mild detergent but not
with ammonia, which can dull the surface. You can add layers of
polyurethane if the finish is damaged.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wax: You replenish wax surfaces as needed by rubbing in more
wax. Again, a good furniture retailer might be your best source for
wax furniture-care products.
</P>
<P>
   Stegman recommends paste waxes that are applied like shoe
polish. Rub in the wax following the grain in the wood and wipe
away the excess. Buff the surface to a shine using a horsehair
brush similar to brushes commonly used to shine shoes.

   With continuing financial problems, rumors are hot that World
Championship
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is ready to make some cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Oct. 23, WCW will tape Thunder on the same night and
location as Monday Nitro live in an attempt to cut production
costs. WCW also hopes it will increase attendance since Nitro shows
have struggled to fill 5,000-6,000 seats recently.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates have the WCW losing nearly $80 million and past
leadership has talked about, but failed, to cut the
long-in-the-tooth wrestling talent.
</P>
<P>
   And Thunder shows have had crowds that can't meet the expenses
of the production crew, not to mention the cost of the wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Siegel, the Turner executive who oversees WCW, is expected
to drop big-money, low-return wrestlers such as Lex Luger, Diamond
Dallas Page, Buff Bagwell and Kaynon.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is to drop $10 million to $15 million in salary before
parent company Time Warner's merger with America Online is
finalized in January, with a lot of cuts after WCW's fiscal year
ends Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In the ring one of the big changes for WCW is the return of
Goldberg as a face. He did not go over with the fans as a heel and
after months of complaining
</P>
<P>
   he has returned to his face role. Kevin Nash is stepping into a
top heel role.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF's push to register voters has resulted in 20,000 new
voters, according to wwf.com. Fans can sign up at house shows or at
WWFvote.com.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of interesting items from the wwf.com Jim Ross Report:
``Stone Cold Steve Austin update: Steve is about 60 days away from
return. Austin weighs about 253 pounds and is looking to return at
around 245-247. The Rattlesnake and Debra plan on getting married
later this month also.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross also had news on The Big Show, who will be out for a few
weeks with a herniated disk in his back.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns he will be assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling
(OVW) in Louisville, Ky., to lose some weight.

&HT;     MEXICAN EMPLOYERS SUFFER AN AMERICAN WOE: HIGH EMPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BILL DAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It's a familiar story: Businesses are having a
tough time finding workers because the booming economy. So they are
recruiting them from far away and paying higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it is Mexico, not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican unemployment fell to 2.03 percent in July, the lowest
level since it hit 2 percent in December 1999, the Mexican
government announced Tuesday. That figure was the lowest ever for
any July, and substantially lower than the 2.2 percent economists
had expected. (The unemployment rate in the United States is 4
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The low jobless rate is a symptom of Mexico's rapidly growing
economy, which jumped by 7.8 percent in the first half of 2000. The
boom is bringing widespread prosperity to Mexico's burgeoning
middle class, but it is putting the squeeze on employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Monterrey recently, and I talked to employers who
said they couldn't expand because they couldn't find workers,''
said Jorge Gonzalez, a professor of economics at Trinity University
in San Antonio. ``That's happening in more cities in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in northern Mexican states like Tamaulipas and
Nuevo Leon, where many foreign-owned manufacturing plants were
established, is as low as 0.5 percent. In southern states,
joblessness has risen above 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the state-run petroleum company, Pemex, needed employees in
Nuevo Leon, it recruited unemployed workers from southern Mexico.
This internal migration has helped moderate the hot economy's wage
pressures, but it has caused problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Reynosa, Nuevo Leon and Matamoros, people are coming in
from the (southern) state of Veracruz, which has a totally
different culture,'' said Francisco Gonzalez, an acting director at
the University of Texas Pan American's Mexican Business Information
Center. ``Some of them don't have a place to live, so they go build
a shack on the back of their relatives' home, or in their back
yard.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other dangers. Economists fear that an overheating
economy could be sabotaged by inflation. A business group, the
Center for Economic Studies of the Private Sector, last week warned
that the economy couldn't sustain its strong growth, and urged the
government to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's Gonzalez said Mexican banks have made fewer loans in
recent years as more of Mexico's financing comes from outside the
country. Even if the Bank of Mexico raised interest rates, it would
not do much to tighten the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government could try to effect fiscal policy by
reducing spending, but Gonzalez said President-elect Vicente Fox
would find that a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the campaign, he said he was going to spend a lot of
money,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation might not be as severe as it seems. The government
expects 1 million new employees to join the workforce this year.
And unemployment statistics in Mexico are calculated differently
than in the United States, where a jobless rate of 2.03 percent
would likely panic the Federal Reserve and prompt it to clamp down
on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   When the government compiles the so-called ``general pressure''
rate, which combines the unemployed with those seeking new or
additional jobs, the figure rises to a more manageable 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bountiful job market, Mexicans continue to seek work
in the United States, where wages are substantially higher.

VEGGIES SIZZLE ON THE GRILL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
ART AVAILABLE. 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grilling and backyard barbecues most often conjure up images of
sizzling steaks, burgers, chicken or fish.
</P>
<P>
   But has it ever crossed your mind to toss a colorful array of
fresh vegetables on the grill? If not, you'll be amazed at how
simple, healthy and fabulous tasting grilled produce can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most vegetables cook beautifully on the grill with just a
minimum of preparation or attention,'' notes Kelly McCune in her
``Vegetables on the Grill'' cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been encouraging people to cook an entire meal on the
grill for years, and finally people are coming around,'' says Betty
Hughes, consumer affairs director for Weber-Stephen Products Co.,
the company that manufactures Weber grills. ``People are really
missing out if they don't do vegetables on the grill.''
</P>
<P>
   Grilling vegetables heightens their natural sweetness resulting
in a fabulous smoky, carmelized flavor that is very different from
those that are steamed, microwaved or boiled.
</P>
<P>
   The smoky flavor is derived from the juices from the vegetables
dropping down on the grill's heat source and thus cooking and
carmelizing the sugars in the vegetables, says Hughes. ``You'll get
the same smoky flavor whether you use a gas or charcoal grill.''
</P>
<P>
   For more of a wood flavor add flavored wood chips to a gas
grill, advises Hughes. Simply place wet chips in a small foil pan
and put the pan in the hottest area of the grill underneath the
cooking grates, which in Weber gas grills is in the front left hand
corner. Don't place the food directly above the chips to avoid a
flare up or a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Experiment and learn what works best on your grill. Here are
some tips for success _ gleaned from experts and our hands-on
experience:
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables are easiest to manage and hold their shape best when
grilled in larger pieces. For instance, cut zucchini and eggplant
(either Japanese or regular) into lengthwise slices rather than
small pieces. Tomatoes are best grilled halved rather than in
slices or quarters. Same goes for red, white or yellow onions and
red, green or yellow bell peppers. Asparagus, mushrooms and green
onions should be left whole.
</P>
<P>
   To keep asparagus spears from falling through the cooking
grates, use thicker spears or tie thinner spears together into
bundles of five or six spears with plain kitchen twine.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to grill corn on the cob. You can soak
the husks in water for an hour and then place them on the grill or
cook in the husks without soaking. Unlike other veggies, corn needs
to be turned often when grilling. If desired, a couple of minutes
before serving, peel back the husks to get a little brown color and
grill marks on the corn, along with some additional smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For best results and fastest cooking, be sure the grill is very
hot before adding the vegetables of your choice, emphasizes Hughes.
Start a charcoal grill 30 minutes in advance of cooking or preheat
a gas grill for 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest and best way to grill vegetables is to brush them
all over with olive or vegetable oil, and place on the grill. No
blanching needed.
</P>
<P>
   While we prefer to season with salt and garlic or regular pepper
after grilling, some cooks like to toss the vegetables with oil,
salt and pepper prior to grilling. Don't bother to marinate
vegetables before grilling as they don't absorb much, if any,
marinade.
</P>
<P>
   For more flavor _ after grilling _ drizzle the produce with
herb-flavored oils, dressings or marinades and fresh herbs, but go
easy so the clean sweet flavors of the vegetables dominate. Hughes
likes to add bottled vinaigrette dressing to a platter of grilled
vegetables before serving as a side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure the cooking grates are clean before you grill, notes
Lisa Hanauer, an Oakland-based food writer and former chef
restaurateur, who loves grilling vegetables and shares her
corn-on-the cob grilling tricks in the September issue of Taunton's
Fine Cooking magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Although grill experts have differing opinions, we found wiping
the cooking grates lightly with oiled paper towels prevents the
vegetables from sticking. Experiment and see what works best for
you.
</P>
<P>
   For best results, grill vegetables over direct medium to medium
high heat, turning once half way through the cooking time.
Generally figure it'll take six to 10 minutes total for grilling
most vegetables. (Corn on the cob and potatoes will take longer.)
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables can be placed close together on cooking grates, but
they should have full surface exposure to the heat to cook evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes recommends cooking with the grill lid down as it reduces
the chance of flare-ups and shortens the cooking time since more
heat is retained.
</P>
<P>
   However, due to constant tending of the veggies, we only covered
the grill for a few minutes at a time, mostly for the not so-tender
vegetables like carrots or corn on the cob, to cook them through.
Suit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Use grilling times only as guidelines. Timing will vary
depending on: thickness of the vegetables, temperature of the
grill, temperature of the vegetables when you start cooking them
(cold, room temperature, etc.) and how you like them cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables are best cooked crisp tender rather than soft and
mushy. You want them to retain their shape and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Don't walk away when grilling vegetables. Watch them as they
cook rapidly _ you don't want them overdone, soggy and limp.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to serve a vegetable platter for a large group,
grill the vegetables a few hours before guests arrive, arrange on
serving plates, cover with foil or plastic wrap and serve at room
temperature. Provided you haven't overcooked them, the vegetables
will have beautiful color _ and wonderful flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Mix and match vegetables _ and think about color combinations
for the most attractive arrangements on platters. Peruse farmers'
markets or supermarkets for the best in-season buys.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you grill vegetables
and experiment, the more confident you'll become. As noted in
``Weber's Art of the Grill,'' cookbook, ``The road to great grilled
vegetables is paved with experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't overlook the possibilities of grilled vegetables for main
as well as side dishes on menus year-round.
</P>
<P>
   You can present the vegetables ``as is'' on a platter or drizzle
with olive oil and sprinkle with chopped fresh basil _ or combine
the smoky flavors of the grilled veggies with other ingredients
like pasta, sauces, soups, breads and other ingredients for robust
meals _ either meatless or with meat.
</P>
<P>
   You can even turn out great grilled salads _ by grilling romaine
lettuce hearts very quickly, then topping with chopped fresh
tomatoes, grilled chopped up eggplant, a few Kalamata olives and a
generous sprinkling of feta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Red peppers, grilled and topped some olive oil, are simple and
divine on an antipasto platter with tapenades, salami, buffalo
mozzarella cheese and tomato slices and a sprinkling of chopped
fresh basil.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes likes to toss grilled veggies with cooked pasta or turn
them into a grilled pizza (she uses frozen bread dough, thawed, or
a Boboli shell).
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer likes to whip up salads _ with any vegetables she has
around. ``I go for color and texture _ and toss with olive oil,
garlic, vinegar, etc.'' She also uses grilled produce to create
salsas and ratatouilles and fill quesadillas, omelets and crepes.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that grilled vegetables, embellished or not, can
provide a satisfying meal that even meat eaters will applaud. Serve
them hot from the grill, at room temperature or chilled, alone or
in a variety of creations. You'll be amazed at how the distinctive
flavors of the vegetables shine through. You're in for some
flavorful dining. &QL;

The mark of great veggies
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guide to grilling selected vegetables. Keep in mind
that grilling times are dependent on lots of factors including how
hot the grill is, the temperature of the food prior to grilling,
the thickness and tenderness of the food being cooked, etc.:
</P>
<P>
   ARTICHOKES: Trim whole and baby artichokes and cut in quarters
(or in half if small). Parboil just until tender; cool and toss
with olive oil and salt and pepper, if desired. Grill, covered,
directly over medium coals or medium heat on gas grill, cut side up
first, turning once, about 5 to 7 minutes per side until nicely
browned and tender.
</P>
<P>
   ASPARAGUS: Trim tough stems; coat with olive oil and salt and
pepper, if desired. Grill directly over medium heat, turning
frequently, about 5 to 8 minutes total, until nicely browned.
</P>
<P>
   BELL PEPPERS: Cut peppers in half lengthwise and remove seeds.
Brush lightly all over with olive oil. Grill over medium coals,
turning occasionally, until tender, about 12 to 15 minutes total.
You should have nice brown grill marks.
</P>
<P>
   CORN: Shuck corn, rub with butter and salt and wrap in foil. OR
leave corn in the husk and remove just a few outer layers. Grill
corn, covered, in foil directly over medium heat, turning as
necessary. Grill corn in husk, covered over medium hot coals,
turning frequently. Grill corn in foil about 20 minutes, turning
once. Grill corn in husks 10 to 15 minutes or longer, until charred
all over. Remove from husk and leave on grill a minute or two to
sear and gain grill marks and more smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   EGGPLANT: Cut regular or Japanese eggplant in half lengthwise or
into 3/4-inch thick lengthwise slices. Brush generously with olive
oil. Grill directly over medium coals or heat, turning once until
tender, about 10 to 12 minutes total.
</P>
<P>
   LEEKS: Clean well; trim tops. Brush whole small leeks or larger
leeks, halved lengthwise, lightly with oil. Grill over medium
coals, turning occasionally until tender, about 8 to 12 minutes
total. Leeks get limp quickly so watch carefully.
</P>
<P>
   MUSHROOMS: Use large mushrooms (portobellos work particularly
well). Wipe clean, remove stems, leave whole, toss well with olive
oil and salt and pepper. Grill over medium-hot coals; turn once or
twice. Grill portobellos about 5 minutes per side, other about 2 to
3 minutes per side, until nicely browned.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN ONIONS: Brush whole onions lightly with olive oil. Grill
over medium coals, turning occasionally until tender, about 4 to 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   RED OR YELLOW ONIONS: Cut onions in half and brush with olive
oil. Grill over medium-hot coals about to 5 to 7 minutes per side,
until soft, but not limp, lightly charred and translucent. If
charring too fast, move to indirect heat to finish grilling.
</P>
<P>
   POTATOES: Quarter or halve small red or yellow potatoes; cut
Idahoes lengthwise into slices; parboil if desired in microwave
oven; toss with olive oil, salt and fresh herbs. Grill directly
over medium-hot coals; move to indirect heat (with grill covered)
to finish cooking if not parboiled. Grill 4 to 6 minutes per side,
until well browned all over; cook with indirect heat 6 to 7 minutes
to finish if not parboiled.
</P>
<P>
   TOMATOES: Cut large tomatoes in half. Brush lightly with oil.
Grill over medium coals, turning once, until heated through, 5 to 7
minutes total. Watch carefully to avoid overcooking and having
tomatoes lose their shape and become limp.
</P>
<P>
   SQUASH (yellow or zucchini): Cut small squash (about 3 to 4
ounces each) in half lengthwise. Cut large zucchinis into thick
lengthwise slices. Brush lightly with oil. Grill over medium coals,
turning occasionally until tender, 8 to 12 minutes total.
</P>
<P>

A PRESCRIPTION FOR HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Srey Mom could neither speak nor sit last May when she arrived
at the home of Sally Stokes and Bob Luoma. At just under age 2 and
just over 10 pounds, she had never seen a toy, never tasted solid
food. Her universe had encompassed no more than she could see over
the sides of the cloth hammock where she lay dying, slowly but
certainly, in the back room of a Cambodian orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   She would be there still had Dr. Nancy Hendrie not rejected a
retirement ``of Bingo and bowling'' in favor of a medical career
re-directed toward the care of children in a country where $300 is
the average annual income.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharing Foundation, the nonprofit organization Hendrie
founded three years ago, has no paid staff, no inflated overhead.
The former pediatrician runs it out of her cottage in Woolwich,
Maine, personally bearing the cost of her many trips to Cambodia to
oversee projects the foundation funds to provide children's basic
needs for food, shelter, education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip last winter, Hendrie discovered Srey Mom in a back
corner in Chom Chao Orphanage, outside Phnom Penh, where the
foundation has installed electricity and mosquito screening,
repaired the leaky roof and drainage system and hired a local
doctor to visit every Saturday. Abandoned at birth because of
congenital defects beyond the intercession of Cambodian medicine,
Srey Mom was being given miminal attention by a staff hardened to
the alarming death rate of so many orphans in its care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't let her die,'' said Hendrie, knowing that the
expertise that could save her was a medical visa away in Boston.
Against bureaucratic odds and the foundation's philosophy of
undertaking projects to aid the maximum number of children, Hendrie
flew out of Cambodia with Srey Mom on her lap. With promises from
old friends at Massachusetts General Hospital, support from her
foundation's board and an offer of temporary foster care from
Stokes and Louma, Hendrie secured a visa for Srey Mom to have
surgery in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In four months, under the care of Drs. Daniel P. Ryan and Ronald
E. Kleinman, the little girl with the saucer-sized eyes has had
five successful operations at MGH. The extra finger on each hand
and a toe on one foot have been removed. The defects in her
gastrointestinal tract have been repaired. The tumor in her brain
has been determined to be benign and no obstacle to a long life.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Srey Mom will be re-admitted to MGH for the final
surgery to reverse a colostomy and connect the last link in her
gastrointestinal system. She will recuperate at the comfortable
Stokes-Louma home on a quiet rural road where she is doted on by
the couple's two teenage sons, former patients of Hendrie's, and
members of the family's local Unitarian church. It is amazing, said
Hendrie, to watch ``a child who'd never seen a toy at play in a
field of Fisher-Price.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy Hendrie exerted to save Srey Mom's life she is now
directing toward finding her a permanent home in Greater Boston.
Sally Stokes and Bob Luoma, of Carlisle, Mass., are too close to an
empty nest to provide more than temporary care to the chubby,
cooing imp who takes only seconds to scoot across the living room
carpet and into the tiled foyer. She is no longer the frightened
child who recoiled at the sight of Louma's beard or screamed at the
approach of the family cats. She laughs easily and often now,
turning for approval when she stands upright at the coffee table or
wrests Hendrie's watch from the doctor's arm. Having heard only
Khmer until last spring, she now plays peek-a-boo and waves bye-bye
in response to a request in English.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrie is convinced Srey Mom's developmental delays were caused
by her now resolved medical ills. ``There is a very bright little
girl in there ready to come out,'' said Hendrie, 68, the mother of
five children, one of them adopted. An adoptive family for Srey Mom
must have that rare combination of optimism and realism so crucial
to a child with special needs. ``There are no guarantees, even with
our own children, but Mom is a fighter. She should not be condemned
to life in a Cambodian orphanage when I just know she could do
great things someday! If I don't find her the right home, I'll
adopt her myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries about Srey Mom should be made to The Sharing
Foundation, Post Office Box 399, Woolwich, ME 04579 or by e-mail to
nhendrie (at)aol.com.

THE THROTTLEBOTTOM EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Breaking out of the cage, fleeing the nest,
flying the coop. By any other name, the Throttlebottom effect
describes imprisonment. Al Gore's escape from it has given him a
postconvention ``bounce'' in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made news here when he declared, ``I stand here tonight as
my own man.'' No kidding. A useful way to look at headlines and
lead paragraphs is to reverse them. A truly big story would depict
Gore saying: ``My own man? Not me. The big guy in the White House
is still pulling the strings. Yes, folks, I remain a hapless
Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern vice president lives in a maximum security facility,
a big mansion on Massachusetts Avenue, winkled away from the Navy
in the 1970s. Its first occupant was Nelson Rockefeller, the
nation's second unelected veep, appointed by the first, Gerald
Ford. Before that, veeps had to find their own digs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1931 musical ``Of Thee I Sing,'' the running mate to
President John Wintergreen, Vice President Alexander
Throttlebottom, ``lives at 1448 Z Street . . . with the other
boarders.'' He mostly ``sits around in the park and feeds the
pigeons, and takes walks, and goes to the movies.'' Victor Moore,
the stalwart Broadway-Hollywood sidekick, played Throttlebottom as
an amiable buffoon and a perfect nonentity, the forerunner of vice
president jokes on late-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Air Force Two, the mansion, and a huge staff have
improved job conditions. Being vice president helps win the
nomination. But in November, before a larger audience, having been
a silent second banana is still a mixed blessing. In its essential
requirements, the job has changed little. One task, which Gore
tackled diligently, is to stifle oneself, to regard one's views and
beliefs the way one would treat Social Security and Medicare,
putting both ``in an ironclad lock box where the politicians can't
touch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Moakley, the Massachusetts congressman who was the first to
understand the soul of Joe Six-Pack, explained the Throttlebottom
effect while waiting on the floor for Gore's acceptance speech. ``I
like Al Gore. Most people who've met him like him,'' Moakley said.
``But I understand why people who know him only from television
don't like him. They don't know him. All they've seen for seven
years is a guy standing in back of the president and nodding his
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before George S. Kaufman, Morrie Ryskind, and George and
Ira Gershwin invented Throttlebottom, Finley Peter Dunne's ``Mr.
Dooley'' observed in 1906: ``It's sthrange about th'
vice-prisidincy. Th' prisidincy is the highest office in th' gift
iv th' people. Th' vice-prisidincy is th' next highest an' th'
lowest. It isn't a crime exactly. Ye can't be sint to jail f'r it,
but it's a kind iv a disgrace. It's like writin' anonymous
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Throttlebottom's debut in 1931, the vice president has
not been anonymous, at least not to Democrats. Of the party's 14
veep candidates to reach the November ballot, 12 had subsequent or
prior experience as a presidential candidate. The only two who did
not reach for the top were John Sparkman, the 1952 nominee, and
Geraldine Ferraro, the nominee in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The official hero, patron saint, and role model of campaigning
vice presidents is Harry Truman, whose comeback in 1948 several
successors sought to emulate. An incumbent veep starts the campaign
as a figure of fun, gradually gets taken seriously, closes the gap,
then wins or comes close. George H. W. Bush won in 1988. Richard
Nixon in 1960, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, and Ford in 1976 lost by
slim margins.
</P>
<P>
   Americans hoot and holler at every heir of Throttlebottom,
heaping scorn until they decide to give the guy a chance. Even if
Gore loses this year, his VP choice would be an unusual accomplice
if he did not run for president himself in 2004. As Joe Lieberman
asked the Democrats assembled here, ``Is America a great country or
what?''

THINK WAL-MART OF NET SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Way back in 1995, just a few years out of Macalester College,
Jeremy Allaire had a vision: that the Internet would be a big deal,
and there would be a huge market opportunity for a company that
provided software for the Net.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out he was right _ and early. The combination of the
two allowed Allaire Corp. to establish itself and grow to a
respectable size in a short time. In the second quarter of 2000,
the Newton, Mass. company had $33 million in sales and made a
profit to boot, the third straight quarter the firm has been in the
black.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed since 1995. A lot of companies now
realize that Net software represents a tremendous market, and a
long list of them provide something similar to what Allaire offers:
a software platform and applications that let customers do
everything from personalizing their Web sites to tracking
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors include giants such as IBM as well a host of
successful upstarts: BEA Systems, Silverstream, Art Technology
Group, and Vignette.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are competing in a crowded market that is in the process
of consolidating down,'' said Paul Krieg, an analyst with Legg
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Does Allaire have a competitive edge that will help it survive
the coming shakeout? Krieg thinks it does. Not surprisingly, so
does the company. And that edge gets back to Jeremy Allaire's
original vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our belief that the Internet is a mass phenomenon,''
said Allaire, now the company's chief technology officer. ``We
believe there will be tremendous growth, not just for 500
customers, but for thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Allaire is attacking the mass market with products that are
significantly cheaper than those offered by the competition. A
customer who might spend $20,000 with Allaire could easily spend
$100,000 with one of its high-end rivals. Think Wal-Mart versus
Nordstrom, and you get some idea of how Allaire would like to
position itself vis-a-vis the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aiming at the fat part of the pyramid,'' said chief
executive David Orfao, a software veteran who has worked at both
Lotus and Apple. Orfao argues that Allaire's low prices will
encourage customers to use its software for more and more
functions.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Allaire thinks it can comfortably coexist with its
higher-ticket competitors. But what about in the future? Could some
of Allaire's rivals move downmarket and sell cheaper versions of
their software?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Davis doesn't think so. ``The big guys have an expensive
cost structure,'' said Davis, an analyst with Needham &AMP; Co. ``It
would be hard for them to retool.''
</P>
<P>
   Allaire has other strengths. Because its original product,
ColdFusion, has been around for a while, several hundred thousand
software developers already use it and know it. More recently,
Allaire has created a line of products that run on Java, a language
that is rapidly becoming the standard in the software world.
</P>
<P>
   On the financial side, Allaire's growth has been explosive. In
1999, sales reached $55 million. They should hit $140 million this
year and $218 million in 2001, said Steven Frankel, an analyst with
Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill. Frankel expects profits to grow, but not as
rapidly as the top line. Allaire started the year with 350
employees; it should end the year with 700.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price has been moving in the opposite direction. After
hitting a peak of $88 in March, it plunged as low as $28 before
recovering to about $35. ``We like the stock; we wish it were
higher,'' said Davis, who blames much of the decline on the
broad-based sell-off in Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Allaire has consistently exceeded Wall Street expectations. But
like so many other tech companies today, it is facing a more
skeptical and a more cautious investment community.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street doesn't doubt that Allaire can grow rapidly for a
while. But it wants to know if the company is going to emerge as a
winner in the end, one with a distinct advantage that will separate
it from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel says investors want to see how deeply Allaire can
penetrate the operations of its customers. Will its products become
a standard that is used everywhere, or will they just be one of
many choices on a lengthy menu?
</P>
<P>
   Allaire may have to turn in a string of impressive quarters
before investors are ready to restore much of the market value that
has disappeared over the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Allaire says the opportunity is there. ``It is ours to
grab,'' he said.

ARE THEY SPEAKING FOR THE FORGOTTEN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore so presumed his place in the pecking order that he
applied to just one university _ Harvard. Now he barks ``Power to
the People!'' George W. Bush was born owning the petroleum that
prevented his diaper rash. Now he is a gusher of common ground.
Walter Bagehot would have scratched his head.
</P>
<P>
   Bagehot, the shamelessly elitist economist who wrote ``The
English Constitution'' in 1867, said government belonged
exclusively to the ``educated thousands'' while the ``unintelligent
millions'' should be entertained by the royal family, ``which
delights the eye, stirs the imagination . . . yet never strains the
intellectual resources of the most ignorant or the most stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagehot considered it beneath politicians to pander to the
``unintelligent millions.'' He wrote: ``In plain English, what I
fear is that both our political parties will bid for the support of
the working man; that both of them will promise to do as he likes.
. . . I can conceive of nothing more corrupting or worse for a set
of poor ignorant people than that two combinations of well-taught
and rich men should constantly offer to defer to their decision and
compete for the office of executing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, we have pop singers to delight the eye, Tiger Woods
to stir the imagination, and well-taught and rich presidential
candidates who compete for office as if they will force the elite
to share their resources with the millions.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech last week accepting the Democratic nomination for
president, Al Gore referred to ``working families'' or ``working
parents'' seven times and 11 other times referred to Americans who
``work hard,'' were ``working hard,'' displayed ``hard work'' or
were ``working overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of all the working families who are the strength
and soul of America, I accept your nomination for president of the
United States,'' Gore said. ``They're for the powerful, and we're
for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Bush said Gore was waging ``class warfare.'' At
first glance that echoed Bagehot's theory that class divisions had
to be ``disguised,'' as in his daddy's use of Willie Horton in
1988. But Bush, also fearful of being seen as Daddy's oil boy,
still panders a bit, saying he promised to ``extend the promise of
prosperity to every forgotten corner of this country.'' Bush said
he would be a leader ``who finds common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the pandering, the forgotten corners are drifting
farther from view. During the Republican convention, The New York
Times had on its front page a story about record-breaking campaign
contributions next to a feature about the dying federal loan
program that inspires doctors to work in poor areas. Only 1,900 out
of a needed 20,000 doctors are being funded.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democratic convention, the Times had another front
page article in which vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
promised that the Democrats would ``expand prosperity.'' Next to
that story was a feature on how the nation's largest law firms have
slashed pro bono work to satisfy paying clients in the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers give lavishly to the Democrats, but less than one
in three low-income people who need a lawyer can get one. The
Republicans slashed federal legal aid in the Clinton years with
little resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, the intelligence of the ``unintelligent
millions,'' as Bagehot would say, is being tested. Interestingly,
Bush was so quick off the mark with ``class warfare'' he has given
Gore a great opening.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said: ``These unhappy times
call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten . . .
that put their faith once more in the forgotten man . . . the
forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.''
</P>
<P>
   These are happier times, but there remain forgotten people. Gore
has begun the campaign talking more about them than Bush. Gore
talked about the health, education, and economic struggles of four
families by name in his acceptance speech. Bush mentioned none by
name in his. Gore utters the phrase ``universal health coverage.''
Bush's dad thought universal coverage was socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked about fixing up crumbling schools for the millions
in his acceptance speech, while Bush talked about vouchers that
would allow the lucky few to escape the ``ignorant or the most
stupid.'' Because he has been a Texas governor, Bush considers it
an asset that ``I have no enemies to fight'' in Washington. Gore
should turn that ``asset'' into a huge liability.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of enemies of working families in Washington.
These families want someone in the White House to wage warfare.
Contrary to Bagehot, the ``unintelligent millions'' would be quite
stimulated by a well-taught president who can delight the eye, stir
the imagination, and shape up those among the ``educated
thousands'' who hoard intellectual and economic resources to the
point of leaving many of the millions ignorant and stupid.

GROUP HOPES FOR PROMISING COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the Promise Keepers?
</P>
<P>
   Founded 10 years ago by University of Colorado football coach
Bill McCartney, the controversial movement of Christian men burst
onto the national scene in 1997 when hundreds of thousands rallied
on the Mall in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the movement, which raised hackles among some women
concerned that the group undermines women's rights by advocating
for men to take charge within families, almost immediately seemed
to flame out. The group briefly laid off all 345 employees in a
tactic that critics said was just a fund-raising ploy and has since
scaled back some of its most expansive ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But, quietly but surely, the Promise Keepers is rebuilding.
Their next gathering is scheduled for this weekend in Worcester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The group sees constant evidence for its need. Spokesman Steve
Chavis pointed to the allegations of sexual misconduct against a
church worker in Middleton, Mass. and the death of a man in a
two-dad brawl at a hockey game in Reading, Mass. as evidence that
men are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been addressing violence and anger and lust,'' Chavis
said.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of holding free conferences, the group is
healthy enough this year to resume charging fees ($69 for adults).
They retreated from an effort to start men's groups at churches and
decided to concentrate on their men's rallies _ now at mid-sized
regional arenas rather than giant stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still drawing, although not to the degree they
were,'' said Dean Allen, a scholar at Andover Newton Theological
School who studies the Promise Keepers.
</P>
<P>
   The organization holds two-day rallies for men with a heavy
emphasis on facilitating personal encounters with Jesus,
encouraging greater attention to families and churches, and
battling racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an amazing, inspirational thing,'' said Leslie H.
Stobbe, who has attended two Promise Keepers conferences and works
as a vice president of the evangelical Christian organization
Vision New England. ``Most churches really don't know how to
minister to men. The Promise Keepers has filled a real void in
men's lives, helping them focus on their spiritual side and their
emotional side, and it also has given them tools for how to relate
to their wife and kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1990, the Promise Keepers say they have reached 3.5
million men through 98 conferences during the decade. The group
encourages men to keep seven promises, from the religious (honor
Jesus) to the personal (pursue vital relationships with other men)
and the familial (build strong marriages and families).
</P>
<P>
   The group is evangelical and takes a conservative position on
many issues. The group believes the Bible is without error and
homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is ongoing debate about the long-term value of
the Promise Keepers movement, the group has clearly tapped into a
new set of questions about the role of men in American families and
churches in the wake of the women's movement. Those concerns,
voiced first through the Iron John movement, are now evidenced in
the increasingly mainstream academic fields of men's studies and
the boomlet in books about the plight of boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Promise Keepers appeal to the confusion that men feel,
although I don't know that they addressed it at a deep enough
level,'' said Stephen Boyd, a professor of religion at Wake Forest
University in North Carolina and a pioneer in the study of men and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said although the Promise Keepers' emphasis on the
spiritual was attractive, their attitudes toward gender
relationships troubled some, particularly women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They advocate a kind of retreat into more traditional gender
roles as a way of solving issues and crises,'' he said. ``They were
controversial for good reason. But they are addressing some of the
questions men are facing.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you please tell the history of rosary beads and clarify
their purpose? What is the origin of their use, and is it
appropriate for non-Catholics?
</P>
<P>
   J.M.H., Cape Cod, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A rosary is a string of prayer beads used by worshipers as a
manual guide for various forms of repetitive prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the worshiper fingers one bead per prayer _ in this
way, the string of beads helps lead the worshiper through a set of
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly known rosary is used by Catholics to guide
them through a series of devotional prayers honoring Mary, the
mother of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The rosary of Mary is not appropriate for use by Protestants,
said the Rev. Robert W. Thornburg, dean of Marsh Chapel and
professor of preaching at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a specifically Roman Catholic devotion that prays to Mary
as the mother of God, and that's not an emphasis that Protestants
make,'' said Thornburg, who is a United Methodist minister. ``Mary
is not given the same veneration in Protestant theology as in
Catholic theology. The words of the rosary are not words that would
typically be helpful for Protestants.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other types of rosaries used in other traditions,
particularly Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Eastern Orthodoxy, in
some cases by laity and in some cases by monks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the first Christian
uses of the rosary occurred in the 3d Century among Eastern
Christian monks. The Catholic practice of saying the rosary was
popularized by St. Dominic and his followers, and may have been
especially useful for the illiterate among the faithful who could
not read liturgical texts but could memorize the prayers associated
with the beads.

FEAR OF THE UNKOWN LOOMS LARGER THAN LIFE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mother confines her toddler indoors to avoid the West Nile
virus, often running with the child up and down the stairs to
release energy. If they venture out, they dart from the door to the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Is this logical?
</P>
<P>
   An American is 50 times more likely to die in an accidental
fall, such as while on stairs, than to be killed by the West Nile
virus. A person is also about 150 times more likely to be killed in
a motor vehicle accident, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Based on current information on casualties, the odds of an
American dying of this summer's most-dreaded virus are roughly 1 in
a million, the statistical cutoff point for saying something has
almost no risk at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, these odds do not prompt a casual attitude from this
Brookline, Mass. mother who has extra reason for concern: She found
a dead crow on her own driveway near Coolidge Corner, later found
to be infected with the West Nile virus, and learned this week that
infected mosquitoes are on her street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Nile virus is so new,'' said Cindy Leung Yue, 34.
``Anything new makes you worried.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus has triggered a psychological reaction all
its own, tapping into some of our most primitive fears. High doses
of statistics don't seem to stop the fear epidemic. This virus
scares not just because it's exotic and new, but because many feel
so helpless to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say people often worry less about risks when they
undertake them voluntarily, such as smoking, driving, sun-bathing,
or bungee-jumping. They hate risk imposed on them, feeling like a
helpless walking target for the ubiquitous mosquito, which can now
give us a bad infection, not just a bad itch.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do people get most scared of? They don't like things
outside their individual control,'' said Sheldon Krimsky, a Tufts
University professor of urban and environmental policy. ``That's
why people are often more worried about being a passenger in an
airplane than driving a car.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that people also have an exaggerated fear reaction to
cluster deaths related to some kind of new event. It may be widely
known that heart disease is the leading cause of death among
Americans, but the here-and-there reports of those deaths don't
pack the kind of emotional power that the West Nile virus does.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, psychologists and scientists say it's a mistake for the
public to focus on one extreme risk while ignoring more serious
ones. It's what some psychologists like to call misallocation of a
person's ``worry budget,'' like the smoker who is afraid of flying
or the sunbather who eats only organic produce.
</P>
<P>
   In the list of health precautions, quitting smoking, exercising,
eating a low-fat diet, and regularly washing one's hands to avoid
transmitting infectious diseases would far more likely lengthen
one's life than extra mosquito repellent to avoid the West Nile
virus.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the ongoing controversy about whether pesticide
spraying may do more long-term harm to humans _ as well as create
resistant mosquitoes _ than the West Nile virus. The virus produces
mild flu symptoms in the overwhelming majority of people and has
been fatal in rare cases among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Public health specialists note that more people appear to worry
about the West Nile virus than the winter flu. While the West Nile
virus killed seven people last year _ all of them New York City
residents over the age of 65 _ the influenza virus killed about
1,700 people nationwide in 1998. The flu also is most fatal to the
very old, very young, and those with compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reaction to the West Nile virus is clearly based more on
emotion than fact,'' said David Ropeik, director of risk
communication at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. ``It's out
of proportion to the actual risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the New York City health department's fact sheets
say that, in infected areas, only 1 percent of the mosquitoes
actually carried the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring huge odds against acquiring a rare disease is similar
to the public's rationale for playing the lottery, which can carry
an even greater improbability for winning. Despite the minuscule
chances, people simply reason: Someone has to win (get infected)
and it could be me.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so emotional about the West Nile virus. Many say
they can't understand all the media attention, government resources
and public hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the race for president is so boring that people are
concentrating on the West Nile,'' said Shai Inbar, a retired
biomedical researcher who now works in the computer industry.
``It's more interesting than Al Gore and George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as with the devil, some people say the virus they know is
better than the virus they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the unknown,'' said Louisa Bertman, a mother of a
7-month-old girl, who has stopped taking long outdoor walks. ``And
I worry it's only going to get worse and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists who study risk perceptions say the alien origins of
this virus _ it was isolated first in 1937 in the West Nile region
of Uganda _ enhances its scariness.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder that the boundaries of our country aren't safe
from new invading diseases, particularly in this mobile and diverse
society, said Donald MacGregor of Decision Research, a nonprofit
firm in Eugene, Ore., that studies risk perceptions in health and
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AIDS virus made us aware of these exotic diseases in other
parts of the world,'' MacGregor said. ``The West Nile virus raises
yet another signal that there's new hazards coming to us that we
don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He said our more reasonable approach to the West Nile virus will
come only after we have experience surviving it over time. He said
that explains why people don't fear the flu too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived through many flu seasons,'' he said. ``We believe
we know how to control it and what to do if we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pinker, a psychology professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said people find it difficult to ignore
the threat of blood-sucking insects that deposit illness beneath
our skin, regardless of statistical odds.
</P>
<P>
   Through evolution, he said, such trading of vile fluids has
``given us the willies.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinker, author of a best-selling book, ``How the Mind Works,''
said it is understandable that humans will always have an alarmist
reaction to any new threat, and raw facts won't temper anxiety
until there's more emotional experience with it. Even if you hear
that the chance of the West Nile virus killing you is 1 in one
million, he said, ``the mind has trouble with risks associated with
that many zeros.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the West Nile virus is particularly threatening
is that its victims are random and get no ``perceived benefit,''
said Scott Geller, a psychology professor at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute who studies risk perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   As Geller explains it, people often have a psychological need to
believe that the misfortune afflicting another person is somehow
deserved. Uncharitable as this sounds, it's part of a common belief
that those who get hurt must have sought too much pleasure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a motorist died in an accident because he was
driving too fast to get to a party, or a boater died because he
dared to make the outing in bad weather. Geller calls it the ``Just
World'' hyphothesis, in which people believe bad things happen for
a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, when a deadly virus strikes randomly, with
mosquitoes passing infection to a passive and unknowing recipient,
it threatens people's ability to rationalize misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something looks random like that, people worry that even
the good guys can get it,'' Geller said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, some local residents say they can't help
but have a heightened reaction to the West Nile virus _ including
lost sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Architect James Batchelor, who also lives on the Brookline
street where infected mosquitoes were found, woke up at 4 a.m. one
recent day to the sound of a buzzing mosquito in his ear. While he
turned on the light and smacked the bug, he lay awake wondering if
he was the conqueror _ or conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Said Batchelor: ``I kept thinking, `What if the mosquito already
bit me?' ''

MODERN ORTHODOX JEWS BLEND BEST OF BOTH WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Once a month the founders of technology start-ups trek
to a private dining room inside the posh Four Seasons Hotel to
pitch their new ideas to a 2-year-old group of Net-savvy investors.
</P>
<P>
   The investors, called the Common Angels, may typify the New
Economy, but the group's founder, David Solomont, has one foot
firmly grounded in a much more ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday at 6:30 a.m., Solomont joins an informal
congregation of fellow Orthodox Jews for prayer at the Maimonides
School in Brookline, a Hebrew day school.
</P>
<P>
   Solomont says he easily passes between the old and new worlds in
which he lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty, for me, is that I don't really think about where
my `religious' life leaves off and my `regular' one begins,'' said
Solomont, part of a growing community of Orthodox Jews in Greater
Boston that today numbers about 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Connecticut Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as the
Democrats' vice presidential candidate has cast a spotlight on
Orthodox Jews, a small and relatively little-known but robust slice
of American Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a world where navigating the sacred and the secular
requires balancing the demands of ritual, tradition, and religious
laws with the realities and challenges of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   And despite common stereotypes of Orthodox Jewry as a monolithic
group of bearded men in black hats living apart from contemporary
society, three out of four Orthodox Jews in the Boson area are,
like Lieberman, modern or centrist Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strain of Orthodoxy that stresses engagement with the
world while remaining faithful to Jewish law and practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Orthodox means having a serious religious outlook
that's rooted in Jewish tradition but that also expresses itself in
a deep commitment to the world today,'' said Barry Shrage, an
Orthodox Jew and executive director of Combined Jewish
Philanthropies of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeffrey Kosowsky, being an Orthodox Jew means weaving
religious practices that go to the heart of who he is with the rest
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabbath, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, is
inviolate to Kosowsky, who works at McKinsey &AMP; Co., a management
consulting firm. Work is out of the question and he asks his
clients not to disturb him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sabbath also means not turning lights on and off, no
driving, writing, cooking, handling money, or participating in any
frivolities at odds with ``godlike activities on a godlike day,''
he said. Because he can't drive on the Sabbath, Kosowsky, like all
Orthodox Jews, lives within walking distance of the temple in which
he worships, Young Israel, a modern Orthodox synagogue in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kosowsky said, ``I really believe I can be a complete
citizen of our society on any number of levels and still be true to
my tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   But being an Orthodox Jew goes well beyond honoring the Sabbath;
it permeates every aspect of Kosowsky's life.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, he dons a fringed prayer shawl and fastens
(itals)tefilin(unitals) _ tiny cases holding Biblical passages _ to
his head and body, and prays, a time which he calls his most
relaxing time of day. Although he does not wear a skullcap at work,
he does wear a (itals)tzitzit,(unitals) a garment with fringes of
thread next to his skin to remind him of his prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My religion is a way of life that affects everything I do, not
just my going to synagogue or performing a certain ritual,''
Kosowsky said. ``It's really all-encompassing.''
</P>
<P>
   About one-fourth of the Boston area's Orthodox Jews adhere to a
more right-wing Orthodoxy, which is more traditional and separatist
than modern Orthodoxy. Followers typically do not read secular
newspapers such as The Boston Globe, and bar television from their
homes. It is often allied with Hasidic or more mystical forms of
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   These highly observant Orthodox Jews often call themselves
Haredim, viewing the term ``ultra-Orthodox'' as pejorative. At
their schools, Mesivta High School of Greater Boston, a new high
school in Boston's Brighton section, and Bais Yaakov, a
five-year-old high school in Newton, boys and girls are kept apart.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, at the 63-year-old Maimonides School, which is
modern Orthodox in orientation, boys and girls study together.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews straddle both worlds. Deborah Kram, who founded a
Torah study program for women, belongs to Young Israel, as well as
Congregation Beth Pinchas, which is Hasidic. She said she feels
welcome in both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up as a modern Orthodox Jew, and that remains my
worldview and where I'm most comfortable,'' said Kram. ``But I
sometimes go to Beth Pinchas because I find the rebbe to be a
wonderful model of loving kindness. I enjoy praying in his four
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the core of Orthodox Judaism is ``the understanding
that the laws we live by are divinely mandated. Of course, they're
given to man to adjudicate, but they are created by God.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, modern and right-wing Orthodox Jews make up between 7
and 10 percent of the nation's 5 million Jews, according to Shrage.
But they account for only 3 percent of the 200,000 Jews who live
within Interstate 495.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jacob Schacter, the founding dean of a new, $10 million
national center for modern Orthodoxy located in Brookline, the
Soloveitchik Institute, said Lieberman's role is raising the public
profile of modern Orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the world in which we live in is an important
place to which we need to contribute and from which we can learn,''
said Schacter. ``Modern Orthodox Jews value openness to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Kram: ``The touchstone of modern Orthodoxy is involving
yourself in the world in hopes of repairing it, which Lieberman is
a perfect example of.''
</P>
<P>
   All Orthodox Jews agree on the Torah as the divinely revealed
word of God, said Schacter, and reject the liberal Jewish notion
that the word of God can be adapted to modern realities.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews worship almost entirely in Hebrew, unlike Reform
and Conservative Jews. In contrast to Reform Jews, Orthodox Jews
oppose same-sex unions and unlike Reform and Conservative Jews they
do not permit women to be rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   But modern Orthodoxy permits some flexibility in interpreting
nonbinding matters of tradition, such as in the wearing of a
skullcap or (itals)kippah.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   And it allows for some creativity, if one can afford it: When
Solomont vacations on Nantucket, he has two traditional Sabbath
meals _ after prayer on Friday night and on Saturday afternoon _
flown directly to him from Levana, a kosher restaurant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Across this area Orthodox Judaism is surging _ membership at
Orthodox synagogues is rising as is enrollment at Hebrew day
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that more people are leading observant lives than
they were 10, 20, or 30 years ago,'' said Solomont, 48, who prefers
the term ``observant'' rather than Orthodox Jew. ``More people are
keeping kosher, going to synagogue, and following a traditional
Jewish way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomont said nothing in his work life interferes with his being
Orthodox. ``If someone wants to do business with me from sundown
Friday to sundown Saturday, they haven't got a prayer of reaching
me,'' he said. ``The Sabbath is strictly my family time.''

SJC TELLS JUDGES TO EVALUATE EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a ruling that legal observers say will dramatically
raise the bar for the testimony of expert witnesses in
Massachusetts trials, the Supreme Judicial Court has ordered judges
to take a more active role in evaluating technical claims and
keeping so-called ``junk science'' out of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the SJC adopted a standard that will make it
much tougher to appeal a judge's ruling on the validity of
scientific or expert testimony. The cumulative effect, legal
experts say, will be to greatly strengthen the role of trial court
judges as gatekeepers separating valid scientific evidence and
testimony from unreliable opinions or even outright quackery.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also predicted that the ruling could restrict the
amount of scientific testimony and potentially shift the balance of
power in both civil and criminal cases. Defendants in product
liability and personal injury cases _ automakers, for example _ may
now have an advantage over those who sue them, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important decision,'' said Albert Zabin, a Boston
attorney who has lectured on the use of expert witnesses.
``Essentially it gives the trial court a lot more of the final
decision-making power.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in a case brought by a former Brigham and
Women's Hospital nurse, Theresa Canavan, who was awarded workers'
compensation disability insurance by a state Industrial Accidents
Board judge in 1995. Canavan maintained she developed a disorder
known as ``multiple chemical sensitivity'' from working in the
hospital's operating rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Her claim was upheld by a state appeals court, but on Thursday
the SJC sided with lawyers for the hospital, who said that the
judge incorrectly admitted the testimony of Dr. Thomas LaCava, a
University of Massachusetts Medical School pediatrician who had
made Canavan's diagnosis. LaCava is also a member of the American
Board of Environmental Medicine, but the court found that the field
is not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple chemical sensitivity sufferers say that exposure to
chemicals, dyes and even perfumes can trigger allergic reactions
and even seizures. Though opinion in the medical community is
mixed, a growing number of people say they suffer from the disorder
and are spawning cottage industries for dye- and perfume-free
household products and chemical-free ``clean'' houses.
</P>
<P>
   In the original trial LaCava admitted under cross-examination
that 50 percent of doctors who see an alleged case of multiple
chemical sensitivity diagnose it as a psychological ailment, not a
physical one.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC ruled that the judge should not have accepted LaCava's
diagnosis, which was based on his ``experience'' with other
multiple chemical sensitivity cases rather than on a scientific
rationale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That a person qualifies as an expert does not endow his
testimony with magic qualities,'' the justices wrote in a sweeping
18-page opinion that brings state law into line with recent US
Supreme Court decisions on expert testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's attorney, Matthew Walko, praised Thursday's
ruling, saying that in some prior cases, all a judge would look at
was the expert's credentials, and if he had a great resume, he
could say whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision says that even if someone is a true expert, the
court must look at the theory they are using, and that theory must
be scientifically valid,'' Walko said.
</P>
<P>
   The last expansion by the SJC of a trial judge's role in judging
expert testimony came in a 1994 case, Commonwealth v. Lanigan,
which paved the way for the use of DNA evidence at trials. In
Lanigan, the justices held that courts could consider ``novel''
scientific evidence even if it had yet to be accepted by the
scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the high court made it more difficult to
appeal a judge's ruling. Before Thursday, the losing side in a case
could appeal the winning side's use of an expert on a ``de novo''
basis _ essentially meaning that the higher court would start from
scratch and take a fresh look at whether the scientific evidence
was valid.
</P>
<P>
   The justices held that, given the rapid advance of science and
technology, having appellate courts making sweeping legal rulings
on scientific evidence was potentially as bad as admitting junk
science. Such rulings could ``freeze'' outdated scientific opinions
in the law and keep them from being updated by newer and better
science, the court held.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standard, the losing side will have a more
difficult task _ showing an ``abuse of discretion'' by the trial
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In layman's language, the judge has to be off the wall in his
decision,'' Zabin said. Essentially, (the ruling) renders most
questions almost unappealable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for defendants in product liability cases praised the
ruling, while attorneys for plaintiffs warned that it could give
corporations an advantage over citizens harmed by their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are going to be fewer decisions that are junk
science decisions,'' said Donald D. Evans, senior counsel for the
American Chemistry Council, which filed a ``friend of the court''
brief in the case. ``We are seeing it around the country. Decisions
not based on sound science are getting thrown out, which we think
is a good trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney Michael Weisman, who has sued auto
manufacturers, chemical companies, and equipment manufacturers on
behalf of accident victims, warned that the ruling could take too
much power away from juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge could turn himself into the primary decision maker,
rather than the jury,'' Weisman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the ruling appeared to be a setback for
multiple chemical sensitivity sufferers, said Canavan's attorney,
Peter F. Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously my client and I are very disappointed in the
decision,'' Brady said. ``When I first started handling these cases
seven years ago I was skeptical, too, but I have found that these
are perhaps the most profoundly disabled people I have ever seen.''

HAPPINESS ELUDES US; KEANU STILL INSCRUTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it became a weekly, Us, now technically known as Us
Weekly, has been straining to be a sort of People magazine but with
better boundaries. It's quite eager to track the lives of the
celebrities, but it tries to stalk its Hollywood prey with a veneer
of reportorial distance and good taste. It serves up the dish, from
Angelina and Billy Bob to the ruthless ``Survivor'' castaways, but
it's unwilling to add the popular emotionalism that People thrives
on, and it carefully avoids the appearance of tabloid insinuation _
even in its layout, which is more like the orderly Entertainment
Weekly than the chaotic tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Can the gossipy People formula work without all the loose affect
and juicy, irresponsible detail? Time will tell Us. This week, Us
attempts a classically People-esque feature about whether our
favorite stars are really truly happy, and whether money and fame
can actually buy contentment. It's the sort of vapid inquiry that
manages to cut to the core of America's love and hatred for
celebrity _ we like to envy the stars' fantasy lives, but then we
also want to look down on them, to feel better about ourselves. The
piece begs for garishness, shameless rumor, and camp.
</P>
<P>
   But Us answers the happiness question with a quasi-scientific
method that's dull as can be. First, the writer chats up the
experts, including Hilary Swank's therapist, Holly Hein,
concluding, ``In the end, then, it seems that when it comes to
happiness, celebrities have it no better than us.'' Then, amid
sidebars including a poll of stylists and caterers (Robert Downey
Jr. is ``extremely happy to have found freedom from drugs and from
prison,'' opines one food-service worker), there are happiness
ratings for a host of stars, denoted by a yellow smiley face whose
expression ranges from ecstatic to blase.
</P>
<P>
   Britney Spears is unhappy because, when her concerts are over,
she's ``all alone (except for those rare moments when reported
boyfriend Justin Timberlake keeps her company).'' Demi Moore is
``semi-happy'' because she's found a new love since Bruce Willis,
but her career has been disappointing of late. Gwyneth Paltrow,
too, is semi-happy, because she is still haunted by her breakup
with Brad Pitt. Pitt, of course, is happy (what about his career
disappointment?), as is his new wife, Jennifer Aniston. Also making
it onto the happy list: Regis and Joy Philbin, Christopher Reeve,
and Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche _ ooops.
</P>
<P>
   Well, every scientific methodology has its limitations, if not
its sense of humor.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Rolling Stone for Aug. 31 profiles two stubbornly unprofilable
celebrities, Keanu Reeves and Hugh Hefner. Reeves, now in the
middle of a few movie releases and a new album by his band Dogstar,
evades writers Chris Heath's questions with an inane haiku-speak
that allows him to throw out non sequitur comments like ``It's a
particle, it's a wave.'' How does he feel about have been
considered a dumb himbo in the early years of his career? ``There's
something good about it, something bad, something happy, something
sad.'' Something true, too, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Heath makes the most of his clammed-up subject, as does Wil S.
Hylton, who finds Hefner inscrutable despite the Silk Pajama'd
One's professed desire to share the real story. All he can find out
is that the Playboy founder is neither an exploitive wolf, nor a
smooth ladies' man. He's a Gatsby-esque shadow figure who sneaks
out of his own infamous parties, and he exudes a fragility that
Hylton never really understands.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the piece, Hylton, who spends plenty of time
partying at the mansion, uncovers a basic conflict about Hefner,
but fails to address it directly. For Hefner believes that a moral
man can be a sexual man, that ``when we repress our sexual
instincts, we enter a world of denial and shame that undercuts the
foundation of civilized society.'' And his party life in the
mansion reflects that believe. But despite all the good times,
despite the ever-present peace pipe in his mouth, he appears to be
a quietly but profoundly unhappy man.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time throws the quartet from HBO's ``Sex and the City'' onto its
cover, to illustrate its trend piece on women who are embracing the
single life and not feeling compelled to be married. Called
``Flying Solo,'' the article feels dated, thin, and dangerously
promotional, since HBO is owned by Time Warner. Like Ally McBeal,
the women on ``Sex and the City'' don't exactly love the single
life, after all, except the sexually voracious Samantha, who is the
show's comic relief. They are on a constant prowl to find love,
happiness, and breakfast at Tiffany's, and this season at least one
of them, Charlotte, seems to have caught herself a groom who looks
like a wedding-cake figure. There's something 1990s about Time's
package, which might at least have seemed fresh when sitcoms were
deluged by single women in the city, including the great Elaine
Benes of ``Seinfeld.''

HEAVY CUTS IN DEFENSE TRACE TO BUSH PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten years ago President Bush ordered Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to slash the defense budget and reduce troop
levels 25 percent by the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This week Bush's son, Republican presidential candidate George
W. Bush, and his running mate, Cheney, accused the Clinton
administration of ``hollowing out'' the military during much of the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those two conflicting points are now at the heart of a dispute
in the 2000 presidential campaign over the levels of money spent
for defense, military pay, and benefits, and the fighting ability
of US forces.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were on display in speeches to the national
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, as Bush predicted
Monday that ``the next president will inherit a military in
decline,'' and Gore responded Tuesday that the US military is the
``strongest and best in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   Strictly in terms of dollars, Bush's charge is questionable.
William J. Perry, a defense secretary earlier in the Clinton
administration, said two-thirds of the decline in defense spending
during the Clinton administration was put in place by President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the silliest thing I ever heard,'' John Pike, a
defense analyst with the American Federation of Scientists, said of
Bush's charges. ``The Cold War is over. Most of those force
reductions were either accomplished or planned under the Bush
administration. The Clinton administration came in and ratified
them and modestly tinkered with the force structure. The big
draw-downs were under President Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of morale and mission, however, Bush may have tapped
into a frustration among some within the military that has existed
since Bill Clinton became commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has faced criticism about his defense policy from his
first day as president. He avoided military duty during the Vietnam
War, implemented a ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy allowing gays
in the military, and was mocked by some for supposedly not knowing
how to salute.
</P>
<P>
   Some military officials do not like the sort of peace-keeping
missions and United Nations operations that Clinton has supported.
And even Clinton's current defense secretary has said the Pentagon
budget needs significant increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton-Gore administration has had its share of
military successes, including the 1999 Kosovo conflict in which
37,000 air missions were flown without the loss of a US pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Pentagon budget is enormous at $288 billion a year, or
about 15 percent of overall federal spending. There are plenty of
critics, including Green Party nominee Ralph Nader, who argue that
the defense budget could be cut dramatically. But Gore and Bush are
both advocating large increases. Moreover, both men support
continued research for a missile-defense system, although Bush's
proposal is more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign delighted in noting Tuesday that much of the
budget decline was caused by Bush's father. The defense budget
stood at $210 billion in 1980, rising as a result of the buildup
under President Reagan to $370 billion by the time President Bush
took office in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Cold War over, Bush slashed troop levels by 25
percent during a five-year period starting in 1990 and cut the
defense budget by tens of billions of dollars. At the time, many of
Bush's military aides, including Cheney, expressed reservations
about the impact of such deep cuts. But President Bush, who broke
his pledge of ``Read my lips, no new taxes,'' needed the defense
savings in order to avoid more tax increases. Many of Bush's
defense cuts did not take effect until the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of these cuts, the United States today has
1.4 million men and women on active duty, down from 2.2 million
during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who was defense secretary from 1994 to 1997, said
two-thirds of the defense cuts during the Clinton administration
were orchestrated by President Bush and Defense Secretary Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain people must be getting amnesia,'' Perry told reporters
Tuesday in a conference call arranged by the Gore campaign. Perry
stressed that he supported President Bush's defense cuts, but said
it is unfair for Bush's son to criticize the Clinton-Gore
administration for implementing them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after President Bush's reductions were put in place,
Clinton further cut the defense budget for several years. But by
1998, with budget surpluses growing and a strong push from Perry's
successor, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, the Clinton
administration began aggressively increasing Pentagon spending.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a former senator from Maine and a Republican, rebutted
Bush's assertion of a military in decline. ``I think you'll see a
military on the ascendance,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Military procurement, which hit a low of $43 billion in 1997,
now is at $60 billion, and is scheduled to reach $70 billion within
four years. In the last two years, troops received their largest
pay increase in a generation. And Clinton last year approved a $112
billion increase in defense spending over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the largest increase since the end of the Cold War, and
that is bound to be increased even further in the future,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen also has testified and said in an interview that even
though the trend of defense cuts had been reversed in the last
three years, much more needs to be spent on national security.
Speaking about the projected $70 billion annual cost in
procurements, he told the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier
this year, ``That's still not going to be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer a peace dividend. It's over,'' Cohen
testified. ``Much of what we are using today, be it in Kosovo or
Bosnia or off the various coasts, is a result'' of that Reagan
administration buildup. ``Well, that buildup is over, and we have
built down. . . . Now we've got to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, over the last four years, Clinton and his top budget
advisers have consistently recommended relatively small increases
in defense spending. Cohen, in internal budget battles at the White
House, has successfully argued for more money. The
Republican-controlled Congress has padded the defense budgets even
more.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Cohen has acknowledged problems in morale as
well, using that argument to win support for increases in wages,
housing allowances, and retirement and medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also may not get much of an argument out of Cohen that
peacekeeping operations were putting too much of a strain on US
troop capabilities. Bush said he would conduct an immediate review
of those commitments if elected and would ``replace uncertain
missions with well-defined objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Cohen acknowledged to a Senate committee, that US
troops were ``overstretched. We're engaged in many, many
operations.'' Currently, US troops are scattered in nearly 100
locations around the globe, including the UN peacekeeping missions
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush
said the Army can't count on all 10 of its divisions. ``If called
on by the commander-in-chief today, two entire divisions of the
Army would have to report _ `Not ready for duty, Sir,' '' Bush
said. But the Clinton administration said Bush's information was
outdated, and the divisions are ready for duty.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's favorite charges is that too many troops are on
food stamps. But Gore campaign officials said only 6,300 out of the
1.4 million members of the armed services are on food stamps, and
most of them have large families who live on military bases.
Tuesday, Gore said no soldier would be on food stamps during his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions were sharply drawn at the VFW convention in Milwaukee.
Bruce Harder, the VFW's director of national security and foreign
affairs, said the military has a problem with readiness, much of it
stemming from underrecruitment for the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration says that the military is completely ready
for anything that might happen,'' Harder said. ``But a lot of
independent evidence indicates a falling off of the readiness of
our armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Globe staff writer Susan Milligan, traveling with Gore, contributed
to this report.

&HT;     LEVI TO OFFER JACKET FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO TALK, LISTEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is hailing as the
first wearable electronics product, the European division of the
jeans maker and Dutch electronics company Philips NV will release a
line of jackets branded IDC+.
</P>
<P>
   The jackets, which will only be available in Europe and cost
$600 to $900, come equipped with a mobile phone and MP3 player, a
remote-control device plus ear gear and a microphone integrated
into the collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loads of people have been talking about wearable technology .
. . but we are the first company to turn this into a commercial
venture,'' said Paola Brandi, a spokeswoman at Levi's European
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The IDC+ jackets (the name stands for Industrial Clothing Design
Plus) come in four styles and will be available next month.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four styles has an integrated system with wires
concealed throughout the jacket connecting the Philips Xenium GSM
mobile phone, which has voice command and dialing capabilities, to
a Philips Rush MP3 player. The devices are controlled through a
built-in remote.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss realizes the jacket may have limited appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be mostly targeted to people like film directors
and television crews, people who like to carry their technology
around with them,'' Brandi said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beckman, a spokesman at Levi headquarters in San Francisco,
said there were no plans to introduce the jacket in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a test,'' he said. ``There aren't going to be many
produced initially. It's an opportunity to see what the market
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Philips has been experimenting with wearable technology,
sometimes called smart or intelligent clothing, since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the research products on the Philips Internet site
include ski clothing that could have built-in ski passes, radio
links, Global Positioning Systems or temperature sensors. Other
ideas include invisible collar microphones and miniature cameras
woven into clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nike Inc. is designing a line of clothing that can accommodate
an MP3 player. A joint effort between Timex Corp. and Motorola Inc.
has produced a pager-watch-organizer, and Swatch Group Ltd. plans
to come out next Christmas with Swatch Talk, a combined cell phone
and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mann, a professor in the electrical engineering department
at the University of Toronto, has been experimenting with wearable
technology since 1982. So to Mann, a jacket that allows the wearer
to carry electronic gadgets is not that impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be all well and good, but they have no real
practicality beyond other than, say, putting your cell phone in
your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the benefit of this, and have they really considered
some of the fundamental concepts such as protection from
radiation?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mann's projects involves computers embedded in clothing
that emit radar to help blind people detect stationary and moving
objects.
</P>
<P>
   While Mann admits some of the bulky wearable computers he
developed 20 years ago were considered outlandish, he said the
concept of incorporating technology and clothing is almost
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's so much hype about it,'' he said. ``I don't think
it (public acceptance) is much of a problem anymore.''

LEONARD COHEN REDUX: ANGST FOR THE MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the un-pressing questions of our time is: How can
celebrities survive their own fame and preserve a modicum of
dignity? There are tremendous pressures on Tom Clancy to keep
writing the same books (he has) or on Neil Young to play the same
songs year in and year out (he hasn't). Our greatest talents seem
to linger too long or flame out too early.
</P>
<P>
   One artist who has survived his own fame in a unique way is
Leonard Cohen, the frog-voiced Canadian singer-songwriter best
known as the writer of the Judy Collins hits ``Suzanne'' and ``Hey,
That's No Way to Say Goodbye.'' After several comeback tours in the
1980s and 1990s, Cohen took the veil, secluding himself in a
Buddhist monastery nestled in the San Gabriel Mountains above Los
Angeles. To all appearances, Cohen had left the world for a life of
meditation and writing in a small cell. When he was ordained in
1996, Cohen adopted the dharma name Jikan, or Silent One.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen has not been silent. Instead, with the help of a
Finnish computer buff, Cohen ``lives'' for his fans on the
Internet, at a site called leonardcohenfiles.com. ``The site
assures his virtual existence, balancing his disappearance into the
spiritual world with an ongoing, on-line narrative of his comings
and goings,'' Cohen's biographer Ira Nadel recently wrote. ``The
technology suits his needs, being both personal and distant, and
solves his desire for privacy while giving his fan a controlled
gateway to his life and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I have a thing for Cohen. He's as dark and funny as the
late, great Serge Gainsbourg, who once sang his reggae version of
``La Marseillaise'' to a stadium full of French paratroopers and
barely escaped with his life. Cohen once opened a concert in
Hamburg with the Nazi salute; similarly, a gesture lost on this
particular audience. His downbeat style (I find him quite cheery,
but never mind that) has made him a cult hero in Scandinavia, land
of glowering darkness and the month-long drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has done it all _ Prozac, psychedelics, graduate school,
Scientolology, the Talmud, ``You Are My Sunshine'' _ and he's still
here to tell us about it. He's been Phil Spector'd _ the two men
cut an album in 1977 _ and many times resurrected. Indeed, he once
claimed to see biblical visions during a concert in Jerusalem.
Despite some pro-Arab sympathies, Cohen decided to join the Israeli
Army during the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Instead of wielding a gun, he
was allowed to perform for the front-line troops. ``Deep in the
Sinai desert, he was introduced to and sipped cognac with the
Israeli general (Ariel) Sharon, himself a Cohen fan,'' according to
David Sheppard, yet another Cohen biographer.
</P>
<P>
   If Boston University professor Christopher Ricks is willing to
stake his considerable academic reputation promoting Bob Dylan,
I'll gladly put my modest credibility on the line hawking the
beauty and elegance of vintage Cohen. I think his rendition of Joan
of Arc's Gethsemane moment (``I'm tired of the war/I want the kind
of work I had before'') should be included in Religious Studies
curricula the world over. And has there ever been a better marriage
of art direction, cinematography, and music than the final minutes
of the Robert Altman/Vilmos Zsigmond sepia-toned classic, ``McCabe
and Mrs. Miller,'' which ends with Cohen's plaintive ballad
``Winter Lady''? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   I even admire, well, envy, his vices. Sheppard calls Cohen ``a
Lothario of insatiable stamina,'' who has been linked over the
years to just about everybody. And they're all grist for the mill.
``Suzanne'' was one of two Suzannes, and ``Joan of Arc'' is
supposedly Nico, the chanteuse for Andy Warhol's Velvet
Underground. His early hit, ``So Long, Marianne,'' is breezy,
soulful, and a pleasure to hear. Unless you are the unlucky
Marianne, of course.
</P>
<P>
   So what's on the Web site? All kinds of things: the original
manuscripts for ``Suzanne'' and ``Joan of Arc;'' an account of
May's Leonard Cohen Event, held in Montreal with the bard in
absentia. We learn that Cohen left the monastery a year ago, on his
65th birthday, and has been roaming around India, Greece, and LA.
He is working on a new album, and a new poetry collection. Just
last week he posted a two-line poem from . . . somewhere. Here it
is: ``You go your way/I'll go your way too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Leonard.

INDIAN DEFIANCE INFLAMES CANADA'S LOBSTER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick _ On the choppy waters of Miramichi
Bay, Indian lobster fishermen wearing bulletproof vests instead of
life vests play cat-and-mouse games with enforcement officers from
the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, with both sides'
high-powered craft cutting and weaving in close proximity. From
time to time, the Indians hurl pails of fish guts at the gray
patrol boats carrying the Maple Leaf ensign, hooting and jeering
when an officer is splattered.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore, greasy black smoke billowing from the barricades of
junk vehicles, spruce logs, and scrap lumber blocking Route 11 _
one of the province's most-frequented tourist routes _ signals a
season of anger and defiance on the Indian reserves of Atlantic
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute over how much lobster Indians should be allowed to
haul from the sea, and _ above all _ whether ``white'' government
has any right to regulate commercial fishing by aboriginal tribes,
has triggered Canada's most dangerous confrontation between natives
and authorities in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the violence in the lobster fishery is a larger
question: Do native people possess a special ethnic right to
natural resources precious to all Canadians?
</P>
<P>
   No, answer fisheries officials, who have repeatedly arrested
Mi'kmaq Indians this month for setting hundreds of illegal lobster
traps in New Brunswick's Miramichi Bay and Nova Scotia's St. Mary's
Bay, and have at times subdued violators with pepper spray during
boat deck brawls.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, answer Indians, who have sought to repel enforcement
boarding parties from their boats and docks with fists, baseball
bats, and fishing gaffs. One fisheries officer received skull
injuries Tuesday after being pelted with rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one thing is clear,'' said Jean-Marc Lanteigne, a
spokesman for Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans. ``The
situation is highly dangerous, and everyone needs to be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Natives say they are fighting for more than just lobster. Last
week, Matthew Coon Come, militant new grand chief of the Assembly
of First Nations, stunned environmentalists by saying aboriginal
people cannot be forbidden from hunting endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Coon Come declared that Indians will not be bound by Canada's
new federal endangered species law, which comes into effect this
fall after decades of debate. He said people of the so-called First
Nations _ collective name for the 800,000 Indians and Eskimos
living on 2,370 reserves _ will continue to hunt bowhead whales and
Peary caribou, both near extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Lobsters are not endangered, of course. The big-clawed
crustacean became Canada's most valuable catch in the 1990s after
the collapse of Newfoundland's cod stocks, an economic and
environmental catastrophe caused by overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster harvest is worth $305 million a year to Nova Scotia,
Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Quebec. But catches have
slumped in recent years, with 90.3 million pounds landed in 1998,
down from 104.7 million pounds at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is not alarming, but fishermen, conservationists,
and fisheries officials say it points to the need to continue
tightly restricting numbers of ``tagged,'' or legal, traps and
limiting fishing communities to lobster seasons lasting only a few
weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Indians, boosted by a landmark Canadian Supreme Court ruling
last fall, are asserting a right to place thousands of new traps in
heavily-fished waters, saying Ottawa has no authority over native
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fish and fish and fish, as the Supreme Court has shown
to be our traditional right,'' said Chief Reg Maloney of Nova
Scotia's Indian Brook Mi'kmaq band, whose members have been
repeatedly arrested for illegal catches hauled from St. Mary's Bay.
``The fisheries police are dressed for war, and we will meet them.
If tragedy comes, it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of Atlantic Canada's 34 Mi'kmaq and Maliseet bands
have signed temporary agreements with Ottawa, agreeing to abide by
fishing laws for one year in exchange for tens of millions of
dollars worth of free boats, traps, and other fishing gear, as well
as extremely valuable lobster licenses bought from white fishermen.
But there is deepening fear in fishing communities of an Indian
rush to the lobstering grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any sign of weakening by Ottawa will be a go-ahead for even
more illegal activity,'' said Denny Morrow, a white fisherman from
southern Nova Scotia. ``This isn't just about native rights, it's
about protecting a natural resource. If the lobsters are
overfished, we're all going down, native and non-native.''
</P>
<P>
   But defiance is in the wind at the impoverished Burnt Church
reserve, where self-described Mi'kmaq ``warriors'' last week
blocked sections of Route 11 with blazing barricades. They forced
Royal Canadian Mounted Police to divert thousands of cars, many
carrying visitors from New England, away from the main thoroughfare
to the province's beach resorts at the height of tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite bluster from Ottawa, Burnt Church natives continued to
harvest lobster from Miramichi Bay during the closed summer season,
saying they intend to place 5,000 pots in the water and issue their
own lobstering licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders from across Canada, meanwhile, rallied to support
the rebellious reserve. Grand Chief Coon Come pointedly feasted on
illegal lobster after giving a speech of encouragement to Burnt
Church natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this hassle because First Nations people, the poorest of
the poor, the most marginalized and dispossessed, are trying to
catch a few lobster to earn a living,'' said Coon Come, a Quebec
Cree.
</P>
<P>
   The fuse was lit last fall when the Canadian Supreme Court sent
shock waves through fishing communities with a historic ruling that
upheld treaties signed by England's King George II in the 1760s
guaranteeing Mi'kmaq and Maliseet Indians of the Maritime provinces
the right to fish and hunt on scale sufficient to earn a ``modest
livelihood,'' not simply put food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been customary in eastern Canada for natives to
snare small quantities of lobster and fish for their own families,
but the vaguely worded ruling seemed to hold that Indians have a
racial right to catch any fish or crustacean in commercial
quantities without federal licenses or adherence to conservation
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it told us was that First Nations can make our own
fishing rules and control our own destiny,'' said James Ward, a
firebrand young leader at the Burnt Church Mi'kmaq reserve.
``That's what this is really all about _ control.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the high court's ruling, docks and bays in
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island became the
scene of showdowns between natives and white fishermen. Near the
impoverished Burnt Church reserve, hundreds of native-owned lobster
traps and fishing boats were vandalized; in retaliation, a
white-owned house and several pickup trucks were torched.
</P>
<P>
   As the one-year anniversary of the court ruling approaches, the
threat of violence hangs heavy in the salt air as natives assert
their perceived right to set as many lobster traps as they choose
and to harvest lobster even during closed seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So explosive is the issue that the Supreme Court, after its
original decision, issued an extraordinary ``clarification,''
saying that it meant only to uphold a ``limited'' right for
Indians, and that the goverment has authority to regulate
aboriginal fishing in the interests of conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal vowed this week that natives
will not be allowed to fish illegally. But Indian lobster catching
continues, and many white fishermen fret over the prospect of a
``political'' compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me what kind of deal is going to be made at the end
of this,'' said Ron Cormier, president of the Maritime Fishermen's
Union. ``The goal should be protecting stocks _ making everyone
fish by the same rules.''

KATZENMOYER, VAUGHN KEEP TABS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two players from different professional sports, friends
for no apparent reason other than a mutual admiration, were 30
miles apart Tuesday: Patriots linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer at
Foxboro Stadium in Foxborough, and Anaheim Angels first baseman Mo
Vaughn in the visitors' clubhouse at Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' said Vaughn, as he reached into his locker
for a game jersey and pulled out a pen to sign it. ``Give this to
Andy. Tell him I'll catch up to him this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is a longtime Ohio State football fan; he even befriended
running back Eddie George, the former Buckeye now playing with the
Tennessee Titans. In his Red Sox days, Vaughn would visit Columbus,
Ohio, after the baseball season to take in Ohio State games. On one
such trip in 1996, he noticed a freshman linebacker: Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I played linebacker, I'd want to play it like Andy,'' said
Vaughn. ``I just got into his style of play. It was so exciting.
The way he hit people. The energy he had out on the field. He was
just a player that I started to follow and admire.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn expressed his admiration for Katzenmoyer to the Buckeye
trainers, who provided him with Katzenmoyer jerseys. Soon the two
players began sending each other jerseys and game equipment as
souvenirs. A friendship began.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it Tuesday, Katzenmoyer couldn't recall ever
meeting Vaughn in person, though Vaughn thought the two had said
hello briefly in the Buckeye locker room years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No professional athlete had ever recognized me like that,''
said Katzenmoyer. ``I had a famous disc jockey, Sugar Ray, wear my
jersey on TV, but never a professional athlete like Mo. I was so
flattered. When you're a kid in school and someone with that kind
of a name pays attention to you like that, that's a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was even more of a thrill for Vaughn when Katzenmoyer was
drafted by the Patriots last year. Vaughn still makes his offseason
home in Easton, not too far from Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire him as a player,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``I've always
liked home run hitters and guys who drive in a lot of runs in
baseball. Mo fits that, all right. I always watch for him on
`SportsCenter' to see what he's up to and followed all of the
things he went through here in Boston when the Red Sox didn't sign
him. I think he's happy in California, but I wish he were here with
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what impresses me most about him is what a great
person he is. All of the charitable things he does for kids is so
amazing. He's so gracious. I think he sets such a high standard for
everyone else in professional sports to give back and be thankful
for everything we have as professional athletes. That's why when I
knew that Mo was a fan of mine, I thought that's really great
because he's such a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn thought that the defensive schemes used by Ohio State
during Katzenmoyer's junior season ``set him back a little bit.''
Last year, said Vaughn, ``Andy got a chance to get his feet wet in
the NFL to see what playing in the league is all about. Now, you
watch, he's going to go back to being the `Big Cat' like he was at
Ohio State. The Patriots are going to find he's going to be a great
player for them in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer certainly has had an impressive camp in Bill
Belichick's 3-4 defense. Having two large linebackers in the middle
_ like the 6-foot-3-inch, 255-pound Katzenmoyer and the 6-4,
250-pound Ted Johnson _ is basically what Belichick wants, in the
long run. Johnson, though, has been out for virtually the entire
preseason with a hamstring injury and Katzenmoyer jammed his
shoulder last week, missing the Tampa Bay game Sunday. His status
for Thursday night's game vs. Carolina is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson tore his biceps in a scrimmage last August,
Katzenmoyer got to start 11 games as a rookie, which was great
on-the-job training. He had been penciled in as an outside
linebacker to replace Todd Collins but had to take a crash course
in the middle linebacker position.
</P>
<P>
   After the season, he went back to Ohio State and worked with
Buckeye strength coach Dave Kennedy, who helped him get bigger and
stronger. When he reported for camp this year, it was obvious he
had taken his conditioning and strength work seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked the fact that he worked so hard,'' said Vaughn.
``The guys at Ohio State always said he works so hard in the weight
room. He played like a madman out there. I'd see some highlights on
ESPN and I'd say, ``Man, he's tough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer said he played baseball through his sophomore year
in high school before devoting his time to football. He said of
Vaughn, ``I admire him as an athlete because to have the mental and
physical ability to play 162 games in a season, that's amazing to
me. To be able to go out every day and play in a competitive game
that means something and come up with the big hits he's come up
with . . . I mean, that to me is a great athlete. It's something
that's hard for me to understand as a football player who plays
once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the way Vaughn is built, Katzenmoyer said, he
probably could have done some damage on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these days, I'd like to be able to spend some time with
him, just hang around,'' said Katzenmoyer. ``Our lives are so busy
that we haven't found the time to really just sit down and talk.
I'll always be interested in him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' concurred Vaughn, ``I'll catch up to him this winter.
Is he playing this week? Make sure he gets the jersey; maybe it'll
give him some good luck.''

redecorate its Web site with Christmas merchandise next month
instead of in October. Online music retailer CDnow.com and
gift-seller Ashford.com also plan to jump-start the season weeks
before consumers begin basting their Thanksgiving turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our holiday products are coming in now,'' said Mary Lou
Kelley, Ashford.com's marketing vice president. ``We will be
locked, loaded, and ready to go by Nov. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade
signaled the debut of the holiday shopping season. Those days are
long gone. Today, retailers will do just about anything to prolong
consumer spending and get an early indication of how shoppers will
behave during the fourth quarter, which can account for as much as
80 percent of annual profits.
</P>
<P>
   Web retailers have even more incentive to encourage early
holiday shopping: preventing a repeat of the last-minute crunch
that contributed to last year's bumper crop of online shopping
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the dot-coms no longer can afford to make mistakes
now that many of them are running low on cash and having trouble
finding new investment as they struggle to become stable
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, several Internet retailers angered customers by
failing to deliver in time for the holidays. Forced to rush to the
malls just a few days before Christmas, many online shoppers vowed
they wouldn't give the offending sites a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators were displeased, too. Last month, the Federal
Trade Commission heaped $1.5 million in fines on CDnow, KBKids.com,
Toysrus.com, Macys.com, and three other online retailers that
failed to properly notify shoppers about shipping delays during the
past holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   But even large retailers with extensive experience in managing
inventories and shipping orders say the last-minute holiday crowds
on the Web can be daunting. ``Even for us, those four weeks before
Christmas become a challenge,'' said David Hochberg, a spokesman
for Lillian Vernon Corp., which has been in the catalog business
for nearly a half century. ``Your order curve just skyrockets.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. From the sidelines, investors are watching
to see which Internet retailers deserve their attention. They have
not been impressed with the scores that have been unable to show a
path to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, they have pulled support from cash-burning Web
stores such as Toysmart.com, Craftshop.com, and Boo.com. Other
virtual retailers are slashing advertising budgets and laying off
employees in an effort to stay alive. As traditional companies
continue to flex their muscles online, all but the strongest and
smartest virtual retailers will have a tough time surviving after
Christmas, industry observers say.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the explosive growth in the Web marketplace is
expected to continue. Jupiter Communications Inc. estimates that
online retail sales more than doubled to $7 billion in the last two
months of last year from $3.1 billion during the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With online retail sales expected to soar once again this
holiday season, it doesn't hurt to get a few shoppers in the door
months in advance, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an admirable goal,'' said Scott Silverman, Internet
retailing vice president with the National Retail Federation. ``If
you can condition some of your holiday shoppers to shop over a
longer period of time, there are a whole slew of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers say they're only serving the interests of
customers who shop early to avoid the last-minute rush and pick
from the best selection of merchandise. But they may discover that
their shoppers instead want to play a game of chicken, said Kenneth
M. Gassman, a retail analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, retailers try to stick to their original prices as
long as possible, Gassman said. And each year, consumers twiddle
their thumbs, waiting for retailers to begin slashing prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to wait till the last minute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gassman points out that many Internet retailers are still
learning how to play the retail game _ one reason why some of them
were late focusing on the last year's Christmas season.
Ashford.com, for example, was involved in huge expansion in the
fall of 2000 and as a result was not as prepared to handle holiday
orders as executives would have liked. This year, Web retailers
seem to be leaving nothing to chance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not all customers like the idea of seeing Santas and
sleds on the Web so early _ just as they might cringe at the sight
of malls decked in holly when they're looking for backpacks and
Dracula capes.
</P>
<P>
   About 62 percent of customers expressed annoyance at stores and
catalogs selling holiday merchandise long before Christmas,
according to a 1998 survey by Maritz Marketing Research Inc. The
poll also found that men were more likely than women to be irked by
the early arrival of Christmas retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of a consumer backlash, some Internet retailers say they
prefer to keep the holiday season under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exactly decking our halls with boughs of holly just
yet,'' said John Zimmermann, merchandising vice president for
SmarterKids.com, a Needham online seller of educational toys. ``We
don't use the words Christmas and Hanukkah this early.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Web executives say there's nothing wrong with a little
holiday spirit in summer or early fall if it's done in good taste.
And the ranks of online merchants who agree appear to be widening.
</P>
<P>
   Before Halloween, shoppers at CDnow's Web site will feature a
holiday gift center, which includes a gift registry and wish list.
</P>
<P>
   CDnow also plans to expand its selection of custom-made compact
disks for the holidays. Pick 12 favorite seasonal tunes and the Web
merchant will create a special CD, wrap it and ship it as a gift,
said Tracie Reed, CDnow's merchandising vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Museumshop.com of Arlington will feature corporate holiday
gifts, wrapped and ready to go, in mid-September. It hopes people
will shop for Hanukkah gifts at its site this fall after it adds
merchandise from the Museum of Jewish Heritage and the Jewish
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But Rebecca Reynolds Moore, founder and president of
Museumshop.com, acknowleges that attempts to convert diehard late
shoppers into early buyers is ``wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, a lot of people do plan early,'' she said. ``I'm
not one of them.''

<P>
   Q. We are expecting a baby in spring, about the same time we
both will finish our training programs. I expect to take a
six-month maternity leave before returning to work part time. My
husband anticipates a salary of roughly $30,000 a year when he goes
to work. Our current expenses are $50,560 a year, including
assisting my mother, student loan payments, auto loan, and
additions to retirement expenses. Are we investing appropriately
for retirement and rainy-day expenses? How much should we begin to
save for our child's education?
</P>
<P>
   K.G., Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have a lot on your plate, but you should be in fine shape
in the long run. Since you have amassed considerable savings at
your relatively tender ages, you could enjoy a comfortable
retirement if you did nothing more than continue with your $433
monthly addition to the two retirement accounts. If the current
portfolio averages 10 percent annual total returns in the next 35
years, you would have $9,170,808, which would be roughly equivalent
to $2.75 million in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's hard to see through all of the uncertainties _
future jobs and income levels, the cost of raising and educating
your child, the amount of assistance your mother will need, and so
forth. But it seems people of your age whose current expenses are
only 87 percent of their income should come through all of this in
fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I would quibble with a couple of your investments. I
can't comment on your investments in the American fund family,
since you don't specify which funds you use. Nor am I certain where
your Pax World investments are in Pax World Balanced or Pax World
Growth. Either way, I would look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Pax World Growth, a mid-cap fund with a portfolio blending
growth and value stocks, has consistently underperformed its peers
and holds a compact portfolio of 34 issues, according to current
information from Morningstar Mutual Funds. Such a compact portfolio
adds to the risk level. If its concentration on health care stocks
is what draws you to this fund, I'd suggest a switch to either
Fidelity Select Health Care or Vanguard Health Care funds. If its
policy of investing in stocks of companies that it deems are
socially responsible is the appeal, I'd swap for the Domini Social
Equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in Pax World Balanced fund, it is the more appealing
of the two but it's the wrong kind of fund for your very long-term
investment time frame. Only 62.7 percent of its investments are in
stocks, and in the long run, the cash and bond holdings will be a
drag on your portfolio. This is especially important since this is
the target for the lion's share of your current savings.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not terribly enthusiastic about Parnassus fund, another
socially responsible offering. Its long-term results are strong,
with a 10-year record running ahead of the Standard and Poor's 500
Index, but recent results have been choppy. Moreover, this is
another fund with a compact portfolio, with only 36 issues,
according to Morningstar. I'd be more comfortable with Domini here,
which relies on 399 stocks. It doesn't have a long-term record to
match that of Parnassus, but it has trailed the Standard and Poor's
500 Index closely.
</P>
<P>
   As for college costs, I'll give you some rough parameters. A
month ago, I extended the college cost projections from the current
edition of ``Paying for College Without Going Broke'' to estimate
the cost of a college education starting in 2017. For a public
school, the four-year cost would be $84,636; for a private college,
$220,867.
</P>
<P>
   To amass such sums so the total balance would be on hand after
17 years, you would need to save $159 a month for a public school
or $414 a month for a private one. Those figures presume average 10
percent investment returns. You would have to adjust the figures
higher (by 5 percent annually) to allow for the extra year for the
child born in 2001. But, of course, you could adjust the figures
lower if you assume that, like yourselves, your child will be
willing to assume the debt that goes with student loans.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I purchase FNMA certificates? Vanguard does not
have FNMAs.
</P>
<P>
   M.P., Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't find any mutual fund that invests solely in Fannie
Maes, the mortgage-backed securities issued by the Federal National
Mortgage Association. However, most government securities funds do
hold some FNMA debt, either in the form of certificates that give
the owners a share of a pool of mortgages, or in debt securities
issued by FNMA. For example, Fidelity Mortgage Securities holds a
large portion of its portfolio in Fannie Mae issues. At Vanguard,
the biggest stake I can find is in the portfolio of Vanguard
Intermediate-Term US Treasury fund, and that's in FNMA debt rather
than mortgage securities.
</P>
<P>
   You can, of course, buy FNMA certificates from a stockbroker,
but be warned that if you do, you're in for a lot of bookkeeping.
That's because the payments from these securities are irregular and
vary in nature. In the routine course of business, part of each
payment from such securities is interest, and the balance is a
return of capital _ the part of the payments made by the mortgage
borrowers that represent their payment of the principal. The
returns can be irregular, because the borrowers may prepay some or
all of the principal on the mortgages. The holders of these
certificates must keep careful track of which payments are taxable
interest and which are returns of their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who are interested in such securities opt for what
is called a unit investment trust. These are much like mutual
funds, established by brokerage firms that buy a bundle of
securities, sell shares in the bundle, and then simply hold the
securities until the last of them is retired, at which time the
trust goes out of business. The owners of shares in a unit
investment trust have the advantage of having a great deal of the
paperwork done by its managers, but the flow of payments is likely
to be just as irregular as if you owned the certificates directly.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to holding the mortgage certificates (in contrast
to FNMA debentures and other straight debt securities) is that
unless the investor carefully isolates the interest and principal
payments as they come in, he might be under the impression that the
returns are higher than they really are.
</P>
<P>
   If you are relying upon FNMA certificates to supply a long-term
income stream, you must carefully reinvest the portion of your
payments that represents the principal. If you're careless and
simply spend the distributions, by the time your final check comes
in you would have spent the entire principal balance as well as the
interest. With a debt security such as a debenture, you will get
interest payments at the stated level, and when the debenture
matures, your principal will be returned to you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A few years ago, I obtained a software program called
Vanguard Retirement Manager, which I found comprehensive and
user-friendly and much better than any other software I could find.
In my attempt to upgrade the software, I discovered Vanguard had
discontinued it. What is the best software to assist future
retirees in financial planning?
</P>
<P>
   R.F., Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This time, I'm going to pass the buck to readers. I tried the
Vanguard software but was not as enthusiastic as you are. I've
tried a number of other programs and have always been dissatisfied.
Most of them, although not necessarily Vanguard's, are heavily
tilted toward the issuing company's products or to an online
database to which you must subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect program would allow you to manage a broad portfolio
of securities, including mutual funds, common stocks, bonds, and
cash accounts. It should allow you to factor in inflation,
historical and future, and to track either all of your finances or
only some. For many years, I used an old version of Quicken, with
varying degrees of frustration. It was the only program in my
computer that did not survive Y2K. I now use Microsoft Money, with
about equal enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   So, readers, does anyone have any recommendations?

<P>
   Imagine a meal made from several of the world's most perfect
foods nestled together on a plate: long strands of al dente
spaghetti tossed with ripe plum tomatoes cooked in olive oil. It's
a simple dish, made even nicer when you sprinkle a nutty
Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Take a deep whiff of the beautiful
aromas, twist the strands onto your fork, and dig in.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture the dish without the cheese. Or, according to what
findings the government presents, picture life without Italy's
finest Parmesan and pecorino romano, France's Roquefort,
Switzerland's Gruyere, the British Cheddars, and our Vermont
Cheddars. Just suppose that any cheese being made today in this
country or Europe, using certain techniques in existence since
ancient times, was suddenly pulled off the market.
</P>
<P>
   That bleak scenario is a possibility, as the US Food and Drug
Administration reviews its 50-year-old policy on unpasteurized milk
cheeses. Now, any cheese made with unpasteurized milk has to be
aged a minimum of 60 days, which is the case with
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Roquefort, and the others. But the FDA says
that unpasteurized milk, which is used in all the great cheeses of
the world, may carry certain pathogens that can survive the 60-day
aging process. The news has cheesemakers, cheese purveyors,
restaurateurs, and the cheese-loving public up in arms. Even with
the FDA stillin its investigation stage, the cheese enthusiasts
have decided to make a preemptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   Ihsan Gurdal, co-owner of Formaggio Kitchen in Cambridge, Mass.,
known for its selection of fine cheeses, is leading the Boston
group. The cheese involved in the research, he says, ``is a huge
list.'' Any ban on unpasteurized milk cheeses, says Gurdal,
``basically eliminates cheeses as we know them.'' Formaggio Kitchen
supplies its sister store, Formaggio South End, and also sends
cheese to some 120 restaurants, including the French Laundry in
Yountville, Calif.; Emeril's in New Orleans; and, locally, the Blue
Room, Rialto, and Radius.
</P>
<P>
   Unpasteurized milk cheeses are in demand because they're
considered to be the finest cheeses available. ``The best, tastiest
cheeses are made from fresh, raw milk _ just as it comes from the
animal, alive and vibrant with living organisms, which are,
unfortunately, very perishable and open to contamination,'' writes
Steven Jenkins in ``Cheese Primer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-day aging period was established so that any harmful
organisms, such as Listeria, Salmonella, and E. coli, would be
destroyed. Aging also hardens a cheese, but certain French
washed-rind or bloom-rind cheeses are also sold here because their
plants in France are on an ``approved producer'' list established
by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Cheeses made from pasteurized milk also escape the potential
ban. But, to connoisseurs, pasteurized milk cheeses have no real
flavor. And Gurdal thinks that pasteurization doesn't guarantee
anything. ``When you pasteurize the milk,'' he says, ``you are
creating an environment to destroy the bacteria. But you're not
only destroying the harmful bacteria, but the good bacteria, the
ones that protect the milk against diseases. If the pasteurization
was a shoddy one, the milk has no protection.''
</P>
<P>
   On farms in Europe, animals are milked and within hours cheese
is made with that milk. ``Unpasteurized is the tradition,'' says
Gurdal. Neither he nor the other producers or purveyors are opposed
to the rules as they stand now. ``We like the status quo,'' Gurdal
says.
</P>
<P>
   To unify their opposition to the proposed ban, the
Wisconsin-based American Cheese Society, Boston-based Oldways
Preservation and Trust, and a group of cheese purveyors and
producers banded together as the Cheese of Choice Coalition. They
decided they would be better off voicing their outrage now, rather
than waiting until the federal agency was further along in its
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling the public what they're about to lose if this
goes into effect,'' says Gurdal. ``What we're trying to do right
now is to have everyone rally together.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gurdal nor the other purveyors know where the idea of
reviewing the 60-day policy on unpasteurized-milk cheeses came
from. Ari Weinzweig of Zingerman's, a popular delicatessen in Ann
Arbor, Mich., that does $1 million a year in cheese sales,
speculates that ``it's one of those administrative things that
starts in somebody's office.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the decision to investigate the unpasteurized policy
has a scientific background, says Dr. Jack Mowbray, a researcher at
the FDA. There have been some reports of illnesses, Mowbray says.
``A big one in Canada,'' he says. ``Europe and North America are
primarily where the outbreaks have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurdal's group would like to see the United States use the same
safe-hygiene procedures used in Europe today. ``These things are in
place already,'' says Gurdal. The FDA already inspects
cheese-making producers in this country and has its
approved-producer French list. Mowbray says the agency is not far
enough along in the research process to make any other decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us,'' says Gurdal, ``and to our public, this is an issue
about our right to have a say in what we have to eat.'' If, in
fact, there are some risks, he says, consumers can make the
decision to take those risks. ``They're basically saying that no
one should own knives because you can cut yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's Mowbray says, ``We're not even to the point where
we're considering options. We're conducting research, working with
USDA and other institutions to determine the nature of the problem.
Once we do that, we'll draw up a list of risk-management options.''
</P>
<P>
   Zingerman's Weinzweig, who, like Gurdal, has petitions in his
store for customer signatures, agrees that the risk should be up to
the individual. ``It's like crossing the street,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nobody does anything and this happens,'' says Weinzweig,
``I'm going to feel really bad. Hopefully we can keep it from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep the food lovers of the world from a fate worse than
death: having to sprinkle their pasta with Parmesan from a little
green can.

<P>
   WELLFLEET, Mass. _ Whales splash off White Crest Beach on a
postcard-perfect Cape Cod morning. Wellfleet Police Chief Richard
Rosenthal, parked atop the dunes in his cruiser, squints through
the windshield. A discussion about serial killers and book
publishers _ Rosenthal, the author of four books, is a credible
authority on both professions _ is briefly put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're sitting here, in my town, watching whales
breaching, is pretty neat,'' says Rosenthal slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Not what a New York cop would expect to see in the East River?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Rosenthal with a gruff laugh. ``Maybe bodies
floating, though.''
</P>
<P>
   No stretch there. Rosenthal, 54, has seen just about everything,
including floaters, during his 32 years in law enforcement. Ten
years ago, after serving as an undercover cop, robbery detective,
firearms expert, homicide investigator, and a NYPD chopper pilot,
he moved to this quiet Outer Cape community (pop. 3,000) to run a
police department cut more in the mold of ``Mayberry RFD'' than
``NYPD Blue.'' Hell's Kitchen this is not. In Wellfleet, organized
crime is two teenagers conspiring to shoplift a six-pack of Coca
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   There's a curious thing about the town's men in blue, though,
and one befitting its reputation as a seasonal arts colony. Besides
Rosenthal, two former officers are also professional writers. Alec
Wilkinson, a longtime summer resident and New Yorker staffer, wrote
the first of his five books, ``Midnights: A Year With the Wellfleet
Police,'' after working as a cop here in the early 1980s. His book
was reissued this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Miller, who also summered here for many years prior to
donning the Wellfleet badge and uniform, now writes a monthly
column for Slate from his current vantage point as an NYPD
detective and former narcotics officer. Miller recently fielded
several book-contract offers as well, which for the moment he says
are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Rosenthal, who just published ``Rookie Cop:
Deep Undercover in the Jewish Defense League'' (Leapfrog Press).
With a novel (``The Murder of Old Comrades'') and two nonfiction
books (``Sky Cops'' and ``K-9 Cops'') already to his credit,
Rosenthal has taken writing well beyond the hobby stage and made it
a serious second career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have writer's block. I don't even know what that is,''
says Rosenthal, who has also written two unpublished novels and
plans a future nonfiction book about Hadden Clark, a convicted
serial killer whose grim dominion included the Outer Cape.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't sound like the resume of a typical small-town
New England police chief, neither does Rosenthal. In fact, he
speaks both German and Russian with passable fluency and sprinkles
conversations with terms like ``conundrum'' and ``sobriquet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rookie Cop'' revisits Rosenthal's first year on the force,
when he was plucked fresh from the Police Academy and assigned to
infiltrate the JDL, led by Rabbi Meir Kahane (``Every Jew a
twenty-two.''). At the time Rosenthal joined the NYPD's Bureau of
Special Services, in 1969, Kahane and his followers were suspected
of at least one fatal bombing in Manhattan. New to police work,
Rosenthal, a Brooklyn native, was cast as the spy who came in from
left field.
</P>
<P>
   At least some JDL members immediately fingered him as a likely
informant, not the taxi driver he claimed to be. Despite this,
Rosenthal was put in charge of the group's weapons arsenal. Much of
his book reads like outtakes from ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot
Straight,'' with JDL members retreating to a makeshift terrorist
``camp'' in upstate New York, trying to manufacture explosives that
would actually work. Soviet officials were their principal targets,
but African-American groups, the PLO, and even the Ku Klux Klan
drew their attention too. Kahane comes across as a forceful if
flawed leader, while Rosenthal walks a fine line between helping
the group and thwarting its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a fairly dysfunctional group,'' Rosenthal avers.
``They take a guy like me, a nonreligious, secular Jew who doesn't
dress or act like them _ that should have been a flag that
something was wrong.'' Yet they were so in need of a weapons
expert, according to Rosenthal, that JDL members overlooked obvious
clues, including the fact that Rosenthal was married to a
German-born, non-Jewish woman.
</P>
<P>
   Disorganized, maybe. Even delusional on occasion. But dangerous
nonetheless, Rosenthal contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only killed one person, to the best of my knowledge,'' he
says. ``But they blew up a lot of places. It was only a matter of
time before they killed somebody else. And as the organization
evolved, they became very paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahane and others were arrested on weapons and bomb-making
charges in May 1971, ending Rosenthal's undercover role. More than
100 firearms were recovered by state and federal agents. Rosenthal
subsequently testified against JDL members during a trial that
slapped Kahane with a five-year jail sentence. Kahane later
emigrated to Israel; he was assassinated in New York City in 1990.
Rosenthal wound up socializing with a group of fellow cops who had
infiltrated groups such as the Black Panthers, Students for a
Democratic Society, the Communist Party, and others deemed security
threats in the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it is much of an issue in Wellfleet, but Rosenthal
defends domestic surveillance of so-called radical groups as a
necessary evil in a free society _ more so in the wake of incidents
such as the Oklahoma City bombing. Yet even in a community like
Wellfleet, he says, there are built-in tensions about what
townspeople do and do not expect from law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us to protect them and their property, but they
don't want us to interfere,'' he says. ``They want us to make sure
inappropriate people are controlled, but they don't want us to
bother people walking down the street. It's a matter of finding the
right balance, and that's difficult to find.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty was underscored earlier this year by two
incidents of alleged racial profiling on the Outer Cape, one
involving Rosenthal and a fellow Wellfleet officer. In each case, a
gun was drawn on an unarmed black man _ one a Cape Cod Times
reporter, the other a Senegalese college student.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal won't discuss the Wellfleet incident in detail except
to say his department's actions got a ``bad rap.'' His 13-member
force, he says, has two black officers. He does admit to suffering
from professional culture shock, though, in moving to a place like
Wellfleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a while to become comfortable with the dynamics,''
he says, shifting his bulky frame in the cruiser's front seat. ``I
came from a big city, where officers are basically anonymous.
You're a technocrat there. You enforce the law or not. In little
towns there's an intertwining of citizens and authorities. If you
antagonize the citizens, it has a negative effect on your budget.
That's the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, when Wellfleet's population swells to around
20,000, the police department hires eight or nine part-time
officers. Even with the seasonal influx, however, violent crime is
practically nonexistent out here. Rosenthal says Wellfleet police
have logged no murders and one armed robbery during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, one of the town's other writers in blue, was a full-time
officer in 1990 when Rosenthal took over the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other cops had no idea what to make of Rich,'' Miller
recalls. ``It's traditional for regular cops to look down on
administrators. Yet here was a guy with 100 times the experience
they had, and they couldn't get him worked up about anything. He'd
come in and listen to their grievances and basically say, `Suck it
up, guys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Says Rosenthal: ``In a small town you can get away with almost
anything so long as you're not perceived as a liar. If people think
you lie, you're dead in the water and might as well move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal wrote his first novel after meeting author J. C.
Pollack through a mutual friend. Pollack, the author of ``Mission:
MIA'' and other thrillers, encouraged Rosenthal to try writing
fiction. Rosenthal's previous writing had been limited to technical
articles on police work. The result of meeting Pollack was ``Old
Comrades,'' a Cold War novel set in Manhattan that draws on
Rosenthal's background as a Russian language specialist in the US
Air Force. After reading a draft of the novel, Pollack steered
Rosenthal toward Simon &AMP; Schuster and helped him find an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1992, ``Old Comrades'' earned Rosenthal a $10,000
advance and sold a respectable 20,000 copies. But a second novel
never did get published _ even Rosenthal calls it ``terrible'' _
and he turned to nonfiction. It took him nine months apiece to
write his next two books, Rosenthal says, each based on one of his
passions: flying helicopters and raising dogs. He and his wife,
Frauke, a Wellfleet firefighter, also enjoy taking motorcycle trips
together. They have no children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only after my first book did it dawn on me how hard it is,
that this is more of a business than an art form,'' Rosenthal says.
``I'm very methodical now. I don't write on spec. I do a proposal.
If it gets bought I write the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing and selling fiction is much more difficult than
nonfiction,'' he continues. ``Nonfiction, and I may regret these
words, is simple. It's a matter of finding an interesting subject,
researching it, and putting it in words other people want to
read.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``K-9 Cops,'' Rosenthal switched publishers, moving from
Pocket Books to Leapfrog Press, a small Wellfleet-based enterprise.
Mid-list authors like him get lost at big houses, he explains. ``If
you get no publicity, no one knows you exist _ no matter how good
the book is,'' Rosenthal says.
</P>
<P>
   Hadden Clark, a serial killer with a history of mental illness
and a penchant for cross-dressing, could be Rosenthal's most
commercial subject yet. Rosenthal guesses that Clark, convicted in
Maryland in 1993 on a single murder count, may have killed as many
as 20 people dating back to the early '80s. Clark also pleaded
guilty to a second murder and has admitted to a dozen more,
although investigators have had trouble confirming his confessions.
On three visits to the Outer Cape, Clark, a former Provincetown
cook, has led a team of law enforcement personnel _ including
Rosenthal _ on fruitless searches for the remains of additional
victims.
</P>
<P>
   That only lends more spice to the tale, insists the chief, who
has also been shadowed by Wilkinson _ Wellfleet really is a small
town _ for an upcoming New Yorker piece on the Clark case.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is unique, Rosenthal says, ``only in the length of time he
got away with his crimes. And anyway, everything is a mystery until
it's solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Rosenthal says he steers away from books and films
like ``The Silence of the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a homicide detective really had an impact on my
personality,'' he says. ``It hardens you. It is not a healthy
thing. It desensitizes you, yet stories about serial killers and
homicidal maniacs do fascinate people. I recognize that.''

 ART ADVISORY: With graphic showing categories of possible threats. 
 By BRUCE TAYLOR SEEMAN  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Earth grows warmer, the prognosis for human health is
darkening.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics still dismiss the doomsday scenarios of the so-called
greenhouse effect. But momentum is building for those scientists
who contend that the time has come to investigate how global
warming may hurt, not whether it's real.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stress deaths in the United States may double by 2075, one
researcher estimates. More Americans will wheeze from pollution,
sneeze from pollen and grow ill from contaminated water, according
to some projections.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies showed that abnormal rainfalls boosted mice
populations and likely sparked the 1993 hantavirus outbreak near
Albuquerque, N.M., suggesting that climate shifts pose infectious
disease threats in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast is worse for those living beyond U.S. borders,
where diseases may hitchhike on bugs thriving in the heat and
epidemics may wash ashore on ocean plants blooming in warm water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening right now,'' said Paul Epstein, associate
director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard
University's Medical School, who is among the most pessimistic of
researchers. ``Glaciers are retreating, plants are migrating. We're
seeing West Nile virus in New York, dengue and malaria in northern
India.''
</P>
<P>
   The warming phenomenon is widely blamed on the atmospheric
build-up of ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide, which are
emitted during the burning of coal and other fossil fuels. The
gases trap heat, upsetting climate systems, many experts maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences to health are viewed through the lens of
probability. Rising temperatures, heavier rains and longer droughts
would shake up ecological systems that influence human well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonged rains, for example, might cause new plant growth that
would attract deer, which can carry ticks, which can carry Lyme
disease. Drought may slow rivers, creating stagnant pools for
mosquito breeding.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are riveting to specialists across the
sciences, from experts in plant migration to researchers who peek
inside polar ice cores for clues about prehistoric climate.
</P>
<P>
   At least two groups of scientists are tracking possible health
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, assembled by the
United Nations, has concluded that ``significant loss of life'' is
possible. Dengue, rift valley fever, cholera and other diseases may
spread in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the IPCC
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of the world population vulnerable to malaria may
rise to 60 percent from 45 percent by 2100, according to the IPCC.
</P>
<P>
   A group of U.S. scientists, meanwhile, is updating a report to
Congress that will outline domestic threats from hotter air and
oceans. The resulting climate shifts would drench some regions in
more intense and frequent rain, while others areas would get baked
by drought, these scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The group recently warned that warmer air will increase
ground-level ozone pollution, aggravating asthma and other
breathing problems, plus increase allergy woes in areas where
plants flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the health segment of the U.S. National Assessment
of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,
also warns that more people could get sick from contaminated water.
Floods may cause overflows at sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   The specific impact will depend on a person's age and overall
health, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With heat waves, it's the elderly,'' said Jonathan Patz,
director of Johns Hopkins University's Program on Health Effects of
Global Environmental Change and a lead author of the U.S.
assessment. ``With air pollution, if ozone increases, it's people
with respiratory problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Kalkstein, director of the Center for Climatic Research
at the University of Delaware, predicted that heat stress
fatalities will double in the next 75 years if warming trends and
other conditions persist. About 2,000 to 3,000 Americans die each
year from heat stress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fatalities will be most common in cities in the Northeast and
Midwest, where residents are unaccustomed to extreme, enduring
heat, and where many people live in brick houses with tar roofs.
</P>
<P>
   But people living in established hot spots may suffer, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume it gets up to 120 or 125 degrees relatively
regularly'' in Phoenix, Kalkstein said. ``You may get to the point
where the heat just becomes intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   All the projections come with caveats.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, other factors may prove more important than global
warming in the spread of disease. Expansions in worldwide travel
and trade will be responsible for some epidemics. So will weak
sanitation, water and medical systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major problem is population growth,'' said Dr. Donald
Henderson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. ``Urban areas are
growing at very rapid rates. People in tropical areas are living in
crowded areas with poor sanitation. All these factors could allow
an organism to grow, but they have nothing to do with global
warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts also are clouded by the limits of science. Researchers
cannot say, for example, exactly when and where disease will
strike, or how severely. Nor is it known how vaccines, more air
conditioning or other measures will insulate people from illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the worldwide climate has changed significantly, most
scientists concur. Air temperatures have risen between 0.7 and 1.4
degrees in the past 100 years, and new data show ocean warming down
to depths of nearly 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Palpable symptoms are emerging. Global icecaps are melting.
Insects are migrating to higher elevations, and shrubs are taking
root on the Alaskan tundra.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific understanding of what role climate plays in
health, meanwhile, is growing. In Uganda, torrential rains have
been blamed for malaria deaths. A new study of more than 400
gastrointestinal disease outbreaks across the U.S. estimates that
runoffs from heavy rains carried the bacteria one-third of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed an emerging science,'' said Rita Colwell,
director of the National Science Foundation. ``Will we have cholera
in the U.S.? I doubt it. Will we have more severe events in
Bangladesh? Possibly.''
</P>
<P>
   But most scientists say it's too early to confirm links between
current human sickness and global warming. Predictions that reach
beyond the proof of science risk the label of irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many reasons why malaria has gone higher in
recent years,'' said Paul Reiter, a national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention specialist who has studied mosquitos at
higher elevations. ``But none of them have been attributed to
climate change. It's just make-believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are guilty of oversimplification, said Hadi
Dowlatabadi, director of the Integrated Study of the Human
Dimensions of Global Change at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   If warming temperatures were such a powerful bridge to disease,
Dowlatabadi asks, why did malaria epidemics sweep through England
and other chilly locales in previous generations?
</P>
<P>
   Missing from current projections, he said, are adequate emphases
on public health factors. Between 1995 and 1998, for instance,
50,000 people in northern Mexico fell sick by dengue fever, the
mosquito-born disease that can cause fever, headaches and internal
bleeding. Only 50 people in nearby Texas, meanwhile, were stricken,
Dowlatabadi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me: Does the climate change dramatically as you go
the five miles over the Rio Grande?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers on the U.S. Assessment team, while giving weight to
such arguments, say they miss the larger point: With global climate
shifting, risk is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not complete agreement on all the particulars,'' said
Harvard's Epstein. ``But there is a clear consensus that climate
plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with
more warming and more extreme events, will have a negative impact
on public health in multiple ways.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers scratching away at the question said they've found a
helpful tool in a familiar weather phenomenon: El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino events, the natural climate cycles that cause regional
temperature extremes, rainfalls and droughts, may be useful dress
rehearsals for more permanent shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that El Nino can give you a short window into
long-term events, it's a valid way to look at things,'' said Dr.
Brian Hjelle, a New Mexico scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Hjelle is among researchers who have examined recent outbreaks
of hantavirus, the illness that has killed dozens in New Mexico and
other Southwest states in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   When people became sick with flu-like symptoms in 1993, the
cause was a mystery. The afflicted got fevers, aches and chills.
Next came headaches, nausea and lungs filling with fluid. Forty
died.
</P>
<P>
   Around-the-clock investigation blamed the white-bellied deer
mouse, whose urine can carry the virus. Seven years later,
scientists maintain a climate shift was at work.
</P>
<P>
   The deer mouse population boomed prior to the outbreak,
according to a study authored by Hjelle, because El Nino-driven
rains in 1991-92 increased vegetation, providing food and ground
cover. When conditions turned drier the next year, the mice sought
food in homes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said they're now refining the technique of using
``climate signals'' to prepare for health problems. In East Africa,
ocean temperatures and mountain greenery can be used to predict
outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a disease that causes partial
blindness in humans and forces pregnant livestock to abort fetuses.
And in the Bay of Bengal off Bangladesh, satellite imagery has
shown that higher water temperatures cause plankton blooms that
carry cholera epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think we've made the linkage between climate
variability, ecology and human health,'' said Patz, from Johns
Hopkins. ``And this is where we need to go'' to understand risks.

other conditions persist. About 2,000 to 3,000 Americans die each
year from heat stress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fatalities will be most common in cities in the Northeast and
Midwest, where residents are unaccustomed to extreme, enduring
heat, and where many people live in brick houses with tar roofs.
</P>
<P>
   But people living in established hot spots may suffer, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume it gets up to 120 or 125 degrees relatively
regularly'' in Phoenix, Kalkstein said. ``You may get to the point
where the heat just becomes intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   All the projections come with caveats.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, other factors may prove more important than global
warming in the spread of disease. Expansions in worldwide travel
and trade will be responsible for some epidemics. So will weak
sanitation, water and medical systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major problem is population growth,'' said Dr. Donald
Henderson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. ``Urban areas are
growing at very rapid rates. People in tropical areas are living in
crowded areas with poor sanitation. All these factors could allow
an organism to grow, but they have nothing to do with global
warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts also are clouded by the limits of science. Researchers
cannot say, for example, exactly when and where disease will
strike, or how severely. Nor is it known how vaccines, more air
conditioning or other measures will insulate people from illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the worldwide climate has changed significantly, most
scientists concur. Air temperatures have risen between 0.7 and 1.4
degrees in the past 100 years, and new data show ocean warming down
to depths of nearly 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Palpable symptoms are emerging. Global icecaps are melting.
Insects are migrating to higher elevations, and shrubs are taking
root on the Alaskan tundra.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific understanding of what role climate plays in
health, meanwhile, is growing. In Uganda, torrential rains have
been blamed for malaria deaths. A new study of more than 400
gastrointestinal disease outbreaks across the U.S. estimates that
runoffs from heavy rains carried the bacteria one-third of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed an emerging science,'' said Rita Colwell,
director of the National Science Foundation. ``Will we have cholera
in the U.S.? I doubt it. Will we have more severe events in
Bangladesh? Possibly.''
</P>
<P>
   But most scientists say it's too early to confirm links between
current human sickness and global warming. Predictions that reach
beyond the proof of science risk the label of irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many reasons why malaria has gone higher in
recent years,'' said Paul Reiter, a national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention specialist who has studied mosquitos at
higher elevations. ``But none of them have been attributed to
climate change. It's just make-believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are guilty of oversimplification, said Hadi
Dowlatabadi, director of the Integrated Study of the Human
Dimensions of Global Change at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   If warming temperatures were such a powerful bridge to disease,
Dowlatabadi asks, why did malaria epidemics sweep through England
and other chilly locales in previous generations?
</P>
<P>
   Missing from current projections, he said, are adequate emphases
on public health factors. Between 1995 and 1998, for instance,
50,000 people in northern Mexico fell sick by dengue fever, the
mosquito-born disease that can cause fever, headaches and internal
bleeding. Only 50 people in nearby Texas, meanwhile, were stricken,
Dowlatabadi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me: Does the climate change dramatically as you go
the five miles over the Rio Grande?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers on the U.S. Assessment team, while giving weight to
such arguments, say they miss the larger point: With global climate
shifting, risk is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not complete agreement on all the particulars,'' said
Harvard's Epstein. ``But there is a clear consensus that climate
plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with
more warming and more extreme events, will have a negative impact
on public health in multiple ways.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers scratching away at the question said they've found a
helpful tool in a familiar weather phenomenon: El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino events, the natural climate cycles that cause regional
temperature extremes, rainfalls and droughts, may be useful dress
rehearsals for more permanent shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that El Nino can give you a short window into
long-term events, it's a valid way to look at things,'' said Dr.
Brian Hjelle, a New Mexico scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Hjelle is among researchers who have examined recent outbreaks
of hantavirus, the illness that has killed dozens in New Mexico and
other Southwest states in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   When people became sick with flu-like symptoms in 1993, the
cause was a mystery. The afflicted got fevers, aches and chills.
Next came headaches, nausea and lungs filling with fluid. Forty
died.
</P>
<P>
   Around-the-clock investigation blamed the white-bellied deer
mouse, whose urine can carry the virus. Seven years later,
scientists maintain a climate shift was at work.
</P>
<P>
   The deer mouse population boomed prior to the outbreak,
according to a study authored by Hjelle, because El Nino-driven
rains in 1991-92 increased vegetation, providing food and ground
cover. When conditions turned drier the next year, the mice sought
food in homes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said they're now refining the technique of using
``climate signals'' to prepare for health problems. In East Africa,
ocean temperatures and mountain greenery can be used to predict
outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a disease that causes partial
blindness in humans and forces pregnant livestock to abort fetuses.
And in the Bay of Bengal off Bangladesh, satellite imagery has
shown that higher water temperatures cause plankton blooms that
carry cholera epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think we've made the linkage between climate
variability, ecology and human health,'' said Patz, from Johns
Hopkins. ``And this is where we need to go'' to understand risks.

 ART ADVISORY: With graphic showing categories of possible threats. 
 By BRUCE TAYLOR SEEMAN  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Earth grows warmer, the prognosis for human health is
darkening.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics still dismiss the doomsday scenarios of the so-called
greenhouse effect. But momentum is building for those scientists
who contend that the time has come to investigate how global
warming may hurt, not whether it's real.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stress deaths in the United States may double by 2075, one
researcher estimates. More Americans will wheeze from pollution,
sneeze from pollen and grow ill from contaminated water, according
to some projections.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies showed that abnormal rainfalls boosted mice
populations and likely sparked the 1993 hantavirus outbreak near
Albuquerque, N.M., suggesting that climate shifts pose infectious
disease threats in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast is worse for those living beyond U.S. borders,
where diseases may hitchhike on bugs thriving in the heat and
epidemics may wash ashore on ocean plants blooming in warm water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening right now,'' said Paul Epstein, associate
director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard
University's Medical School, who is among the most pessimistic of
researchers. ``Glaciers are retreating, plants are migrating. We're
seeing West Nile virus in New York, dengue and malaria in northern
India.''
</P>
<P>
   The warming phenomenon is widely blamed on the atmospheric
build-up of ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide, which are
emitted during the burning of coal and other fossil fuels. The
gases trap heat, upsetting climate systems, many experts maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences to health are viewed through the lens of
probability. Rising temperatures, heavier rains and longer droughts
would shake up ecological systems that influence human well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonged rains, for example, might cause new plant growth that
would attract deer, which can carry ticks, which can carry Lyme
disease. Drought may slow rivers, creating stagnant pools for
mosquito breeding.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are riveting to specialists across the
sciences, from experts in plant migration to researchers who peek
inside polar ice cores for clues about prehistoric climate.
</P>
<P>
   At least two groups of scientists are tracking possible health
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, assembled by the
United Nations, has concluded that ``significant loss of life'' is
possible. Dengue, rift valley fever, cholera and other diseases may
spread in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the IPCC
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of the world population vulnerable to malaria may
rise to 60 percent from 45 percent by 2100, according to the IPCC.
</P>
<P>
   A group of U.S. scientists, meanwhile, is updating a report to
Congress that will outline domestic threats from hotter air and
oceans. The resulting climate shifts would drench some regions in
more intense and frequent rain, while others areas would get baked
by drought, these scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The group recently warned that warmer air will increase
ground-level ozone pollution, aggravating asthma and other
breathing problems, plus increase allergy woes in areas where
plants flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the health segment of the U.S. National Assessment
of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change,
also warns that more people could get sick from contaminated water.
Floods may cause overflows at sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   The specific impact will depend on a person's age and overall
health, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With heat waves, it's the elderly,'' said Jonathan Patz,
director of Johns Hopkins University's Program on Health Effects of
Global Environmental Change and a lead author of the U.S.
assessment. ``With air pollution, if ozone increases, it's people
with respiratory problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Kalkstein, director of the Center for Climatic Research
at the University of Delaware, predicted that heat stress
fatalities will double in the next 75 years if warming trends and
other conditions persist. About 2,000 to 3,000 Americans die each
year from heat stress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fatalities will be most common in cities in the Northeast and
Midwest, where residents are unaccustomed to extreme, enduring
heat, and where many people live in brick houses with tar roofs.
</P>
<P>
   But people living in established hot spots may suffer, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume it gets up to 120 or 125 degrees relatively
regularly'' in Phoenix, Kalkstein said. ``You may get to the point
where the heat just becomes intolerable.''
</P>
<P>

warming in the spread of disease. Expansions in worldwide travel

 &HT;     By MIKE FINGER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Some people look at precise, carbon-copy forgeries
of famous athletes' signatures and are astounded. Others marvel at
the meticulous scientific techniques now used to determine if an
autograph is authentic.
</P>
<P>
   But to veteran collector Howard O'Desky, the most amazing aspect
of the sports autograph industry is still the same as it always was
_ plain, old stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, O'Desky's story about a man who spent
thousands of dollars on a Tony Gwynn-model Rawlings baseball glove
that was supposedly signed by Hall-of-Famer Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson died in 1972. Gwynn's first season in the major leagues
didn't come until 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic how many people get taken on stuff like that,''
said O'Desky, the owner of Howie's Sports Cards in San Antonio.
``People are still pretty foolish when it comes to buying
autographs, even with all the evidence about fakes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Months after a federal investigation revealed that more than
half _ and as much as 90 percent _ of ``autographed'' sports
memorabilia is phony, the $1 billion-per-year industry is still
thriving, thanks to the public's insatiable appetite for such
souvenirs and consumers' continued naivete about the prevalence of
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   Even though card shops and on-line auction houses have flooded
the market with more bogus merchandise than ever before, insiders
say that buyers can still feel comfortable about their ability to
purchase authentic signed items _ if they are careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will always have to be diligent in finding out where
the stuff is coming from, and they need to get some certainties
from the companies that they're getting the real deal,'' said Scott
Kelnhofer, editor of ``Card Trade'' magazine. ``I think a lot of
people are starting to ask more questions, and that's a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that questioning was prompted by ``Operation Bullpen,''
an FBI investigation that used athletes such as Gwynn, Sammy Sosa
and Brett Favre as informants to stop illegal dealers nationwide.
More than 50 businesses were raided and 26 defendants have been
charged for crimes ranging from mail fraud to counterfeiting, and
that may be just the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why counterfeiters have found such a home in
the sports memorabilia industry.
</P>
<P>
   Autographs are relatively easy to forge. The demand for such
signatures is huge, especially among children and other fans not
exactly well schooled in the world of investing. And most
importantly, the chances of making money are great, considering
that signed jerseys sell for as much as $20,000 and items as small
as baseballs routinely go for a few hundred dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Because buying autographs can be such a risky proposition, most
professional collectors adhere to two main principles:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't buy anything that you aren't absolutely sure of.
</P>
<P>
   _ If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever look at cheap stuff, because if it's cheap, it's
probably not real,'' said Charlie DiPietro, the owner of Sports
Cards Plus in San Antonio. ``I don't blame people who are skeptical
about autographs, because there's a lot of bad stuff out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Without actually being present for the signing of an autograph,
there are few ways that a buyer can be absolutely certain that an
item is authentic. Almost all autographs sold in stores now come
with certificates of authenticity, but as O'Desky said, ``If a guy
is willing to fake a baseball, why wouldn't he be willing to fake a
letter of authenticity?''
</P>
<P>
   The safest bet for consumers these days is to invest only in
autographs approved by companies such as Professional Sports
Authenticators and Upper Deck Authenticated, which verify the
authenticity of memorabilia by either witnessing the ``signing
event'' or analyzing the paper, ink and penmanship to ensure that
an old autograph is real.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for proof of authenticity has become so great that there
is even a market for companies such as AuthentiGraph.com, a New
York-based start-up that tracks items for the entire life of an
autograph _ from the time before the athlete signs a ball through
countless sales of the item from buyer to buyer.
</P>
<P>
   AuthentiGraph uses a seven-step system to record the ``signing
event,'' time-stamp the certificate of authenticity, register new
owners and provide a thorough history of the autograph that can be
accessed on the Internet. The company is currently trying to coax
players' associations from a number of different sports to sign
autographs exclusively through AuthentiGraph.
</P>
<P>
   AuthentiGraph Vice President Siupeli Malamala, a former New York
Jets offensive lineman, said athletes have a lot to gain from
signing with such companies, because the abundance of fake
autographs on the market only diminishes the value of the real
ones, and customers often can't tell which is which.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there before, so I know how important it is for
players to protect their names,'' Malamala said.

 &HT;    O'Leary leading the renaissance of Georgia Tech football
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - When a bank of lights failed at Georgia Tech football
practice in October 1995, new head coach George O'Leary impatiently
had a trainer call for an electrician.
</P>
<P>
   As Donnie Davis took a snap from Mike Cheever, an explosion
rocked the night, and the Yellow Jackets team watched the
electrician tumble, almost in slow motion, down an embankment from
the fuse box. The Rose Bowl Field lights dimmed and went out again.
</P>
<P>
   When the electrician landed, smoke was coming from under his
cap, and he clutched a screwdriver bent at a right angle. As the
Tech trainers rushed to the electrician and he struggled to rise,
O'Leary took one look, saw he was alive and shouted, ``He's OK. Run
the damn play!''
</P>
<P>
   No one is more single-minded than O'Leary. If it isn't about
football, he's not interested. Tech has gone to three bowls in a
row, a feat it had not managed since 1970-72. The Jackets' past
three seasons of 7-5, 10-2 and 8-4 are only one game short of the
total won by Bobby Ross 1989-91, which included a share of a
national championship. O'Leary's 36-25 mark ranks him fourth in
Tech history in wins behind John Heisman, Bill Alexander and Bobby
Dodd. His winning percentage is third, behind Heisman and Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Yellow Jackets are back. The renaissance of
Georgia Tech football is happening right now.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to talk about his success, O'Leary gives the basics.
``When I first started here, the biggest thing lacking was trust,''
he says. ``I wanted the trust of the players back. I was going to
run a program where everybody is treated the same way hard but
fair. I tell them I try to treat them just like I treat my sons. I
also tell them to go find my sons and see how they were treated.''
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Irishman tells the story, not for the first
time, about his daughter in kindergarten, some 20 years ago,
drawing a detailed picture of the family, down to the pet
Dalmation.
</P>
<P>
   No father was in the picture. ``I was never at home,'' he says.
``The kindergarten teacher was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Maloney, the head coach at Syracuse in 1978, hired O'Leary
as an assistant out of Liverpool High School. ``I didn't really
know him,'' Maloney says, ``but I kept reading about him in the
paper. The only regret I have about it now is that I didn't hire
him five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was an exceptional recruiter,'' Maloney says. ``He
didn't fit that mold. The recruiters today are a whole lot more
slicked down that that. George was more down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney searches for a word to describe the young O'Leary.
``Quiet,'' he finally says. ``He was a low-key kind of guy. He was
like your neighbor next door. He always seemed a lot older than he
was. George was a good listener, a good learner. He adapted. He was
always watching and listening.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Syracuse coach says O'Leary interacted with the
players well but still maintained discipline. ``Sometimes, new
coaches are afraid to be demanding with the players,'' Maloney
says. ``George never was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the players the biggest thing they have to learn are
priorities,'' O'Leary says. ``No. 1 is academics. No. 2 is
football. The social life is tough, because they have only so much
manageable time. I tell them you can do two things well, not
three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think George has changed a bit,'' says Dick McPherson,
who took over the Syracuse program from Maloney. ``He's always been
a very demanding, exact guy. He likes to play golf. He loves his
kids, his wife. He's got his whole life right there in front of
him. All George ever wanted to do was work, recruit and have a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary hasn't backed down from the top players in recruiting.
He isn't frightened away if FSU or Florida is recruiting the same
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've isolated players, stuck to our guns of bringing in
players with character,'' O'Leary says. ``I've told our assistants
not to be afraid to walk away from a good player if the character's
not there.'' O'Leary has managed to stay flexible through more than
30 years in the game. He preaches accountability above all. ``All
of our coaches understand accountability,'' he says. ``It's
important we all walk and talk the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell all our players exactly what I think,'' he says. ``I
have rules about drinking, about drugs. The most important thing
is, don't lie to me. I won't lie to you, and you don't lie to me.
When they come to me about not being treated fairly, I tell `em
they're not going to like my answer. As long as I'm head coach,
it's not a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's players aren't like those of the past, O'Leary says.
``There's a whole lot more going on in society today,'' he says.
``Some guys seem to think they've got a right to a scholarship, a
right to play. There are no rights, just opportunities. You earn
everything you get. You earn respect, playing time. What happens in
the classroom is their responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech moved in 1999 to assure that O'Leary would stay. He signed
a six-year rollover contract with a hefty buyout. The first year
paid him a $200,000 base. He gets a 5 percent raise each year. His
apparel contract is worth $125,000. His radio and TV comes to
$275,000. Incentives make it worth more than $700,000 annually. If
he should leave, Tech is paid $1.5 million. If he is fired, O'Leary
is paid the same.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary laughs at the rumors that he is the next coach at Notre
Dame if Bob Davies fails. ``One of the main problems in coaching
today is when a coach gets a job, he starts looking for his next
job,'' he says. ``I signed a contract that would keep me here. I'm
happy with Georgia Tech.''

   Have you seen the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll, the one that

double-digit lead over Gore in the presidential race. But it now
puts Gore ahead of Bush, 47 percent to 46 percent _ although the
one-point difference is well within the poll's 5 percentage-point
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the Democrats' convention and Gore's closing-night
speech had voters all across America leaping from their easy chairs
and exclaiming, ``Holy populism, Batman, this guy Gore is
phantasmagorical!''
</P>
<P>
   Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits are saying that Gore succeeded in changing his
image _ again? _ from that of a boring, ineffectual second banana
laboring in the shadow of Bill Clinton to that of a confident,
combative national leader ready to charge the hill on behalf of
just plain folks.
</P>
<P>
   Others contend that Gore benefited from the sort of boost that
any struggling candidate would get by turning in a
better-than-expected performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-backers are saying that they always expected the race to be
closer than earlier polls suggested and that people should hold
their horses for a week or two before deciding what Gore's
convention did or didn't do to boost his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the question: What do these post-convention poll
numbers mean?
</P>
<P>
   And here's the answer: Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something we do know. Something happened during the
Democratic convention that caused Gore's popularity with female
voters to go through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   According to CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider, in
fact, Gore's dramatic convention bounce was provided almost
entirely by women.
</P>
<P>
   Before the convention, Schneider pointed out, women favored Bush
over Gore. After the convention, women favored Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, as reported by USA Today:
</P>
<P>
   Pre-convention: Bush 51 percent, Gore 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Post-convention: Gore 58 percent, Bush 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Holy gender gap! That's a 31-point turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap, of course, was crucial in the Clinton-Gore
victories of 1992 and 1996. For reasons that some of us still don't
understand, women voted Democratic in those two elections as if
Republicans had threatened to revoke female suffrage.
</P>
<P>
   In most polls before the Democrats met in Los Angeles, though,
Bush had more or less obliterated the gender gap. Women clearly did
not harbor the misgivings about the Texas governor that they did
about his father, President Bush, and '96 Republican nominee Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   So. What ignited Gore's startling surge of popularity among
women?
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom seems to be that the litany of liberal
policy initiatives served up by Gore in his convention speech
convinced women that his agenda is more attuned to their concerns
than the compassionate conservative programs touted by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   OK. But there had to be something else.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know what that something else was: The Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last Thursday, but just about everybody is still
talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today published a front-page story about it. Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist Maureen Dowd wrote about it. CNN's Jeanne
Moos weighed in with a witty TV essay. Jay Leno lampooned it in a
skit.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiss: Gore sprints into the convention hall, throws his arms
around adoring wife Tipper and delivers a three-second (seemed like
30) smooch right on her eager lips.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the camera angle or did Tipper's knees buckle?
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious what happened. Women from coast to coast glanced at
their snoozing hubbies and tried to remember the last time the bum
burst through the door awash in spousal passion. Each and every
wife had the exact same thought about Gore: ``Now that's the kind
of man we need leading America.''
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to a new political phenomenon: The kissing gap.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready to rumble, George and Laura?

&HT;     BRONCOS BACK TEAMMATE ACCUSED OF USING RACIAL SLUR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM ORSBORN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free safety Eric Brown said he and several other black Denver
Broncos teammates had mixed emotions when a published report
indicated that an unidentified white player had accused linebacker
Bill Romanowski of using a racial slur.
</P>
<P>
   At first, ``a lot of us didn't know what to think,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing an emotional Romanowski call the accusation
``an absolute lie,'' Brown said he and his teammates decided to
support the man who has been a squad captain the past three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `We've played with this man, and we know how he
acts and behaves around us,''' Brown said in a telephone interview.
``We have faith in him and trust him when he's on the field, so why
not have faith in him and trust him when he's off the field?''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Sports Illustrated article, an NFL player
allegedly told a grand jury in Colorado that Romanowski said he
took the drug Phentermine to help him compete with black players.
Phentermine is an appetite suppressant that some people have used
as a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski's ``exact words were, `We have to go up against the
black guys,''' the player told the magazine. ``He said, `They're
faster and stronger, and we have to take advantage of (taking
Phentermine). It is the only way we can compete with the black
guys.' He didn't say, `black guys.' He used the `n' word.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year veteran was indicted by a grand jury in Colorado
earlier this month on four felony charges of fraudulently obtaining
massive quantities of a controlled drug. While remaining silent on
the drug charges, Romanowski has denied ever using a slur to
describe black players. His lawyer, Jeff Springer, has threatened
to sue Sports Illustrated, which reported the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Broncos, including running back Terrell Davis,
also have publicly supported Romanowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Bill, then you know he wouldn't say something like
that,'' Davis, who is black, told the Denver Post.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the firestorm has not hurt the team's chemistry or
its camaraderie inside the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' Brown said. ``We sit around and we joke. We are
like one big family.''

<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No major pro sports team has won four consecutive championships
in this decade. Not the Chicago Bulls, not the Dallas Cowboys, not
the New York Yankees, not Major League Soccer's D.C. United. A
four-peat hasn't been accomplished in hockey since 1983, in
basketball since 1966, in baseball since 1954, or in football ever.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is being celebrated today as history's greatest
golfer because he just became the first player in 47 years to win
three major tournaments in a year. But no current male athlete has
won four straight titles in any of these sports.
</P>
<P>
   That honor is about to be earned instead by a team of women: the
Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of the Comets, who upset the Los Angeles Sparks on
Sunday to gain a berth in the Women's National Basketball
Association finals against the New York Liberty, once again
demonstrates that women have to work twice as hard as men for the
same recognition (the finals begin Thursday night in New York). The
Comets have surmounted obstacles none of the decade's male
dynasties faced.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees needed an extra star to win the World Series,
they went out and bought him.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's rigid control of salaries and player allocation makes
this impossible. Not only have the Comets been unable to buy
significant new talent; they've repeatedly lost their best role
players to the league's merciless expansion drafts, which allow
each squad to protect only a few of its top performers. In a league
bent on parity, the Comets have reconstituted and reorganized their
lineup every year. And still the league knows no other champion.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls or Yankees lost a game or two early in the
playoffs, they had another three to six games to pull out the
series. But in the WNBA, there's no room for error. In 1997, the
WNBA championship consisted of a single game. Until this year, the
first round of the playoffs was single-elimination. If the Comets
played one bad game in any of those contests in any of those years,
they were gone.
</P>
<P>
   They never did. Now all WNBA playoffs are two-out-of-three. The
Comets can't afford to lose two straight games. And they don't.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys faced a difficult playoff opponent, they could
rely on home-field advantage. The Comets can't. The WNBA's
upside-down scheduling system gives the team with the worse record
the home court in Game 1, thereby forcing the team with the better
record into a single-elimination situation at home in Games 2 and
3. This system has often put the Comets in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 finals, the Phoenix Mercury beat them narrowly in
Game 1 in Phoenix and had them down 12 points _ a huge lead in WNBA
terms _ in Game 2 at Houston. The Comets had seven minutes to save
their season. They did it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the girls have succeeded where the boys failed. After
winning their second straight Super Bowl in 1994, the Cowboys, like
other male dynasties, dissolved in an orgy of drugs, car crashes,
sexual violence and feuding. They blamed it on the heat of the
spotlight. But pressure and media sniping haven't torn apart the
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Since their inception, the press has hyped and fanned rivalries
among their ``Big Three'' _ Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina
Thompson. But the big three have stayed together and kept their
egos in check.
</P>
<P>
   Without their alpha male, Michael Jordan, the Bulls couldn't get
back to the NBA finals. The Comets, on the other hand, have shared
the ball and the trophy. Cooper led them to their first
championship while Swoopes was pregnant. This year, Cooper has
taken fewer shots and passed more to Swoopes, the league's MVP. In
many big playoff games, Thompson carries the team. Imagine the
Bulls riding Horace Grant to a title.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets live by all the virtues their male counterparts
neglect. They use their heads, help each other, and do what their
coach asks them to do. In their last two playoff series, Thompson
sacrificed her scoring to focus on guarding two of the league's
most unstoppable players: Yolanda Griffith of the Sacramento
Monarchs and Lisa Leslie of the Sparks. Result: four straight
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, unable to blow past younger defenders at age 37,
eviscerated the Sparks Sunday with subtle changes of pace and
direction on drives to the basket. Coquese Washington, a 5-foot-6
reserve guard, grabbed four rebounds in 14 minutes. Tammy Jackson,
a hobbled 37-year-old who was cut by another franchise two years
ago, blocked a crucial shot attempt in the game's final seconds,
and Janeth Arcain, a defensive specialist, sank the winning basket
and free throws. Minutes earlier, Arcain had been flagrantly
whacked in the face by Leslie, and no foul was called.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, fists would have been thrown and players would have
been ejected. Instead, Arcain walked away, stayed on the court, and
sealed the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' greatest triumph, however, may lie in teaching their
sisters virtues more familiar to men. Four years ago, the rest of
the WNBA played like girls. They guarded their opponents
courteously, looked for unchallenged spaces to catch the ball, and
settled for long-range heaves.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shattered that civility. They played aggressive,
relentless defense. Cooper crumpled opponents psychologically with
a Jordanesque will to dominate. Swoopes wore a poker face to
deprive the enemy of emotional feedback. Both of them drove
straight at defenders to force fouls and earn free throws.
Meanwhile, Thompson battled under the boards like Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets achieved what has always defined history's greatest
teams: They changed the way the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of mental toughness, they have put the NBA to shame.
When Jordan took a vacation to play baseball, the Bulls collapsed.
A year ago Saturday, the Comets lost Kim Perrot, their original
point guard and Cooper's best friend, to cancer. A week later, they
walked onto the court and fought their way to another championship.

<P>
   This year, the league thought it had finally put together a
better team. The Sparks, who had lost only four games all season,
were supposed to bring the WNBA title to Los Angeles to join the
Lakers' NBA trophy. But the Lakers never ran into a squad like this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Comets are teaching the world a lesson: Never
send a girl to do a woman's job.

   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No major pro sports team has won four consecutive championships
in this decade. Not the Chicago Bulls, not the Dallas Cowboys, not
the New York Yankees, not Major League Soccer's D.C. United. A
four-peat hasn't been accomplished in hockey since 1983, in
basketball since 1966, in baseball since 1954, or in football ever.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is being celebrated today as history's greatest
golfer because he just became the first player in 47 years to win
three major tournaments in a year. But no current male athlete has
won four straight titles in any of these sports.
</P>
<P>
   That honor is about to be earned instead by a team of women: the
Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of the Comets, who upset the Los Angeles Sparks on
Sunday to gain a berth in the Women's National Basketball
Association finals against the New York Liberty, once again
demonstrates that women have to work twice as hard as men for the
same recognition (the finals begin Thursday night in New York). The
Comets have surmounted obstacles none of the decade's male
dynasties faced.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees needed an extra star to win the World Series,
they went out and bought him.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's rigid control of salaries and player allocation makes
this impossible. Not only have the Comets been unable to buy
significant new talent; they've repeatedly lost their best role
players to the league's merciless expansion drafts, which allow
each squad to protect only a few of its top performers. In a league
bent on parity, the Comets have reconstituted and reorganized their
lineup every year. And still the league knows no other champion.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls or Yankees lost a game or two early in the
playoffs, they had another three to six games to pull out the
series. But in the WNBA, there's no room for error. In 1997, the
WNBA championship consisted of a single game. Until this year, the
first round of the playoffs was single-elimination. If the Comets
played one bad game in any of those contests in any of those years,
they were gone.
</P>
<P>
   They never did. Now all WNBA playoffs are two-out-of-three. The
Comets can't afford to lose two straight games. And they don't.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys faced a difficult playoff opponent, they could
rely on home-field advantage. The Comets can't. The WNBA's
upside-down scheduling system gives the team with the worse record
the home court in Game 1, thereby forcing the team with the better
record into a single-elimination situation at home in Games 2 and
3. This system has often put the Comets in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 finals, the Phoenix Mercury beat them narrowly in
Game 1 in Phoenix and had them down 12 points _ a huge lead in WNBA
terms _ in Game 2 at Houston. The Comets had seven minutes to save
their season. They did it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the girls have succeeded where the boys failed. After
winning their second straight Super Bowl in 1994, the Cowboys, like
other male dynasties, dissolved in an orgy of drugs, car crashes,
sexual violence and feuding. They blamed it on the heat of the
spotlight. But pressure and media sniping haven't torn apart the
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Since their inception, the press has hyped and fanned rivalries
among their ``Big Three'' _ Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina
Thompson. But the big three have stayed together and kept their
egos in check.
</P>
<P>
   Without their alpha male, Michael Jordan, the Bulls couldn't get
back to the NBA finals. The Comets, on the other hand, have shared
the ball and the trophy. Cooper led them to their first
championship while Swoopes was pregnant. This year, Cooper has
taken fewer shots and passed more to Swoopes, the league's MVP. In
many big playoff games, Thompson carries the team. Imagine the
Bulls riding Horace Grant to a title.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets live by all the virtues their male counterparts
neglect. They use their heads, help each other, and do what their
coach asks them to do. In their last two playoff series, Thompson
sacrificed her scoring to focus on guarding two of the league's
most unstoppable players: Yolanda Griffith of the Sacramento
Monarchs and Lisa Leslie of the Sparks. Result: four straight
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, unable to blow past younger defenders at age 37,
eviscerated the Sparks Sunday with subtle changes of pace and
direction on drives to the basket. Coquese Washington, a 5-foot-6
reserve guard, grabbed four rebounds in 14 minutes. Tammy Jackson,
a hobbled 37-year-old who was cut by another franchise two years
ago, blocked a crucial shot attempt in the game's final seconds,
and Janeth Arcain, a defensive specialist, sank the winning basket
and free throws. Minutes earlier, Arcain had been flagrantly
whacked in the face by Leslie, and no foul was called.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, fists would have been thrown and players would have
been ejected. Instead, Arcain walked away, stayed on the court, and
sealed the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' greatest triumph, however, may lie in teaching their
sisters virtues more familiar to men. Four years ago, the rest of
the WNBA played like girls. They guarded their opponents
courteously, looked for unchallenged spaces to catch the ball, and
settled for long-range heaves.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shattered that civility. They played aggressive,
relentless defense. Cooper crumpled opponents psychologically with
a Jordanesque will to dominate. Swoopes wore a poker face to
deprive the enemy of emotional feedback. Both of them drove
straight at defenders to force fouls and earn free throws.
Meanwhile, Thompson battled under the boards like Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets achieved what has always defined history's greatest
teams: They changed the way the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of mental toughness, they have put the NBA to shame.
When Jordan took a vacation to play baseball, the Bulls collapsed.
A year ago Saturday, the Comets lost Kim Perrot, their original
point guard and Cooper's best friend, to cancer. A week later, they

Lakers' NBA trophy. But the Lakers never ran into a squad like this

   VACATION-HOUSE (Valley Center, Calif.) _ If you were to choose a
place to construct a high-concept vacation house, it would probably
not be Valley Center. But here on a Valley Center hilltop sits a
brazenly modern structure with metal-wrapped walls cantilevered
over a luxuriant orange orchard. Mysteriously ambiguous, it could
be an exotic construction trailer _ or a miniature Getty Museum
poised against the sky. By Sydney Leblanc.

   ISOLATED-WOMEN (New York) _ The House of Elder Artists, or Thea,
is a confederacy of kindred souls dedicated to building an
un-retirement home for female writers, artists, community activists
_ and those game enough to grow old among them. Today, communal
living arrangements of various sorts are appealing to a broad group
of single women. From shared housing, where housemates are often
matched by nonprofit or religious groups, to golf resorts in
Florida, housing is beginning to address profound statistical
realities: Between 1970 and 1998, the number of women living alone
across the country doubled, from 7.3 million to 15.3 million,
according to the American Association of Retired Persons. By

WHATABURGER, WHAT A LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month marks the 50th anniversary of Whataburger, and
because the company would like a little publicity about the event,
it might be possible to wrestle from it just what kind of deal
founder Harmon Dobson made for all those orange-and-white striped
A-frame buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And, why did he call the company what he did _ Whataburger?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying all those buildings were ugly, and I know that
the newer ones aren't really A-frames. They just have that A-frame
facade.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a photo of the company's newest ``Whataburger by the
Bay,'' in Corpus Christi, Texas _ where the burger chain originated
_ it is easy to discern that Whataburger has changed its
architectural tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those early sheds must have been a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson opened his first hamburger stand in 1950. He was
originally a bush pilot, and when he opened his hamburger business,
he flew his single-engine Piper Super Cub above Corpus Christi,
towing a bright red banner that had Whataburger printed on it.
</P>
<P>
   He also blew a large air horn that some say sounded like a duck
honking.
</P>
<P>
   When people looked up, he dropped them coupons for his new
business.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson was also a former diamond courier and automobile dealer.
He owned a dealership in Arkansas just before moving to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, 1950, he wrote in his journal: ``Left today for
Texas &AMP; God only knows where.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be a wildcatter, making millions in the Texas
oilfields, but in a matter of months, circumstances had changed his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up in a small, portable stand selling 25-cent
hamburgers across the street from Del Mar College in Corpus
Christi. Four days later, on Aug. 12, he again wrote in his
journal: ``Big Day _ $141.80 _ Christ What a workhouse _ 551
hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year later, Dobson confided in his journal
that he was making a good profit and that the company would
``probably turn out to be my `life work.' I'm beginning to like &AMP;
appreciate the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The business rewarded Dobson. Three years after that first
portable stand, Dobson opened the first Whataburger outside Corpus
Christi. It was in nearby Kingsville. That same year, Joe Andrews
of Alice, also near Corpus, received the first Whataburger
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The company expanded outside Texas in 1959 with a store in
Pensacola, Fla. It was in 1961 that Dobson built the first 3-story
A-frame building with an orange-and-white striped roof.
</P>
<P>
   There is no explanation why he decided on that particular motif,
but the company does say the distinct buildings served as a kind of
billboard for the hamburger stands, and they have been recognized
as pop icons of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 565 locations in eight states and Mexico, with
sales over $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Whataburgers are tastier than McDonald's or Burger King
is strictly a matter of preference, but one thing is certain:
Whataburgers take longer to make.
</P>
<P>
   That's not by accident. Whataburger claims no patty will hit the
heat until it's ordered. As one of the company's billboards
proclaims: ``You could get a faster burger, but then you'd have to
eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mainstay of the menu is still the quarter-pound beef burger
on a 5-inch bun with lettuce, three tomato slices, four dill pickle
slices, chopped onions and mustard.
</P>
<P>
   The Whataburger company has remained in the Dobson family.
Harmon Dobson died in a plane crash in 1967, but the family has
turned his lifelong journal into a 50th-anniversary coffee-table
book tracing the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Dobson's rationale for the company name is shared:
``Dobson's thinking was that in Texas, where people think big, the
Whataburger really needed to be large _ to make people exclaim,
`What a burger.' ''

GET A BREAKFAST BOUNTY IN EL PASO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BEVERLY BUNDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ The sun comes up in this rolling sienna town,
warming 18-wheelers as they leave the cacophony of Juarez to spill
into the Interstate system of America. Heat threatens early; by
evening, dust will be settling onto brows, creating the combination
of grit and sweat that has kept border towns vital for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hot day begins _ as early as 6 a.m. _ petite Mexican
office workers and hulking El Paso city leaders will be tucking
into the same sort of fare. Plates of eggs pumped up with chorizo
or potatoes or shiny beneath a blanket of chile-flecked ranchero
sauce. Usually there are beans on the side, and certainly a
tortilla or three. And a grand cup of coffee, the bitter edges
smoothed with warm milk.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of breakfast, in heft if not in heritage, that our
grandfathers ate before going out to face the north forty. It's the
breakfast we ate until after World War II, when egg consumption
tanked as Americans moved from farms to perfectly planned
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Award-winning author Bill Jamison, who is researching an
American breakfast book, says the Mexican big breakfast is a
relatively recent thing.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast in Mexico used to be two meals: ``Desayuno'' was the
first round, a true ``break fast'' of coffee and a tortilla at
daybreak; ``almuerzo'' came later in the morning and was a little
more substantial.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps in changing their schedules to adapt a little more
to the ``Norte Americanos,'' their strong trade partners and
geographical bunk mates, much of Mexico has rolled the two meals
into one spirited, all-out morning fiesta. The big breakfast also
works into the rhythm of a country where the last meal of the day,
``cena,'' is typically lighter fare. ``Comida,'' the early
afternoon meal, is the day's mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   W. Park Kerr, owner of El Paso Chile Co. and author of cookbooks
including ``Burning Desires,'' says ``the string of cheese hanging
out of a breakfast enchilada is the thread that holds frequently
fragile border communities together. Personally, I think these
wonderful border power-breakfasts at the local joints are the best
eating in El Paso.''
</P>
<P>
   And when faced with the alternative of a bowl of gray oatmeal or
a pallid Hot Pocket, who could argue.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   FOUR PLACES TO START THE DAY IN EL PASO:
</P>
<P>
   H &AMP; H CARWASH, 701 E. Yandell Drive, (915) 533-1144
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Maynard and Kenny Haddad own this carwash-cum-cafe.
(The Haddads are part of the large El Paso Lebanese community that
claims actor F. Murray Abraham as one of its own.)
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush has eaten here, and probably more important, so has
Julia Child. It's vital to grab a stool at the counter, the better
to be seen by the power brokers who breakfast here and to see the
ballet folklorica that goes on behind the counter. The cooks
silently work the grill, swirling behind one another to flip
tortillas or turn the ``papas.''
</P>
<P>
   Tacos are the thing to order, and the best is carne picada, beef
tri-tip that has been seared on the same grill that Northerners
would use for pancakes. Order the taco plate so that you get a
combination of guacamole and refried beans with the warm meat and
the tortilla wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   TACO SANTA CECILIA, 5500 El Paso Drive, (915) 772-3435
</P>
<P>
   There's little English spoken at this chain restaurant turned to
local ownership. Simply know what to order, and you'll get yourself
a little plate of heaven that needs no translation.
</P>
<P>
   Pork tacos are the deal, with meat roasted gyros-style on an
upright spit over mesquite. Ask for the store-made salsa, pico de
gallo loaded with chunks of avocado. The tiny stone-ground
tortillas, probably imported from just across the bridge, are a
touch of authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   LA NORTENA, 212 W. Overland Ave., (915) 533-0533
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more mainstream dining rooms, even taking
into account the glittered mirror and tequila label painted on the
wall. Near downtown, you're likely to see locals sipping Tecate
fairly early in the morning and office workers coming in for
after-work drinks. The food is just as noteworthy as the libations.
</P>
<P>
   La Nortena is known for its ojo al diablo (devil's eye) _
stacked red enchiladas sporting a sour cream garnish. Sort of a
Mexican version of the Turkish evil eye to ward off the day's bad
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   LUCY'S, 1305 N. Mesa St., (915) 534-7421
</P>
<P>
   This divey little place is known for its machaca burritos _
boiled shredded brisket mixed with tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and
eggs, and wrapped in flour tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso's Park Kerr calls these burritos the ultimate food for a
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy three or four and put them on the dashboard to keep warm.
That's what we all do.''

   In the church of economic theory, as in that other church, the
central symbol of the faith is a cross. Only this one is tilted and
looks like an ``x'' not a ``t.''
</P>
<P>
   As any communicant learns early on, the x represents supply and
demand ``curves'' (usually portrayed as straight lines). ``Demand''
slopes down to reflect the fact that people tend to want less of
something as it gets more expensive. ``Supply'' slopes up because
... because, well, we'll get to that.
</P>
<P>
   But where the two lines cross is the blessed point of
``equilibrium,'' where the price is exactly what is needed for
supply to equal demand. At that point markets clear, utility is
maximized, lions are beaten into plowshares, bread walks on wine,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   It only takes a few more curves and diagrams to show how free
markets inexorably lead you to that point.
</P>
<P>
   Having been inducted into the faith in college, I'm a fairly
devout believer in the basic doctrines. But I have always been
troubled by doubts on one item: In my innermost heart, I wonder if
the supply curve really slopes upward. (There, I've said it.) These
doubts affect many other members of the church. Most suffer in
silence, while some join schismatic sects such as the notorious
Galbraithian heresy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is reconciling the upward-sloping supply curve with
another key doctrinal concept known as ``marginal cost.'' Marginal
cost is the cost of producing one more unit. Doctrine holds that in
a free market, competition will make price equal to marginal cost,
because anyone attempting to charge more will get undercut by a
rival, and anyone who charges less will lose money. Each producer
increases production until the cost of producing the next unit
starts to exceed the price she can get.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, rising marginal costs determine the supply curve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I yearn for market-clearing equilibrium as much as the next
fellow. But the whole doctrinal contraption involves two difficult
assumptions. First, marginal costs have to be increasing (to avoid
the embarrassment of supply and demand curves that never cross).
Second, at the point where supply and demand do cross, marginal
costs have to be above average costs.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the price you get for every widget you produce is
determined by the extra cost of producing one more widget, that
price has got to be high enough to cover all your costs.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I dragging you down these dank doctrinal corridors?
Because the news these days is full of controversies where the
basic problem is that marginal costs do not rise. They start out
below average cost and stay that way. This is why airlines, for
example, charge $105 or $501 for the same seat on the same route.
The marginal cost of filling an empty seat on a plane that's going
anyway is almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   To be precise, it's 53.7 cents, which is the cost of shredding
used boarding passes and molding them into ``vegetarian lasagna.''
</P>
<P>
   So $105 covers your marginal cost on the last seat, but you need
$501 from some people to cover your average cost.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug prices are another hot example. The cost of
producing the billionth pill is nothing compared with the cost of
developing the first one. Some people must pay a lot more than
marginal cost or new drugs will never be developed. At the same
time, any particular sale even slightly above marginal cost is
profitable _ and, in fact, reduces the price for everybody by
absorbing some of the development costs. So it's irritating but not
necessarily bad for the United States that the same drugs sell for
less in Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last May, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
identified low marginal costs as a central feature of the ``New
Economy.'' Developing a computer program is expensive; putting it
on a disc is cheap. In their purest form, information and knowledge
_ the basic products of the new economy _ cost nothing at all to
reproduce and distribute, and never get used up.
</P>
<P>
   You can give information to me and still have just as much of it
yourself. In fact, because of the so-called ``network effect'' _
the more people who use a software program, the more valuable it is
to each user _ some products of the new economy may even have
negative marginal costs.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, the basic tenets of economic theory can no
longer tell you what prices will be or what they should be. Nor can
church doctrine guarantee that an invisible hand will produce the
most efficient result. Summers noted that if marginal costs are
below average costs, competition that drives prices down to
marginal cost is ruinous.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the only way a firm can make money is to have some
degree of monopoly power. Critics of antitrust have seized on
Summers' analysis, generally failing to note that it undermines the
case for free markets at least as much as the case for government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   And now that it's fashionable to admit that marginal costs don't
always go up, maybe it's permissible to ask aloud how often they
ever do. Even an Old Economy business like the auto industry spends
billions of dollars designing and preparing to produce a new model.
Can the marginal cost of producing one more car, leaving aside
these startup costs, actually be more than the average cost of all
cars of this model, startup costs included? If not, what is left of
the one true faith? And yet somehow it's hard to believe.

&HT;     AMERICAN RUNNER READY FOR SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even after winning the 1,500 and 5,000 meters at
last month's Olympic Track and Field Trials, Regina Jacobs knew she
would not be running both events in the Sydney Olympics. The
question was which one she would pick.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, of Oakland, Calif., provided an answer Tuesday. The
four-time Olympian and Stanford University graduate opted for the
1,500 over the longer race, even though she is the American
record-holder at 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot more experience there,'' said Tom Craig, Jacobs'
husband and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Jacobs, who has asthma, is recovering from a
respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be fine,'' he said. ``She's in great shape. The upshot
is it probably helps with peaking. It slowed her down and will
allow her to peak at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jacobs arrives in Sydney next month, she will have
competition not only from international rivals like Svetlana
Masterkova of Russia, Violeta Szekely of Romania, Kutre Dulecha of
Ethiopia and Carla Sacramento of Portugal, but fellow American Suzy
Favor Hamilton as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be six people going for three medals,'' Craig
said. ``All six of them can medal. Whoever stays calm and under
control will medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jacobs easily defeated Hamilton at the Olympic trials,
4:01.01 to 4:01.81, Hamilton ran a lifetime-best 3:57.40 July 28 in
Oslo. Jacobs has never broken four minutes for the metric mile; her
best is 4:00.35.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, 36, has said her one remaining goal in the sport is to
earn an Olympic medal. Although she has a pair of silver medals
from the World Championships, in 1997 and 1999, her best Olympic
finish was 10th in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' decision to run the 1,500 affects U.S. team membership
in the 5,000. Because neither Jacobs nor Olympic trials
second-place finisher Deena Drossin will run that race in Sydney,
the 3-4-5 runners will make the team instead. They are Elva Dryer,
Amy Rudolph and Anne Marie Lauck.

<P>
   As a follow-up to a recent column about elementary Chinese
dishes, here are two simple but standard offerings that were
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I'm including a peach pie recipe that was not requested
but was sent in by Vera Carter, who writes: ``I think everyone in
Jackson, Miss., and Ruston, La., already has this recipe. I got it
from my sister-in-law in Jackson, so please share it'' with

pork, ginger, salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon
sesame oil. Pulse until well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   Lay out won-ton skins. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon filling on
center of each won-ton skin. Brush edges lightly with beaten egg
wash and fold corners over to form a triangle, enclosing filling.
Press to seal well. Dab egg wash on one corner and stick to
opposite corner to form a little hat-shaped won ton. Continue until
all won tons are made. Place on floured cookie sheet and cover with
a clean kitchen towel.
</P>
<P>
   In large saucepan, bring stock to simmer. Season with soy sauce
and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
</P>

   In large pot, bring 10 cups of water to boil. Add won tons and
cook until they rise to surface, 2 to 3 minutes. With slotted
spoon, transfer won tons to simmering soup.
</P>
<P>
   Add remaining 2 teaspoons sesame oil and minced scallion to soup
just before serving. Spoon 4 won tons into each of 6 individual

   With the last days of vacation sadly trickling away, many teens
and 'tweens will find themselves drawn to MTV this weekend for a
few end-of-summer goodies.
</P>
<P>
   A no-brainer, in several senses of the word, will be ``TRL End
of Summer Countdown,'' on MTV Saturday at 8:00 p.m. ``Total Request
Live,'' as only old fogies call it, has become the ``American
Bandstand'' for the pierced-navel crowd or, more correctly, for
their Britney-and-Justin-loving younger siblings. Tonight's
four-hour marathon will bring back all their summer video faves.
Squeal! Expect Eminem as well as 'N Sync. Carson Daly hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Far smarter _ highly entertaining for grownups, too, _ is
``Daria: Is It Fall Yet?'' The 90-minute animated film airing
Sunday at 7 on MTV explains what the mordantly witty Daria and her
best pal, Jane, were up to over the summer. There's actually a rift
between the two pals _ over a boy nonetheless. So while teen-age
social critic Daria is trying to cope with the idea of actually
dating, Jane is off to art camp, where she gets hit on by a female
camper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Daria's fashion victim little sister finds out that
education is not such a bad thing after all, and her creepy school
counselor opens the ``It's OK to Cry'' self-esteem day camp.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Daria'' series isn't as great as ``The Simpsons'' or as
acute as ``King of the Hill,'' but it's probably third in TV's
animation hierarchy. It loves nonconformists, loathes peer pressure
and cant. It's witty and human. And this movie is an excellent
choice for parents and teens to watch together _ or separately, if
necessary _ before school begins again.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, parents, if you're not familiar with the ``Daria''
series, rerun episodes air 5:30-7 p.m. on Saturday and from 5-7
p.m. Sunday.
</P>

   (Anne Applebaum writes a column for the London Sunday
Telegraph.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Objectively speaking, you wouldn't think a small mishap like a
sunken submarine could possibly hurt Vladimir Putin. After all, the
man has greater problems: an unwinnable guerrilla war in Chechnya,
bombs going off in central Moscow, a dysfunctional economy that is
staying afloat only thanks to high oil prices, a recalcitrant
bureaucracy, a declining population.
</P>
<P>
   By some reckonings, the Kursk tragedy isn't even the most
serious problem afflicting his navy: After all, it represents only
one dysfunctional submarine, and some 180 others have been taken
out of service in the past decade. Many of those remaining are
virtually deserted, some reportedly without security, their nuclear
reactors intact.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it almost seems as if the Kursk disaster was specifically
designed to hit President Putin precisely where he is most
vulnerable. This isn't just a matter of timing _ post-Moscow bomb,
Putin on holiday, Chechen war faltering _ or the Kremlin's slow
reaction to events, as many have stressed.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter is that since Putin was first named
prime minister and heir apparent to President Boris Yeltsin a year
ago, he has _ while talking about economic reform and other sundry
things of appeal to the West _ won acclaim in Russia primarily
thanks to his frequently stated desire to rebuild both Russia's
international military prestige and its imperial image.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Putin's popularity began to rise last year with
the re-invasion of Chechnya and continued, when he was still only
acting president, with some loose talk about multiple nuclear
warheads and an announcement that Russia would reverse its vow
never to use nuclear weapons first.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Boris Yeltsin, then still president,
stomped out of an OSCE summit in Turkey, banging a figurative shoe
on the table, refusing to listen to criticism of the Chechen war,
showing the West _ and the Russians _ that he was no longer a
capitalist lap dog.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, both Yeltsin and Putin slowly stepped up pressure on
people who made the military uncomfortable, and not just, as has
been well documented, on journalists who reported unfavorably on
the second Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly notable, in the light of this week's events, was
the jailing and prosecution of the Russian journalist Aleksander
Nikitin, who dared to publish, in cooperation with the Norwegian
environmental group Bellona, a report describing in great detail
the polluting potential of Russia's northern fleet, including its
nuclear submarines. Although Nikitin was acquitted, new hearings
are scheduled in the Russian Supreme Court in September.
</P>
<P>
   Since being elected to office, Putin's image hasn't changed: On
the contrary, he has had himself photographed flying military
planes and inspecting military installations, all to the sound of
public applause. Even as the Chechen war has faltered, he has
relied heavily on the support of the ``power ministries,'' the
military and the security services, to help him win bureaucratic
and military battles in Moscow, so far with success. Nor has Putin
withdrawn from his promise to make Russia into a military power
once again.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that Russia has fallen behind the West in
military capability, a group of Putin's top advisers recently
published a report _ ``A Strategy for Russia'' _ in which they
argued, among other things, that Russia should remain a superpower,
comparable if not equal to the United States, and thereby maintain
its international political position and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing their analysis, Putin has declared that his goal is for
Russia to rebuild its conventional forces and to expand Russia's
reach: There has been talk, for example, of sending the Russian
navy back to the Mediterranean, a part of the world it has not been
seen in for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, in the light of the disaster of the sunken Kursk,
all of that looks far more theoretical than it did even a week ago.
As Norwegian and British ships raced to the rescue, the
remilitarization strategy began to look not merely hollow, but
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good example of problems sparked when you're trying to
pretend to be a great power,'' Larry Korb, a former U.S. assistant
defense secretary, told Reuters, somewhat condescendingly, this
week. ``If you send a new but poorly maintained car on the road and
you don't teach your son or daughter to drive it, you're going to
have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers wrote much the same: ``The tragedy of the
Kursk proved that it is not just evil but criminal to build up
unfounded illusions about Russia's defense ability,'' editorialized
Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in this affair, it had occurred to me that the correct
analogy for the Kursk accident might be the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle: a similar lesson in the dangers of
hubris, a warning about the limits of technology, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the events unfold over the last week, however, I see
that that analogy was wrong: No American politician ever staked his
prestige on the success of space technology in the way that Putin
has staked his claims to legitimacy and to popularity on the
success of the Russian armed forces. The Kursk contains far more
potential for destroying not only Putin but also the broader
program of the military and the security services which he
represents.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, like Britain earlier this century, is in fact at a
turning point in its post-imperial evolution. It can go on
``pretending to be a great power,'' competing with the United
States in rhetoric and bombast with only a tiny percentage of the
funding _ $5 billion vs. $300 billion annually) _ sending ships to
the Mediterranean and conducting elaborate military exercises like
the one the Kursk was engaged upon, or it can recognize that its
imperial days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Putin can salvage something from this crisis, so to speak, only
if he is intelligent enough to use it as an excuse to retrench, to
focus on Russia's ailing economy, to promote real reform rather
than the ersatz capitalism of recent years, to start thinking about
the plight of ordinary Russians rather than the fate of ``Mother
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Putin could cut Russia's military expenditure and
military ambitions. Russia's annual budget expenditure, after all,
is a quarter the size of Holland's. Although it would take a brave
leader to reduce Russia's armed forces to Dutch levels, to do so
may be Russia's last chance at retaining Holland's international
influence.
</P>
<P>
   If he refuses _ if Russia continues to aspire to a superpower
status it cannot afford _ expect more disasters, more silence and
stonewalling, and more tragedies like that of the Kursk.

A DIRECTOR PLUMBS AN AREA OF NO HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 27)  
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Bertrand Tavernier's latest film did not begin with the
``big idea'' of denouncing poverty and unemployment hidden behind
France's stolidly bourgeois facade. Rather, its genesis was an
anecdote heard one evening over dinner with his 33-year-old
daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, Dominique Sampiero, a poet who
had spent 15 years teaching in public schools in run-down
communities in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominique told the story of a woman who couldn't afford the
monthly contribution to her children's school because she needed
the 30 francs'' _ $4.50 _ ``for food,'' Tavernier, 59, recalled.
``I was taken aback. I said I hadn't heard that in any French
movie. The year 2000 was approaching and I felt people needed to
know that this was happening in France today, that things like that
were happening just one hour from Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   From this conversation, then, was born ``It All Starts Today''
(``Ca Commence Aujourd'hui''), Tavernier's 19th feature film, which
opens Sept. 8. The movie, which the director wrote with Sampiero
and Tavernier, revolves around the young head of a kindergarten in
a depressed suburb of the northern city of Valenciennes. It is
through this intense and idealistic man, Daniel Lefebvre, played by
the rising stage and screen actor Philippe Torreton, that Tavernier
makes his political point.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the movie does little more than portray a few months
in the life of an ``ecole maternelle'' whose very young pupils _
between the ages of 2 and 5 _ come from poor families. The school,
however, cannot isolate itself from a social environment scarred by
unemployment, alcoholism, malnutrition and child abuse. As Daniel
finds himself drawn into the problems of the children and their
parents, he grows increasingly frustrated by the inadequate
response of welfare workers, school inspectors and the local mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, the movie has strong echoes of a
documentary, not only because it was shot in a kindergarten in
Anzin, outside Valenciennes, with an existing class cast as
Daniel's pupils, but also because improvisation is unavoidable when
filming tiny children. Even more important, Anzin's story is
identical to that of the film's fictional community. Having once
stood at the heart of both France's coal industry and heroic
battles by miners for better conditions (Emile Zola's epic novel
``Germinal,'' which Claude Berri made into a movie in 1993, was set
there), Anzin has sunk into a depression over the past 30 years.
Local residents who play small parts or act as extras in the film
know first hand what this has meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always misery, but there was hope because there was
work,'' Tavernier explained in the office of his production
company, Little Bear. ``The jobs were badly paid, but there were
union struggles, strikes that lasted for months, that gave hope. In
the darkness, there was always light at the end of the tunnel. But
now, in this region, people have no hope. The mines have closed,
there are no jobs, there are no unions, people feel abandoned.
There's a deep sense of demoralization. That's what I felt there.
People have grown used to having no importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tavernier is not alone in finding inspiration in the rawness of
life in France's post-industrial north: among other recent films,
Erick Zonka set ``The Dream Life of Angels'' and Bruno Dumont ``La
Vie de Jesus'' in that territory. There is also the interesting
parallel with England, where social blight in the north provided
the backdrop for such movies as Mark Hermann's ``Brassed Off'' and
Peter Cattaneo's ``Full Monty.'' Yet just as ``up north'' is a
remote land for many Londoners, few Parisians know northern France.
Even Tavernier, whose recent films include ``De l'Autre Cote du
Periph'' (``The Other Side of the Tracks''), a documentary about
drug problems in a poor Paris suburb, only discovered this world
through his encounter with the ``ecole maternelle'' in Anzin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can now analyze things politically, but it didn't start out
like that,'' he said. ``I knew nothing about life in a
kindergarten, but then I saw that it spoke deeply about the
country. Slowly, in talking to the children, I understood that we
were talking about the state of one entire region of France. Later,
after a screening, someone told me: `The kindergarten is the birth
of a nation.' I thought that was magnificent. All the problems at
birth, if not dealt with, become dramatic. And that was the drama
of the kindergarten. It lacked the resources to deal with all the
problems it confronted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in his film, Tavernier leaves viewers to draw their own
conclusions. He is more interested in the personalities involved in
the kindergarten's life. Among them are Daniel's girlfriend,
Valeria (Maria Pitaressi), an artist who earns her keep working as
a waitress; a sympathetic social worker, Samia (Nadia Kaci); the
school inspector (Didier Bezace); the mayor (Gerard Giroudon); and
several of the school's teachers, including the experienced Madame
Delacourt (Francoise Bette). A half-dozen children also feature in
the incidents that run through the film, including that of the
mother who needs her last 30 francs to feed her family.
</P>
<P>
   By good fortune, Torreton, who also starred in Tavernier's
``L627,'' ``Fresh Bait'' and ``Capitaine Conan,'' proved to be a
natural kindergarten teacher, leading the children in songs and
games, reacting instinctively to their interruptions and moods,
hugging and teasing them with the ease and experience of a man,
well, whose mother was a kindergarten teacher and who has children
of his own, aged 3 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eager to meet the kids without any special preparation,
because that's the fate of thousands of young teachers at the start
of every school year,'' said Torreton, who is 35. ``I placed myself
in the skin of a young teacher called Philippe Torreton, who was
assigned to a kindergarten in Anzin. I had prepared classes and
activities like any teacher, but I saw no point in going to other
schools. I just told the children: `Look, I'm an actor playing a
teacher called Daniel. It's easy for you because you have to
remember only one name. I have to remember 33.' Within two days, I
was Daniel.''
</P>
<P>
   Being an actor also prepared him to perform in front of a class.
But being a teacher, he said, was more challenging.

   ``A teacher is never forgiven,'' he said with a laugh. ``As
actors, we perform in front of people who have bought tickets and,
even if they're bored, they're unlikely to make a fuss because they
have paid good money. But for a teacher facing pupils who don't
want to be there and are thinking only of recreation, the smallest
mistake, the tiniest slip of attention, is punished. It's a
terrible exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the children are frequently on screen, as passive
observers of the dramas surrounding them, they are not the real
stars of the movie. ``It All Starts Today'' is an undisguised
homage to France's teachers, with Daniel and his colleagues cast as
Don Quixotes whose valiant combat the French should support and
admire. Not everyone did, however.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   When the film was released in France 18 months ago, not a few
critics said Tavernier had opted for melodrama and sentimentality.
The left-of-center Paris daily Liberation complained that he had
portrayed Daniel as a saint _ to which the director responded
testily that there were 5,000 saints like Daniel in French schools.
Le Monde's critic Jacques Mandelbaum asked whether a kindergarten
director could be a hero of classical cinema _ to which Tavernier
retorted that Michele Niewrzeda, the real director of the ``Behind
the Hedge'' kindergarten at Anzin, was even more heroic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were journalists who said it was all exaggerated,''
Tavernier went on. ``But for the people in the north, it was all
very real. I received 2,000 letters from people saying, `This is my
life, it's like that, thank you for giving me courage.' It's not a
film without hope. It's an energetic film that encourages people
not to be passive. Even a psychiatrist told me that he uses the
film to treat teachers suffering from depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Tavernier was above all reassured _ and surprised _ by the
public response. By his own admission, he had worried whether there
was a market for a film that could even distantly be considered
political. He noted that political films made by foreign directors
did well in France (the British director Ken Loach is a case in
point), but that the same fare by French directors usually flopped.
With ``It All Starts Today,'' which cost $3.5 million to make, the
film was set to break even if it sold 450,000 tickets. In practice,
it sold twice as many in France and another 450,000 in Spain alone
(``Even the King of Spain asked to see it,'' Tavernier exclaimed).
</P>
<P>
   In Torreton's view, what saved the film was that Tavernier did
not set off with a political mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works a lot through curiosity and the joy and anger
provoked by his curiosity,'' Torreton said. ``He is above all
someone with an appetite to see, to understand, to listen, to
become involved. But when he makes a film, he has a sense of
spectacle, no matter the subject, whether social drama or total
romance. Too many filmmakers in France think that to offer some
spectacle is to be commercial. Cinema is commerce. It's a
commercial art.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tavernier, however, more than the response of critics and
audiences, there is something that convinced him that he got things
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have renamed the school in Anzin after me,'' he said,
beaming with pride. ``It is now the Ecole Maternelle Bertrand
Tavernier.''

CHINA JAILS INTERNET CAFE OWNER FOR POSTING POLITICAL ARTICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The owner of an Internet cafe in southern China has
been arrested and charged with subversion for posting articles
critical of the Communist Party, the latest sign of the
government's campaign to tame the explosion of electronic
information.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang Shihua, a high school teacher who operated the cafe in the
city of Nontong in Sichuan Province, is the third person in recent
months known to face serious charges for political statements on
the Internet. His arrest on Aug. 16, five days after he began
posting the articles under a pseudonym, was reported this week by
the Free China Movement in Washington, based on accounts by Chinese
television and Reporters Without Borders, a media watchdog group in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have embraced the Internet as a key to
development but also fear it, and special ``Web police'' units have
been formed to search for illegal activities like fraud and
pornography as well as outlawed political debate.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Huang Qi, who ran a Web site from Sichuan that
published statements on the student democracy movement that was
crushed in 1989 and other rights issues, was charged with
subversion in June.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Qi Yanchen, of Hebei Province, has been charged
with the same crime for posting anti-government messages, according
to rights groups. None of the three arrested men has been tried,
but convictions in such cases are nearly certain and can bring long
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the authorities shut down New Culture Forum,
a Web site in Shandong Province that sponsored debate on the need
for democracy.

 &HT;    RELATIVES OF KURSK CREW GREET RUSSIA'S PUTIN WITH 'BOOS' ON DAY
OF MOURNING
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ Russians lowered flags to half-mast and lit
candles in special church ceremonies during a national day of
mourning Wednesday for the 118 crewmembers of the sunken submarine
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the outpouring of grief rang shouts of anger by family
members who met with President Vladimir Putin for the first time
since the Aug. 12 tragedy plunged the Oscar-II Class nuclear sub
354 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was expected to attend memorial ceremonies at the
Severomorsk naval base and in Murmansk, where the Northern Fleet is
based, but he abruptly cut short his visit after a stormy meeting
with some 600 relatives of the submariners that lasted until early
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Met with shouts and some boos, Putin tried to calm those who had
traveled hundreds of miles in the hope of reclaiming the bodies of
their loved ones and finding answers to the question of what
exactly caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grief is immeasurable, there are not enough words of
comfort. My heart hurts, but yours hurt even more,'' said Putin,
looking serious in an all-black suit.
</P>
<P>
   But families would not be consoled, according to people who
attended the meeting held in officer's barracks. Instead, they
criticized the president for the lack of information they received
during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will we get them back, dead or alive? Answer as the
president,'' shouted a woman, referring to the bodies of the
sailors, in comments taped by state-owned RTR television, the only
press agency allowed to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll answer you when I know myself,'' the president replied.
</P>
<P>
   The mood soured further when the family members requested that
the Navy cancel memorial ceremonies Putin was supposed to
officiate, saying they would not mourn until they had corpses to
bury.
</P>
<P>
   In a further blow to the family members, officials in charge of
salvaging the bodies and the 20,000-ton sub announced Wednesday
that it would take close to one year to raise the Kursk, due to
adverse weather conditions common to this region in the Arctic
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has not yet been made about whether to retrieve the
bodies separately in a quicker operation that would involve
drilling holes into the sub, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident can not be confirmed until the
wreckage is brought to the surface and examined more closely, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officers have said the most likely cause of the
disaster was that an initial explosion, either from inside the
vessel or from a collision wrecked the front of the sub, sending it
straight down to the seabed. This impact then led to a detonation
of the Kursk's torpedoes. The crew, Russian officials say, died
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
contradicted this official explanation. They said the more likely
cause of the initial explosion was a misfire during top-secret
military exercises held in the area on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Naval sources based in Murmansk said the Russian military was
test-firing an experimental torpedo on the day the Kursk went
missing. Only a misfire of this weapon or another incoming weapon
could puncture the hull of the Kursk, one of the newest and most
modern nuclear submarines in Russia's fleet, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Possible causes of the accident have become the main themes of
television news talk shows and editorial columns across Russia's 11
time zones.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the day of mourning, however, Putin asked television
stations to refrain from running entertainment shows. Most TV
stations canceled usual entertainment and news shows and called for
moments of silence _ but regular programming continued during the
morning, including soap operas. Some stations honored the dead by
showing the names and photographs of the crewmembers.
</P>
<P>
   This silence on television was not matched in the streets of
Murmansk, a town some 1,000 miles north of Moscow where nearly 50
percent of the jobs are associated with the nearby base.
</P>
<P>
   Here, people assailed Putin for taking so long after the
accident to show concern for the crew. But most of all, they
criticized the government for initially resisting international
help, a decision they feel could have saved some lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership doesn't care about individual lives. It lied to
us about our boys. What good do their tears do us now?'' asked
misty-eyed 63-year-old Anna Kudrovna, who was laying flowers at the
town's WWII memorial Wednesday in honor of the Kursk crew.
</P>
<P>
   The government, at Putin's behest, has promised to look after
the relatives. And Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko told
reporters in Moscow Wednesday that families would get average
compensation worth US$7,000, an amount that equals more than 10
years' salary for a mid-level officer.

   With continuing financial problems, rumors are hot that World
Championship
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is ready to make some cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Oct. 23, WCW will tape Thunder on the same night and
location as Monday Nitro live in an attempt to cut production
costs. WCW also hopes it will increase attendance since Nitro shows
have struggled to fill 5,000-6,000 seats recently.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates have the WCW losing nearly $80 million and past
leadership has talked about, but failed, to cut the
long-in-the-tooth wrestling talent.
</P>
<P>
   And Thunder shows have had crowds that can't meet the expenses
of the production crew, not to mention the cost of the wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Siegel, the Turner executive who oversees WCW, is expected
to drop big-money, low-return wrestlers such as Lex Luger, Diamond
Dallas Page, Buff Bagwell and Kaynon.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is to drop $10 million to $15 million in salary before
parent company Time Warner's merger with America Online is
finalized in January, with a lot of cuts after WCW's fiscal year
ends Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In the ring one of the big changes for WCW is the return of
Goldberg as a face. He did not go over with the fans as a heel and
after months of complaining
</P>
<P>
   he has returned to his face role. Kevin Nash is stepping into a
top heel role.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF's push to register voters has resulted in 20,000 new
voters, according to wwf.com. Fans can sign up at house shows or at
WWFvote.com.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of interesting items from the wwf.com Jim Ross Report:
``Stone Cold Steve Austin update: Steve is about 60 days away from
return. Austin weighs about 253 pounds and is looking to return at
around 245-247. The Rattlesnake and Debra plan on getting married
later this month also.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross also had news on The Big Show, who will be out for a few
weeks with a herniated disk in his back.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns he will be assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling
(OVW) in Louisville, Ky., to lose some weight.

&HT;     RAIDERS NEED TO PLAY RISON AND PLAY HIM HARD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Among the underpublicized reasons Richard Nixon
was driven from office with pitchforks were his periodic attempts
to phone in plays to then-Washington Redskins coach George Allen.
Unlike visiting China or helping cover up a burglary, that sort of
thing is best left to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this seems like the perfect time to drop a
quick one in Jon Gruden's in-basket at the Oakland Raiders Galactic
Headquarters. What with the last riveting practice game coming
Thursday night against the Seattle Fighting Kitnas, it is time to
give one, free of charge, to those stubborn Raiders fans who come
out to the Coliseum for the meaningless August game as well as the
meaningless December game, hoping to make the present seem like the
past.
</P>
<P>
   And here it is: first play, Andre Rison, for as far as Rich
Gannon can make him run.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind establishing the run. Never mind taking what the
defense gives you. Never mind giving the boys on the bubble maximum
opportunity to show their wares.
</P>
<P>
   Rison, deep as you can send him, and as often as you can think
of it.
</P>
<P>
   The fans deserve this because, well, because they deserve to
know right off what Andre Rison the Raiders actually signed.
They've had to sweat through Sebastian Janikowski's funky first few
months of Raider-hood, and when they clamored for a 69-yard
what-the-hell field-goal attempt last Friday against Detroit,
Gruden opted to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   And now they are being handed Rison, who may still have some
Techron in the old tank, or may be just a flatliner waiting for
someone to turn off the defibrillator. Fact is, we don't know what
Rison the Raiders just signed.
</P>
<P>
   And no, his occasional off-field crankiness doesn't count. For
one, nobody really cares as long as he can catch the ball (again,
see Janikowski), and if he can't catch the ball, nobody will care
if he sees Mother Teresa impersonating Paul Tagliabue in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those matters the NFL does best _ football, pure,
simple and utterly egalitarian. You play, you stay. You fail, you
bail. It can't be any more basic than that.
</P>
<P>
   And since the Raiders plainly need a second wide receiver, there
seems no better way to find out if they just acquired the answer
than to air him out immediately. Rison doesn't have to know the
whole playbook yet, just the routes that will give Oakland the
confidence that comes with having a receiving corps that ranks only
slightly higher than Cleveland's.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, using him until he becomes just a waft of blue sulfurous
smoke makes football sense. Gruden and Gannon need to know in a few
days how much to trust his skill and will.
</P>
<P>
   But that's their problem. Rison also needs the work to give the
fans a fresh reason to believe that the draft gambles of Janikowski
and punter Shane Lechler made sense that it will take only one wide
receiver who couldn't get along with the slightly oleaginous Kansas
City general manager Carl Peterson to take the Raiders out of the
``In Other Games'' category once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it, those fans have been extraordinarily strong,
if a bit too painted-up for some tastes. The 32,000 and change who
were counted for the practice home opener against Detroit didn't
just happen upon the ballyard. They meant to be there, had to be
there. There's no gentle reasoning with them. Their world has two
colors, and one opinion. They are, in some ways, like the Borg of
Star Trek lore, and not just some of the fellows near the player
tunnel dress that way.
</P>
<P>
   These are the gents and ladies who deserve to know as soon as
possible if Andre Rison is again the real deal, and what the
Raiders intend to do if he isn't. They have endured plenty since
the team blundered its way back north, and they need to know if
they need to order more duct tape for their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   So they need to see Rison straight from the chute Thursday
night. They need to see him run those fade patterns that made him a
name, and the hands that made him a name worth remembering. What's
more, they've earned it. I mean, if they're not going to get a
rebate for playoff games not played, they may as well get a sneak
preview of the next model down the line.

   In my continuing quest for noteworthy food of the open highway,

   If the Uranium weren't so organically cool, one would swear it
was a figment of the ``Twilight Zone.'' Opened in 1956 as a
Chinese-American restaurant, the Uranium has morphed with U.S.
dining habits. In the past 50 years, the building has also housed
an Italian and a Mexican restaurant. The tail end of a 1955
Chevrolet still butts out from one wall _ a vestige of theme
restaurants when it held a salad bar in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the restaurant is owned by Johnie Calahan. He's the cook
and son Jeremiah is the server. And while Christian radio sings its
praises, the pair serve up a righteous breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The specialty here is the ``quiki,'' a stir-fry of scrambled
eggs beaded with hominy and other mix-ins. A heaping plate is borne
from the kitchen neatly divided into the quiki (in this case heated
up with chorizo) and a mountain of fried potatoes. In the middle is
a dam of spongy biscuits swamped with cream gravy. Then, because
this is New Mexico, a bowl of mud-colored salsa, flecked with
slivers of roasted chile, comes to rest beside the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The loco hominy quiki and all the fixings is $4.75 _ less than
you'll pay down the road for 3 gallons of gas to get you back on
the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a miner's appetite, you might try the Uranium
omelet _ it's six, count 'em, six eggs with an assortment of meats,
vegetables, cheese and filling for $7.25. If you stop for lunch,
you can get a bowl of chili _ in this case green chili _ with
biscuits or crackers for $2.75. And if you can't wait to get to
Vegas, the Uranium will pack it up for you for a fee. ``A Ten Cent
Charge will Be Added to All to Go Orders Per Item Except Drinks.''
If you're heading to Las Vegas, you better watch those dimes.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Years ago, with a boyfriend in a pickup, I crossed over the
Hoover Dam late at night, with Charlie Daniels playing ``The Devil
Went Down to Georgia'' on the radio. It was one of those
mind-scorching moments of youth.
</P>
<P>
   The lights of this monumental dam, carved out of the rock by men
during a mean time, play on black water that makes toast possible
for much of the Western United States. Never had I felt so small.
</P>
<P>
   And then, right after the dam, are the lights of Las Vegas _
which manages, with its in-your-face silliness, to make us all seem
large. We know the New York facade is bogus, that the canal on the
upper level of the Venetian is tacky, that Siegfried &AMP; Roy make
Michael Jackson seem normal.
</P>
<P>
   But after a $100 glass of wine at one blackjack table, it's time
to feel small once again. To reclaim my equilibrium, I wanted to
get away from the Strip, away from big-small, win-lose, 21 or 16.
And so I arrived, 15 minutes before closing time, at an Asian
enclave just far enough from the Strip to muffle the din of the
slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   LOTUS OF SIAM, 953 E. Sahara Ave., Suite A5, (702) 735-3033
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Saipin Chutima have long been a favorite of foodies in
Los Angeles, where they owned a Thai restaurant specializing in
Isaan fare, the food of northeast Thailand. But now the couple has
picked up roots and moved to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gold broke the news in the August issue of ``Gourmet,''
calling Lotus of Siam ``The Single Best Thai Restaurant in North
America.'' ``Gourmet'' must not have heavy penetration in Las
Vegas, because only one other couple was there when I snuck in
under the ``Closed'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the tired steam tables in the middle of the room and
a menu promoting Menu No. 1 $8.95: Won-ton soup, egg roll, fried
won ton, barbecued chicken and steamed rice or sticky rice and,
further up the food chain, Dinner No. 3 $9.95: Tom yum kai (spicy
and sour chicken soup), egg roll, fried won ton sweet and sour
chicken and steamed rice, this was just what my body needed.
</P>
<P>
   This restaurant could be in a strip center anywhere, and perhaps
that's the charm. The obligatory posters and the silly silk flowers
are real after the manufactured glitz of the strip. And the food is
just as honest.
</P>
<P>
   I overordered because I was keeping the couple late, and, too, I
felt better giving them my money than donating it to a house bank.
</P>
<P>
   Larb, the ground-meat version of Thai salad so perfect for hot
summer nights, is wonderful here. Ground cooked chicken is tossed
with chopped onion, green chiles and lime juice and served with
fresh cabbage. Beef jerky, marinated beef strips deep-fried and
served with a spicy homemade sauce, is an intense dish, both in
flavor and mastication skills required.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of all this goodness was the crispy mussel omelet
($6.95), a combination of silky mussels playing against the crisp
crust of the plate-size omelet. If there were to be a last meal,
this would make the short list.
</P>
<P>
   Roasted duck was a close second _ and only because this is Las
Vegas, and you've got to name a winner. The moist duck is married
with pineapple, bell pepper and tomato in a red curry base with a
touch of coconut milk. All yours for $8.95.
</P>
<P>
   Dessert was perfect for a hot desert night: a ball of coconut
ice cream wrapped in a hand of sticky rice ($3.25). I was ready to
face the night _ big or small.
</P>
<P>
   All the leftovers went back to the hotel with me, refrigerated
or not, because it's Las Vegas, and for food this good I'm willing
to bet the odds.

TALENTED WOMEN HAVE DREAMS OF GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Stacy Sykora was a little girl in Burleson in North Texas,
she played volleyball in her front yard with her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would just slam the balls on me,'' Sykora told the U.S.
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Her response?
</P>
<P>
   She became a world-class volleyball player, specializing in
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora, 23, is on the U.S. Olympic Women's Volleyball team and
is headed to the games next month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   She's one of the women to watch at the Olympics. Keep an eye on
these women, not just for their ability to win medals, but also for
the stories of how life didn't drag them down but instead fueled
their desire to rise.
</P>
<P>
   After all, some of us who were hit by big sister's spikes
decided never to play volleyball again. Not Sykora. The 1995
Burleson High School graduate, buffed from playing volleyball on
the beach at South Padre Island on the Gulf Coast, went on to
become the Texas A&AMP;M University Defensive Player of the Year in
1996. The 5-foot-10-inch athlete lives and trains with the U.S.
Olympic Team in Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Here, based on U.S. Olympic Committee interviews, are two more
great achievers readying for the 2000 games:
</P>
<P>
   DAWN STALEY: She won a gold medal in basketball at the 1996
Olympics, went home to Philadelphia and started the Dawn Staley
Foundation, which offers after-school academic and athletic
programs for inner-city kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a product of the inner city, and a lot of people wrote us
off,'' she says. ``A lot of people looked down on kids who grew up
in the inner city.''
</P>
<P>
   Staley, 30, says poor kids don't get enough encouragement. No
one tells them that someday they may have their own gold medal.
Staley wants that changed.
</P>
<P>
   Staley wants ``to show that the neighborhood you grew up in
doesn't define you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In her professional life, she is a guard on a WNBA team, the
Charlotte Sting.
</P>
<P>
   RHONI BARTON: This Torrence, Calif., native is the daughter of a
professional water-skier. Her father had her on tiny water skis
that he made when she started walking.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was in elementary school, she was on the lake
early every morning, skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when she was 15, her father died. She lost not only a
father, but also the coach who provided her with direction. She
says getting back on water skis was her greatest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Now 24, she says her father's legacy lives on. When she competes
in the water-skiing events in the Olympics, the lessons her father
taught her _ to work harder, to be a good sport, to refuse to give
up _ will be with her.

PUTTING SOME COLOR INTO THE RODEO IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give some African-Americans enough rope, and they'll catch and
tie a calf.
</P>
<P>
   That is Cleo Hearn's favorite pastime. He's been roping calves
for more than four decades. And for three decades, he's been
helping minority cowboys to exhibit their rodeo skills.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma native began organizing black rodeos in the early
'70s, having discovered in the Big Apple a ripe and ready audience
for the spectacle of dozens of black cowboys riding, roping and
getting up close and personal with bucking horses and bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearn wanted to make his rodeos more representative of the
ethnic composition of the cowboy life during the heyday of the
cattle kingdom. About 25 percent of the cowboys who trailed cattle
from Texas to the northern railheads were African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1991, Hearn started the Cowboys of Color rodeos, which
include Hispanic and Native American cowboys as well as
African-Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has a few choice words about the economic impact of rodeos in
a community: the value (in terms of money and entertainment) of
rodeos like his, and the role played by cowboys of color in the
days of cattle drives and in contemporary professional rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn, who earns his living as a big wheel for Ford Motor Co.,
got a rodeo scholarship to Oklahoma State University and then left
because school officials decided that they'd rather have him play
football.
</P>
<P>
   He later graduated from Langston University with a degree in
business.
</P>
<P>
   He was drafted into the Army during the Korean War and expected
to be discharged quickly because of rodeo injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. He wound up in the spit-and-polish ceremonial honor guard
in Washington, where he achieved a kind of southpaw celebrity by
stepping on President Kennedy's foot. That miscue led to continuing
chitchat between the president and the soldier, which always began
with: ``I know where my feet are;
</P>
<P>
   do you know where yours are?''
</P>
<P>
   He was in the right spot at the right time and was the right
color when Marlboro cigarettes, and later Ford, needed a black
cowboy for an ad campaign. The latter commercial led to his
longtime employment with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeos like his and Bill Pickett's, he said, allow cowboys of
color to compete.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that role models like All-Around World Champion
Fred Whitfield will inspire African-American youths to take to the
sport, especially since some colleges offer rodeo scholarships.
Four of his sons, Hearn said, went through college on rodeo
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever attended a Cowboys of Color rodeo knows that
they are highly educational and entertaining. But be warned about
the music. The performers may wear boots and big hats, but the
sounds aren't country and western. Cowboys of Color is rodeo with a
beat.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A Jakarta judge said Wednesday that the
trial of former president Suharto on corruption charges would start
on Aug. 31 and that the ex-dictator must appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years before being forced to
resign in 1998, was officially charged with corruption this month,
accused of skimming nearly $500 million from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lalu Mariyun, chief of the South Jakarta District Court,
said Suharto, 79, must appear at his trial despite assertions by
his lawyers that he is too ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have ordered the Jakarta prosecutor's office to bring
Suharto to appear on August 31 at the court,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has promised to pardon Suharto if he
is found guilty, but only if he returns any ill-gotten wealth to
the state.

&HT;     GORE'S DOMESTIC POLICIES BUILD ON THOSE OF FDR, LBJ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Aug. 27)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many of Al Gore's strong populist appeals to the
poor and the middle class in his acceptance speech in Los Angeles
and his orations on the campaign trail originated long ago with
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not say that his grand design for America in the early
21st century was rooted in the far-reaching, controversial and
sometimes revolutionary programs created in the 20th century. But
the truth is that, if elected, he would build on foundations laid
by earlier Democratic presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In promising to ``fight for people,'' Gore appropriated the
weapon that won massive election victories for Roosevelt and
Johnson and greatly influenced their domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Astute observers of history could envision Gore's impassioned
convention message being delivered in the accent of FDR, the
Harvard-educated New Yorker of impeccable lineage, or the colorful
jargon of LBJ, the dynamic Hill Country politician who got his
degree at Texas State Teachers' College. These observers would have
little difficulty believing that many of Gore's proposals are
actually extensions of those advanced by Roosevelt and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Social Security, which has become one of the
untouchable pillars of our society, was launched by FDR in 1935 and
supported, to one degree or another, by every subsequent president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would channel money _ more than his Republican opponent,
George W. Bush _ from the budget surplus into Social Security to
make the program solvent far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that when Bill Clinton presided over a budget
surplus in fiscal 1998, he was the first president to do so since
Johnson submitted his last budget to Congress, the one for fiscal
1969.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore spoke of boosting the minimum wage, he was seeking to
expand an important program launched by the New Deal in the dark
days of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Like Roosevelt in 1936 denouncing the ``economic royalists,''
who he said regarded economic slavery as ``nobody's business,''
Gore repeatedly attacked the ``powerful interests'' that he said
block progress for today's working men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Gore echoed both Roosevelt and Johnson when he told Democratic
convention delegates, ``Together, let's make sure that our
prosperity enriches not just the few, but all working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, the former school teacher, Gore decreed that
education will be a priority if he is elected president. The
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which Gore has promised to
protect, was one of Johnson's most prized legislative
accomplishments. Its passage in 1964 marked the first time that the
federal government agreed to provide funds to schools in depressed
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his support of affirmative action, Gore adopted
another program pushed by Johnson, who was the greatest civil right
president in history.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would be pleased to see that many of the issues Gore
chose to showcase in his acceptance speech were those that he had
pioneered as part of the Great Society, including Medicare and
improvement of air and water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, because he was president during the horrible Vietnam
War, the only one that America lost, LBJ has become a non-person to
many of his fellow Democrats as well as Republicans and
independents.
</P>
<P>
   It matters not that John F. Kennedy dispatched 16,000 U.S.
military advisers to Vietnam and that Richard Nixon pursued the war
for four years after Johnson's retirement. That brutal conflict in
Southeast Asia is seen by many Americans as Johnson's war.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and liberals have made Democrats wary of paying
homage to Johnson, although the distinguished economist and
diplomat John Kenneth Galbraith wrote last year: ``Next only to
Franklin Roosevelt, and in some respects more so, Lyndon Johnson
was the most effective advocate of humane social change in this
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson could be crude, overbearing and deceitful. But he was
also compassionate and dedicated to the concept that government can
_ and does _ improve the lives of millions of Americans from all
walks of life. He saw that it can help especially the poor and the
young, the African Americans and Hispanics and others who, for one
reason or another, have been denied a share of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's and Johnson's philosophy on domestic matters appears
to have greatly influenced Gore's thinking. So have the guiding
beliefs of Kennedy, Harry Truman, Jimmy Carter and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not opposed to business and wealth. He is opposed to
those powerful forces of business and industry _ ``big tobacco, big
oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies and the HMOs,
as he put it _ that endanger the lives and lay a heavy financial
burden on poor and middle-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although he announced to the world from Los Angeles that he is
his own man, he has borrowed greatly from the past to update his
plans for the future.

 &HT;    RELATIVES OF KURSK CREW GREET RUSSIA'S PUTIN WITH 'BOOS' ON DAY
OF MOURNING
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ Russians lowered flags to half-mast and lit
candles in special church ceremonies during a national day of
mourning Wednesday for the 118 crewmembers of the sunken submarine
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the outpouring of grief rang shouts of anger by family
members who met with President Vladimir Putin for the first time
since the Aug. 12 tragedy plunged the Oscar-II Class nuclear sub
354 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was expected to attend memorial ceremonies at the
Severomorsk naval base and in Murmansk, where the Northern Fleet is
based, but he abruptly cut short his visit after a stormy meeting
with some 600 relatives of the submariners that lasted until early
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Met with shouts and some boos, Putin tried to calm those who had
traveled hundreds of miles in the hope of reclaiming the bodies of
their loved ones and finding answers to the question of what
exactly caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grief is immeasurable, there are not enough words of
comfort. My heart hurts, but yours hurt even more,'' said Putin,
looking serious in an all-black suit.
</P>
<P>
   But families would not be consoled, according to people who
attended the meeting held in officer's barracks. Instead, they
criticized the president for the lack of information they received
during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will we get them back, dead or alive? Answer as the
president,'' shouted a woman, referring to the bodies of the
sailors, in comments taped by state-owned RTR television, the only
press agency allowed to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll answer you when I know myself,'' the president replied.
</P>
<P>
   The mood soured further when the family members requested that
the Navy cancel memorial ceremonies Putin was supposed to
officiate, saying they would not mourn until they had corpses to
bury.
</P>
<P>
   In a further blow to the family members, officials in charge of
salvaging the bodies and the 20,000-ton sub announced Wednesday
that it would take close to one year to raise the Kursk, due to
adverse weather conditions common to this region in the Arctic
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has not yet been made about whether to retrieve the
bodies separately in a quicker operation that would involve
drilling holes into the sub, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident can not be confirmed until the
wreckage is brought to the surface and examined more closely, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officers have said the most likely cause of the
disaster was that an initial explosion, either from inside the
vessel or from a collision wrecked the front of the sub, sending it
straight down to the seabed. This impact then led to a detonation
of the Kursk's torpedoes. The crew, Russian officials say, died
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
contradicted this official explanation. They said the more likely
cause of the initial explosion was a misfire during top-secret
military exercises held in the area on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Naval sources based in Murmansk said the Russian military was
test-firing an experimental torpedo on the day the Kursk went
missing. Only a misfire of this weapon or another incoming weapon
could puncture the hull of the Kursk, one of the newest and most
modern nuclear submarines in Russia's fleet, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Possible causes of the accident have become the main themes of
television news talk shows and editorial columns across Russia's 11
time zones.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the day of mourning, however, Putin asked television
stations to refrain from running entertainment shows. Most TV
stations canceled usual entertainment and news shows and called for
moments of silence _ but regular programming continued during the
morning, including soap operas. Some stations honored the dead by
showing the names and photographs of the crewmembers.
</P>
<P>
   This silence on television was not matched in the streets of
Murmansk, a town some 1,000 miles north of Moscow where nearly 50
percent of the jobs are associated with the nearby base.
</P>
<P>
   Here, people assailed Putin for taking so long after the
accident to show concern for the crew. But most of all, they
criticized the government for initially resisting international
help, a decision they feel could have saved some lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership doesn't care about individual lives. It lied to
us about our boys. What good do their tears do us now?'' asked
misty-eyed 63-year-old Anna Kudrovna, who was laying flowers at the
town's WWII memorial Wednesday in honor of the Kursk crew.
</P>
<P>
   The government, at Putin's behest, has promised to look after
the relatives. And Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko told
reporters in Moscow Wednesday that families would get average
compensation worth US$7,000, an amount that equals more than 10
years' salary for a mid-level officer.

<P>
   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene Lopez, 15, said she
was willing to do anything if she could just get to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take care of babies,'' the
teenager from El Salvador said earnestly, her eyes as wide as
saucers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez never made it to her dream cities of Houston or El
Paso. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all high school girls
_ were unceremoniously dumped just inside Mexico by a smuggler
they'd paid to take them north. And it wasn't long before
immigration authorities in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state,
picked them up and put them in a detention center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents knew we were doing this. Our grandmother gave us
money,'' said Claudia Lopez, 16, who huddled nervously with the
other girls inside a cell, waiting for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going somewhere where with jobs we could
afford to buy food,'' Claudia said. ``We didn't know this would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While United States officials wage their own battle against
illegal crossings, Mexican officials in Chiapas _ which borders
Guatemala _ say they're grappling with a 30 percent surge in
seizures of Central Americans and other illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   More than 54,000 migrants were caught just in Chiapas here
between January and June, compared to about 37,700 during the same
period last year. The vast majority are Central Americans on their
way to the United States to escape low wages and societies still
devastated by civil war and 1998's Hurricane Mitch, according to
Javier Jimenez, regional director of the Mexican National Migration
Institute here, in this a city on the Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sense of urgency about them,'' Jimenez said. ``The
U.S. economy is what offers them hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers charging thousands of dollars are getting into the
action, leading migrants on increasingly perilous journeys in their
quest to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In April, seven people died after 250 migrants were found locked
inside suffocating train cargo holds in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In May, authorities found 309 illegal immigrants jammed inside a
convoy of four trucks traveling from Chiapas to Matamoros, on
Mexico's northern border. The migrants, ten of whom had to be
hospitalized, said their goal was to reach Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Guatemalans bound for the United States, including
two children, drowned when a motorboat they were in capsized off
the coast of Oaxaca, another southern Mexican state.
</P>
<P>
   A greater number of South Americans are also traveling through
southern Mexico en route to America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere in the United States,'' was the dream destination of
Luis Cayano, a 23-year-old Peruvian who'd been locked inside a
one-room holding cell here for more than a month, awaiting news on
who would pay for him to be deported to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Cayano, who has some college education, said he spent several
thousand dollars on bus fare and bribes to corrupt officials in
various countries as he made his way north. His mother had used her
house as collateral for a loan from a bank and he felt responsible
now to somehow get to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a dream of going to the United States, you have to
give it a go,'' Cayano said. ``We are willing to risk a lot to get
there, even our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the Central Americans flooding Mexico, Salvadoran
Francisco Antonio Ramirez wanted to get to Los Angeles, where he
heard he could make more money than he ever imagined. Mexican
officials caught him at a bus station near Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a cost-benefit analysis, it's probably worth more
for me to try to get to the United States than stay at my job in El
Salvador,'' the 26-year-old father of two said.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of tears, he said he'd saved and borrowed about
US$900 for his journey from his home in San Miguel, El Salvador.
Back home, in a country rife with crime, he was earning the
equivalent of US$110 a month repairing highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pittance,'' he said. ``We lived through a terrible war.
And now what little you earn gets stolen by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduran Carlos Castillo, 18, said he earned so little at a
T-shirt assembly plant back home _ about US$40 a week _ that his
family also thought it worth him trying his luck at getting to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad situation in Honduras,'' said Castillo, a
fresh-faced youth who was placed in the holding cell with the
startled look of a deer caught in headlights.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was hoping to join his uncle somewhere in Texas, but
he couldn't remember exactly where. He was supposed to call and get
the name of the city once he had traveled deeper into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, which hit Central America almost two years ago,
left its worst path of destruction in Honduras, Castillo's
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people were killed and 70-to-80 percent of
agricultural production was destroyed, along with 33,000 homes. The
U.S. government offered more than $103 million in emergency food
and disaster recovery. About 10 percent of another $291 million to
rebuild roads, health infrastructure and businesses was spent by
this June, according to the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy. We endured non-stop rain and wind. People
went for days without food. All that left big losses. You have to
look hard for ways to survive. So the hurricane had a huge impact
on us,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the migrants waiting to be shipped back home,
Castillo shrugged when asked if he would attempt the trip again.
</P>
<P>
   Most Central Americans caught in Chiapas are deported over the
border to Guatemala, where they travel freely without visas under a
multilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Those crossing illegally into Mexico sometimes walk through
tropical terrain or pay to be ferried across the Suchiate River,
which divides Chiapas from Guatemala. Once inside Mexico, the
migrants take buses or jump on trains heading north, climbing on
top of boxcars or hanging off the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials man roadblocks near the southern border to
check travelers' documents, and patrol the banks of the Suchiate
River. But because of shortages in manpower, the Suchiate appears
in some places to be a virtual no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   An astonishingly bustling trade is carried out daily on the
river, whose banks are lined on both sides with shacks selling food
and goods.
</P>
<P>
   Just a football-field away from an international checkpoint in
Hidalgo, Chiapas, a couple dozen rafts crafted from inner tubes and
wooden planks ply the river, carrying people and loads of
groceries. Guatemalans use the rafts so they can avoid having to
pay tariffs on their purchases at an official checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican customs' officials appear unable to stop the illegal
crossings. About the most they do is watch with binoculars and try
to stop drug shipments from coming in, said Neri Corada, one of the
reed-thin men and boys who push the rafts through the river with
long poles.
</P>
<P>
   In an impoverished region where everyone is fighting to survive,
tolerance prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sacred river provides a source of work for us,'' said
Corado. ``Imagine what we would do if it were not here.''

<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped dill or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large bunch of tender greens (spinach, mustard, chard, beet
greens), well washed, with tough stems trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Custard:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk or cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Wash and cut all the vegetables as suggested. Preheat the oven

Saute for about 1 minute, then add the squash, mushrooms, half the
herbs and several pinches of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Cook over medium-high heat for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring
frequently, until squash begins to color just a little; then
transfer the mixture to a gratin or casserole dish.
</P>
<P>
   Add the greens to the same skillet and cook just long enough to
wilt them down. Press out as much of the liquid as possible,
roughly chop the greens, and distribute them over the vegetables in
the gratin pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, beat the ricotta with the eggs; stir in the
milk or cream, the cheese and the remaining herbs. Season with salt
and pepper, then pour over the vegetables. Bake until the custard
is set and lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes.
</P>

<P>
   What do you do when someone stands you up? You stew. You steam.
Or perhaps you write a curt note. Douglas Anderson of Manhattan has
taken another approach: He sends a virtual voodoo doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have stood me up for voice lessons,'' said Anderson,
who is a music teacher. ``They never show up or call.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Anderson discovered PinStruck.com, an online service that
allows him to send offenders a curse in the image of a grinning
voodoo doll, and lets him stay anonymous while doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most therapeutic thing,'' Anderson said. ``It gives
me a channel to get it out of my system. As soon as I send off a
little effigy, I completely forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has company. On a typical day, PinStruck sends 2,000 to
3,000 curses. The messages are rendered in spidery handwriting, and
senders like Anderson can choose among 19 curses. The top choices,
said Tyson Liotta, who designed the site for Steem, a Web company
in Gaithersburg, Md., are ``You know you like it,'' ``I love you,''
``Look what you have become'' and ``It's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The site recently deleted a popular curse that said, ``This is
the end of you.'' ``People interpreted it as a death threat,''
Liotta said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge is not the noblest impulse but, with the Internet to
hide behind, it has certainly become easier to act upon. Web sites
for virtual vengeance give vindictive sorts plenty of ways to get
back at the objects of their disaffection. They can drive people
crazy with anonymous messages, disparage their enemies and deliver
bouquets of dead roses (or worse). It all comes with little effort
and almost no chance of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senders love the fact it is anonymous, and the victims
hate it,'' Liotta said. ``We get so much mail saying, `I really
need to know who sent it.' We have never known or been able to tell
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Some revenge sites, like Mother-In-Law Stories, simply offer a
forum for well-targeted gripes (motherinlawstories.com). Other less
savory sites encourage people to upload unflattering pictures, to
ask for suggestions on how best to take revenge or simply to vent
in a way that might make a sailor blush.
</P>
<P>
   A few enterprising people have even set up Web sites dedicated
to individuals. ``You're not going to say something hateful to
somebody's face, but on a Web site, hey, why not?'' said Matthew
Joseff of Reston, Va., who runs a site that allows retribution
seekers to post photographs and comments.
</P>
<P>
   Like flaming, Internet revenge is convenient, nonconfrontational
and anonymous. ``People can find in the Internet a means of
expression they never could otherwise,'' said Dr. Paul Ciborowski,
a psychologist at Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y.
Ciborowski said some of his patients had used the Internet for
revenge. ``It allows for impulsivity unchecked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites serve as clearinghouses for the vengeful by running
message boards where people can malign those who have done them
wrong, glean sympathetic responses, share stories of real-life
revenge and gather tips for future use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rattle people's cages,'' said Michael Baumgartner of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., who runs a revenge site. ``The best revenge does
not hurt but merely drives someone crazy. Remember, the people you
are doing revenge to deserve it. They've done something wrong.''
Baumgartner, whose day job is in human resources, also has an
online store featuring flowers _ dead, wilted or painted black, all
sent anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Ciborowski said anonymous postings could be a sort of therapy.
``There's an `I got it off my chest' kind of thing,'' he said.
``This is a validating group. They understand what you're going
through. Otherwise, they wouldn't be on this Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is funny or therapeutic to the sender can be anything
but to the recipient. Ciborowski drew a distinction between
anonymous postings and anonymous e-mail messages, which he called
vindictive and potentially frightening. ``You don't know who sent
it or why,'' he said. ``You're suspicious of anyone who might have
a grievance against you. Individuals who do this kind of thing tend
to be passive-aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of a nasty message makes it especially
threatening, said Sheila Heen, co-author of ``Difficult
Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most'' (Viking Press,
1999). ``I don't think we appreciate the impact it has,'' said
Heen, who teaches negotiation at Harvard Law School. ``You're
thinking, `Why does someone hate me so much?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're slashing someone's tires,'' she added, ``it's easier
to know you're stepping out of the normal bounds of behavior. On
the Internet, the action is consistent with a million other actions
you take in the course of a day. You click to sell stock, to
transfer money, to e-mail a friend, to e-mail an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many revenge sites emphasize that they are to be used
only for entertainment, said Liotta, the designer of the virtual
voodoo doll, ``no one respects that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send it to the most fearful person they know,'' he said.
``That person freaks out, but there's nobody to yell at except us.
Some people take it a lot more seriously than we anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite frequent requests, Liotta refuses to allow senders to
write their own messages. Nor can senders choose _ for technical
reasons _ where on the doll to stick the pins.
</P>
<P>
   Another variation on anonymous revenge comes from ManicMail.net,
a service that allows users to send e-mail messages that appear to
be coming from someone else.
</P>
<P>
   One satisfied user of ManicMail is Sam Downing of Chatsworth,
Calif. ``I have always enjoyed practical jokes,'' Downing said.
When a colleague showed off his brand-new Honda Accord a few months
ago, Downing couldn't resist a trick. ``I sent him an e-mail from
the dealership saying the car was being recalled,'' he said. ``It
was the first car he had ever bought.''
</P>
<P>
   The colleague, Jeffrey Tani, was so upset that co-workers, who
were in on the joke, made Downing confess.
</P>
<P>
   Tani said, ``It looked authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   A disclaimer at ManicMail warns against using the service for
abusive, offensive or illegal purposes. The disclaimer started out
as a lighthearted admonition, but it grew increasingly severe
because people abused the service, said Antony Robbins, a computer
programmer in England who runs ManicMail with his brother, Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the brothers started the site last year, they said, they
have been queried about a half-dozen times by the FBI and police
departments, mostly, Robbins said, about teen-agers harassing
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, ManicMail can trace the sender. And if a
recipient complains, no more ManicMail can be sent to that address.
</P>
<P>
   ManicMail sends about 300 e-mail notes a day. Activity spiked a
few months ago when it was mentioned on a syndicated radio show.
Baumgartner said: ``The world is filled with miserable people. They
all have the same theme.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ They're buried as they lived, side by side,
in a plot that seems at once too small for their stature and a
perfect fit with their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Their grave marker is no bigger or more ornate than most others
in the cemetery located behind the small white Baptist church they
helped build on land they donated nearly 150 years ago. The few
facts carved in stone _ Chang and Eng came into the world together
on May 11, 1811, and died together on Jan. 17, 1874 _ barely
scratch the surface of this richly complex, real-life saga of the
original Siamese twins.
</P>
<P>
   They surely were among the most exotically foreign creatures
this part of the world had ever seen. And yet their story _ and
that of their descendants _ is quintessentially American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once when I was 8 or 9, we were sitting around the table at
home talking about famous people,'' recalls Milton Haynes, 64, of
Raleigh. ``And I said, `Who are we?' I can still remember my daddy
saying, `You can tell 'em we're descended from Siamese twins.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's the last Saturday in July, and Haynes is waiting his turn
in a long buffet line in the White Plains Recreational Building. To
his right, the U.S. and North Carolina flags are displayed on a
beige brick wall. Dead ahead, a couple of tables laid end-to-end
nearly buckle beneath the weight of homemade casseroles, platters
of chicken and bowls of baked beans and banana pudding. The excited
chatter of reunited cousins and great-aunts fills what little air
circulates in the low-slung building.
</P>
<P>
   It could be any one of countless family reunions held in small
Southern towns on sultry summer afternoons. On their name tags,
Haynes and his wife, Chase, also have printed the name ``Chang.''
Across the room, Jessie Bunker Bryant, a statuesque woman in her
early 70s bent low over a table of fat notebooks filled with
genealogical information, has written ``Eng'' on hers.
</P>
<P>
   So has Sarah Bunker, at 11 one of the youngest of the
approximately 150 descendants of the twins packed into this small
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many `greats' I am,'' sighs Sarah, who has no
siblings and shudders slightly at the thought of being permanently
attached to a certain pesky young relative.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most family ties are figurative. For Chang and Eng
Bunker, they were literal, although it is the way the two men
worked with, around and through their condition, rather than the
physical oddity itself, that their descendants come together to
recall and celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left us a great legacy,'' says Tom Atkins, 39, the
self-described ``youngest great-grandchild'' (by Eng), who moved
three years ago from Gwinnett County to Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine taking off from home for a foreign country when you're
still a kid and doing what they did. I don't know how anyone could
do that, let alone people in their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in what is now Thailand, connected by a band of cartilage
at the base of the breastbone, Chang and Eng unwittingly spawned
the phrase Siamese twins (the accepted term now is ``conjoined'')
and were initially considered to be such a bad omen that they were
ordered put to death. Though they were spared, even being invited
at age 13 to visit the Bangkok palace of King Rama III, Chang and
Eng's shared life was hardly their own for years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the twins turned 18, a Scottish trader paid a
small sum of money to the boys' mother and got permission from the
king to take them to New York. ``The Siamese Double Boys,'' as an
exhibition poster billed them, spent the next three years touring
the United States and Great Britain with an act that largely
featured them tumbling and audiences staring at them curiously. In
Britain alone, more than 300,000 people paid to see them. But after
promoters and exhibitors took their cuts, there was little money
left for the twins. Soon after turning 21, the twins went into
business for themselves in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By 1839, Chang and Eng were in need of a vacation and a career
change. They found both in Wilkesboro, N.C., where they applied for
U.S. citizenship and set about becoming farmers in an area known as
Trap Hill. Adopting an arbitrary last name, Bunker, they began
sinking roots. In a double ceremony in April 1843, Chang married
Adelaide Yates, with whom he would eventually have 10 children, and
Eng married her sister, Sallie, with whom he would have 11. In
1845, the two growing families moved to a bigger house on a large
piece of farmland near Mount Airy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mount Airy is best known as the picturesque birthplace of
TV's Andy Griffith. Its downtown is dotted with a Floyd's City
Barbershop, a Snappy Lunch and other establishments offering fond
reminders or actual souvenirs of the fictional Mayberry. But in the
mid-1800s, the Bunker twins _ having toured with P.T. Barnum and
appeared onstage around the world _ loomed largest in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the I-74 connector highway runs through what was once
their vast expanse of farmland in White Plains. The original White
Plains Baptist Church stands on their donated land, not far from
Bunker Road. The ``double chop'' method Chang and Eng developed to
fell large trees is still used by pairs of woodchoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bunkers grew tobacco, among other crops, and owned slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Shoemaker, a Duluth resident who accompanied her husband,
Diynes, who thinks it was simply a matter of so many descendants
becoming so spread out over time. ``And we to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes contacted Jessie Bunker Bryant, one of Eng's
great-granddaughters, and the resulting reunion at a church in
Wallberg, N.C., drew about 175 people. Since then, Chang and Eng
descendants from as far away as Idaho and Washington state have
come to North Carolina for the annual reunion held on the last
Saturday in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured since these two gentlemen had never been separated,
we should try to get together,'' says Haynes, inching his way along
the buffet line at this year's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the most unlikely guest at this year's reunion was
30-year-old Darin Strauss of New York. Strauss' first novel,
``Chang and Eng,'' was published this summer to much acclaim.
Starting with details from the twins' history, Strauss broadened
his story into a haunting exploration of themes relating to
identity and all the books for all the kids,'' reports Blackmon,
who has four children, including Tanya Rees, and eight
grandchildren. ``He seems like a nice fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems a little nervous,'' says Haymore, watching two women
position themselves on either side of Strauss for a photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm coming to the reunion. Do you think I'll be
welcome?' '' Blackmon concludes. ``I said, `I think you'll be OK.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Even as family members now are opening up, talking about and
celebrating their exotic ancestors, the local community seems to
have rediscovered Chang and Eng as well. Beyond Strauss' book,
there now is an entire room of exhibits on Chang and Eng at the
Mount Airy Visitors Center (to go along with three rooms covering
the life and times of Andy Griffith). The Surry County Commission
recently voted to name the bridge that crosses over Stewart's Creek
on busy U.S. 601 in honor of the twins. And ``Twin Sunday'' is even
making a comeback at the circa-1956 brick White Plains Baptist
Church that stan

<P>
   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene Lopez, 15, said she
was willing to do anything if she could just get to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take care of babies,'' the
teenager from El Salvador said earnestly, her eyes as wide as
saucers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez never made it to her dream cities of Houston or El
Paso. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all high school girls
_ were unceremoniously dumped just inside Mexico by a smuggler
they'd paid to take them north. And it wasn't long before
immigration authorities in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state,
picked them up and put them in a detention center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents knew we were doing this. Our grandmother gave us
money,'' said Claudia Lopez, 16, who huddled nervously with the
other girls inside a cell, waiting for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going somewhere where with jobs we could
afford to buy food,'' Claudia said. ``We didn't know this would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While United States officials wage their own battle against
illegal crossings, Mexican officials in Chiapas _ which borders
Guatemala _ say they're grappling with a 30 percent surge in
seizures of Central Americans and other illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   More than 54,000 migrants were caught just in Chiapas here
between January and June, compared to about 37,700 during the same
period last year. The vast majority are Central Americans on their
way to the United States to escape low wages and societies still
devastated by civil war and 1998's Hurricane Mitch, according to
Javier Jimenez, regional director of the Mexican National Migration
Institute here, in this a city on the Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sense of urgency about them,'' Jimenez said. ``The
U.S. economy is what offers them hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers charging thousands of dollars are getting into the
action, leading migrants on increasingly perilous journeys in their
quest to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In April, seven people died after 250 migrants were found locked
inside suffocating train cargo holds in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In May, authorities found 309 illegal immigrants jammed inside a
convoy of four trucks traveling from Chiapas to Matamoros, on
Mexico's northern border. The migrants, ten of whom had to be
hospitalized, said their goal was to reach Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Guatemalans bound for the United States, including
two children, drowned when a motorboat they were in capsized off
the coast of Oaxaca, another southern Mexican state.
</P>
<P>
   A greater number of South Americans are also traveling through
southern Mexico en route to America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere in the United States,'' was the dream destination of
Luis Cayano, a 23-year-old Peruvian who'd been locked inside a
one-room holding cell here for more than a month, awaiting news on
who would pay for him to be deported to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Cayano, who has some college education, said he spent several
thousand dollars on bus fare and bribes to corrupt officials in
various countries as he made his way north. His mother had used her
house as collateral for a loan from a bank and he felt responsible
now to somehow get to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a dream of going to the United States, you have to
give it a go,'' Cayano said. ``We are willing to risk a lot to get
there, even our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the Central Americans flooding Mexico, Salvadoran
Francisco Antonio Ramirez wanted to get to Los Angeles, where he
heard he could make more money than he ever imagined. Mexican
officials caught him at a bus station near Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a cost-benefit analysis, it's probably worth more
for me to try to get to the United States than stay at my job in El
Salvador,'' the 26-year-old father of two said.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of tears, he said he'd saved and borrowed about
US$900 for his journey from his home in San Miguel, El Salvador.
Back home, in a country rife with crime, he was earning the
equivalent of US$110 a month repairing highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pittance,'' he said. ``We lived through a terrible war.
And now what little you earn gets stolen by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduran Carlos Castillo, 18, said he earned so little at a
T-shirt assembly plant back home _ about US$40 a week _ that his
family also thought it worth him trying his luck at getting to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad situation in Honduras,'' said Castillo, a
fresh-faced youth who was placed in the holding cell with the
startled look of a deer caught in headlights.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was hoping to join his uncle somewhere in Texas, but
he couldn't remember exactly where. He was supposed to call and get
the name of the city once he had traveled deeper into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, which hit Central America almost two years ago,
left its worst path of destruction in Honduras, Castillo's
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people were killed and 70-to-80 percent of
agricultural production was destroyed, along with 33,000 homes. The
U.S. government offered more than $103 million in emergency food
and disaster recovery. About 10 percent of another $291 million to
rebuild roads, health infrastructure and businesses was spent by
this June, according to the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy. We endured non-stop rain and wind. People
went for days without food. All that left big losses. You have to
look hard for ways to survive. So the hurricane had a huge impact
on us,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the migrants waiting to be shipped back home,
Castillo shrugged when asked if he would attempt the trip again.
</P>
<P>
   Most Central Americans caught in Chiapas are deported over the
border to Guatemala, where they travel freely without visas under a
multilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Those crossing illegally into Mexico sometimes walk through
tropical terrain or pay to be ferried across the Suchiate River,
which divides Chiapas from Guatemala. Once inside Mexico, the
migrants take buses or jump on trains heading north, climbing on
top of boxcars or hanging off the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials man roadblocks near the southern border to
check travelers' documents, and patrol the banks of the Suchiate
River. But because of shortages in manpower, the Suchiate appears
in some places to be a virtual no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   An astonishingly bustling trade is carried out daily on the
river, whose banks are lined on both sides with shacks selling food
and goods.
</P>
<P>
   Just a football-field away from an international checkpoint in
Hidalgo, Chiapas, a couple dozen rafts crafted from inner tubes and
wooden planks ply the river, carrying people and loads of
groceries. Guatemalans use the rafts so they can avoid having to
pay tariffs on their purchases at an official checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican customs' officials appear unable to stop the illegal
crossings. About the most they do is watch with binoculars and try
to stop drug shipments from coming in, said Neri Corada, one of the
reed-thin men and boys who push the rafts through the river with
long poles.
</P>
<P>
   In an impoverished region where everyone is fighting to survive,
tolerance prevails.
</P>

 &HT;    BRITISH LOTTERY OPERATOR'S TIES TO GTECH RESULTS IN LOSS OF
CONTRACT
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<P>
   LONDON _ British lottery officials Wednesday said they intend to
drop a company associated with GTECH, the world's largest lottery
operator, in favor of a consortium led by Virgin Group tycoon
Richard Branson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island-based GTECH, which has a history of
controversy, operates the lotteries in many U.S. states _ including
Georgia, Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with GTECH's software contributed heavily to the
British Lottery Commission's surprise decision to end its
relationship with Camelot, the English company that has held the
lottery contract since 1994, Commission Chairwoman Helena Shovelton
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shovelton also expressed reservations because of ``unresolved
concerns about the long-term propriety of the arrangements made
with GTECH, and between GTECH and Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not elaborate, but the commission is investigating
Camelot's handling of a technical problem that caused errors in
thousands of prize payments between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   GTECH, which at the time had a 22 percent stake in Camelot, did
not tell the company about the glitch until earlier this year,
according to British press reports. Camelot could be fined if the
probe reveals breaches in its agreement with the commission. The
results are expected to be made public next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it no longer owns part of Camelot, GTECH remains its
key technical supplier.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal by Branson's People's Lottery consortium also
had problems, Shovelton said they probably could be resolved
through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, who has been eager to win the lottery contract, was
stranded on his Caribbean island by Hurricane Debby and could not
make the announcement. Branson competed with Camelot for the
contract in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Branson accused former GTECH Chairman Guy Snowden of attempting
to bribe Branson into dropping his bid. Branson later sued Snowden
for libel over the affair and won a 1998 judgment that was upheld
on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The British Parliament also reprimanded a former lottery
regulator for accepting hospitality and free trips in a private jet
owned by GTECH.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, questions have been raised here about Camelot's
profits _ which have run more than US$105 million a year _
directors' bonuses and the way money was distributed to good
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, Camelot insists it runs the most
successful lottery in the world. It has sold more than US$40
billion worth of tickets and distributed about US$15 billion to
good causes.
</P>
<P>
   Branson has pledged that he would not profit from the lottery,
saying any surpluses would go to good causes.
</P>
<P>
   Included in his consortium are KPMG Consulting, Energis, Compaq,
Kellogg's, Microsoft and Cisco Systems, who will supply the
technology, and advertising agency J Walter Thompson and AWI _
GTECH's chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes PLC, De La Rue PLC and Thomson-CSF unit, Racal
owns Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Both Camelot and People's Lottery had pledged to raise nearly
US$23 billion over the next seven years. Branson also proposed
running two online games and pledged to create 2,500 new
millionaires with his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision caught Camelot by surprise. ``We are
bitterly disappointed and stunned by the news,'' the company said
in a statement that also suggested that the matter may not yet be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   GTECH's activities have been the subjects of investigations in
Georgia and Texas, but neither has revealed any criminal
wrongdoing.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bess Gornick was an only-in-New-York New Yorker. The
kind of woman who, living alone at age 90 in a Manhattan apartment,
thought nothing of bounding up to a police officer, with the back
of her sweater half-fastened, and demanding, ``Button me!''
</P>
<P>
   The city and its tempestuous motion _ its bus drivers, cashiers,
pretzel vendors, street talkers, dog walkers _ were a perpetual
source of renewal to Gornick, a ``working-class toughie from the
Bronx,'' in the words of her daughter, the writer Vivian Gornick.
</P>
<P>
   When Bess became housebound in the mid-1980s, unable to roam
freely, her deterioration was rapid. She grew listless and
withdrawn. ``For the first time in her life she lost definition,''
Gornick recalled. ``My mother had suddenly become a generic old
woman.'' But one day, Gornick brought along a friend to visit, and
in no time at all her mother and friend were deep in conversation.
``The change in my mother was astonishing,'' the writer recalled.
``She began to look again like herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last years of Bess Gornick's life made her daughter, who
has inherited both her socialist mother's vigor and luminous skin,
think about her own aging, and of the loss of connections. Like
many creative city people, Gornick lives and works alone, one of
the legions, she has written, who ``stare out the window of a room
empty of companionship.'' Like many writers and artists, she finds
herself growing old without a pension or benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around at my own soul,'' Gornick said the other day,
engaged in her mother's favorite activities, walking and talking
fast around Greenwich Village. ``I discover as I go on that the
loneliness is crippling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born the idea for The House of Elder Artists, or THEA,
a confederacy of kindred souls dedicated to creating an
un-retirement home for female writers, artists, community activists
_ and those game enough to grow old among them.
</P>
<P>
   They envision THEA, as yet unbuilt, as a sort of Yaddo with
superintendents: a nonprofit residence and cultural center in
Manhattan with 100 rental apartments, many reserved for people of
low to modest means. Although the project must surmount major
hurdles, from finding a site to securing financing, the preliminary
ideas call for a common dining room as well as studio and gallery
space and rooms for public performances and lectures. To build it,
the group has teamed up with the Women's Housing and Economic
Development Corp., a nonprofit organization dedicated to women's
housing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, communal living arrangements of various sorts are
appealing to a broad group of single women. From shared housing,
where housemates are often matched by nonprofit or religious groups
like the National Shared Housing Resource Center
(www.nationalsharedhousing.org), to golf resorts in Florida for
those seeking the Dinah Shore lifestyle, housing is beginning to
address profound statistical realities: Between 1970 and 1998, the
number of women living alone across the country doubled, from 7.3
million to 15.3 million, according to the American Association of
Retired Persons. In New York City alone, 41.8 percent of all women
aged 65 and older live alone, versus 20.8 percent of the men.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Gornickchicks are following squarely in the
tradition of the material feminists of the 19th century, women like
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who proposed a feminist apartment hotel
in New York City and campaigned for redesigned spaces that would
support women's public work and end their physical isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The group currently is made up of the advocates of yesteryear,
as one puts it, including the novelist Helen Yglesias, 85, the
writer Alix Kates Shulman, 67; the children's book illustrator and
author Vera Williams, 72, the documentary filmmaker Lilly Rivlin,
62, and assorted lawyers, judges, painters and Village lefties,
from age 53 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say, Why now? Why us?'' Emily Goodman, a judge in
her 50s, said over Italian food in a Manhattan restaurant one
recent evening with some THEA sisters. They shared some dishes,
rejected the ones saturated in olive oil as too fattening. (``Are
we going to do this at THEA?'' one wondered.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a group who've always been involved in movements,''
Goodman said. ``If we sat around and waited, it would never
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gornick, who pulls up a Murphy bed each morning to make space
for her office at home, speaks of spiritual isolation as the great,
largely unspoken fear. In her 1987 memoir, ``Fierce Attachments,''
she recalls life in the Bronx tenement apartment building where she
grew up, the connection her mother felt each time she opened the
window onto the alley, where women were calling to each other,
``the sound of their voices mixed with the smell of clothes drying
in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   As an old woman, she said, her mother's desire to connect to the
life of the city was even stronger, but she became unable to reach
out. ``My mother and her friends got old sealed off in little
apartments,'' she said. ``They had lifetimes of insecurities that,
as they got older, they were less able to break through. The point
of THEA, in a way, is to create a place that would save us from
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused a moment. ``If Eleanor Roosevelt hadn't been married
to Franklin, she would live in a place like THEA.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   As more women live alone and housing costs climb, ``shelter
poverty'' among older women is rising, said Marci LeFevre, a
consultant for the AARP, resulting in more and more older women
pooling resources to live together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it,'' said Williams, whose eyes exude
youthful mischief, ``it's odd that it should be unusual that people
who've had great autonomy get together to think about arranging
their lives as they get older.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the glory days of the feminist movement,
middle-age women prefer sofas to the floor. THEA has gone through
many permutations since Gornick went through her phone book three
years ago and invited ``almost every woman I'd known in the past 20
years'' to think about her proposition.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably fortunate that David Letterman was not a fly on
the wall. The original idea was a feminist retirement residence, a
concept that was shot down almost immediately by the room of
feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Gornick remembers the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Too broad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too restricting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What, no men?''
</P>
<P>
   The second suggestion was to make it a residence for women in
the arts. But that didn't wash with the lawyers. (``What, no
men?'') The third idea was to make THEA a residence for women
active in political causes. (``Activists? What does that mean?
They'll think were Communists.'' ``What, no men?'') The meetings
went on _ and on _ with about 20 to 30 women in attendance. ``It
was talk, talk, talk that went nowhere, like an academic faculty
meeting,'' Gornick recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then one night, Rivlin said, ``Why are we calling this a
retirement home? Who's retiring? We have to be a part of the polis,
the city, and have the city come to us.'' It was a galvanizing
moment. ``Every face in the room lit up,'' Gornick said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea took hold of a residence organized around a strong
shared public sense of things, in her words, where writers and
artists would give back to the city and keep their own working
minds alive by inviting the neighborhood in for lectures, master
classes, readings and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But the endless tortured discussions about minutiae might have
continued to eternity had THEA not hooked up with Nancy Biberman, a
housing advocate, developer and lawyer who founded the Women's
Housing and Economic Development Corp. and was responsible for the
$23 million transformation of the vacant Morrisania Hospital in the
South Bronx into a low-income apartment building for 132 families,
many of them formerly homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Biberman, 52, whose first experience with building was
barricading Hamilton Hall at Columbia University in 1968, became a
partner with THEA and the project's developer. To make THEA a
reality in Manhattan, she said, either as a new building or a
renovated one, would cost about $20 million. About $16 million
would come from tax-exempt bonds through the city's Housing
Development Corp., a loan that would be repaid with rental income
over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   THEA also qualifies for tax credits because it has committed
itself to setting aside 20 percent of its one- and two-bedroom
apartments for low-income tenants. The sliding scale of rents would
range from $857 to $3,500, including two meals a day, with
residents selected by lottery. The design would allow spaces for
home health-care attendants, whose services might be shared.
</P>
<P>
   The women of THEA themselves will need to raise an additional $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The project is so daunting that some members of the original
group have dropped out, among them the writer Susan Brownmiller.
``Fund raising wasn't my thing, and the whole project sounded
fearfully expensive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current real estate climate, would the group consider
living outside Manhattan? Gornick wouldn't hear of it, convinced
not only of the long-term benefits of Manhattan's cultural richness
but also of the contributions the group could make to it. She
remembers once asking her mother, the ultimate Manhattanite, to
consider moving to Florida. Not long afterward, Gornick went there
on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma!'' she shrieked into the telephone. ``You were right! I
hope you die in a blizzard running for the 23rd Street crosstown.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Biberman said the group negotiated for an option to
purchase a piece of vacant land on West 46th Street but chose not
to pursue it because of a more desirable possibility. ``We're
pursuing that now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of THEA, which could resemble a gray-haired version of
a '60s college dorm, would be resonant with the rich experiences of
women like Yglesias, whose latest novel, ``The Girls,'' is about
four sisters in their 80s and 90s, living in Miami. Yglesias, who
has three children and five grandchildren, divides her time between
a house in Maine, where she hires people to drive her around, and
the Markle Residence in Greenwich Village, an intergenerational
apartment building, with group dining, run by the Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   She published her first novel, ``How She Died,'' at age 54,
after raising a family. ``Life intervenes for many women,'' she
said. ``I was lucky.'' She remains committed despite the fact that
she may not live to see the project's fruition. Yglesias, who
describes herself as ``a seasoned voyager in the territory of the
aged,'' continued, ``I don't really think in terms of THEA
happening in time for me,'' she said, ``not that I brood.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gornick, Williams regards THEA not only as a personal
solution but as a social model. She has already pioneered
alternative housing: In 1955, she and a group of friends from Black
Mountain College in North Carolina got together to establish a
radical cooperative community at Stony Point, N.Y. She raised three
children there, alongside a pottery and an enamel shop, a
woodworking shop and a school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she shares a graffiti-spattered waterfront studio in
Greenwich Village with fellow artists, and, after years living
alone, has begun sharing her apartment with a roommate. ``I'm not
interested in the acquisition of property or furnishing places,''
she said. ``They don't fascinate me the way solving social problems
does.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't sure at first she had the energy for THEA. ``There's
a reluctance to make any plans for old age, because you're
reluctant to be old,'' she said. ``You need solitude. But you also
need crosscurrents. Here you would be in a place where you might be
needed by other people, where there would be others around to talk
about your work. It would be enlivening, harder to get into ruts.
It's my idea of what keeps people living, versus having things
supremely comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, she said, eyes crinkling: ``It would be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a place where Gornick could continue writing about
``the lovely human bustle at noon, a density of urban appetites and
absorptions.'' In her essay ``On the Street'' from ``Approaching
Eye Level'' (Beacon Press, 1996), she describes the searing New
York loneliness ``that engulfs me like dry heat.'' She finds an
antidote walking the city streets _ as she hopes to do at age 95 _
grinning to herself at the exhilarating lengths people will go to
to survive, the ``50 different ways people struggle to remain human
until the very last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join the anxiety,'' she writes, ``I share the condition. I
feel in my nerve endings the common refusal to go under.''

STEPS TO INSTALL MOLDING AND TRIM 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Installing molding and trim around doors and windows and at the
top and base of the walls is called finish carpentry. The pieces
must be cut accurately and fitted together so they are aligned
properly without noticeable gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Most do-it-yourselfers can, with time and practice, install
molding so it looks good, but professional carpenters can install
the same molding more quickly and with fewer mistakes. That is
because they have developed tricks of the trade that make basic
finish-carpentry tasks easier.
</P>
<P>
   Most professionals try to avoid taking measurements. They do not
measure a length, then try to transfer that measurement to the
workpiece, the piece to be cut to length. Instead they try,
whenever possible, to hold the workpiece in place and mark its
length. If, for example, the carpenter wants to fit a piece of
molding over a door opening, he will hold the molding against the
jamb and mark the length, thus eliminating the need for a ruler.
</P>
<P>
   In situations where it may be difficult to hold the workpiece in
position, like fitting a long piece within an opening, the
carpenter will use a folding rule that has a sliding extension on
the end. The sliding extension makes it easy to transfer inside
dimensions without even having to read the scale.
</P>
<P>
   Most finish carpenters prefer extension rules to flexible tapes
for taking critical measurements because the rules remain rigid
when extended. Tapes often flex and bend. This can distort the
final measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Most carpenters are aware that certain tools have built-in
measurements, and they often use them to mark off a length. A
36-inch level is, obviously, 36 inches long. The blade of a
combination square is 1 inch wide. Many framing hammers are 16
inches (the distance between wall studs) from the head to the end
of the handle.
</P>
<P>
   If a carpenter knows he will be using a particular dimension
repeatedly in a layout, he will make his own measuring stick
(sometimes called a story pole) by cutting a board to a certain
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Using tools with standard dimensions eliminates the need to
measure and read numbers off a scale.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, trim cuts for molding or doors are made at right
angles so that the ends are square. This works if the frame is a
perfect rectangle, but in many houses, even new ones, angles may be
a little off. If you try to trim the bottom of a door to fit into a
doorway where the floor is out of level, the resulting gap between
the bottom edge of the door and the floor will be uneven, even
though the angles on the door are square.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a minor flaw, but the eye picks up on
divergent lines and the tapered gap at the door bottom will look
like some sort of mistake. The solution here is to trim the door so
that the bottom edge is parallel to the floor. This will create an
even and more pleasing gap under the door that looks right.
</P>
<P>
   When fitting the last piece of molding into place, professional
finish carpenters are careful not to cut it to exact length.
Instead, they cut the piece slightly long then shave it gradually
with a plane, file or power miter saw to achieve the best fit.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, it is difficult to achieve perfection when
doing a large installation, like running molding around the
perimeter of a room. The last piece may not fit exactly as planned,
no matter how much it is trimmed and shaved.
</P>
<P>
   Professional carpenters are aware of this problem, and they plan
the installation so the last piece will be positioned in an
inconspicuous corner of the room where a slight gap will go
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   An important rule in all carpentry is to complete the job. While
this may sound obvious, a large number of do-it-yourselfers (and
even professionals working on the molding in their own homes) run
out of time, so they leave a job half completed. Gradually, they
become accustomed to a window without the casing, missing baseboard
molding or a door that never gets a coat of sealer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being eyesores that are obvious to visitors,
these unfinished projects can create problems. Without the casing,
cold drafts may flow through the framing around the window. The
door without sealer will absorb moisture and warp.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot finish a job in the time you planned, immediately
pencil in a date on the calendar when you can return and complete
the work.

   About 1.5 million Christian youth gathered in Rome last weekend
for World Youth Day 2000, the 15th edition of the annual events,
which Pope John Paul II began in 1985. The theme of the conference
was unity between people of different races, denominations and
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``One'' is the official album of the conference, and the lyrics
and the roster of artists accurately reflect what the event tried
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The CD contains a mixture of original songs and previously
released cuts from diverse artists. It includes the Austin-based
Salvador, a Latin-pop group; Burlap to Cashmere, with its
Mediterranean influences; Gabriel's Harp, a French-American rock
group; the R&AMP;B-influenced sound of Winans Phase 2; and the pop/rock
band Sixpence None the Richer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best cuts is ``Peace Has Broken Out,'' a hopeful duet
by Marie Brennan and Booley, Irish singers from different sides of
the border, about reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   The theme song of the album is ``Emmanuel,'' a ballad about
unity in Christ, in English and multilanguage versions.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of ``One'' and the quality of the songs make this CD a
winner. &QL;

Ideas.'' But the Reformed theologian argues that considering basic
truths ``lays bare all of our assumptions so that we may discover
those assumptions that are false and often lethal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ergo'': Sproul's brief overview of major Western philosophers,
begins with Plato and his predecessors and proceeds to Friedrich
Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sarte. ``The Consequences of Ideas''
concentrates more on the ideas than the consequences, although one
hardly needs much reminding about what Karl Marx hath wrought in
Russia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sproul writes for ``educated laypersons,'' so expect some
unfamiliar words and concepts. But the book is almost as
reader-friendly as the topic will allow. &QL;

SWINGS, WALKERS AND BASSINETS FOR INFANTS RECALLED AS UNSAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost 3 million swings, walkers and bassinets are
being recalled because they pose serious hazards, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission said Wednesday. The agency said parents
should stop using them at once.
</P>
<P>
   The products under recall are about 2.5 million ``Lift 'n Lock
Swings'' and about 246,000 ``Get Up &AMP; Go Walkers,'' both made by
Fisher-Price of East Aurora, N.Y., and about 46,000 ``Le Cradle''
bassinets, manufactured by Kids Line of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The swing is an outdoor set for children from 9 months to 3
years old. The CPSC said children can maneuver out of the
restraints and fall. Fisher-Price has received 110 reports of
infants tumbling out of the swings, resulting in several serious
injuries and many bruises and scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   The swings have red or purple plastic seats, yellow T-shaped
restraint shields and blue ropes, the agency said. They were sold
from January 1991 until this month for about $19.
</P>
<P>
   The Fisher-Price walker under recall is a three-sided push toy,
white with blue sides, which has been sold since July 1997 for
about $30 and has found to be dangerous because children can push
it over or cut themselves on toy ``windshield wipers.''
Fisher-Price has received several hundred reports of children being
injured, the CPSC said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher-Price will provide free repair kits for the swings and
walkers. More information, like identifying serial numbers, is
available on the Fisher-Price web site (www.fisher-price.com) as
well as the CPSC site (www.cpsc.gov.)
</P>
<P>
   The bassinets under recall are dangerous because infants can
become trapped in an opening between the side and mattress
platform, the safety commission said. Kids Line has received a
report of a 3-month-old boy in Oakland Park, Fla., who suffocated
in a bassinet. Other infants have been injured by scrapes against
an exposed metal frame when the fabric pulls away, the CPSC said.
</P>
<P>
   The hazardous bassinets have a white metal base and were sold
from January 1989 through last May for $100 to $200, the agency
said. Free repair kits are available through Kids Line by calling
866-LECRADL (532-7235) toll free.

DVD TOY FOR RICH TECHIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(Eds.: Please note that the word PLUS in parentheses has been used
in the 8th and 9th grafs instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to some newspaper systems.) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a product that is wildly expensive, technically confusing
and apparently incompatible with a lot of machines with which it
ought to be expected to work, the Panasonic DMR-E10 DVD Video
Recorder is actually pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   It has the distinction of being the first consumer DVD video
recorder to reach these shores from Japan, and therefore it _ or
one of its competitors heading this way later in the year _ will be
pounced upon eagerly by rich gadget freaks.
</P>
<P>
   But let's get real. This champagne-colored DVD recorder costs
$4,000, blank DVD-RAM cartridges capable of recording 120 minutes
of digital video cost more than $25 apiece, and the likelihood is
high for an ugly Betamax versus VHS death match with rival DVD
recording formats.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic recorder comes with a 140-page manual that is only
slightly less scary than a Stephen King novella.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this product is actually more expensive and more
complicated to use than a personal computer, which is a remarkable
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   A truly determined gadget hound could probably rationalize
getting a DVD video recorders for dubbing old home videos onto a
DVD disc or for recording a favorite show that is being transmitted
in high quality to a digital TV via satellite. The picture quality
is excellent, and the old videotape I copied looked even better on
DVD than it did originally. And I could pop the recorded disc into
my computer's DVD drive and view the video on screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic DMR-E10 is not a one-trick pony. It is superb at
playing back prerecorded DVD movies and audio CDs. And while $25 is
a lot to spend on a blank disc, the disc can be recorded, erased
and rerecorded hundreds of times. At the highest quality, the
4.7-gigabyte DVD-RAM disc will hold one hour of video. At standard
quality, two hours. At the lowest level, which is still better than
the best videocassette recorder, it stores four hours.
</P>
<P>
   But if the goal is merely to record programs off the television,
a humble VCR does that job passably well at a fraction of the cost.
And as for archiving old videotapes onto a DVD disc, until the
technical standards are resolved, no one knows whether a DVD-RAM
disc will still be viewable a decade from now _ or whether a rival
format, either DVD(PLUS)RW or DVD-RW, will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Handicappers, grab your pencils. Panasonic, Toshiba, Samsung and
Hitachi are backing the DVD-RAM format. Sony, Yamaha, Ricoh,
Hewlett-Packard, Philips, RCA and Mitsubishi are backing
DVD(PLUS)RW, which they say is more compatible with existing DVD
players than Panasonic's DVD-RAM format. Pioneer and Sharp are
backing DVD-RW.
</P>
<P>
   I'm backing away from the whole mess, at least until a dominant
DVD video recording format emerges. Remember the Sony Betamax?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forget making bootleg copies of prerecorded DVD
movies. This new deck and its soon-to-arrive cousins will not allow
it. Besides, blank discs cost $25 and store-bought DVD movies cost
$20 _ a value proposition for piracy that might appeal to a New
Economy dot-com investor, but not to anyone with both oars in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   But do not ignore the new DVD video recorders. Eventually, they
will get better, cheaper, easier, more versatile and more reliable,
and when that happens, the trusty videocassette will begin its slow
ride into the analog sunset, where it will join its sidekick the
audiocassette.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of rapid adoption by consumers, DVD players are the
most successful consumer electronics devices of all time, getting
into millions of homes in a much shorter time than it took VCRs or
audio CD players. But the arrival of DVD recorders has been
delayed, for reasons both technical and political. The Hollywood
film industry, which a generation ago waged a bitter fight to stop
VCRs, has been urging the consumer electronics companies to hold
off introducing DVD recorders until there is reliable copyright
protection to thwart video pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic DMR-E10 includes a copyright protection system
called Content Protection for Recordable Media, which allows movie
studios or music companies to embed signals in a digital file that
determine whether it can be copied once, multiple times or not at
all.
</P>
<P>
   And that inspires us to take a lateral arabesque into public
policy. Those of you who find such topics boring may be excused
now.
</P>
<P>
   Flashback: In junior high school, the lockers all had
combination locks, but before long we figured out that by lifting
the locker door handle and applying just the right amount of
pressure to a specific point on the door _ BAM! _ the locker popped
open. We also discovered, much to our delight, that the technique
worked on any locker.
</P>
<P>
   The vice principal was not pleased that we had found a way to
circumvent the locker security system, and he forbade us from using
it. Thus were sown the seeds of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   It was the school's fault, we reasoned, for having chosen cheap
locks in the first place. And instead of trying to suppress what
was already by then a widely known technique for hacking the
lockers, the school simply needed to install better locks.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999. Jon Johansen, a Norwegian who was then 15,
wanted to watch DVD movies on his Linux-based computer. But he
couldn't, because of a copy-protection scheme called Content
Scramble System. The system was developed by the motion picture
industry and encoded into every DVD disc, so that the discs could
be played only on DVD players and computers that contained the
special key needed to unscramble the files.
</P>
<P>
   Johansen and a couple of friends discovered that the security
codes were almost as flimsy as my old school lockers. They wrote a
Windows program called DeCSS, which allowed them to descramble and
view the movies and copy them to hard disks. Johansen posted the
program on his personal Web site, and it propagated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of putting on their dunce caps and writing ``We goofed
on the encryption scheme'' 100 times on the blackboard, and
developing a new business model, the movie studios decided in
effect to sue the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, they compounded their mistakes into something
that was not only wrong, but dangerous. A group of motion picture
studios sued Eric Corley, whose 2600.com Web site had posted a copy
of DeCSS. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998,
passed by Congress with generous input from Hollywood, it is a
crime to possess any technology that is designed to violate a
copyright. Corley removed DeCSS from the 2600.com site, but he left
hyperlinks that pointed visitors to other Web sites where the
program was still available for downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge ordered Corley to take down the
links. In other words, the judge said it was illegal not just to
use the DeCSS program to circumvent DVD copy protection, and not
just to make the program available on a Web site, but it was also
illegal to provide a hyperlink to a site where the program was
being offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the court's decision after trial, and the decision may
be summarized in a nutshell,'' U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan
wrote in his decision. With all due respect to Kaplan, he chose a
highly appropriate container.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld on appeal, this ruling means that someone can be found
liable merely for pointing to objectionable information or programs
that someone else has posted on the Internet. It does not require a
Hollywood-style imagination to envision where this ruling could
take us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't get me wrong. Hollywood has a right to restrict the
viewing of its DVD movies to the personal use of people who have
paid a royalty. They just chose the wrong way to accomplish that,
and now the entire Internet could suffer.

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE-ASSESS (Moscow) _ A news analysis: With the
public confession Wednesday night by President Vladimir Putin that
he feels ``responsibility and guilt'' for the loss of the nuclear
submarine Kursk, Russia's political evolution seems to be taking a
new kind of post-Soviet turn. Military commanders are offering to
resign. The government and the private sector are competing to
raise millions of dollars to comfort the families of the Kursk's
crew. The air waves are ringing with the mea culpas from the
haughty admirals of the once mighty Red Banner Fleet of the north.

   U.N.-PEACEKEEPING (United Nations) _ A panel of international
experts recommended Wednesday that the U.N. peacekeeping
department, under attack for a series of disasters in recent years,
be enlarged and professionalized, with intelligence-gathering
functions that were essentially forbidden during the Cold War. The
panel of experts, appointed by Secretary General Kofi Annan, urged
that more effort go into preparing for crises before they spin out
of control _ not waiting for instructions from the Security Council
_ and also recommended that peacekeeping officials resist big-power
domination over their day-to-day activities. It is a vision certain
to upset both Americans isolationists as well as some Third World
leaders who fear a that stronger, more independent organization
would mean a new kind of colonialism. By Barbara Crossette.

because of their ability to form every tissue of the body, are

disability, death and medical expenses in decades to come. The

adult onset diabetes, which accounts for 90-95 percent of all cases
of the disease. Inactivity and weight gain can bring on Type 2

VIDEO DRESSES UP E-MAIL ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By KAREN J. BANNAN    
 c .2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shereef Moustafa has always been cautious about opening e-mail
notes containing attachments because he worries about viruses, but
when he received a video e-mail message about an Oracle conference,
his curiosity got the better of him. He clicked on the e-mail's
attachment, and a crisp video began to play almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second video invitation was so intriguing that Moustafa,
a marketing manager for an e-business company based in Los Angeles,
not only signed up for the advertised conference but also forwarded
the message to several of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got it,'' Moustafa said, ``I was quite honestly blown
away. It was tight, easy to watch and didn't waste my time. I
really got a feeling for what the conference would be about in a
short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Moustafa is not alone. Jay Stevens, marketing director for
RadicalMail, the company in Marina Del Rey, Calif., that created
and sent the conference video via e-mail, said the Oracle
conference invitation had been sent to 27,000 people and had been
opened 41,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we sent out the invitation, FirstConferences was
getting 10 people signing up for the conference per day,'' Stevens
said. ``After the video e-mail, they got 40 to 50 signups a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Video e-mail messages contain video clips or links to clips that
have been created for an advertiser or an organization. Video
e-mail can be used to send news and information to users who
request it. Video e-mail is relatively new, but the Discovery
Channel, the pop singer Britney Spears and Nissan automobile
dealers in the Atlanta area have already jumped on the video
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Video e-mail lets advertisers tell a story
and gives consumers access to extra features that all-text e-mail
cannot provide. For example, Britney Spears' video e-mail, which
was sent to members of her fan club, contains a short clip of the
singer's latest single as well as a contest link, an e-commerce
component that lets users order her latest CD and an automatic
forwarding option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really providing people with entertainment that they can
use to educate themselves and gain access to things that they are
really interested in,'' said Tom Blakeley, the co-chairman of
MindArrow Systems, a company based in Aliso Viejo, Calif., that
provided the technology behind the Britney Spears campaign. ``We
create a way to deliver content that makes people say Wow and gives
them a reason to open their e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   That factor is what Michele Slack, a senior analyst with Jupiter
Communications, based in New York, says will add to the
proliferation of video e-mail. ``We're seeing more and more
companies utilizing e-mail for marketing,'' Slack said. ``With more
than 268 billion e-mail messages being delivered in a year by 2005,
any type of e-mail that can stand out and break through the clutter
is going to be increasingly powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the wow factor, there are two potential problems
with video e-mail. The first is the bandwidth required to view the
videos. Today, more than 70 percent of consumers use a
low-bandwidth, dial-up connection to the Web, according to
Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose, Calif. Video e-mail,
especially streaming e-mail, requires large chunks of bandwidth.
High-quality video clips are often as large as 800 kilobytes.
Trying to watch a video that large over a dial-up line can be
difficult, if not impossible, depending on the speed of a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Web-based video is optimized for people with
high-speed connections, who are expected to be a minority for at
least several years, Slack said, most people with dial-up
connections will be willing to wait for videos to be downloaded, at
least in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the forefront of any new technology there is an increased
factor of tolerance,'' she said. ``Customers are willing to
experiment more, and they are willing to be more accepting.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies that develop video e-mail _ like MindArrow
Systems; RadicalMail; InChorus.com, in Santa Clara, Calif.;
Media1st.com, in Atlanta; and helloNetwork in Las Vegas _ are
trying to circumvent bandwidth limitations by pushing video only
when a user opens a message. That helps advertisers avoid the
possibility that large e-mail messages will be sent to people who
do not want them. It also helps companies track when a video is
viewed and for how long it is viewed, something that critics say
could lead to privacy problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because companies can track who is watching, how long they stay
with the message and to whom they forward the files, the companies
can theoretically create databases containing preferences and
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, of Radical E-Mail, played down the threat of customer
profiling, saying that most video e-mail companies send these
messages only to consumers who ``opt in,'' or agree to accept them.
``If someone has opted in, they can just as easily opt out,''
Stevens said. ``In addition, they have already provided a great
deal of demographic information to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dody, the chief executive of Media1st.com, agreed. ``We
always tell consumers right up front that we're collecting the
information that we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an upside to this type of business model, Slack
said. Because most people getting video e-mail choose to do so, and
because video messages are more expensive to produce than text
messages, consumers will see little if any video e-mail spam, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Moustafa, giving up a little bit of personal data is a small
price to pay for compelling information that he actually wants.
``Video is definitely a differentiator,'' he said. ``It was totally
like watching television. I would definitely want to see more of
this kind of e-mail. It certainly beats spam any day.''

 &HT;    BRITISH LOTTERY OPERATOR'S TIES TO GTECH RESULTS IN LOSS OF
CONTRACT
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British lottery officials Wednesday said they intend to
drop a company associated with GTECH, the world's largest lottery
operator, in favor of a consortium led by Virgin Group tycoon
Richard Branson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island-based GTECH, which has a history of
controversy, operates the lotteries in many U.S. states _ including
Georgia, Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with GTECH's software contributed heavily to the
British Lottery Commission's surprise decision to end its
relationship with Camelot, the English company that has held the
lottery contract since 1994, Commission Chairwoman Helena Shovelton
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shovelton also expressed reservations because of ``unresolved
concerns about the long-term propriety of the arrangements made
with GTECH, and between GTECH and Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not elaborate, but the commission is investigating
Camelot's handling of a technical problem that caused errors in
thousands of prize payments between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   GTECH, which at the time had a 22 percent stake in Camelot, did
not tell the company about the glitch until earlier this year,
according to British press reports. Camelot could be fined if the
probe reveals breaches in its agreement with the commission. The
results are expected to be made public next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it no longer owns part of Camelot, GTECH remains its
key technical supplier.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal by Branson's People's Lottery consortium also
had problems, Shovelton said they probably could be resolved
through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, who has been eager to win the lottery contract, was
stranded on his Caribbean island by Hurricane Debby and could not

ECONOMIC SCENE: COMPETITION IN ONLINE MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HAL VARIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is supposed to be a consumer paradise, with
cutthroat pricing creating bountiful bargains for surfing shoppers.
And so far the Internet has been a great place to shop. A survey by
two MIT professors, Erik Brynjolfsson and Michael Smith, found that
prices on the Internet are 9 to 16 percent lower than in retail
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But there is reason to believe that the bargains will not last.
For the last few years, Internet retailers have engaged in
``penetration pricing,'' setting low prices to make a big splash in
new markets. But recently, Internet retailers appear to be nudging
up prices, so as to reduce the burn rate and improve the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   While online retail selling matures, online wholesale markets
are heating up as businesses rush to set up online exchanges to cut
supply costs and, incidentally, to create a more competitive
environment for their suppliers. Proponents of online exchanges and
auctions claim cost savings of 10 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What does economics have to say about these rosy scenarios? Will
online markets really result in lower prices in the long run? The
answer is somewhat ambiguous: there are good reasons why prices
should go down, but there are also some good reasons why they might
go up.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet lowers the cost of the search. It is a lot easier
to click on a hyperlink than it is to drive to the store, or for
that matter, to make a phone call or send a fax. This means buyers
can shop around for a low price. High-priced sellers have either to
meet the competition or go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more subtle effects. It is true that buyers find
it easier to discover what the sellers are charging, but each
seller also finds it easier to discover what other sellers are
charging. It there are lots of competing sellers, this will
probably tend to push down prices even more rapidly. But if there
are only a few sellers, low-cost information about what they are
charging could, perversely, lead to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when price information is widely available, it
becomes easier for suppliers to coordinate their pricing, with each
seller agreeing, implicitly or explicitly, to charge a high price
so as to avoid ``ruinous competition.''
</P>
<P>
   A classic example is the infamous Joint Executive Committee set
up by the major American railroads in the 1880s. The committee,
actually a cartel, predated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and
was, at the time, perfectly legal. Newspapers of the day reported
on meetings and statements from the committee, just as newspapers
today report on meetings of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   The primary role of the committee was to collect information and
publish weekly accounts of shipments by the individual railroads.
The committee also collected data on prices charged, but this was
notoriously unreliable since committee members tended to cheat on
the cartel prices by making secret agreements with shippers to
shave prices in exchange for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to recognize that price cutting by the railroads
had to be secret _ public cuts were counterproductive because they
just precipitated price wars. But imagine what would happen if the
railroad cartel had used a public Internet exchange. Each railroad
could then see the prices charged by the others and attempts to
shave prices could be quickly countered, making the cartel less
vulnerable to price wars.
</P>
<P>
   Sound far-fetched? Look at the way airline prices are posted
online today: each airline announces its prices, along with the
associated terms and conditions, allowing competitors to scrutinize
one another's offerings. In the late 1980s, the airlines used
online reservation systems to signal price changes to one another.
One airline would post a price increase at 2 a.m. on Monday. If the
competition followed, the change would stick. If the competition
did not respond, the airline would roll its price back by 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Justice Department sued several large airlines,
requiring them to cease such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Online merchants are clearly monitoring one another's prices
today. Go to http://www.dealtime.com and type in the name of a
well-known book. Odds are the the best prices are within a few
cents of one another. This is not just chance.
</P>
<P>
   The usual story of competition has an implicit timing assumption
that buyers move faster than sellers. If a seller cuts its price,
it is rewarded by a flood of buyers before the other sellers can
respond. But if the sellers move faster than the buyers, they can
match one another's price cuts immediately, damping the rewards of
price cutting. Similarly, if a seller raises a price and all other
sellers quickly match it, the seller will not lose customers. When
sellers move faster than buyers, prices tend to drift upward.
</P>
<P>
   If there are lots of competitors, this effect is swamped by the
usual dynamics of competition. The problem is that the cost
structure of online retailing suggests that there are likely to be
only a few big companies in the long run, making implicit collusion
more likely. When Toys ``R'' Us and Amazon.com announced a joint
venture a few weeks ago, Toby Lenk, chief executive of eToys said:
``This is great news for us. Last year we had half a dozen
competitors. Now our two remaining competitors are merging into
one.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are only a few online retail vendors, the real
competition they face will not be from one another, but will be
from offline substitutes _ traditional retailers. As long as this
market remains fragmented, full-fledged retail collusion is
unlikely. Prices will not be as low as they were in the heady days
of penetration pricing, but they will have to be attractive enough
to compete with alternative retail channels.
</P>
<P>
   What about the online business-to-business exchanges? If an
exchange operates in a wholesale market where there are few buyers
and many sellers, the extra flow of price information is likely to
work for the benefit of the buyers, pushing down prices. But in
exchanges in which there are few sellers and many buyers, the
availability of timely price information may well have the opposite
effect, pushing up prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is now trying to set standards of
behavior for online exchanges. The objective is to make sure that
such exchanges foster competition rather than dampen it.

 &HT;    BRITISH LOTTERY OPERATOR'S TIES TO GTECH RESULTS IN LOSS OF
CONTRACT
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British lottery officials Wednesday said they intend to
drop a company associated with GTECH, the world's largest lottery
operator, in favor of a consortium led by Virgin Group tycoon
Richard Branson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island-based GTECH, which has a history of
controversy, operates the lotteries in many U.S. states _ including
Georgia, Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with GTECH's software contributed heavily to the
British Lottery Commission's surprise decision to end its
relationship with Camelot, the English company that has held the
lottery contract since 1994, Commission Chairwoman Helena Shovelton
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Shovelton also expressed reservations because of ``unresolved
concerns about the long-term propriety of the arrangements made
with GTECH, and between GTECH and Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not elaborate, but the commission is investigating
Camelot's handling of a technical problem that caused errors in
thousands of prize payments between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   GTECH, which at the time had a 22 percent stake in Camelot, did
not tell the company about the glitch until earlier this year,
according to British press reports. Camelot could be fined if the
probe reveals breaches in its agreement with the commission. The
results are expected to be made public next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it no longer owns part of Camelot, GTECH remains its
key technical supplier.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal by Branson's People's Lottery consortium also
had problems, Shovelton said they probably could be resolved
through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, who has been eager to win the lottery contract, was
stranded on his Caribbean island by Hurricane Debby and could not
make the announcement. Branson competed with Camelot for the
contract in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Branson accused former GTECH Chairman Guy Snowden of attempting
to bribe Branson into dropping his bid. Branson later sued Snowden
for libel over the affair and won a 1998 judgment that was upheld
on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The British Parliament also reprimanded a former lottery
regulator for accepting hospitality and free trips in a private jet
owned by GTECH.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, questions have been raised here about Camelot's
profits _ which have run more than US$105 million a year _
directors' bonuses and the way money was distributed to good
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, Camelot insists it runs the most
successful lottery in the world. It has sold more than US$40
billion worth of tickets and distributed about US$15 billion to
good causes.
</P>
<P>
   Branson has pledged that he would not profit from the lottery,
saying any surpluses would go to good causes.
</P>
<P>
   Included in his consortium are KPMG Consulting, Energis, Compaq,
Kellogg's, Microsoft and Cisco Systems, who will supply the
technology, and advertising agency J Walter Thompson and AWI _
GTECH's chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury Schweppes PLC, De La Rue PLC and Thomson-CSF unit, Racal
owns Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Both Camelot and People's Lottery had pledged to raise nearly
US$23 billion over the next seven years. Branson also proposed
running two online games and pledged to create 2,500 new
millionaires with his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision caught Camelot by surprise. ``We are
bitterly disappointed and stunned by the news,'' the company said
in a statement that also suggested that the matter may not yet be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   GTECH's activities have been the subjects of investigations in
Georgia and Texas, but neither has revealed any criminal
wrongdoing.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAVERACK, N.Y. _ Lockwood de Forest, a turn-of-the-century
artist and designer who rose to eminence, then sank into obscurity,
is now on the brink of rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan gallery recently featured some of his oil sketches.
A desk embodying his design philosophy is part of an exhibition on
Orientalism at Williams College in Massachusetts. The Indian-style
interiors he championed are being echoed by hip designers like
Muriel Brandolini and Lulu Kwiatkowski. In this Hudson River Valley
village two hours north of New York City, furniture and
architectural elements he produced have been brought together by
the filmmakers Ismail Merchant and James Ivory in what must be his
first one-man design show since the 1893 World's Columbian
Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Scion of a New York clan whose family tree blossoms with myriad
lawyers and the occasional flamboyant _ a great-uncle was the
painter Frederic E. Church, and a great-niece was the Warhol
superstar Edie Sedgwick _ Lockwood de Forest was a pivotal member
of Associated Artists, a short-lived design firm founded by Louis
Comfort Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Its specialty was self-conscious splendor, exotic interiors that
were one part ABC Carpet &AMP; Home, one part ``Arabian Nights.'' Brass
lanterns hung from stenciled ceilings. Persian carpets were flung
over harem-style balustrades. Fireplaces glimmered with Moorish
tiles. Thanks to a woodcarving studio that de Forest discovered in
Ahmadabad, on the Arabian Sea coast of India, his trendy ensembles
for clients like the Baltimore &AMP; Ohio Railroad heiress Mary Garrett
and her lover M. Carey Thomas, a president of Bryn Mawr College,
incorporated exquisite teak furniture and architectural fittings
that resemble petrified lace.
</P>
<P>
   The eight chairs, two tables, chest of drawers, fireplace
surround, two doors, two settees and standing screen in ``Lockwood
de Forest'' at the Merchant and Ivory Foundation exemplify the
top-dollar exoticism that was de Forest's hallmark in the 1880s,
the high point of a fitful career that ended when he died in 1932
at 82. Rendered in cinnamon-colored teak with delicately chiseled
foliate and geometric designs _ there are a couple of cast-iron
firebacks, too _ most of the pieces come from the collection of
David L. Petrovsky, who owns an eponymous antiques shop in nearby
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, Petrovsky gazed wide-eyed at the feet of a
gleaming armchair produced by Indian woodcarvers working under de
Forest's direction. ``Look at those,'' he said. ``They look like
garlic bulbs with toenails.'' Eye-catchingly odd, yes, but no more
so than the bizarre finials higher up: the heads of impassive Hindu
deities surmounted by sawtooth tiaras. The show, which closes Sept.
4, is one of several marking the 10th anniversary of the Merchant
and Ivory Foundation, an arts organization founded by the
Oscar-winning filmmakers. Its headquarters are in red-painted
gristmill buildings that have been turned into exhibition and
performance spaces near their Greek Revival house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a show like this,'' said Ivory, whose latest
film, an adaptation of Henry James' ``Golden Bowl,'' starring Uma
Thurman, will open this fall. ``But a couple of months ago, David
suggested it, and Ismail and I thought, `Why not?' De Forest's work
is very intriguing, and both Ismail and I are fascinated by
everything to do with India, for obvious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood de Forest was not the only American aesthete of his
time who fell under the spell of India, a country that became a
pop-culture influence after Queen Victoria became its empress in
1876. But the largely self-taught artist, designer and architect
was the most passionately pro-India Yankee of his time, the
American equivalent of John Lockwood Kipling, father of the
empire-thumping poet and curator of a museum in the Indian city of
Lahore (now in Pakistan) in the days of the British Raj.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the elder Kipling's scholarship led him to create widely
admired Indian-style rooms _ a dining room at Queen Victoria's
Osborne House on the Isle of Wight and a billiard room for her son
the Duke of Connaught at his country house in Surrey, Bagshot Park,
now the home of Prince Edward _ de Forest's passion for the Mogul
art and architecture of the subcontinent led him to install similar
spaces from Ithaca to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1880s were his glory days,'' said Roberta A. Mayer, an art
historian, who lives in Hopewell, N.J. De Forest's work was
exhibited to acclaim at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in
London in 1886, and at the World's Columbian Exhibition seven years
later, attracting an impressive array of clients: the steel king
Andrew Carnegie, the transportation magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes,
the hotelier Potter Palmer, even Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not have a hand in its design, a stylistically
related desk by Associated Artists is featured in ``Noble Dreams,
Wicked Pleasures: Orientalism in America, 1870-1930,'' an
exhibition that runs through Sept. 4 at the Sterling and Francine
Clark Art Institute at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. Made
of satinwood, brass, pewter and leather, it embodies everything
that Associated Artists and de Forest stood for in the late 19th
century: Eastern exoticism conjured for Western millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   De Forest visited India on his honeymoon in 1879, a nearly
two-year trip that he turned to his economic advantage, keeping his
eye peeled for objects and inspirations that would benefit
Associated Artists. In Ahmadabad, he met Muggunbhai Hutheesing, a
philanthropist whose woodcarving studio would become crucial to de
Forest's career. The studio was only a small component of a family
fortune built on some of India's largest carpet and textile
factories, as well as on opium trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike European Orientalists, many of whom looked upon Asia and
the Middle East with colonialist superiority, de Forest wanted to
help the cause of Indian woodworkers and preserve traditional
Indian arts and crafts, which were being forgotten in the wake of
brightly varnished knockoffs being made in Paris. His equally
enthusiastic wife, Meta, had her couturier transform cheap Indian
cottons into dresses that were the envy of her friends _ until they
learned of the fabrics' ``lowly'' (i.e., non-Western) provenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having committed themselves as to the beauty of the material,
it was difficult for them to crawl out of it with either grace or
success,'' Lockwood de Forest gleefully recalled. ``We had a fine
chance to rub their ignorance in, which we often enjoyed doing.''
</P>
<P>
   By directing Hutheesing's carvers to copy or adapt centuries-old
details from mosques, temples, tombs and mansions _ designs that
were used in de Forest's interiors, furniture and accessories,
including a wall bracket at Olana, the house of Great-Uncle
Frederic _ one small part of India's artistry could continue to
flourish, albeit reinterpreted in costly Western settings.
</P>
<P>
   Part of him had a romantic response to all that beauty, but he
was pragmatic, too, Mayer said: ``He wanted to make his art into a
legitimate profession, a way to create beauty and make money at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, de Forest's Indian experiment appealed to a
fickle audience too conscious of fads to be loyal to his narrow
vision. By the turn of the century, his romantic rooms were passe,
a victim of the Francophile chic popularized by Elsie de Wolfe and
Ogden Codman Jr. By 1908, he had sold his stock of moldings and
furniture to his old friend Tiffany and retired to Santa Barbara,
Calif., where he spent much of his remaining life painting. (His
son, another Lockwood, would become one of the state's great
landscape designers.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not one de Forest interior survives intact, and even
the bits and pieces remaining are not completely appreciated. His
teak room for Andrew Carnegie, for instance, still occupies its
second-floor spot in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the former Carnegie
mansion, though its furniture was sold long ago and its carvings
are obscured under temporary exhibition walls. As for de Forest's
furniture, no one knows precisely how much was produced, a mystery
that deepens when it becomes clear that none was labeled or marked,
thus making it difficult to distinguish it from the often fine
copies produced by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It does show up periodically, often misidentified, at auctions
and other, less likely, places. In 1995, Petrovsky discovered a
seven-piece suite of furniture in a consignment shop in New Canaan,
Conn. He says that Mitchell Wolfson Jr., founder of the Wolfsonian
museum in Miami Beach, recently bought more than 100 pieces of
carved teak, each a different pattern and individually numbered,
apparently a set of samples that the artist used to guide the
Ahmadabad carvers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the uncertainty, some of Lockwood de Forest's magic
lingers. A house he designed in Baltimore is now an Indian
restaurant called the Brass Elephant. His furnishings for Mary
Garrett are scattered throughout several rooms in the Bryn Mawr
alumnae house. As for the brick town house that de Forest built for
himself at 7 E &UR; . &LR;  10th St &UR; . &LR;  between 1886 and 1888, once heralded
as the most Indian house in America, it is now the Bronfman Center
for Jewish Student Life at New York University. Its extraordinary
lacelike interiors have suffered over time, but its teak-bedecked
facade, like that of the elaborate Burmese-style Ava apartments
next door, is splendidly unaltered, an incongruous reminder of a
trendsetter who once reigned in a city that too often forgets.

   When Lily Met Iris
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last fall, I bought some Pardancanda (orchid iris) plants.
They have thrived and are stunningly beautiful, but I can't find
any more. The tags said ``Pardancanda `Dazzler Series' Candylily.''
Are they still available? Can they be divided, and if so, when? Any
information about them would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   A. Pardancanda norrisii is an iris-family flower child: Created
in the 1960s, more colorful than either of its parents, developed
by an avid home gardener named Samuel Norris, who did it all for
love. It took him a great many tries, but he finally mated a hybrid
version of belamcanda, the old-fashioned blackberry lily, which
always has purple-spotted orange flowers, with a lavender-flowered
plant called Iris dichotoma (Pardanthopsis). The offspring had
flowers in a whole paintbox of colors: Pink, purple, yellow,
orange, white and red, many of them spotted or with multicolor
petals.
</P>
<P>
   Like those of belamcanda, pardancanda's flowers last only one
day, but each plant produces lots of them, so the show lasts a
month or more. And you still get the pretty clusters of shiny
fruits that gave blackberry lilies their name.
</P>
<P>
   Pardancandas do best in bright sunshine, enjoy fairly heavy
feeding and will, where happy, gradually form large clumps. These
can be divided in late summer, after the foliage has started to
turn yellow, or in early spring before the new growth starts.
</P>
<P>
   You can also raise new P. norrisii plants from seed, and get all
sorts of interesting surprises. Dazzler, a hybrid available only as
plants, is uniformly 15 to 18 inches tall, with flowers that start
and stop at more or less the same time. Seed-grown pardancandas
will vary from 10 inches to 3 feet, and they will bloom over a
longer season because they won't all be ready at once.
</P>
<P>
   P. norrisii seed is available from Park Seed, 1 Parkton Ave.,
Greenwood, SC 29647; (800) 845-3369; free catalog. Dazzler plants
are produced by a wholesale nursery called Bluebird. Retailers may
be found at its Web site, www.bluebirdnursery.com, or by mail from
P.O. Box 460, Clarkson, Neb. 68629.
</P>
<P>
   How Not to Be Bored
</P>
<P>
   Q. The bulbs of my iris are being eaten by fat, white grubs over
1 inch long. Is there anything I can do, or should I replace the
plants?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a lot that you can do, and if you don't do it,
there's no point in replacing the plants. The grubs are iris
borers, a special bane of bearded iris. They will invade in force
unless you take action.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't just eat. Sooner or later, they will open the way
for soft rot, a foul-smelling bacterial infection, which kills more
plants than borers do.
</P>
<P>
   Start by digging up the rhizomes and cutting out the borers.
Discard badly damaged rhizomes. Before replanting the ones that are
left, cut back leaf fans to 3 inches. Rake the soil to remove those
borers that have left the plants to pupate in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After pupating, the grubs' next move is to emerge in autumn as
nondescript brown moths. They lay their eggs in dead iris leaves
and other debris. So your next move is to wait until hard frost
kills the moths, then remove every scrap of material that might
harbor eggs.
</P>
<P>
   You will miss some, no matter what. In spring, they will hatch
into tiny larvae, climb up the new iris leaves, then eat their way
down toward the rhizomes from inside the leaf tissue. Watch for
ragged edges, browning tips and little tunnels. Squeeze firmly at
the lower end of the tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts advise killing borers biologically (with the
microscopic worms called beneficial nematodes) or chemically (with
strong systemic insecticides), but both of these methods require
near-perfect timing and ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the best control is the simplest, cheapest and
least toxic: Just clean up.
</P>
<P>

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES NEW CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(This story does not carry a byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ President Abdurrahman Wahid unveiled a
revamped Cabinet Wednesday in a move to revitalize his faltering
administration and tackle acute social and economic woes that are
threatening to tear Indonesia apart.
</P>
<P>
   The new lineup had been widely anticipated since Wahid promised
an angry national assembly two weeks ago that he would make
significant changes to improve his erratic performance and
leadership style _ issues that had concerned some legislators so
much that they had demanded that he step down.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid announced that he was cutting his Cabinet to 26 ministers
from 35, and that the group would include eight new people. Vice
President Megawati Sukarnoputri will supervise the new team and run
the day-to-day business of the government, a move that legislators
had also demanded. Wahid said earlier that he wanted to concentrate
on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in October 1999, Wahid has been criticized
for failing to turn around Indonesia's worst economic slide in
decades. He was also blamed for failing to end corruption within
his government, stop a bloody religious war in the eastern Maluku
islands and halt separatist movements in far-flung provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Wahid said, was the larger Cabinet, which
had been comprised of politicians from main factions of the
People's Consultative Assembly, which put him into power. He said
that the setup had immediately created disunity as political
rivalries and self interests paralyzed the government.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said during brief comments to reporters Wednesday that his
new team was mainly composed of professionals who would concentrate
on results, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My consideration was that they must be experts in their
fields,'' he said. ``I know them one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the appointments of Rizal Ramli, the head of Bulog,
Indonesia's national food distribution agency, and Priyadi Prapto
Suharso, a banker, to run Wahid's economic team raised concern
among some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Wahid had nominated the new finance minister
to run a state-owned bank, but he was ruled ineligible because of
his earlier involvement with a bank that had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid defended his selections, saying, ``I know exactly about
Priyadi because I have had observations about him for 16 years, not
only now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president did not re-hire his economic minister, Kwik Kian
Gie, who resigned last week, or the finance minister, Bambang
Sudibyo. He did name Soesilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the current mines
and energy minister, to the coveted post of coordinating minister
for political and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Key Cabinet members including Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab, a
confidant of Wahid's, and Attorney General Marzuki Darusman kept
their jobs, but several others were not retained as Wahid merged
some portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Hasballah M. Saad, believed to be the first-ever human rights
minister of a sovereign nation, and Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono were among a handful of ministers who were ousted.

A HOUSE TRANSFORMS ITSELF, AND A FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SYDNEY LEBLANC    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY CENTER, Calif. _ If you were to choose a place to
construct a high-concept vacation house, it would probably not be
Valley Center.
</P>
<P>
   This remote desert hamlet, beautiful though it is, seems more
suited to the citrus groves, avocado orchards and ostrich ranches
that cover its rolling hills. Two and a half hours south of Los
Angeles, it's a world away from that capital of architectural
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   But here on a Valley Center hilltop sits a brazenly modern
structure with metal-wrapped walls cantilevered over a luxuriant
orange orchard. Mysteriously ambiguous, it could be an exotic
construction trailer _ or a miniature Getty Museum poised against
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my father was shocked by the new architecture he's never
said so,'' Penny Cuff McNulty said of the ingenious house that
provides new horizons for three generations of her family.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago the house on this hill was a typical ranch
belonging to her father, Charles Cuff, now 85. It went up in flames
in a raging wildfire, and in three hours the Cuffs lost a home and
the heart of the family's century-old citrus-growing operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuffs felt they had to rebuild in the same place to
recapture a vital touchstone. But the family itself had changed.
Cuff was semiretired in Los Angeles; his three daughters had
married, moved away and had children, ranging in age from 7 to 30.
Making Valley Center a getaway offered a saving grace, and a hub
where the far-flung clan could reconnect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family became an unwitting client,'' explained Kevin Daly,
43, a Santa Monica architect who is married to Cuff's daughter Dana
Cuff. The residence he designed with his partner, Christopher
Genik, has introduced startling new ideas into a traditional
landscape. Perforated aluminum screens form a protective shell over
long glass walls. These screens are architecture in action. Some
glide side to side like shiny bifold doors. Others are motorized to
move up and down with the push of a button. Set in their
stop-action positions, they resemble shimmering silver visors
cocked at jaunty angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they came to the project so unexpectedly, they had no
preconceptions about what it should be,'' Daly said. ``But first,
we had to figure out what had been lost.'' To Cuff, the loss seemed
devastating. ``I lost everything _ pictures, piano, antiques all
went up in smoke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers naturally had their ideas. A replacement-cost
settlement, the family learned, meant replicating the old ranch
house, at $120 a foot. But the architects of the family (Dana Cuff
is a professor in the architecture department at UCLA) eventually
wooed them with a different design within the replacement-cost
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my father-in-law asked was that we keep it flat,'' Daly
said. ``And I'm sure he would have been just as happy if we had
come up with an adobe-style house with a red tile roof, like those
you see all over Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spanish Mission was not Daly, Genik's hidden agenda. Daly
worked in Frank Gehry's office before joining forces 11 years ago
with Genik, a former Rice University classmate.
</P>
<P>
   The partners are best known for designing simple, boxlike
buildings that are wrapped in screens and layers to alter the
viewers' perception of structure and space.
</P>
<P>
   Their approach connects them with larger forces sweeping the
international architectural scene. Closely watched trendsetters
like the Swiss team of Herzog &AMP; de Meuron and the French architect
Jean Nouvel have become famous for creating semitransparent facades
that change the nature of walls, selectively reveal the interiors,
manipulate light and evoke mystery, and no small point, for making
beautiful buildings that delight the senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Charlie that if we were going to change anything, we
might as well change everything,'' Daly recalled. ``Fortunately, he
was willing to suspend disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   In contemplating the new design, the architects faced a creative
contradiction. The 3,000-square-foot house had to be flexible
enough to accommodate three generations of Cuff family members,
including spouses, children and grandchildren. They might visit at
any time and in any combination and wanted a place that was always
vacation-ready.
</P>
<P>
   But a house that was too open would not be secure, and security
_ especially fire protection _ was a vital concern for the family,
whose memories of the big fire lingered.
</P>
<P>
   The phoenix, it seemed, would have to have a split personality:
airy and open one moment, tough as nails the next. Surprisingly,
the fire issue became the catalyst for the new design.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, Genik's solution could be called an open-and-shut vacation
house, a Transformer-like structure that springs to life in an
instant, then closes completely.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation is accomplished with large moving parts:
perforated screens on the central living and dining area move up
and down. Screens along the two bedroom wings, which form a U
around the courtyard, are manual and slide side to side with a
twist of the wrist. All of them can be adjusted through the day in
accordance with the sun's movement, or to allow a little siesta at
any time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so easy the kids can do it,'' Dana Cuff said. When
it's time to leave, the screens shift into reverse, restoring the
protective shell that helps provide peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The unique silver screens were inspired by two ordinary building
elements _ the overhead garage door and the sliding bifold door.
These doors could be made to pass the architects' personal
ingenuity test, that every element they designed should accomplish
more than one thing. Their screen doors provide security, shade,
interior light control and stunning visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   When the screen bifold doors on the courtyard-side bedroom wings
are opened, they resemble great books wrapped in shiny metal
jackets. Most striking are the massive vertical screens protecting
the living and dining area, which occupies the taller, central part
of the U. Deployed three across on the eastern and western
exposures, these monumental 10-foot-by-24-foot screens hang from
cross-braced steel tracks, extensions of the interior ceiling's
I-beams. Each screen is powered by a small motor that tilts it up
and out, angled away from the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those living room doors looked so enormous at first,'' Dana
Cuff exclaimed at the memory. ``It was a relief to find that they
were actually under our control.''
</P>
<P>
   The silvery sunscreens work wonders with the desert light, and
it's the mutable visual perception, the architects say, that is
their favorite feature of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Sunlight filters softly in through the thousands of tiny
perforations, charging up the atmosphere; you can almost put your
finger on it, like phosphorescence. Looking out through the
screens, the dazzling desert light becomes slightly veiled. ``It's
like using camera apertures to step down the light,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Shades in summer, in winter they bounce light back into the
interior. In a sunset, the house looks radiant with the pink, blue,
purple and gold desert light alternately washing over its silver
surfaces. Later, it glows like a lantern in the night.
</P>
<P>
   The screens, with designed-in breathability, Genik said, make
the house habitable in the desert and help with cross-ventilation.
All the exterior surfaces reflect sunlight, and the siting captures
cooling breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is a simple plan and desert-spare decoration. The
main living and dining area floats freely between two long glass
walls, with a fireplace to anchor the space and provide seismic
stability. An open kitchen is separated from the space by an island
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to cook,'' said Penny Cuff McNulty, who visits from
her home near Washington. ``Sometimes, we have four cooks in the
kitchen, and it always works.''
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom wings are also transformable. Thanks again to
sliding doors, there can be from four to seven bedrooms, sleeping
as many as 14 people. These sleeping alcoves are arrayed single
file, like Pullman cars. Birch plywood sliding doors close them off
for sleeping or open them to the courtyard's glass walls; other
sliding doors, between rooms, allow suitelike spaces for parents
with children. The end bedrooms in each wing are private. Some of
these rooms have tiny desks for adults to work and for children to
play with their computers.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of artwork, shots of color enliven the cool,
monochromatic shell. Bedroom doors and concrete floors are painted
shades of chartreuse, purple, blue and yellow. Kilim rugs brighten
bare concrete floors. Dining chairs are candy-coated colors.
Bathrooms, tiled in squares of Mexican glass, are vibrant aqua or
sapphire. Window frames in the bedroom wings are painted canary
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The architects' open design plays to the big-sky landscape.
Oriented westward, the twin wings of the house frame a long view of
the Pacific Ocean, 20 miles away. To the east, Palomar Mountain
rises behind the house. From almost any spot it's easy to feel on
top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Donald Judd sculpture placed in the desert,'' said
Cameron Armstrong, a Houston architect who clads his houses in
corrugated metal. ``It's minimal without being minimalist. You're
left alone with the essentials of the place: earth, water, light
and sky. There's the potential for a clean moment here.''
</P>
<P>
   Open and relaxed as it is, the Cuffs' house attempts to erect a
fortress against fire. The aluminum screens, while not fireproof,
are fire resistant. They prevent ignition that could be caused by
sparks or flying embers piercing the interior. Every exposed
surface, including outer bedroom walls of corrugated concrete
board, is made of a noncombustible material.
</P>
<P>
   If a fire should start, there is a large-radius rooftop
sprinkler system that drenches the surrounding landscape. The
swimming pool has a special pump and an independent generator so
that its water can be diverted for firefighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to forget how savage the fire was,'' Daly said.
Still, the rebuilding process was restorative. ``The whole family
lost a house and now the whole family has built it back,'' said
Cuff, who visits weekly from Los Angeles. ``It has bound us
together in a new way.'' Now, when family members exchange gifts,
they're usually presents for the place they've all come to share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to characterize a vacation house as something
other than a luxury, a bauble,'' Kevin Daly concluded. ``But this
house is different.The entire family had an emotional tie to the
ranch. In this case, it's all about being there.''

THE OPEN SOURCE WAR: WHOSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS IT, ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 Peter Wayner is the author of a new book on the open source world
entitled _  
 ``Free for All: How Linux and the Free Software Movement Undercut
the High-Tech Titans'' (HarperBusiness).  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a war going on. It isn't between ethnic groups,
provinces, religions or nations. It is between nimble people who
want to think for themselves and big dinosaurs of corporations that
want to keep the upstarts penned up and docile.
</P>
<P>
   This is the war of Open Source, and it is being fought in
conference rooms, law offices, hacker redoubts and university
dormitory rooms and in the hearts of millions of people surfing the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are the big conglomerates that sell gadgets, music,
toys, movies, text, cars and tools to the world. They're
discovering that intellectual property laws covering trademarks,
patents and copyrights can be potent tools to block criticism and
keep consumers on a very short leash. All it takes is a SWAT team
of well-financed lawyers to stomp out opposition.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are the folks who think that they actually own
what they purchase. They may be car buffs who want to rebore their
engine blocks, musicians who want to make copies of tunes to play
in their cars or computer owners who want to fix nasty bugs. They
all want to get at the guts of the technology because that's where
the power is.
</P>
<P>
   In computer terminology, they want to tinker with the source
code, the instructions for the computer that are understandable by
a programmer. If you have access to the source, you can change the
way the machine behaves. Computer programmers routinely adopt the
voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi from ``Star Wars'' and intone, ``Use the
source, Luke.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, getting at the source of one thing or another was
one of the hallmarks of the American can-do spirit. The movie
studios routinely celebrated the gritty mechanic or lowly grunt
soldier who saved the day with a wrench and an intuitive feel about
how machines work. In the past, you were supposed to understand how
machines did their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that kind of curiosity makes you a hacker. The big movie
and music conglomerates want to portray the meddling kids who
fiddle with DVD players as pirates who are just one click away from
breaking into the Pentagon and launching nuclear missiles. To the
conglomerates, poking around inside a gadget is just another form
of theft.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Motion Picture Association of America and major
movie studios, for instance, have recently been scouring the Net,
looking for copies of a program for unlocking DVD movies called
DeCSS. They aren't just suing people who use the program to sell
bootleg copies _ you don't need DeCSS to do that. They want to
stomp out the knowledge of how the program works, and they want to
make sure that no one on the Net even links to the software.
</P>
<P>
   The people making the software available contend that they're
not pirating movies but are simply arranging to play DVD movies on
their Linux machines. They're using the source code in much the
same way that Bo and Luke Duke welded a few enhancements to their
car in the television show ``The Dukes of Hazzard.''
</P>
<P>
   This desire for control of intellectual property has been
inspired in part by the software industry. Most people who buy a
piece of software would be stunned to learn that they don't own
that software that cost $100 _ they've just licensed it.
</P>
<P>
   These licenses often include strict prohibitions on taking the
software apart, or reverse-engineering it. If you want to customize
the software or find a way to fix the bugs, you're out of luck. If
the software runs slightly differently on your computer, you can't
do any reverse-engineering to fix it. The companies adopt the rule:
``Thou shall not know the source.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most infamous license restrictions came attached to
Microsoft Agent, a product that helped programmers create little
animated helpers on the screen. Buried in the click-wrapped license
is a phrase that prohibits anyone working with the product from
using ``the Character Animation Data and Image Files to disparage
Microsoft, its products or services.'' Luckily, I'm not using
Microsoft's tools to write this.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest proposal from the World Intellectual Property
Organization, an arm of the United Nations, aims to let big
corporations protect the facts in their databases. If all goes
according to the group's plans, facts will pass out of the public
domain when a corporation collects them. Once a company creates a
database, it'll be able to stop others from copying the facts in
the database without a license. It will own those facts.
</P>
<P>
   While that may protect the big databases of information, it will
also constrain the little ones. Facts will go from being something
that is owned by everyone to something that can be herded and owned
by a single person or company.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that at least in the software world, the battle
against intellectual property constraints is going surprisingly
well. In the last 15 years, the open-source software world has
produced a collection of operating systems, applications and tools
that is often better than most of the commercial systems out there.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of the Macintosh OS, for instance, is based
in large part on open-source operating systems like FreeBSD and
NetBSD. Computers based on GNU software (like Unix, but free) Linux
or FreeBSD are used to run more than half of the sites on the Web,
and they're found in increasing numbers in offices around the
world. Even new appliances like the TiVo digital video recorders
are based on Linux.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Open-source developers share all of their source code in the
hopes that others will use it, improve it and perhaps contribute
enhancements to the rest of the world. The licenses that control
the software make no attempt to stop people from sharing; in fact,
they encourage it. There are no thefts of information, and there is
no basis for any lawsuits like the one aimed at Napster. The
authors want you to enjoy the software and pass it on.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are surprised that the world of open-source code
exists at all. How do programmers eat if they don't sell their
software? In most cases, they are paid for the work their software
performs rather than for the software itself. Many are programmers
who use the software for their projects. The Apache Web server, for
instance, is produced by a team of people who design Web sites.
They charge for the service and share the basic software. In other
cases, charging for the software is more trouble than its worth.
</P>
<P>
   Many open-source teams achieved success before the influx of
capital and hype. They relied on the freedom to cooperate, and
that's often much more valuable. The forces of openness have made
surprising strides in the last 10 years. The work of a bunch of
hobbyists, teen-agers and programmers working in their spare time
now often eclipses the work of the biggest companies and their
proprietary software. IBM tried for years to dethrone Microsoft
with its OS/2 operating system. Now the company is backing Linux.
</P>
<P>
   This success scares the dinosaur companies that rely upon
intellectual property laws to protect their earnings. If they can't
deliver the best solutions to the people themselves, they're
reaching to the courts to ensure that no one will supplant them.
The lawsuit against the DVD-playing program, for instance, will do
more to stop new companies that want to play legitimately purchased
DVD movies than pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits against Napster may be aimed at piracy, but they
could also stomp out small record labels and unsigned artists who
want their music to float freely through the world of Napster. But
the big labels want to shut down the entire service. If the current
laws are not strong enough, they want new laws that will stop
people from making some kinds of open technology. They imagine a
world where technology will control and limit people instead of
liberating them.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, new technologies that appear to undermine old
business models have not been as dangerous as they seemed at first.
The photocopier was supposed to destroy the market for books, but
now bookstores are bigger than before. The VCR was supposed to
destroy network television, but now we have more networks than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Gutenberg replaced the monks in the scriptorium, the
new technology for copying has made artists and the companies that
employ them richer than ever. The notion of opening the source code
to the world is just part of that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have tried to use legal mechanisms to keep their
customers under tight rein, but that has never succeeded. If
anything, innovation stagnated and the industries declined.
Reverse-engineering and the old greasy-knuckled can-do spirit are
an important part of guaranteeing competition and protecting the
consumer. Imagine if Ralph Nader or Rachel Carson had been
hamstrung by the new rules on intellectual property? Many of the
car companies now actively encourage the aftermarket, which
provides both cool performance enchancers like superchargers and
safety devices like infant seats.
</P>
<P>
   The open-source war is not going to be easy for society. The
intellectual property laws do help protect creators and their
innovations, and corporations instinctively grab as much power as
they can get. But if the strength of these laws grows and the teams
of lawyers that enforce them become more powerful, society will
become much poorer.

 &HT;    Greenville residents aid in effort to save animals threatened by
wildfires
 &HT;    By Cynthia Kopkowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. - Wildfires gobbling up land out west this
summer are leaving many farm animals and family pets in danger.
</P>
<P>
   With the memory of animal rescues during Hurricane Floyd still
fresh in their minds, two Greenville residents packed their bags to
lend a hand in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Scott and Cora Tyson joined volunteers from around the
country working with the Emergency Animal Rescue Service in
Hamilton, Mont., 25 miles away from the edge of the fires. EARS is
the rescue division of the California-based United Animal Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The team began its efforts Aug. 16 at fairgrounds in one of the
state's western border counties. Firefighters from Winterville,
Greenville, Kinston and Trenton also arrived in Hamilton on Sunday
to battle the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   EARS volunteers are working with 325 animals that were brought
to the facility by families forced to evacuate. Animals brought to
the shelter are assigned a number and photo ID to ensure easy
retrieval by their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was on the other side of the animal rescue fence last
year, when EARS volunteers rescued his two dogs trapped at his
family's flooded Belvoir home. When he saw the Montana fires
getting worse, Scott got in his car and drove 2,545 miles to work
at the makeshift menagerie.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived Monday morning after a 48-hour trip that carried him
past charred fields and was hindered by roads closed due to the
fire. First on his list in Hamilton was a tour of the fairgrounds
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a zoo here now,'' Scott said. ``That's what
it looks like at least, but it's quiet. Right now I'm standing in
front of where all the animals are kept, and it's very full.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Montana, Scott will sleep in a tent neighboring 37
horses, 47 goats, one llama, four alpacas, 18 cows, one wolf, 120
chickens, one bull and 32 dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   During long work days, he and other volunteers will do ``what
their owners normally would do,'' he said, including feeding and
nursing the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stranger sights Scott and Tyson witnessed at the
camp included a dog taking cough medicine for a smoke-induced sore
throat and calves drinking milk from goats standing on top of a
table.
</P>
<P>
   Along with veterinarians, the volunteers are working with a
rabbit with a broken leg, an injured cat and a badly burned bull
that was a nearby resident's pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a job to do and all of them here with EARS know
what to do,'' Scott said. ``And just like in Greenville they have
people that walked in to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people out here that care about the
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the fires sweeping through nearby counties and states,
Scott said a low gray ceiling of smoke is a choking reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is smoke all around; you can't turn in any direction and
not see it,'' he said. ``I've never seen anything like this. We're
in the middle of a bunch of mountains, but you can't even tell
they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott is working side by side with fellow Greenville resident
Tyson, the Pitt County coordinator for EARS. She flew to Montana
after the group's national director requested help.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is adapting to a schedule dictated by Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winds can shift quickly, so when an evacuation order gets put
out people will bring animals in at all hours, many around
midnight,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   For the animal rescuers, days ending at midnight usually begin
before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get woken up about 6 in the morning by the rooster,'' Tyson
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day for Tyson and other volunteers consists of three
hours of morning animal feeding and cage cleaning. The group grabs
a quick breakfast and then meets with the U.S. Forestry Service
officials for an update on evacuation orders and the fires' status.
</P>
<P>
   After a short afternoon break the whole process begins again,
Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said she has to be back in Greenville by Sept. 1 but will
stay until that time if she is needed.

 &HT;    Infrequent phone calls are only link to husbands battling blazes
 &HT;    By Cynthia Kopkowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. - Some Pitt County residents are keeping a
closer eye on wildfires out west than most. That's because their
family members are battling the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Derrick Moore and Tom Harris, two of 231
firefighters from North Carolina that have gone to the fires since
the end of June, are keeping an eye on the situation. A team of 57
firefighters from 10 area counties, including Pitt, Beaufort,
Martin and Greene, traveled west in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic phone calls and news reports provide Suzanne Moore with
a tentative link to her husband, a North Carolina Forestry Service
assistant ranger who is fighting fires in Idaho. She has seen her
husband only four days in the past month, in between his trip to
Colorado at the end of July and his Aug. 13 flight to Pocatello,
Idaho. She expects him to return next week.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting and watching are roles familiar to Moore, whose husband
fought fires in Florida and Montana in 1998 and 1999 and did rescue
work in Belvoir during Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   When an early morning call came from the state's forestry
service to the Moore's house on July 24, Derrick was packed and
ready to go. He passed a physical and skill tests at the beginning
of the year to become eligible for volunteer wildfire duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rough, but I know it's something that he has wanted to do
since he joined the forestry service,'' said Suzanne, a paralegal.
``And they really need help out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from North Carolina sent west are working under the
direction of the U.S. Forestry Service, said John Shepherd, a
section chief with the state forestry office's Raleigh
headquarters. A group of about 20 North Carolina firefighters is on
standby to head to the fires this week, Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 25-year veteran of the forestry service, is fighting
fires near the Bitterroot River in southwestern Montana. His calls
home have been limited due to few phones and long work days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is, no news is normally good news,'' said
Harris' wife, Darlene, who last talked to him Sunday. ``I've really
become accustomed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harris' have been married 26 years and managed to celebrate
their anniversary Thursday before Tom left for Montana. Darlene
watched her husband fight fires in California in the 1970s, went
eight days without seeing him during Hurricane Floyd and spent
several weeks alone while he battled blazes in Florida this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene, an employee with the U.S. Bankruptcy Office in
Greenville, even takes on the challenge of helping her husband get
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he gets the call, it's a mad dash to help him get packed
and ready,'' she said. ``This time I had to get a pup tent, a
sleeping bag and 14 days worth of clothes in one suitcase. That's
not easy _ it's a lot of smushing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent phone call Darlene got from her husband was
Tuesday morning from the side of a mountain in Idaho. He was on one
of his five-minute breaks in what he told her were 12- or 16-hour
days trying to uncover hot spots and build fire-slowing fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phone calls are very important,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But long days and a three-hour time difference means those calls
may come late at night just before Tom crawls into his tent, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some mornings they're up by 4:30, on the mountain at 6 and not
back at camp until 9,'' Suzanne said. ``He eats, takes a quick
shower and then calls quickly to say, `This is where I'm at, this
is what's going on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're all tired,'' Suzanne said, ``but they realize
that they're there for a good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the necessity of her husband's work doesn't always
make his absence easier, Darlene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companionship is what I miss the most,'' she said. ``We just
purchased a place on the (Pamlico) river. Last time I talked to him
he asked why I wasn't up there when he called and I said, `It's not
any fun,''' without him.
</P>
<P>
   For Suzanne, waiting for her husband means focusing on work,
singing with the church choir, eating dinner with neighbors and
taking care of the couple's dog, Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the long-distance relationships is fear, both wives
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not nervous,'' Suzanne said of her husband, a
four-year veteran of the forest service. ``He's got a very good
head on his shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, descriptions of the wildfires in newspapers and on
television are supplemented by their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne said the photos from Derrick's first trip to Mesa Verde,
Colo., put the images of burned trees and fields in the palm of her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing her husband's stories about the fires reinforced
Darlene's commitment to supporting his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes a lot of pride in what he's doing; it's a calling to
him,'' she said. ``I'm pretty independent, and that allows him to
keep doing what he needs to do.''

ATTACKS PROMPT UNITED NATIONS TO SUSPEND RELIEF WORK IN WEST
TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
Wednesday that all aid operations in West Timor have been suspended
following the severe beating of three relief workers by
pro-Indonesia militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   When the attack took place on Tuesday, the three workers were
distributing plastic sheeting to East Timorese refugees in West
Timor, which is still ruled by Indonesia. All three were assaulted
with machetes, clubs and stones, and one worker had his head held
under water in a rice field until he choked and nearly drowned,
officials in Geneva said. All suffered severe injuries, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soren Jessen-Petersen, the assistant high commissioner, accused
the Indonesian government of allowing the pro-Indonesia militiamen,
at least some of whom are thought to be backed by the Indonesian
military, to behave with impunity, making ``a mockery of statements
by responsible officials in Jakarta guaranteeing security for aid
workers and refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that Indonesian military units in the area
failed to respond to calls for help during the attack, at
Kefamenanu, about 130 miles from Kupang, the capital of West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   There have now been more than 100 cases of assaults on aid
workers in the year since the East Timorese voted for independence
from Indonesia and many fled or were driven from their homes in the
militia-led violence that ensued. Officials say that Tuesday's
attacks may have been the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was sending a senior refugee official to West
Timor to investigate the attack, the refugee commissioner's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 125,000 East Timorese remain in West Timor. The United
Nations has been trying to register them to determine how many want
to stay on Indonesian territory and how many want to return to
their homes. Nearly 170,000 East Timorese have already returned to
their homeland to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government periodically announces that it will
close all the refugee camps in West Timor and resettle some of the
East Timorese in other parts of Indonesia if they want to stay in
the country, but there has been no action. An Indonesian official
in Dili, the East Timorese capital, on Wednesday promised to close
down refugee camps in West Timor in three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency has repeatedly asked that the militiamen
be removed from the camps and not be allowed to intimidate
refugees. Many of the remaining displaced East Timorese are thought
to be afraid to voice their wishes to return home for fear of
attack by the roving militia groups.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drier and slightly cooler air will circulate from the Great
Lakes into New England on Thursday as a cold front pushes off the
northeast coast. However, clouds and showers will persist in Maine,
and the sky will clear slowly along the New England coast. The
leading edge of this Canadian-born air will reach into the Middle
Atlantic states, where thundershowers will erupt along a cold
front.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry weather will dominate the South under hazy sunshine.
Afternoon storms will develop near the central and western Gulf
Coast as sea breezes push farther inland. Showers and a few
thunderstorms are expected in the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The center of a very hot air mass will be over the Oklahoma
panhandle. Most of the upper Plains will be hotter and more humid.
The flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the Southwest
will bring widespread thundershowers from the mountains of Arizona
to western Wyoming.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SPUTTERING STORMS
</P>
<P>
   Warm, moist air rising from near the ocean's surface is the
lifeblood of hurricanes. On Wednesday, two Atlantic hurricanes were
deprived of their essential fuel. Once-mighty Hurricane Alberto
dissipated over the cold waters of the North Atlantic, having
become the third longest tropical storm recorded in the Atlantic.
Meanwhile, Hurricane Debby weakened to a tropical storm as dry air
descending from the mountains of Hispaniola was drawn into the
circulation of the storm.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Entering the Florida battleground
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Already peppering the state with new campaign ads, the
presidential candidates are making live appearances in south
Florida this week. First was a trip today to Kings Point, a largely
Jewish and politically active condominium community between Fort
Lauderdale and Boca Raton, by Al Gore and Joe Lieberman. After
that, they were attending a fund-raiser for the Democratic Party at
a private home in Fort Lauderdale. The Democrats will be followed
by George W. Bush, set to campaign Thursday and Friday in
Miami-Dade County. It will be the first visit for both campaigns
since the conventions. Florida, with 25 electoral votes, could go
either way this year.
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION, AND SOME FUND-RAISING
</P>
<P>
   Mixing fund-raising with photo opportunities, Dick Cheney was
continuing his Southern California swing today in Bakersfield and
Santa Barbara. The tour is part of a campaign to promote George W.
Bush's education message of accountability and high standards
across the nation. The centerpiece of his public appearances today
was a leadership forum with Junior ROTC students at Bakersfield
High School. After that, he was going to the opening of a GOP
headquarters in Kern County, then to Santa Barbara for a
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   JUST TAKE HER HAND AND FOLLOW ALONG
</P>
<P>
   When Dick Cheney went to an elementary school in Redlands,
Calif., to discuss education policies, he brought along a secret
campaign weapon: his wife, Lynne. Her role became clear almost the
moment they arrived. It was she who gamely worked the crowd of
fourth-graders as she and her husband toured a computer laboratory
in front of the cameras. The Republican vice presidential
candidate, meanwhile, stood quietly in the center of the room, his
hands in the pockets of his pinstripe suit, smiling. His brand of
small talk was with teacher Viola Perez, asking her about the
federal Title I program for disadvantaged students and training for
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATES IN THE TALKING STAGE
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of the Bush and Gore campaigns have begun tentative
negotiations on debates. Chris Lehane, spokesman for Al Gore, said
the campaign chairman, William Daley, had spoken with Donald Evans,
an oil entrepreneur and longtime friend of George W. Bush. Bush has
said he's willing to debate Gore three times, but has not accepted
the dates, sites or formats of the October events proposed by the
bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Gore's aides have
said he will accept those debate invitations as well as numerous
others.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIFYING UTILITY RATE HIKES
</P>
<P>
   Calling on citizens to fight corporate dominance of the country,
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader advised Californians to take
regulatory control of their state's electricity industry and demand
their money back. Nader called on the state Legislature and Gov.
Gray Davis to pass a rate rollback law that doesn't include a
balloon payment to compensate utilities for the money they would
lose during a rate decrease. In San Diego, the first city in
California to feel the effects of subjecting customers to free
market prices for electricity, rates have almost quadrupled in the
last two months. Today, Nader was taking his campaign north to
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   PLAY US A SAD POLITICAL SONG
</P>
<P>
   Some country music stars aren't standing by Al Gore because he's
from Tennessee. Some of Nashville's biggest acts _ Brooks &AMP; Dunn,
Wynonna Judd, Hank Williams Jr., Loretta Lynn, Travis Tritt, Lorrie
Morgan and the Oak Ridge Boys _ are lining up with Texan George W.
Bush. But Gore, whose family farm is 50 miles east of Music City,
isn't without down-home support. He's got Pam Tillis, Mary Chapin
Carpenter, Kathy Mattea, John Michael Montgomery, Ricky Van Shelton
and Marty Stuart on his side. Representatives for Faith Hill and
Tim McGraw, Garth Brooks and the Dixie Chicks _ some of the
industry's chartbusters _ say they're too busy with their careers
to choose sides.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY FEUD GOES TO COURT
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Pat Buchanan launched a suit in federal court in
Virginia against rival Reform Party presidential candidate John
Hagelin, seeking to bar him from referring to himself as the
party's nominee. A hearing for a temporary restraining order has
been set for Aug. 30 before U.S. District Judge Norman Moon. Each
candidate claimed the Reform mantle this month at the party's
convention, a raucous gathering that ended with supporters of each
naming him as the nominee. At stake is $12.6 million in federal
matching funds for the real candidate.
</P>
<P>
   OR, THEY COULD FLIP A COIN
</P>
<P>
   While opposing Reform Party factions fight over who is the
party's true presidential nominee, Montana Secretary of State Mike
Cooney will use a lottery to settle the issue for his state's
general election ballot. A drawing will be conducted Thursday to
determine whether Pat Buchanan or John Hagelin will be listed as
the Reform candidate in November. Cooney said that process is
dictated by state law when a party's choice of nominee is unclear.
He added, however, that his office would have to abide by any court
order, regardless of the outcome of the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   TIPTOE THROUGH THE TWO LIPS
</P>
<P>
   Sooner esident pro tem Yusuf Salaam, are the key. Smitherman
says he'll have to receive at least 400 of Salaam's votes on Sept.
12 to have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA OK FOR INCUMBENTS
</P>
<P>
   A car salesman who compares representing voters to providing
good customer service will lead Republican efforts to keep a House
seat in eastern Oklahoma. Andy Ewing, retiring Rep. Tom Coburn's
hand-picked successor, beat six other GOP candidates in a primary
in a district where Republicans are outnumbered 5-to-2. Democrats
sent two candidates _ state Rep. Bill Settle and James ``Jim Bob''
Wilson, who campaigns on the fact he is not a lawyer _ to a Sept.
19 runoff. Reps. J.C. Watts, Ernest Istook and Steve Largent easily
defeated inexperienced and underfunded GOP challengers. But each
faces opposition in November.
</P>
<P>
   SPARSELY POPULATED PRIMARIES
</P>
<P>
   Besides Oklahoma, there were primaries in two other states.
Wyoming's first-term GOP Sen. Craig Thomas faced no primary
opposition, and mine worker Mel Logan beat a retired businessman
for the Democratic nomination to challenge Thomas in the fall.
Three-term Rep. Barbara Cubin easily won her nomination against two
poorly funded fellow Republican challengers. She will face office
clerk Michael Green, who won the Democratic nomination. In Alaska,
the state's lone House member, GOP Rep. Don Young, had no
challengers for his party's nomination. He has represented the
state since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the legacy of the suffragists at every turn, Hillary
Clinton sought to portray herself as a champion of women and
working families and to bolster her support in Rochester, N.Y.,
where Susan B. Anthony once fought for the right to vote. Clinton
toured Anthony's red-brick home, boasted of her own efforts to
promote women's issues like breast cancer and child care, and even
appeared with Ruth Dyk, 99, who once marched alongside the
suffragists and likened Clinton to them. ``If I've learned one
thing, it's this: New York needs a woman's touch,'' said Dyk.

   DEMOCRATS' ADS FADE TO BLACK
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Republican threats, television stations in two
congressional districts have pulled Democratic attack ads on the
grounds that they distorted the GOP candidates' voting records.
Both the cable company Comcast in New Jersey and four network
stations in Lexington, Ky., have decided in the past week to stop
airing ads funded by the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee questioning the GOP candidates' votes on education bills.
The candidates are Rep. Ernie Fletcher in Kentucky and ex-Rep. Dick
Zimmer in New Jersey. TV stations cannot be held legally liable for
the content of ads funded by candidates for federal office, but
they can be sued for defamation in the case of issue ads funded by
outside groups.

   FIRST REVLON, NOW THIS
</P>
<P>
   A group that wants to get women elected to the White House
offered a job to Monica Lewinsky _ then quickly dropped it.
American Women Presidents, formed in March to promote the election
of women as president and vice president, faxed a letter to
Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, offering her the post of
corporate vice president. But a few hours later, the offer was
rescinded. The fax had said the group was disturbed that Lewinsky's
``life and career have been sidetracked'' since her affair with
President Clinton ``while the lives and careers of most of the
others involved in our national tragedy have remained intact.''

   A soccer game lasts 90 minutes, but the global passion for the
sport is never governed by the clock. And it's a good thing,
because watching a European match on American television usually
means staying up very late or getting up very, very early.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the mainstream news media cover only the
big events, like the men's and women's World Cup. Other than a
pilgrimage to Old Trafford, the soccer stadium in Manchester,
England, to see a Manchester United match or to Nou Camp in Spain
to see F.C. Barcelona, perhaps the best way to slake the obsession
for soccer is on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is emerging as the talk radio of soccer, providing
statistics, chat rooms and Web sites dedicated to individual
players.
</P>
<P>
   Staying current with European and other results from around the
world once meant tuning in the crackly and elusive signals of a
shortwave radio. Now it is more likely that soccer aficionados
marooned on these shores can tune to matches on the Internet via
streaming audio.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com from Yahoo offers live matches, but only from a
handful of teams in Italy (A.C. Milan, Juventus and Parma) and
Britain (Manchester United, Arsenal, Derby County and Glasgow
Celtic). Internetsoccer.com takes a more local approach,
broadcasting the regional World Cup qualifying matches now being
played by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most European club teams have official (and many, many
unofficial) Web sites, some of which, like Paris Saint-Germain
(www.psg.fr), also offer an English version. In general, the sites
have a club's history, schedules, news releases, player roster and,
of course, merchandise (most European clubs have the nasty habit of
changing their uniform style every season).
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent way to follow a match (whether it is a regular
league game on the weekend or a match in continental cup
competition) in real time is with the Match Tracker. It is used at
the official Web sites of two of the most famous European clubs:
Manchester United (manutd.com) and Barcelona (fcbarcelona.com).
</P>
<P>
   Launching Match Tracker calls up a window on the screen that
will give you a second-by-second, text-based play-by-play of the
match, including statistics, lineups (with player pictures and
information) and an audio link (if the match is being broadcast
over the Internet). It is probably the closest you can get to the
match without actually being there.
</P>
<P>
   A straight tickertape of scores can be found at Livescore.com.
There, you can follow matches in 18 European countries as well as
continental and international cup competitions like the European
Champions League, the UEFA Cup and qualifying matches leading up to
the 2002 World Cup finals in South Korea and Japan. Scores are
updated every few minutes. A small flashing green square denotes a
match in progress, and there is also a notation of how much time
has elapsed in the match. When a match ends, the site provides a
link to a news service report about the match.
</P>
<P>
   As more young American players like Landon Donovan (on the Bayer
Leverkusen team in Germany), Joe-Max Moore (Everton in England) and
Claudio Reyna (Glasgow Rangers in Scotland) seek fame (but mostly
fortune) playing soccer in Europe, the Internet has made it
possible, even easy, to follow their weekly performances.
</P>
<P>
   The site with the most extensive information on Americans
playing overseas is Soccerspot.com. The site's research is now
being picked up and distributed by the U.S. Soccer Federation (on
its Web site, www.us-soccer.com, and via e-mail messages) and
ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Video broadcasts on the Web are probably still a couple of years
away, but soccer fans can use the Internet to find listings of
soccer on TV (primarily satellite TV) by checking out the listings
at Soccertv.com.

 &HT;    TRADE, DRUGS, BORDER LIKELY ON AGENDA FOR CLINTON MEETING WITH
MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT FOX
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Each rose to national leadership by overturning the
political status quo after storming the gates as reform-minded
centrists ready to carry the next generation into a bold new era.
</P>
<P>
   When they meet at the White House on Thursday, President Clinton
and Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, are sure to find fertile
common ground around those shared political roots.
</P>
<P>
   There's certain to be some talk on the contentious triad of
substantive issues _ drugs, trade and immigration _ at the core of
U.S.-Mexican relations.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long Oval Office get acquainted session, though, is
more likely to focus on the challenges Fox, 58, will face when he
takes office Dec. 1 and tries to administer a corrupt and largely
calcified bureaucracy installed over seven decades of rule by his
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a daunting task,'' said a senior administration official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``One thing is to win an
election, and the other is to govern . . . He (Fox) probably wants
to hear the president's insights.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Fox is a former state governor who strode onto the
national political stage by convincing voters that it was time for
change at the top.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time Coca-Cola Co. executive, Fox won a stunning upset in
elections July 2, ending 71 years of single-party rule in Mexico by
vanquishing the PRI, the Spanish acronym for the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, headed by current Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Fox takes office just seven weeks before Clinton leaves, so the
two are expected to have little time for official business.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly eight years spent trying to manage U.S.-Mexican
relations from Washington, Clinton is certain to have advice to
offer Fox on how to avoid early missteps in dealing with the United
States, and perhaps even a suggestion or two on how best to
approach his own domestic political challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get to know him, and I want to reaffirm the support
of the United States, which I think is bipartisan, for good, strong
relationships with Mexico,'' Clinton told reporters on the South
Lawn on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been impressed with what I've seen and heard about him so
far,'' said Clinton, ``and I'm anxious to meet him and do what I
can to get our relationship off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he was interested in the vision Fox has for
closer U.S.-Mexican relations, even though analysts say there's
little near-term potential for the president-elect's goal of
establishing open borders between the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I want to hear what he has to say about it, and how we
would go about dealing with the problems that we have with the
trade arrangement we have now, whether they would be amplified,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everything else, the devil is always in the details here,
so I want to talk to him about it and see what he has in mind,''
Clinton added. ``I would imagine most of this work would have to be
done by the next administration.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fox told reporters in Mexico that he was looking
forward to meeting Clinton, ``Dos metros a dos metros.''
Translating literally into ``two meters to two meters,'' the phrase
is suggestive of two tall men getting together as powerful equals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also meets Thursday with Vice President Al Gore, attends a
luncheon hosted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and holds
a press conference at the National Press Club. Thursday evening,
Fox is to be honored by the Center for Democracy, a non-profit
activist group in Washington, for his contribution to advancing the
role of elective government in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was to arrive here late Wednesday from Canada, where he met
earlier this week with Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Tuesday,
part of a four-day swing through Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fox is to travel to Dallas, where he is scheduled to
meet with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants to informally establish his credentials and lay the
groundwork for what he hopes will be a series of significant steps
forward in Mexico's relations with its giant neighbors to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has said he would like to see that relationship follow the
model of the European Union, with open borders and a single market
for trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea with little near-term potential, owing to the broad
social and economic gaps between Mexico _ a poor country where
per-capita income hasn't quite reached US$5,000 a year _ and its
wealthy neighbors north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In some U.S. political quarters, in fact, the proposal is
regarded as preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad idea,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of
the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative, largely
anti-immigration, Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Relying chiefly on U.S. Census data, Krikorian's group estimates
that there are about 7.1 million people in this country who came
here from Mexico _ about 3 million of whom are here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about 54 percent of the total illegal alien population,''
said Krikorian.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 150,000 Mexicans migrate illegally to the United States
each year, drawn by the prospect of higher pay and better living
standards than they might find back home.
</P>
<P>
   Loosening immigration restrictions, analysts like Krikorian
fear, could open the floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border is already
too porous, owing to the burgeoning trade relationship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada were
wedded in 1994 by the North American Free Trade Agreement, or
NAFTA, which reduced tariffs and other cross-border trade barriers
and encouraged investment among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, two-way trade between the United States and Mexico is
on track to top $240 billion. That's second only to U.S.-Canada
trade, headed toward a record-breaking $413 billion, and it's ahead
of U.S.-Japan trade, likely to top $206 billion this year,
according to the pace set in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With increased trade, though, has come a surge in cross-border
transit, including trucks, automobiles, container vessels and other
vehicles. That has made it increasingly difficult for U.S.
officials to block the entry of billions of dollars a year worth of
illicit narcotics flooding in from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The White House claims that some 60 percent of this country's
cocaine comes in from Mexico, as well as thousands of tons of
marijuana each year, and a relatively small but growing amount of
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug trade is a huge problem also for Mexico, as
narco-dollars fuel rampant crime and corruption of officials at
every level of law enforcement and government.

OPENING DOORS AT HOTEL WITH A PALM IN THE HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass., Utah)   (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They won't beam fresh towels up to the room, but Palm handhelds
that can send and receive infrared signals will soon function as
check-in desks and even room keys for travelers who stay at some
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The system will beam room numbers and door lock codes from the
computer network at the hotel's registration desk to a guest's Palm
through infrared ports. When the guest gets to the room, the Palm
will transmit an infrared signal to a chip in the door lock to open
the room. The system was developed by Suite Technology System
Network, based in Salt Lake City, and Micros Systems, in Columbia,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is already an important part of the amenities offered
by major hotels, many of which let guests use their television
remote controls to do things like checking out. The next wave of
technology is expected to let hotels offer many more services to
guests and tailor those services to match personal needs and
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The first installation of the Palm-based communication system is
at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Mass. The hotel's general
manager, Michael Doyle, said each guest would also be able to
choose the room temperature, the type of pillow and the time for a
wake-up call through a keyboard wired to the hotel network and the
Internet. A high-definition television acts as a monitor in each
room. Guests will also be able to order room service and use their
Internet accounts via the keyboards. Each guest's preferences will
be stored, along with information like bookmarked Web sites, so
they can be called up if the guest returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be looking at how we can communicate with these devices
and set the tone for a customer's arrival,'' Doyle said. The Palm
system and network for rooms will be available at the Charles early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Palm-based door openers are also being used in the real estate
industry. Last year, Palm Inc. and Supra Products, a company that
makes electronic locks, introduced the eKEY, a devices that
attaches to the Palm Vx to give a real estate agent access to a
house (as well as access to market information through the device's
wireless and cradle connections).
</P>
<P>
   Many hotels are working on ways to provide automated wireless
services to their customers. Joe Lazlo, a senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications, said the Charles Hotel was taking a small but
innovative step toward wireless personalization, while much of the
hotel industry seemed to be waiting for the widespread adoption of
a single wireless platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempts to do these cool wireless applications have been
somewhat limited,'' Lazlo said. ``Wireless communication is neat
stuff, but deployment on a nationwide basis really begs a reliable
standard that vendors in a whole bunch of different industries can
agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the hotel industry say they believe that the winning
platform will be Bluetooth, which is being developed by Intel,
Nokia, Ericsson and other electronics and telecommunications
companies and will connect cellular phones and handhelds with
computers. The companies involved include 3Com, which recently spun
off Palm Inc., and Microsoft, which makes Pocket PC software; not
surprisingly, both Palm and Pocket PC devices are expected to
become compatible with Bluetooth.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel are using Pocket PC
handheld computers that link wirelessly to the hotel network to
enter housekeeping information. W.J. Kitchen, chief executive of
Amaranth Technology Systems, which makes the software to link the
Pocket PC devices to the hotel network, said the system would
ultimately run on Bluetooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll start to see Bluetooth-equipped handhelds and cell
phones,'' he said, ``which will both automatically check in
customers and transmit information to the hotel staff to let them
greet returning customers by name or offer them a bottle of their
favorite wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel industry experts say wireless technology will let
personalized customer service become more automated in the next few
years. ``The Palm application is somewhat dependent on the number
of people who have a wireless Palm device,'' said David Moon, a
partner in the hotel industry group at Arthur Andersen in Phoenix.
``But we think the wireless Web offers a very significant
opportunity in terms of automating not only check-in, but services
within the hotel, like authenticating entry into the health club.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for hotels, Moon said, will be to integrate their
current networks with the new wireless applications.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was also the question of how hotels with a high
level of personal service would incorporate these technologies.
``The higher-end hotels often rely on the front desk interaction as
one of the most meaningful interactions with the guest,'' he said.
``And they don't want to lose that because it could dilute their
brand identity.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a real concern, said Tim Harvey, the chief information
officer for the Hilton Hotels Corp., based in Beverly Hills, Calif.
``We've tested things from check-in kiosks to curbside check-in to
check-in on airport buses, and I think there needs to be a
balance,'' he said. ``There are going to be customers for a long
time who are going to want to walk up to the front desk and talk to
a person. I think people are going to go toward a more expeditious
check-in, but it's a long way out.''

   After nearly eight years spent trying to manage U.S.-Mexican
relations from Washington, Clinton is certain to have advice to
offer Fox on how to avoid early missteps in dealing with the United
States, and perhaps even a suggestion or two on how best to
approach his own domestic political challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get to know him, and I want to reaffirm the support
of the United States, which I think is bipartisan, for good, strong
relationships with Mexico,'' Clinton told reporters on the South
Lawn on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been impressed with what I've seen and heard about him so
far,'' said Clinton, ``and I'm anxious to meet him and do what I
can to get our relationship off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he was interested in the vision Fox has for
closer U.S.-Mexican relations, even though analysts say there's
little near-term potential for the president-elect's goal of
establishing open borders between the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I want to hear what he has to say about it, and how we
would go about dealing with the problems that we have with the
trade arrangement we have now, whether they would be amplified,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everything else, the devil is always in the details here,
so I want to talk to him about it and see what he has in mind,''
Clinton added. ``I would imagine most of this work would have to be
done by the next administration.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fox told reporters in Mexico that he was looking
forward to meeting Clinton, ``Dos metros a dos metros.''
Translating literally into ``two meters to two meters,'' the phrase
is suggestive of two tall men getting together as powerful equals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also meets Thursday with Vice President Al Gore, attends a
luncheon hosted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and holds
a press conference at the National Press Club. Thursday evening,
Fox is to be honored by the Center for Democracy, a non-profit
activist group in Washington, for his contribution to advancing the
role of elective government in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was to arrive here late Wednesday from Canada, where he met
earlier this week with Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Tuesday,
part of a four-day swing through Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fox is to travel to Dallas, where he is scheduled to
meet with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants to informally establish his credentials and lay the
groundwork for what he hopes will be a series of significant steps
forward in Mexico's relations with its giant neighbors to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has said he would like to see that relationship follow the
model of the European Union, with open borders and a single market
for trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea with little near-term potential, owing to the broad
social and economic gaps between Mexico _ a poor country where
per-capita income hasn't quite reached US$5,000 a year _ and its
wealthy neighbors north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In some U.S. political quarters, in fact, the proposal is
regarded as preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad idea,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of
the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative, largely
anti-immigration, Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Relying chiefly on U.S. Census data, Krikorian's group estimates
that there are about 7.1 million people in this country who came
here from Mexico _ about 3 million of whom are here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about 54 percent of the total illegal alien population,''
said Krikorian.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 150,000 Mexicans migrate illegally to the United States
each year, drawn by the prospect of higher pay and better living
standards than they might find back home.
</P>
<P>
   Loosening immigration restrictions, analysts like Krikorian
fear, could open the floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border is already
too porous, owing to the burgeoning trade relationship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada were
wedded in 1994 by the North American Free Trade Agreement, or
NAFTA, which reduced tariffs and other cross-border trade barriers
and encouraged investment among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, two-way trade between the United States and Mexico is
on track to top $240 billion. That's second only to U.S.-Canada
trade, headed toward a record-breaking $413 billion, and it's ahead
of U.S.-Japan trade, likely to top $206 billion this year,
according to the pace set in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With increased trade, though, has come a surge in cross-border
transit, including trucks, automobiles, container vessels and other
vehicles. That has made it increasingly difficult for U.S.
officials to block the entry of billions of dollars a year worth of
illicit narcotics flooding in from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The White House claims that some 60 percent of this country's
cocaine comes in from Mexico, as well as thousands of tons of
marijuana each year, and a relatively small but growing amount of
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   The drug trade is a huge problem also for Mexico, as
narco-dollars fuel rampant crime and corruption of officials at
every level of law enforcement and government.

SITE INVITES SHOPPERS TO WAX ELOQUENT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   I am looking for a piano lamp that has a long arm that you can
adjust to cast really strong light on sheet music. The lamp has to
be small enough to fit on a small shelf, and it should not tip over
and fall onto the floor constantly like the last one (which broke).
Also, it cannot be ugly. Is that too much to ask?
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, I thought the answer was yes. In search of
leads, I scoured all my usual haunts, including lighting stores and
antique stores, yard sales and thrift shops.
</P>
<P>
   I tried online search engines, too. But although you can quickly
hunt down certain kinds of products on the Internet _ books and
CDs, for example _ simply by entering a title in a query box, you
are less likely to succeed with more idiosyncratic requests. My
favorite search engine, Google, laughed at my request: ``Your
search, `small piano lamp that casts good light,' did not match any
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves responded to my question as if it were one of my
children trying to avoid telling me who left the car door open in
the rain. (``Umm, Mom, I don't know, but would you like to look at
this cool Web site that has information about the movie `The
Piano'?'')
</P>
<P>
   So after the old lamp broke, I just swept up the broken light
bulb and told my daughters to squint through ``Fur Elise'' until
further notice. Then one day last week I heard about a free
shopping service called Respond.com, where shoppers can type in the
most idiosyncratic, finicky words they can think of to describe the
specific product or service they want (www.respond.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have an easier time finding what you are looking
for if you could say it in your own words to a lot of people all at
once, then it could be helpful to use Respond,'' said Will Clemens,
Respond.com's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Respond.com acts as a liaison between shoppers and merchants. It
protects shoppers' anonymity while it forwards requests via e-mail
to more than 70,000 merchants selling items in more than 4,000
categories, like bicycle components and fresh mussels. Respond.com
is paid for leads by both big and small merchants, like Lands' End,
Annie's Costume and Magic, and ABT Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers reply by e-mail to Respond.com if they think they can
fulfill a request, and Respond.com forwards the responses to the
shopper. If a lead looks promising, the shopper can get in touch
with a seller to ask questions, negotiate or make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The service was simple and easy to use. At the top of the home
page was a query box that prompted me to finish the phrase ``I'm
looking for ...''
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the suggestive ellipses made me think of the
Miss America personality test, in which contestants are asked to
reveal their deepest desires. Momentarily carried away, I tried to
type, ``I'm looking for world peace, or at least a scholarship and
free use of a convertible for the next year,'' but that turned out
to be too many characters for the search function to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, ``I'm looking for a small piano lamp that casts good
light,'' fit just fine. After I clicked on ``Go!'' the site offered
me a choice of a couple of dozen categories to search, including
Antique Lamps and Lights, Desk Lamps and Wall Lamps. I chose the
Antique Lamps and Lights category, then typed a detailed
description of my dream lamp and set a one-week deadline for
replies.
</P>
<P>
   Just sending such a specific request made me feel so powerful
that I started to remember other hard-to-find items that have
eluded me. So I filed five more requests, for things like ``a hotel
in Miami with a big, free-form swimming pool that will entertain
children all day,'' ``a free-standing bamboo magazine rack to sit
next to an armchair,'' ``old cookbooks from the first half of the
20th century'' and ``biographical information about the author
Louise Dickinson Rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a day, I had received at least one response to each
request (after three days, the most I received was three, from
online travel agents who offered to help me book a trip to Miami).
Some responses to queries for books, for instance, came from
individual booksellers and turned out to be less comprehensive than
if I had simply used a specialized search engine like
Bookfinder.com to look for the same material.
</P>
<P>
   But responses to my quirkier requests offered good leads. Some
of the best, in fact, came from Respond.com's customer service
staff, which sends e-mail responses to queries in categories where
Respond.com has fewer merchant partners (to ensure that shoppers
get at least one response within 72 hours). The staff will hunt
through databases of previous requests and, if necessary, conduct a
Web search to find promising online retailers' sites. While I could
have done such a search myself, I was happy to sit back and let
them do the work.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I learned about Tuthilllighting.com, the
informational Internet site (www.Tuthilllighting.com) of a company
that sells piano lamps, including a model that clips onto a music
rack. On the company's Web site, I also happened to notice a
battery-operated, wall-mounted picture lamp, which had no messy
cord to dangle down behind a picture frame. That reminded me that I
had been looking for months for two of those, too. Although
Tuthilllighting.com doesn't sell products online, the Web site
referred me to a local retailer, N&AMP;S Dcor Fixture on Long Island,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned N&AMP;S to get prices, discuss bulb requirements and ask
what the finish ``statuary bronze'' could possibly look like. Over
the phone, the clerk told me that the piano lamp had a cord (messy,
now that I had seen the cordless picture lamp) and cost $240.
</P>
<P>
   To make the visit to Respond.com worth the effort, I ordered the
picture lamp. Downstairs, I heard someone stumbling over ``Ode to
Joy'' in bad light.

HOPING PEOPLE WATCH JAIL AND WON'T WANT TO VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz.)   (Circuits)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inner workings of at least one piece of the criminal justice
system can now be viewed on the Internet 24 hours a day, courtesy
of Webcams in the Maricopa County jail in south-central Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Four cameras make up the Jail Cam (www.mcso.org or crime.com),
which lets visitors view detainees being led into the jail in
handcuffs, being fingerprinted and booked and being taken to
holding cells.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix,
said he had installed the Webcams as a deterrent because he figured
that viewing a holding cell on the Web would convince some people
that they never wanted to wind up in one.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Arpaio said he had also set up the
Webcams as a response to critics who accused his officers of
mistreating inmates. Four years ago, an inmate, Scott Norberg, died
at the jail, and the man's family has sued the sheriff's office.
Arpaio said one of the cameras on the Web was trained on the
hallway where Norberg died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everybody in the world can be the jury if they want to
tune into the Web page,'' he said. ``I have faith in my officers
and don't mind them being seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Eisenberg, executive director of the Arizona chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union, said she did not approve of the
jail Webcams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it constitutes punishment by humiliation for people
who have not even been charged with a crime,'' Eisenberg said. ``I
certainly think that it's not his concern about deterring people in
Australia _ he has no way of knowing where these hits are coming
from.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks that Jail Cam has been operating, there have
been millions of hits per day, the sheriff said. A private company
is paying for the project, Arpaio said. The cameras being used were
previously installed as security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get hundreds of e-mails from all over the world,'' the
sheriff said, ``and 95 percent love it and feel it's a great
deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   A disclaimer on the site reminds viewers that a person is
innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio compares the unfiltered viewing with news photographs of
crime suspects, or even the televised chase involving O.J. Simpson.
``He wasn't even arrested yet,'' the sheriff said. ``What's wrong
with it in a jail?''
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County has the fourth-largest jail system in the United
States. The jail books about 300 to 400 people a day on charges
like prostitution or even murder.
</P>
<P>
   But even though a disclaimer on the site warns _ and titillates
_ viewers, saying they might inadvertently see violent or sexually
inappropriate behavior by detainees, viewers might be bored stiff
rather than scared straight if several recent visits are any
indication. For the most part, the camera captures images of
officers shuffling papers and going about the daily routine of
booking crime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said he planned to make the site more intriguing. ``We're
trying to get audio,'' he said. ``It's nice to hear what's going
on.''

YOU HAVE 90 SECONDS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU. START SMILING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I promised my editor I'd do this. I'd follow the tips in ``How
to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Nicholas Boothman's book, released in paperback last year
and picked up by Workman Publishing for hardcover distribution in
September, tells me to beam, say ``Hi!'' point my heart toward my
prospect and mimic his or her body language. Start conversations
with open-ended questions. Listen. Maintain eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   He wants me to put my personality in a microwave and zap it on
``Hi!''
</P>
<P>
   With this, I am to bond instantly. Boothman could have named
this $14.95 book ``Super Glue for the Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   It's depressing when I realize that within 90 minutes of reading
the first chapter of his book, I have made two people dislike me in
90 seconds or less. Both instances involved discussions of
politics. I resolve to try harder.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule from the book is that time is precious. In the
space of a few heartbeats, assumptions register, opinions are
formed. The human attention span, he says, is 30 seconds and no
longer if there is not stimulation. Don't believe it? He says stare
at an inanimate object for 30 seconds. Don't choose a great work of
art. Stare at something ordinary. I gaze at a glossy white pot of
cascading ivy. At the count of 10, my mind starts to wander. By
golly, he is right!
</P>
<P>
   I set out to prove I am more interesting than a pot of ivy.
</P>
<P>
   To attract people, Boothman says, we must be open with our body
language. Don't cross your arms. Don't button your jacket. Point
your heart toward the person and say ``Hi!'' Lean forward slightly.
If you don't shake the person's hand, then at least practice what
he calls the handless handshake. This involves all the posturing
and pleasantness of an actual handshake, only without actually
having to touch anyone.
</P>
<P>
   I need to meet someone new so I can practice. I give 50 cents to
a man asking for money on the street in downtown Fort Worth. I lean
forward, smile and say ``Hi!'' He looks frightened, suspicious,
confused.
</P>
<P>
   I need a new target.
</P>
<P>
   I try the technique on a co-worker. She looks frightened,
suspicious, confused.
</P>
<P>
   Then I get into the aforementioned discussions of politics. I
don't get instant bonding, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   I read the next chapter, the one about establishing rapport.
</P>
<P>
   This is more complex. First, you have to start with what the
author calls a ``Really Useful Attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In face-to-face situations, your attitude precedes you. It is
the central force of your life _ it controls the quality and
appearance of everything you do,'' Boothman says.
</P>
<P>
   We are what we think. As Boothman says, ``I don't want my boss
yelling at me'' causes a person to reflect an entirely different
attitude than ``I want a promotion,'' or, I might add, ``I want a
promotion in 90 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Once we have our attitudes switched to ``positive,'' Boothman
wants us to copy the body language and tone of voice of the person
we hope to charm. Such similarity of gesture and style sets up an
unspoken bond. ``We are alike,'' it suggests. It creates a comfort
zone with which to start conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Boothman says people won't pick up on the fact we are copying
them, unless we do really obvious things such as stick our fingers
in our ears when they do.
</P>
<P>
   I fold my hands when my co-worker folds hers. I gesture when
another uses his hands to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Is this working? I see no sign that they are reacting, for
better or worse. Of course, they know me, so it may be too late to
establish rapport.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, I feel like an ape. Worse yet, I feel like an insincere
ape.
</P>
<P>
   I try listening to tone of voice. As Boothman says, if a person
says, ``That's brilliant'' in an indifferent tone of voice, it is
far removed in meaning from ``That's brilliant!'' I find imitating
tone of voice to be too phony, almost patronizing. So I don't try
this tip.
</P>
<P>
   I do try some of his conversation-starting tips. Boothman says
to begin by making a statement that reflects a common interest,
then ask an open-ended question, one that cannot be answered with a
``yes'' or ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha! There is the classical music critic. He is wearing
turquoise and black, the very same colors I am wearing. I stand
next to him and point this similarity out. He and the office
manager smile in response. I then have one of those regrettable
Sally Field moments when I think: ``They like me! They really,
really like me!'' Then, to my horror, I completely fail to link the
Boothman tips. I am unable to come up with an open-ended question!
So I leave. Later, the theater critic tells me that the classical
music critic and I look as if we are on the same bowling team.
</P>
<P>
   I decide that ``How to Make People Like You'' has some practical
tips. Salesfolk probably could practice these ideas with good
results. I may be able to apply them with more grace, if I
practice. But I think, for my own purposes, I am better off
developing more gradual rapport.

VICTORIA SHARES HER SECRETS
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKI TURNER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victoria Principal, who first rose to fame as Pamela Ewing on
the addictive prime-time soap ``Dallas,'' returns to television
this fall in Aaron Spelling's campy sudser ``Titans.'' Principal,
50, plays nightclub owner and rich divorcee Gwen Williams. Gwen is
very different from Pam Ewing, but Principal has changed a great
deal, too. The Principal is definitely in charge now.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: You're 50, and you look fabulous. What is your secret?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: I think that America, unlike Europe and many other
cultures, has relegated women after the age of 35 to pigeonholing.
You are no longer sexy, you are just a mother, a wife, an ex-wife,
or just a professional or just single. And guess what? We are so
many things. Watch out, world!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you always had a high degree of self-confidence?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think that it's about life experiences and wisdom. I think
that I was not a secure person at 25 at all. But I think 25 years
later, I have a certain sense of self through life experiences,
which gives me confidence because I've lived it. And I hope at 60
and 70 and 80 and 90 that I'm wearing purple!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why purple?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you woke up on the morning of your 50th birthday, what
were you feeling?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I couldn't wait to see the jewelry. My husband made my 50th
birthday really, really fun. He invited all my friends, and there
was a party that lasted longer than my life. And there was a ring
that put a big smile on my face. But most of all, I asked everyone
not to bring gifts, and what everyone did was bring handmade cards.
I have a special box with all the cards in it that I will have for
the rest of my life. The cards are affectionate, funny, serious,
loving, and some of them are like journals chronicling 30 years of
friendship. It was wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: They always say men grow wiser as they get older. Does the
same hold true for women?
</P>
<P>
   A: That depends on the person and that varies from person to
person. I think life is a gift, and I intend to celebrate every
decade of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there things that you now do at 50 that you wouldn't have
dared do at 20, 30 or 40?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I was 20, I would walk into a room and wonder if anyone
liked me. And now when I walk into a room I wonder, ``Who do I
like?''

   Monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars like milkweed. The good
news for monarchs is that birds tend to find milkweed-laden
caterpillars distasteful. After tasting a monarch caterpillar, a
predator might associate the brightly colored, striped caterpillars
with an unpleasant meal and avoid them in the future, saving the
lives of monarchs everywhere. Organic gardening stores often sell
seeds for milkweed.
</P>
<P>
   Monarch butterflies sip milkweed nectar. When milkweed isn't in
season, monarchs drink flower nectar from dogbane, lilac, red
clover, lantana and thistles. In the fall, they visit goldenrods,
blazing stars (liatris), iron weed and tickseed flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A gulf fritillary caterpillar likes the passion vine, including
Passiflora incarnata and Passiflora foetida. The orange and black
butterfly it becomes likes nectar from lantana, shepherd's needle
and daisylike flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning cloak caterpillars like willow trees, cottonwood and
hackberry. The adult black butterfly prefers tree sap, particularly
that of oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Black swallowtail caterpillars enjoy plants from the parsley
family, including Queen Anne's lace, carrot, celery, dill and
fennel. The adult black, yellow and orange butterfly drinks nectar
from flowers, including red clover, milkweed and thistles. Source:

BUTTERFLY BREEDER WINGS IT IN UNUSUAL BUSINESS

<P>
   In the morning, when the shade dapples her yard and the
temperature is not yet searing, Leslie Lange of the Fluttering B
Butterfly Ranch in Colleyville releases her butterflies into an
outdoor tent for exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Orange and black wings flicker in the air around her head. They
brush against her cheek. The butterflies flit, impossibly graceful
and lovely.
</P>
<P>
   These butterflies don't look as if they could be in the middle
of a controversy, but they are.
</P>
<P>
   Lange's ``ranch'' in her suburban back yard is her new business,
one that provides monarchs or painted ladies or gulf fritillaries
for ceremonial releases at birthday parties, weddings or schools.
</P>
<P>
   Children love them. Newlyweds sigh. Pretty much everyone feels
good about these fluttering symbols of rebirth _ except
conservation groups that are bugged by the increasingly popular
fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, this is treating butterflies as confetti,'' said Nancy
Greig, director of the Cockrell Butterfly Center at the Museum of
Natural Science in Houston. ``This is butterflies as baubles.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the ethical argument against releasing commercially
raised, mail-order butterflies into the wild. There's a biological
argument as well. Commercial, mail-order butterflies can be
released into inappropriate climates or environments, where they
can die too quickly, introduce disease or compete for food with
native populations that already face vanishing habitats, says the
National Wildlife Federation, the American Museum of Natural
History and the Washington State Department of Wildlife. Those
groups also are concerned that commercially raised butterflies will
be too confused to migrate properly. They may have romantic
liaisons with their wild counterparts, causing unforeseen ripples
in the genetic pool. Or they may be injured in shipping, the groups
say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the butterfly ranch, Lange is saying
``Whoa!''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a bachelor of science degree in biology from Texas
Woman's University in Denton and an affiliation with the
International Butterfly Breeders Association, Lange, 36, says she
overcomes conservationists' concerns by using thorough research,
careful breeding techniques, cautious shipping and detailed
instructions on when and how to release butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she says, she's very, very careful.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has no policy on butterfly releases, says John Jackman at
the Texas Agricultural Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't very concerned about the release of native species.
It could cause some genetic shifting, but I think the number of
butterflies released is small enough that it wouldn't create a
problem,'' Jackman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lange raises and releases butterflies that are native to Texas.
When she ships butterflies out of state, she says, she sends only
butterflies that have been approved by the U.S. Agriculture
Department for release in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Lange collects eggs from the butterfly garden in her back yard.
She washes the eggs in a solution of 90 percent water and 10
percent bleach to kill bacteria. She also buys butterfly eggs from
other breeders, of which about a dozen operate in Texas. Lange
mates the stock she purchases with the stock that found its way to
her yard. That way, she says, no inbreeding problems will emerge
from her ranch.
</P>
<P>
   A spare bedroom in her home has been converted into a butterfly
rearing barn with full-spectrum grow lights mounted on posts. In
the ``barn,'' Lange stores the eggs of native Texas butterflies in
white plastic containers covered with paper towels. The eggs hatch
and turn into caterpillars, which she feeds milkweed and parsley
from her yard. They form cocoons, then emerge as butterflies. The
egg-to-butterfly progression takes three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 24 hours after their hatching, Lange lets the
butterflies stay in the spare-bedroom-turned-barn in a homemade
cage her husband built from plastic pipes and white netting. Once
their wings harden, she places them in a cage and takes them
outside for daily exercise. At night, she brings them indoors to
avoid predators, including mockingbirds, wasps and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In a family room converted into the Fluttering B Butterfly Ranch
headquarters, Lange stores permits from the U.S. Agriculture
Department that allow her to ship her butterflies to 27 states.
Each state has separate laws governing which types of butterflies
it will allow. No Texas-raised monarchs can be sent west of the
Rocky Mountains because Eastern U.S. monarchs can carry a parasite
that has yet to invade their Western relations.
</P>
<P>
   Lange is fastidious about her monarchs. She raises milkweed,
picks it and washes it in a bleach solution before giving it to the
orange and black beauties. As she readies monarchs for shipping,
she swabs each butterfly's tummy and checks the swab under a
microscope to make sure she isn't releasing any monarchs with
parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Her other butterflies _ mourning cloaks, the gulf fritillary,
black swallowtails _ aren't as sensitive to parasites, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the packing. Each butterfly is slipped inside a box
about 3-by-3- inches square and a quarter-inch thick. Those boxes
are placed inside a larger box lined with foam and filled with foam
pellets. An ice pack is slipped inside the box so that the
butterflies don't overheat. Instructions are included. She advises
clients to store the box in a cool, dark room until the big day.
She tells the buyers to plan their release for daylight, because
butterflies, unlike moths, do not fly at night. She ships April
through October and advises clients not to release butterflies on a
cold or rainy day. And then she ships the box via the U.S. Postal
Service or Airborne Express.
</P>
<P>
   Lange says she's shipped hundreds of butterflies since she
started in February, and she says she's never heard from a client
that a butterfly had died during shipment.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't believe that the migrating monarchs become so upset
they can't find their way to overwintering grounds. She's heard of
monarchs that were tagged in the United States being found in
Mexico, so they must make it, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lange says she believes the release of commercially bred
butterflies ultimately has a good effect on the environment. She
sends information on habitat to clients, advising them on which
types of plants draw the pretty insects to a garden. Recently,
while preparing a shipment of 27 butterflies for a little girl's
birthday party in Illinois, Lange included 27 packets of seeds, so
the kids could go home and grow butterfly gardens. She often
includes the seeds, and she realizes that she and other breeders
just don't see eye to eye with the folks who would prefer that she
release just the seeds.

BRAT PACK HOSTS SWEET PARTY

   The business of wine, and the drinking of same, have long been
regarded as stodgy, stuffy and traditional. That's certainly what
the scions of several Sonoma County winemaking clans heard when
they went off to college and were ridiculed by classmates for their
far-from-plebian tastes.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to the family businesses _ at wineries like
Bundschu, San Giacomo and Sebastiani _ they started agitating for
different approaches to selling wine, and to loosening up that
oh-so-uptight image. The result was a nickname, and then a group,
now national, called the Wine Brats.
</P>
<P>
   And tonight, the Brats will be putting on their annual L.A.
WineRave, to raise money for Sweet Relief, the charity that
benefits ailing musicians.
</P>
<P>
   The event at the sort-of-open Knitting Factory Hollywood
nightclub will feature wines from 24 vineyards, food from five
restaurants (including the Knitting Factory), a short experimental
film by Matthew Konicek of Chicago, fashion and art by designer
Nicole Moss in collaboration with painter William Quigley, and
dance music by DJ Freedom Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a silent auction to benefit Sweet Relief, a
give-away trip to the Australian wine country and souvenir stemware
to commemorate all that good wine.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets were about gone, though a few will be available at the
door for $50 each, said Wine Brats executive director Joel Quigley.
Even if you can't make the event, a newly energized Los Angeles
chapter of the group is planning to hold monthly events. Best of
all, membership in the group is free. For more information, go to
www.winebrats.org.
</P>
<P>
   The event runs from 7 to 11 p.m. at the Knitting Factory, 7021
Hollywood Blvd., tucked behind the Hollywood Entertainment Museum
at the corner of Sycamore in the heart of Hollywood. &QL;

   WASHINGTON -- Al Gore and George W. Bush would love to have the
voters' undivided attention. They are not going to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race is about to be overtaken by a big wave of
diversions and distractions, forcing Gore and Bush to compete with
the Summer Olympics; the U.S. Open tennis matches; the start of
football, basketball and hockey seasons; major league baseball
playoffs and a World Series stretching into late October.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates want people to believe this election really
matters. But pollsters report a deep and continuing attention
deficit among voters that is likely to get worse before it gets
better as America's romance with the excitement of televised
sporting events intrudes on a comparatively dull election.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis championships begin Aug. 28. Pro football season
opens Sept. 3. The Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will devour two
weeks of prime campaign time -- Sept. 15 to Oct. 1. Baseball
playoffs begin Oct. 3, pro hockey starts Oct. 4, the World Series
will open Oct. 21 and could run through Oct. 28, and professional
basketball play commences Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Election Day is Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves precious little time for the candidates to hold
their debates, maintain momentum and energize a disinterested
electorate that as yet exhibits no sense of urgency about its vital
responsibility for choosing the new leader of the free world.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the national political conventions, The Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press, which has been tracking the
high level of voter apathy all year, predicted that voter turnout
would slip lower than the disappointing 49 percent level of 1996.
Pew pollsters found that 44 percent of respondents did not follow
election news closely or at all, and 30 percent believe it does not
make much difference who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research, which measures viewership among the
three major television broadcast networks, said the combined
audience dropped for both major conventions -- an estimated 11
percent below 1996 for the Democrats and 4 percent below 1996 for
the GOP. The CBS show ``Survivor'' drew an audience well in excess
of aggregate ratings for Gore's speech on all competing networks
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the challenge looms even larger for whichever
candidate is behind on Labor Day, Sept. 4, since it will be very
difficult to catch up while the focus of many voters is directed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always distractions, and these are bigger than most,
but you can't do anything about it,'' said Ari Fleischer, campaign
spokesman for Bush, the Republican nominee. ``You can't pause,
can't stop, you just run just as hard as you always do.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists claim to be unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have more than one attention span,'' insisted former
Democratic National Chairman Roy Roemer. ``They know this is an
important election. Nobody I know gets so absorbed in baseball or
the Olympics that they tune out what's happened to their schools,
what happens on their city council, or what's happening in the
political race.''
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, brushed aside questions
about how Gore will cope. ``There are no distractions,'' Daley
insisted. ``This happens every four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. The Olympic games usually are held much earlier in
the summer. The last time they came in the midst of a fall
presidential campaign was in l988, when Republican George Bush,
father of this year's GOP candidate, beat Democrat Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is nothing new about the football, basketball,
hockey and baseball schedules, those attractions inevitably shift
media and public attention away from arguments over the intricacies
of campaign finance reform, tax policy, budget priorities, school
vouchers and privatization schemes for Social Security, political
experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem we've been talking privately about all year,''
said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. ``It really interrupts the dynamic of
the campaign. The candidates struggle for notice and, of course,
that makes the debates even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly, Gore and Bush -- as well as Green Party
nominee Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan, standard bearer of one fork
of the Reform Party -- will be, at least temporarily, eclipsed by
the likes of Marion Jones, Jenny Thompson, Michael Johnson and
Lance Armstrong, all strong U.S. gold medal contenders in running,
swimming and cycling events at the Olympics. Not to mention the
entire U.S. women's soccer team.

`ROAD APPLE' STILL THRILLS CLASSIC-OBSESSED MAC FANS TO THE CORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PAUL KUNKEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the subject is Macintosh, love often turns to obsession.
Such is the case for a small group of Apple aficionados who have
decided that the one true Macintosh is the Color Classic.
</P>
<P>
   As the last toaster-size Mac, the Color Classic followed the
same basic design that was first offered in 1984 and was the only
model to offer a built-in color display. Unveiled in 1993, the tiny
all-in-one Classic disappeared from store shelves in 1994, but it
still makes millions of brief appearances each day: the smiling
icon that appears during every Mac start-up is a holdover from the
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   And for some traditionalists, the candy-colored iMac and the new
G4 Cube will never replace it. The design looks modern even today.
But the Web site called LowEndMac, which describes and posts
rankings of older Macintoshes for collectors and die-hard fans,
designated the Color Classic a ``road apple'' (a technological dud)
because of its unbearably slow 16-megahertz processor and Apple's
decision not to offer parts that let users upgrade their machines.
</P>
<P>
   That does not stop fans like the Rev. Stuart Bell, who ministers
to his parishioners in Sussex, England, by day and finds unorthodox
ways of keeping his Color Classic up to date by night. He replaced
the original circuit board with a PowerMac board, which he then
upgraded with a 275-megahertz G3 chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original Mac design with the built-in screen in a box
weighing no more than 20 pounds is the definitive and the cutest
Macintosh of them all,'' Bell said. The iMac, at 35 pounds,
recaptures that concept in some ways, he said. But, he added,
``it's hardly portable, and I don't think anyone would call it
cute.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Color Classic is still adored is the appeal of
its case, which was designed by Daniele DeIuliis at Apple in 1992
(he later created the case for the Powerbook 500 series). Giving
the original Classic a twist, DeIuliis (pronounced day-YOU-lease)
lengthened the front, accentuated the forehead above the screen and
carved the floppy disk slot to resemble a drooping mouth, a
combination that reminded many users of Bart Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   He made the side vents resemble gills, a look that suggested
that the computer was breathing. The plastic around the display
appears to stretch. A mirthful touch was the tiny round legs that
resemble the feet of a baby elephant. A later Apple design
language, called Espresso, used the visual cues that first appeared
on the Color Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the form and detailing,'' Bell said, ``you know
it is classic Apple. It's almost a living thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Color Classic was a favorite among university students, who
wanted a small machine that could handle word processing. But the
hottest market of all was in Japan, where tight spaces made the
Color Classic's small footprint especially desirable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Apple discontinued the product in the United States and
offered the slightly faster Color Classic II in Japan; that model
was discontinued the following year. By 1997, hundreds of Japanese
users who had refused to trade in their beloved machines joined
forces with the two-man team of Takashi Imai, who writes for the
Japanese magazine MacPower, and Makoto Akizuki, known together as
Takky. Together they founded the Club for Creating the Strongest
Color Classic, which functions as a clearinghouse for information
on how to upgrade the Color Classic using spare parts taken from
later machines.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 300 members, the club has a Web site
(homepage2.nifty.com/Kan-chan) that offers detailed instructions
for upgrading the Color Classic's video output and installing a G3
motherboard, a new hard drive, a second power supply (for PCI
expansion), an on-board CD-ROM drive, stereo sound and more.
Currently, the strongest machine, owned by a club member known as
Misutiku, has a 500-megahertz G3 chip, two power supplies, Ethernet
and a TV-FM radio tuner with a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to find a discarded Color Classic, which often
sells on eBay for less than $100. Next, open the back of the
machine, replace the motherboard with one from a discarded Power
Macintosh 5000 or 6000 series machine (as Bell did). Enhance the
Color Classic's resolution by cutting one wire and soldering a new
wire on the video circuit board (that increases the scanning
voltage from 60 to 84 volts, which increases the screen density

Photoshop or browsing the Web). You now have one of the most
sought-after cult objects in the Mac universe.

   A Color Classic running at G3 speed can give the most confirmed
iMac user a case of techno-envy, said Siu Chi Tang, who finances
his Color Classic obsession by working as a Linux distributor in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The club site warns that tinkering with a Color Classic can be
dangerous (the cathode-ray tube can deliver a potentially lethal
shock). Many users prefer to order an already built unit from Maxus
Computer in Japan (www.maxuscomputer.com), a Macintosh upgrade
specialist that can remove the 333-megahertz G3 motherboard and
4-gigabyte hard drive from an iMac and install it in a Color
Classic for $2,600, more than twice the price of a new iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is not really an issue,'' Tang said, ``because
having a strong Color Classic is like owning a hot rod car. It's
impractical, but it's cool. There are a lot of people who will pay
any price to have one.'' Tang displays his own jet-black G3
conversion on his company's Web site (www.tangal.com), where he
also shows a souped-up Apple IIc and a machine that he considers
his ultimate trophy: a clear plastic Color Classic, one of only
three in existence, which Apple engineers used for testing. Asked
to put a price on it, Tang paused, then said, ``I can't.''

   Patrick Ng, an Internet executive in Hong Kong, has taken his
obsession to more lyrical heights. A vice president at
PacificDotCom, Ng has documented his self-diagnosed case of
``CCFS'' (Color Classic Fixation Syndrome) on his amusing Web site,
Color Classic Forever
(grus.hkstar.com/(tilde)patrickn/colorclassic). The story began in
October 1998, when Ng saw a photo of the Color Classic. He alerted
a newsgroup to his quest for one and visited several shops until he
found a dirty nonworking model.
</P>
<P>
   After giving it a scrub, Ng rhapsodized in a diary entry on his
site: ``I now see the uncompromising beauty and elegance of CC even
more obviously, it simply shines. As this mystic discovery
continues, my super-ego seems to warn me the danger of the game,
the emotional attachment to a physical object.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, while others were partying, Ng was otherwise
occupied, as a later diary entry showed: ``I embraced the dusted
classic during the countdown. The rest of that night, perhaps I
should say the rest of the millennium, I gradually slipped away and
fell into a deep trance, everything went blurred except a single
point of vision, I naturally put that point on the shining Color
Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   He then decided that he wanted the machine to carry his child,
``to give her life,'' he wrote. As it turned out, Ng's ``child'' is
his Siamese fighting fish, Faust, who now swims in an aquarium
installed in the Color Classic's chassis.
</P>
<P>
   Cured of his obsession, Ng now keeps his Macquarium in his
office, which overlooks Hong Kong. ``I receive e-mails from all
over the world asking about Faust,'' he said. ``He's doing fine.''

&HT;     RENO DEFENDS DECISION AGAINST APPOINTING GORE COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Wednesday strongly
defended her decision against appointing a special counsel to
investigate Vice President Al Gore's fund-raising efforts four
years ago, removing a potentially troublesome obstacle in Gore's
quest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because further investigation is not likely to result in a
prosecutable case I have concluded that a special counsel is not
warranted,'' Reno said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the heart of everything we care about in this
country _ that you don't pursue a case where there is no basis for
concluding that you can make a case,'' Reno added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign welcomed the decision. If Reno had appointed
an outside counsel, the vice president could have been dogged by
investigators while campaigning for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is running in a close race against Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with today's Justice Department announcement,''
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. ``But our focus is going to
remain where it has always been _ which is on using our prosperity
to help America's families.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision marked the third time she has rejected an
independent investigation of the vice president. In this instance,
Reno shot down the recommendation of Robert Conrad, head of a
Justice Department campaign task force.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad wanted Reno to appoint an outside counsel to determine
whether Gore lied during an April interview with investigators
about a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in California and
fund-raising ``coffees'' held at the White House. The events were
part of efforts to raise money for the Clinton-Gore re-election
campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that she personally reviewed the transcript of the
Gore interview, Reno said the vice president's comments are
``neither false statements nor perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've concluded that there is no reasonable possibility that
further investigation could develop evidence that would support the
filing of charges for making a willful false statement,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno praised Conrad as ``an excellent prosecutor,'' she
said her decision amounted to a ``disagreement among lawyers.''
Conrad was not alone in recommending an outside counsel. Reno said
at least two other advisers agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she ``struggled'' with the decision, which she
finalized over the weekend, and conceded that Republicans might
renew attacks on her for protecting the vice president, the
Democratic candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno countered that the action was based on legal
considerations, not politics. ``I don't do things based on
politics. I realize that politics will be hurled around my head. I
just sit there and duck as it comes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno's decision is a relief to the Gore campaign,
Republicans are not likely to let the vice president off the hook
as the presidential campaign tightens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a statement, reiterated Republican contentions that
Gore ``engaged in a number of questionable fund-raising activities
and gave the FBI statements that continue to raise the issue of his
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that ``the American people are sick and tired of all
these scandals and investigations. The best way to put all these
scandals and investigations behind us is to elect someone new.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With chiseled features and a well-honed body _ which he's
displayed in more than a few films _ Wesley Snipes says he didn't
know he was a sex symbol until he got into movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had women come up to me and say, 'When are you going to
do something in which you take off your clothes again?' he says
with an ingenuous smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Claude (Van Damme) and all of them might want to do that
kind of stuff ... But I'm not that anxious to put my booty on the
screen anymore,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   In his current appearance in the action-thriller, ``The Art of
War,'' from his Amen Ra Films production company, Snipes doesn't
undress or even have a love scene with the heroine played by
Asian-American actress Marie Matiko.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy I play has no time to get it on with a woman,'' he
points out. ``It's like, 'Yo, the man is on the run.' He's too busy
saving himself to end up in the sack at some hotel! That would be
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who plays a covert agent for the United Nations, goes
underground after he's falsely accused of murdering the Chinese
ambassador. As the plot thickens with international intrigue, he's
placed in constant jeopardy _ and in the middle of some
death-defying action scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Stunt coordinator Michael Scherer says Snipes enthusiastically
participated in everything from martial arts combat to jumping from
buildings. ``Sometimes he scared the bejesus out of me because he'd
get right in there,'' Scherer confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes allows that he was often in a little peril. ``But that's
OK, I don't mind it,'' he says. ``I've been working with most of my
stunt men for 10 years and they know how far I'll go. We know each
other's styles and rhythms.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this movie he was a producer. So, when he wanted to take
too big a chance on a stunt, they'd remind him that if he got hurt
the whole production would be shut down. ``And I'd end up having to
pay everybody to sit around!'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got my attention!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Snipes first signed on to ``The Art of War,''
originally developed for Asian action star Jet-Li, he made sure
that he'd be doing some of his favorite things: martial arts and
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also wanted to beef up 'The Art of War,' which is the
title of an ancient handbook written by a very powerful Asian
general, Sun Tsu,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principles he lays down to win a war still apply today _
and my character embraces them,'' he continues. ``Then, you add the
action and, oh man, it's icing on the cake!''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes doesn't deny that being an action hero, and scoring with
audiences, in such thrillers as ``Passenger 57,'' ``Drop Zone'' and
the hugely successful ``Blade,'' has given him the clout he wants
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get into the business to do action,'' he reveals.
``I'm a classically trained actor, and I love the more dramatic
stuff whether it's on Broadway or in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doing films like 'The Art of War' has afforded me the
opportunity to do other projects that have more heart and
sensitivity. So I'm not knocking it!''
</P>
<P>
   Describing action scenes, he said he doesn't like ``straight up
formula stuff. I do fights that are right to the core, right to the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, nobody thinks about hitting a guy in the side of
the thigh. But it works. Pow! You hit him there and he's going to
stop what he's doing for at least a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who has studied martial arts as well as capoeira
(Brazilian dance-fighting), draws on his own street sense to keep
his screen fights authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the Bronx,'' he says. ``The Bronx teaches you to
survive. It's like, 'Bring it on!'''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``If you took me on, it wouldn't be easy. That's
part of my image. People don't mess with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Snipes was less a fighter than a performer when he
was in his teens. He enrolled in Manhattan's High School for the
Performing Arts where he flirted with the idea of becoming a dancer
or singer. Instead he decided on acting because it came easy to
him.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother abruptly moved the family to Orlando, Fla.,
Snipes completed high school while teaming up with friends to form
``Struttin' Street Stuff,'' a traveling puppet troupe that
performed in parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything. We created the puppets, we painted them, we
wrote the scripts,'' he remembers. ``I was just a whippersnapper
but I learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes readily concedes he also learned a lot from the
performance that opened the doors to his career _ an appearance in
Michael Jackson's ``Bad'' video. ``I was amazed by Michael's level
of concentration,'' he recalls. ``I thought if I could achieve
that, then people might react to me like they were reacting to
Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the tabloid headlines that dogged his rise to fame _
including his celebrated arrest in Florida after a high-speed chase
on his motorcycle, Snipes admits, ``No one can train you to be
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you deal with the loss of anonymity, the loss of
privacy? You have to be disciplined. You go back to what works.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes readily admits the biggest influence on his life and
career was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom told me something very simple _ 'Whatever you do, try
to be the best at it,''' he reveals.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made me study and read _ read, read, read. I remember
having a library card when I was about seven. It was mandatory that
I go to the library. My mom helped lay a foundation for me that I'm
now reaping with my success.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she gets the benefit, too. I get to send her around the
world. It's like, 'You want to travel, Mom? Go ahead. Wherever you
want.' It's a great feeling being able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes shared the thrill of his star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame with his mom. ``I thought someone was joking,'' he says.
``Nobody's nominated me for an Academy Award or even a People's
Choice. I didn't really think I was in the running. But it was a
hell of a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many cats from the Bronx have that kind of
experience!'' he chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not on location Snipes is usually at home in Malibu.
He shares custody of his son Jelani, 11, with his ex-wife, April,
from whom he was divorced in 1990. ``It's tough to be a good
father, and I'm definitely not cut out to be a stay-at-home dad,''
he says candidly, ``But Jelani and I have some nice times together,
and he would probably like to have me around a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes pauses to consider how he'd define what's behind his
screen image. ``If I end my career tomorrow,'' he says finally, ``I
don't want people saying, 'Oh, he's just an action guy, a sex
symbol ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be thought of as an actor.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore and George W. Bush would love to have the
voters' undivided attention. They are not going to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race is about to be overtaken by a big wave of
diversions and distractions, forcing Gore and Bush to compete with
the Summer Olympics; the U.S. Open tennis matches; the start of
football, basketball and hockey seasons; major league baseball
playoffs and a World Series stretching into late October.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates want people to believe this election really
matters. But pollsters report a deep and continuing attention
deficit among voters that is likely to get worse before it gets
better as America's romance with the excitement of televised
sporting events intrudes on a comparatively dull election.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis championships begin Aug. 28. Pro football season
opens Sept. 3. The Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will devour two
weeks of prime campaign time _ Sept. 15 to Oct. 1. Baseball
playoffs begin Oct. 3, pro hockey starts Oct. 4, the World Series
will open Oct. 21 and could run through Oct. 28, and professional
basketball play commences Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Election Day is Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves precious little time for the candidates to hold
their debates, maintain momentum and energize a disinterested
electorate that as yet exhibits no sense of urgency about its vital
responsibility for choosing the new leader of the free world.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the national political conventions, The Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press, which has been tracking the
high level of voter apathy all year, predicted that voter turnout
would slip lower than the disappointing 49 percent level of 1996.
Pew pollsters found that 44 percent of respondents did not follow
election news closely or at all, and 30 percent believe it does not
make much difference who is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research, which measures viewership among the
three major television broadcast networks, said the combined
audience dropped for both major conventions _ an estimated 11
percent below 1996 for the Democrats and 4 percent below 1996 for
the GOP. The CBS show ``Survivor'' drew an audience well in excess
of aggregate ratings for Gore's speech on all competing networks
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the challenge looms even larger for whichever
candidate is behind on Labor Day, Sept. 4, since it will be very
difficult to catch up while the focus of many voters is directed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always distractions, and these are bigger than most,
but you can't do anything about it,'' said Ari Fleischer, campaign
spokesman for Bush, the Republican nominee. ``You can't pause,
can't stop, you just run just as hard as you always do.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists claim to be unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have more than one attention span,'' insisted former
Democratic National Chairman Roy Roemer. ``They know this is an
important election. Nobody I know gets so absorbed in baseball or
the Olympics that they tune out what's happened to their schools,
what happens on their city council, or what's happening in the
political race.''
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, brushed aside questions
about how Gore will cope. ``There are no distractions,'' Daley
insisted. ``This happens every four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. The Olympic games usually are held much earlier in
the summer. The last time they came in the midst of a fall
presidential campaign was in l988, when Republican George Bush,
father of this year's GOP candidate, beat Democrat Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is nothing new about the football, basketball,
hockey and baseball schedules, those attractions inevitably shift
media and public attention away from arguments over the intricacies
of campaign finance reform, tax policy, budget priorities, school
vouchers and privatization schemes for Social Security, political
experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem we've been talking privately about all year,''
said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. ``It really interrupts the dynamic of
the campaign. The candidates struggle for notice and, of course,
that makes the debates even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly, Gore and Bush _ as well as Green Party nominee
Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan, standard bearer of one fork of the
Reform Party _ will be, at least temporarily, eclipsed by the likes
of Marion Jones, Jenny Thompson, Michael Johnson and Lance
Armstrong, all strong U.S. gold medal contenders in running,
swimming and cycling events at the Olympics. Not to mention the
entire U.S. women's soccer team.

IN SALZBURG, A BENEVOLENT ELDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 27)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ Pierre Boulez' ``Structures,'' Book 2, for
two pianos is music of uncompromising complexity. In this landmark
exploration of rigorous serial techniques, composed over several
years beginning in 1956, the pianos go at each other nonstop,
exchanging volatile volleys of notes with a ferocity that seems
almost free-form. At the time of its premiere, in 1961, the work
galvanized composers in the avant-garde and in academic circles.
Few people could have thought that it would ever reach outside to
mainstream audiences. Certainly not audiences at the Salzburg
Festival, then the most tradition-bound of all the prestigious
international music festivals.
</P>
<P>
   So it must have been deeply satisfying for Boulez _ or
perplexing, or amusing, or who knows what? _ when, at the
conclusion of the third of four recent concerts at the Salzburg
Festival in honor of his 75th birthday, an audience that nearly
filled the 1,500-seat Felsenreitschule burst into cheers after a
brilliant performance of that very work, the gnarly ``Structures,''
Book 2. The superb pianists were Pierre-Laurent Aimard and Florent
Boffard. Joining them on stage for the ovation, Boulez was called
back four times.
</P>
<P>
   Among the listeners were many younger people, the kind of music
lovers who would never have been at the Salzburg Festival 10 years
ago. But also in the audience were patrons dressed in evening
finery, the type of veteran festivalgoers who are more typically
seen next door in the best seats (about $320 each) at the Grosses
Festspielhaus for performances of Mozart and Strauss operas.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Boulez 2000 concerts, including two programs that
Boulez conducted with the London Symphony Orchestra, were well
attended and enthusiastically received. Once a cocksure
revolutionary, Boulez has become the benevolent elder of the
Salzburg Festival. On a particularly humid morning, one saw an
amazing thing: Latecomers, flushed and perspiring, scurrying into
the Festspielhaus, hoping that good seats were still available for
a free talk by Boulez.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Naturally, Boulez deserves most of the credit
for his own success. Perhaps he knew all along that there could be
a potential audience for work like his, even among concertgoers
reared on mainstream repertory.
</P>
<P>
   But Boulez's ascendancy at the Salzburg Festival is also due to
the efforts of Gerard Mortier, its artistic director since 1992.
When he arrived, Mortier vowed to shake the place up, to present
the opera repertory in boldly rethought productions, but most of
all to make the festival, finally, a hospitable place for living
composers as well as musicians from cultures far outside the
Austro-German heritage. One of his first acts was to appoint Boulez
composer in residence in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier has also relied on Hans Landesmann, the unsung hero of
the Mortier era. Landesmann is officially the intendant, or
executive director, of the festival. But since he has a musical
background, he has also served as the de facto artistic director of
concerts there. Under his leadership, the festival has complemented
Boulez's work by introducing other new-music offerings, like the
Composer Portraits programs, and the Next Generation series,
financed by the Los Angeles arts patron Betty Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   There was new music at Salzburg before Mortier's era, but not
much, and that, Landesmann explained recently, was kept to the
side, done out of obligation rather than enthusiasm. The climate
has changed for good.
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated event last summer was the premiere of
Luciano Berio's opera ``Cronaca del Luogo.'' Similarly, the most
important event of this summer was the premiere on Aug. 15 of Kaija
Saariaho's opera ``L'Amour de Loin,'' to a libretto by Amin
Maalouf, commissioned jointly by Salzburg, the Theatre du Chatelet
in Paris and the Santa Fe Opera. And prodding Mortier along in his
commitment to new opera has been Boulez, who praised Mortier's
sense of mission during his recent talk. As of now, a new opera
commissioned by the festival will be a highlight of every season:
Works by Matthias Pintscher, Wolfgang Rihm, Hans Werner Henze and
Olga Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the plan. Mortier is leaving after the season
next summer amid much contention. From the start, he faced
resistance among the festival's entrenched supporters, both public
and private, who had been content to see the event showcase lavish,
regally cast productions of operas by Mozart and Strauss, and
elegant concerts of traditional symphonic repertory performed with
silken excellence by the Vienna Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, as is well known, the backlash became more
pointed when the national elections gave the right-wing Freedom
Party the clout to claim a role in Austria's governing coalition.
Some talk from party leaders suggested that its members were a
little less than condemning of Nazi politics. And now, along with
alarming anti-immigrant cant from the government coalition have
come troubling cuts in social services.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier and his staff were appalled by the turn of events. They
also faced a dilemma. The Salzburg Festival has relied on
government funds, though much less than is generally thought. The
combined allocations from four public sources _ the Austrian
republic, the Salzburg tourist bureau, the city fund and the county
fund _ account for only 28 percent of the festival's budget (which
this year amounts to roughly $42 million). Over 50 percent comes
from ticket sales, a worrisomely high figure.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier's artistically exciting programs have proved costly and
run up deficits. But the government's pleas to rein in costs have
come amid political rhetoric about elitist contemporary music and
injunctions to maintain the country's artistic nationality. ``We
are told by some that the festival should be more Austrian,
whatever that means,'' Mortier said disdainfully, while introducing
the creators of ``L'Amour de Loin'' at a panel.
</P>
<P>
   Mortier's first response to the new government's challenge was
to announce his resignation as of this year. Among those who
persuaded him to change his mind was Boulez, who urged him to use
the post to make a point. So Mortier will turn the festival next
summer, his last, into a veritable celebration of multiculturalism,
then cede his post to Peter Ruzicka, a German composer and
conductor, and also an admiring colleague of Boulez, who
increasingly seems a power behind the scene.
</P>
<P>
   If Ruzicka continues to give Boulez a central role in the
Salzburg Festival, he should enjoy public support. Elsewhere
Boulez's very name may rattle classical-music audiences, but here
listeners seemed genuinely intrigued by his challenging music and
disarmed by his charming intelligence.

</P>
<P>
   On one level, the performances themselves assured a strong
response. In 1976, Aimard, then just 19, began an 18-year
association with Boulez's cutting-edge Ensemble Intercontemporain.
He is an extraordinary technician and a compelling musician. His
solo recital at the Mozarteum, the first of the Boulez 2000
concerts, was astonishing. He gave impressive accounts of works by
Messiaen, Bartok and George Benjamin. But especially in two early
works by Boulez, ``Notations'' and the First Piano Sonata, Aimard
brought lucid clarity, impetuosity, tenderness and great dabs of
color to fiendishly difficult piano music. As an encore he played a
work even many pianists consider formidable listening, Webern's
Variations (Op. 27), in a sensitive, involving and beguilingly
fanciful performance.
</P>
<P>
   In the third Boulez 2000 concert, at the Felsenreitschule the
next day, Aimard made Berg's harmonically wayward Sonata (Op. 1)
seem positively Brahmsian, gave a gripping account of Schoenberg's
breakthrough Five Piano Pieces (Op. 23) and, with the excellent
flutist Sophie Cherrier, offered a continually imaginative
performance of Boulez's early Flute Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   Then Aimard's younger colleague, Boffard, a member of the
Ensemble Intercontemporain since 1988, joined him in
``Structures,'' Book 2. Music gets no more formidable than this.
But no matter how many musical events tumbled on one another _
darting contrapuntal lines, splatterings of notes, undulating
shimmers, hellbent outbursts of chords that climaxed with clusters
played with the flats of the hands and forearms _ the music sped by
with uncanny clarity. This work may be tough to comprehend, but as
played here, it made you giddy with amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the impact of Boulez's music was in part a reaction to
the soupy neo-Romanticism that has become so fashionable in the
last 20 years. However momentarily placating, some of those
sumptuously scored neo-Romantic works just don't stay with you. But
Boulez's music is something genuine and ingenious. Everyone must at
least concede that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, listeners may be more willing to take a chance on
Boulez's music because over the years he has earned their gratitude
as a conductor. His conducting was always technically deft and
intellectually solid. In his mature years he has allowed his
music-making, and his own works, to become more elegant, pliant and
playful.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pieces he performed here with the London Symphony he
had already presented with the orchestra at Carnegie Hall last
season, including Mahler's Sixth Symphony, given a somewhat fussy
account. Peter Eotvos' ``zeroPoints'' and Neuwirth's
``Clinamen/Nodus,'' works commissioned for these birthday tours,
are stronger for their explorations of tremulous colors and sounds
than for their motivic cogency and rhythmic sway. Emanuel Ax made
Schoenberg's 12-tone Piano Concerto seem the most lyrical music
ever written. Boulez's performance of Stravinsky's ``Petrouchka''
was a revelation; I heard intricate inner voices and layered
happenings in this familiar music that I had never known were
there.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for outsiders to say that Austria must come to terms
with its fears of immigration and cultural change. Boulez is an
outsider himself. And in helping Mortier open the festival to new
music and bracing works by living composers, he has made it a more
stimulating place to hear the ``Jupiter'' Symphony and ``Don
Giovanni.'' Their opponents should remember that in his own day
Mozart was a challenging composer of contemporary music. It's safe
to say what side he would be on in Salzburg today.

&HT;     RENO DEFENDS DECISION AGAINST APPOINTING GORE COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Wednesday strongly
defended her decision against appointing a special counsel to
investigate Vice President Al Gore's fund-raising efforts four
years ago, removing a potentially troublesome obstacle in Gore's
quest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because further investigation is not likely to result in a
prosecutable case I have concluded that a special counsel is not
warranted,'' Reno said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the heart of everything we care about in this
country _ that you don't pursue a case where there is no basis for
concluding that you can make a case,'' Reno added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign welcomed the decision. If Reno had appointed
an outside counsel, the vice president could have been dogged by
investigators while campaigning for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is running in a close race against Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with today's Justice Department announcement,''
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. ``But our focus is going to
remain where it has always been _ which is on using our prosperity
to help America's families.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision marked the third time she has rejected an
independent investigation of the vice president. In this instance,
Reno shot down the recommendation of Robert Conrad, head of a
Justice Department campaign task force.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad wanted Reno to appoint an outside counsel to determine
whether Gore lied during an April interview with investigators
about a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in California and
fund-raising ``coffees'' held at the White House. The events were
part of efforts to raise money for the Clinton-Gore re-election
campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that she personally reviewed the transcript of the
Gore interview, Reno said the vice president's comments are
``neither false statements nor perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've concluded that there is no reasonable possibility that
further investigation could develop evidence that would support the
filing of charges for making a willful false statement,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno praised Conrad as ``an excellent prosecutor,'' she
said her decision amounted to a ``disagreement among lawyers.''
Conrad was not alone in recommending an outside counsel. Reno said
at least two other advisers agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she ``struggled'' with the decision, which she
finalized over the weekend, and conceded that Republicans might
renew attacks on her for protecting the vice president, the
Democratic candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno countered that the action was based on legal
considerations, not politics. ``I don't do things based on
politics. I realize that politics will be hurled around my head. I
just sit there and duck as it comes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno's decision is a relief to the Gore campaign,
Republicans are not likely to let the vice president off the hook
as the presidential campaign tightens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a statement, reiterated Republican contentions that
Gore ``engaged in a number of questionable fund-raising activities
and gave the FBI statements that continue to raise the issue of his
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that ``the American people are sick and tired of all
these scandals and investigations. The best way to put all these
scandals and investigations behind us is to elect someone new.''

A COMPLETE WEBERN, WITH `NEW' WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The complete recording of Anton Webern's output just released by
Deutsche Grammophon does much more than refute old and sterile
arguments against serialism. But that it does, and overwhelmingly.
Webern _ always a close observer of his teacher Schoenberg, though,
as an essentially lyrical composer, thoroughly independent _ took
up Schoenberg's new serial technique in 1924 and never looked back.
For the rest of his life, 21 years, he went on delighting in the
opportunities serialism presented for making patterns: patterns
like those of the snowflakes, flowers and crystals he admired in
the Austrian mountains, patterns that would support his music's
exquisite strains of melody and be supported by them.
</P>
<P>
   He was making patterns with the past, too. Serialism
reinvigorated for him the standard forms, especially variations and
canon. And it brought him closer to the old masters. Starting with
his Symphony (1927-28), most of his movements are canons of one
kind or another, often allowing an expressive gesture to be
answered, balanced and pinpointed by a copy moving in the other
direction, a lift by a sigh, along the course of a regularly waving
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Canonic and variation forms were also outcomes of a quest for
integration, for creating music in which a motif of three or four
notes would be constantly present in different colorings,
registrations and rhythmic placements. Hence the paradox that the
music feels, expressively, so fragile that it might fall apart if
one put a finger on it and yet, structurally, it is tightly made
and reinforced in every direction. It is at once tender and tough.
</P>
<P>
   As for links with predecessors, that same symphony, although it
has just two movements, is scored for chamber orchestra and lasts
less than 10 minutes, has something of the grand melodic sweep
Webern admired in Bruckner. The concerto that came soon after is a
modern ``Brandenburg,'' and Bach is invoked again in the two
cantatas on spiritual themes that came near the end of Webern's
life.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Webern outfaced his nostalgia by resolute
adherence to the new means he had devised for himself, with cues
from Schoenberg, and by steady exploration of their possibilities.
He never worried that his music, in essential respects, sounded
quite unlike anything that had come before or was being written
around him. He just went on, with exemplary persistence. He had no
way of knowing that the vacuum in which he worked would rapidly be
filled after his death, not least by Stravinsky, who learned a lot
from his music in the 1950s, but also by many younger composers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eager Webernians then was Pierre Boulez, who returns
to be the mastermind of the new recordings, just as he was 30 years
ago for a set made by CBS, now available on CD from Sony Classical.
But there are differences. One is that the new box (Deutsche
Grammophon 457 637-2; six CDs) is twice as large, including many
works Webern withheld from publication.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these are juvenilia, imparting the unsurprising news
that the composer at 16 was a talented, hopeful, somewhat
incompetent beginner. His later rejects, though, include wonderful
pieces, especially among the songs and instrumental movements he
wrote in 1913 and 1914. During that period he gave thought to a
sequence of orchestral pieces, some with solo soprano, rather in
the manner of a distilled Mahler symphony. There might have been a
similar string quartet with voice. Much later, though, Webern
decided to issue sets of purely instrumental movements: the Six
Bagatelles (Op. 9) for string quartet and the Five Pieces (Op. 10)
for orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   This left out of account not only the song movements _ two with
orchestra and the one with quartet are breathtaking _ but also
quite a number of orchestral movements. Boulez includes five, and
two extra bagatelles.
</P>
<P>
   A CD player can be programmed to present, say, Opus 9 followed
by the two unselected bagatelles and, to end, the song with
quartet, which not only provides a passionate slow finale but also
leaves a clue to the music's expressive core, in a sense of grief
and loss. Similarly, one can reconstruct a vocal symphony, which
would have to include an alarming brassy piece (No. 3 among the
additional orchestral movements) and the magical setting of a
Stefan George poem, with its delicious spot for voice and
percussion, and its penultimate gesture of a huge rise from the
singer on the word ``holy.''
</P>
<P>
   These and many other pieces sound, here, marvelous to perform.
All the string quartets and trios are played by the Emerson String
Quartet, which, strong and expressive, makes every little miniature
sound big. Nearly all the songs, and the soprano parts in the
cantatas, are sung by Christiane Oelze, for whom the music seems to
have been waiting. Defying gravity, Oelze moves with ease through
the enormous pitch intervals Webern loved and makes them beautiful
and true, keen points in the continuing phrase and markers of
exaltation or anguish.

</P>
<P>
   Her contributions include, happily, all the songs with piano,
which again embrace remarkable items Webern did not publish: the
Five Dehmel Lieder of 1906-8, right on the bright moonlit borders
of atonality; and 4 George songs from the next year, in addition to
the 10 published as Opuses 3 and 4. Webern changed his mind about
the planning of these cycles, eventually deciding that each should
have an introduction followed by four songs in which the singing
persona's feelings are reflected in nature (Op. 3) or in a tragic
relationship (Op. 4). The numbers thus omitted are well worth
hearing, especially when sung so well _ and played so well, by Eric
Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Among other exceptional pianists at work here are Pierre-Laurent
Aimard, in the quartet with saxophone and the concerto, and
Krystian Zimerman, in the Variations (Op. 27) and two other pieces.
Zimerman gives a beautiful account of the variations: the finale,
highly effective, has wide-spanning melodies, often violent and
gentle in the same breath, searching in a musical space that comes
to be defined by chord resonances in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But of course the performer who figures most prominently and
comprehensively is Boulez, as conductor. To an astonishing degree,
his tempos are close to those of his earlier recordings. Yet
consistency of timing is deceptive, for within identical spans a
lot has changed. Boulez is working here with the Berlin
Philharmonic and the Ensemble Intercontemporain: musicians who have
a much fuller appreciation than anyone did three decades ago of
Webern's flow, dependent on subtle phrasing and a chamber-musical
responsiveness of one player or section to another.
</P>
<P>
   Where, for instance, the arrangement Webern made of the six-part
ricercar from Bach's ``Musical Offering'' almost fell apart in the
1969 London Symphony recording, the new version is secure and even
imposing. The earlier performances of the original works often
sound scrappy and preliminary, and though the first clarinet in the
symphony achieves some suavity in rather torn textures, the same
part emerges in the later recording far more gorgeous and
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there are losses as well. The spikiness Boulez found
in this repertory when he was in his mid-40s was not just a result
of unconsidered playing: it came from a conviction that the music
was fierce and that it mattered. Witness, for example, the swing
between aggressiveness and recuperation in the second movement of
the symphony, or the way the choral women in the third movement of
the Second Cantata seem to sing with teeth bared, like Valkyries.
These moments are more beautiful in the later recordings but not
necessarily more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   There are also performances in the earlier set that will not be
supplanted, like the account of the two Rilke poems, with Heather
Harper, or the many appearances of another soprano, Halina
Lukomska, whose flaming voice is so different from Oelze's but
equally apt.
</P>
<P>
   Something else has happened to Webern during the last three
decades: we know far more about his life, and about his opinions,
which were not all edifying. His pursuit of purity in his music _
of complete homogeneity and integration, of absolute precision in
the minutest detail _ and the high value he placed on German
culture led him, crazily and dismayingly, to consider that his
ideals were shared by the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   He was not an anti-Semite. Indeed, he helped conceal Jews in
Vienna. But he seems to have thought that Hitler was some kind of
agent of spiritual regeneration, and that the spreading Nazi
conquests of 1939 to 1941 were all to the benefit of the nations
overcome: this even though the annexation of Austria in 1938 had
put an end to his activity as a conductor and to any hopes he had
of hearing his music again, other than in neutral Switzerland. The
Nazis closed his public career. And yet, privately, he applauded
them.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this, we might want to listen to the Variations for
orchestra of 1940 a little more carefully and a little more
critically: to pay less attention, perhaps, to the coherence and
symmetry the music so ostentatiously exhibits than to the delicacy,
strangeness and variety of its component parts, and even to insist,
contra Webern, on multiplicity and ambiguity as essential elements
in his art.
</P>
<P>
   More useful, too, than dismissing him for his foolish views
would be to learn from his example of magnificent but, in crucial
respects, misaligned idealism. Snowflakes and flowers are all very
well, and we need them, but their rules are not those of politics.

   RUSSIA-SUB _ MURMANSK, Russia _ Russian President Vladimir Putin
has called for a national day of mourning Wednesday, but will not
be here with relatives for a church service to remember the 118

   US-MEXICO _ WASHINGTON _ Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox is
scheduled to meet with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
Thursday. It will be the first time that a U.S. president has met
with any Mexican president that is a not a member of the former
ruling party, the PRI. Fox, who is popular among Mexican immigrants
in the United States, has made issues such as immigration and
foreign investment key issues in his presidency. What does the U.S.

sunning themselves on Tybee Island on the Georgia coast. They have
spent the month of August in a tent when not helping thousands of
other fire fighters battle the raging wildfires in Montana. They
join other Georgians on the scene, like Bobby Kitchens. The
Chatsworth, Ga., resident is a biologist for the U.S. Forest

   FIRESTONE _ The Firestone tire models voluntarily recalled Aug.
9 are also failing on sport utility vehicles other than the Ford
Explorer, but when an Explorer loses its tire tread it is six times
as likely to roll over and kill someone, federal accident data
shows. An analysis of the of 642 Firestone and Explorer-related
accident reports that the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration has collected since early this year shows that the
rate at which tire treads are coming apart are comparable whether
the Firestone tires are on Ford's popular Explorer or on other
sport utility vehicles. However, the analysis indicates that what
happens after the tread peals away is strikingly different. The
results of the analysis, which was performed by the American
Statesman, appeared to support the allegations of lawyers and
safety advocates who have claimed that the Explorer has played a
role in the catastrophic tire failures being reported nationwide.

   RESTSTOPS _ Georgia's interstate rest stops have helped boost

crisis. Many rest areas along South Carolina's highways are filfthy
and some are even considered dangerous. A rash of robberies that
began in February and culminated with a violent attack on an
elderly woman in Sumter County in June has forced South Carolina's
politicians to sit up and take notice. And today, a task force

<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents have long shuddered at the thought of their little ones
inhaling the germ-ridden air of day care centers, where every
sniffle, cough or sneeze seems pregnant with disease.
</P>
<P>
   But it may actually be healthy in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Arizona found that children who were exposed to
day care centers at an early age were less likely to develop asthma
when they were older. Their theory is that exposure to viruses and
bacteria when very young girds the immune system against asthma
developing later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to put one's child in day care depends on many
factors. But parents from families with histories of asthma might
want to go ahead and expose their child to more children early in
life,'' said Dr. Thomas Ball, assistant professor of clinical
pediatrics at the University of Arizona, and co-author of the study
of published in the current New England Journal of Medicine.
``Infants who were exposed to more children in or outside of the
house were almost half as likely to develop asthma later in
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The counter-intuitive finding may be a clue in a long-running
medical mystery: what causes asthma and why have asthma cases
skyrocketed in the last 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are almost certain there is a genetic component but
the environmental triggers remain murky. Pollution was once thought
the culprit but lost luster after a series of studies in the 1990s
found lower asthma rates among residents of heavily-polluted East
German cities than in their cleaner West German counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona study appears to lend weight to the contender now in
vogue, the so-called Hygiene Hypothesis, which says: modern
improvements in hygiene that limit exposure to disease early in
life produces weaker, more asthma-vulnerable, immune systems later
in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Arizona study) does seem to support that hypothesis,''
said Dr. Hans Oettgen, clinical director of immunology at
Children's Hospital. ``But it's still at the state where it is a
hypothesis. It hasn't been nailed down with 100 percent
certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is considered a major public health nuisance, affecting
the lives of almost 15 million Americans, nearly a third of them
children, with its recurring bouts of breathlessness and wheezing.
Severe asthma attacks can be fatal. The condition occurs when the
lungs are clogged with sticky mucus that restricts airflow.
</P>
<P>
   Sufferers must often carry around bronchodilators or take
anti-inflammatory drugs. Childhood asthma grows milder with age but
could permanently reduce lung capacity by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Oettgen cautioned that the Arizona study does not mean hesitant
parents should rush their children to the nearest day care center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to hesitate when talking about exposing your
kids to anything,'' he said. ``A lot of infections still have bad
outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in an editorial accompanying the study, whimsically
titled ``Please, Sneeze on my Child,'' Dr. Sandra Christiansen of
the Scripps Research Institute in California wrote: ``For those of
us who share the furtive guilt of having left marginally ill
toddlers at day care, these findings also offer a sense of
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona researchers were even more confident about their
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infections early in life help steer infants developing immune
response towards a non-allergic road,'' said Ball.
</P>
<P>
   But Ball and his colleagues stressed their study is only a small
piece in the quest to understand and prevent asthma. The condition
has exploded around the world in the last two decades but not
uniformly. It's prevalence increased by 30 percent in Australia and
Britain but only 2 percent in China.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma tends to run in families but that doesn't guarantee an
asthma sufferer's child will have it. Some environmental risk
factors have been identified: smoking by parents, indoor exposure
to allergens, absence of breast-feeding and a diet high in a
certain type of fat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, an English researcher found that children from large
families, where illness is more common, were less likely to have
hay fever. This launched the Hygeiene Hypothesis. Soon studies were
produced that showed kids exposed to pets early in life were less
likely to have allergies, as was the case with kids who grow up on
farms _ both environments alive with allergens and potential lung
irritants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still don't know the cause,'' said Ball.

STAPLES TO TRY `BRICK AND CLICK' KIOSKS IN 20 STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to offer customers more convenience through a ``bricks
and clicks'' strategy, Staples Inc. it will test kiosks linked to
its retail Web site in about 20 of its 1,200 office-supply
superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``business solutions centers,'' the kiosks let customers
order online with or without the help of a Staples associate. If an
item is out of stock at a store or the customer wants to place an
unusually large order, the customer can opt to buy it from the
Staples.com Web site and get next-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A kiosk linked to Staples.com gives a customer access to a much
wider range of goods than can be stocked in a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business solutions centers are the ultimate in
bricks-and-clicks retailing,'' Staples chief executive Thomas G.
Stemberg said Wednesday. ``We are transforming our business by
bringing the online world to store shoppers. By integrating our
stores with Staples.com and its extensive offering of both products
and business services, we are truly becoming a one-stop destination
for all the needs of small business.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rebecca Zitomer, director of Staples business solutions,
``Many of our customers don't know Staples.com yet. The business
solutions centers are a way to introduce those customers to
Staples.com and show them how easy it is to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Staples' recent focus has been to offer services such as
business-tax preparation, payroll processing, and Web-site design
to the same small-business customers who buy its paper clips and
pencils. The store kiosk is another way to raise awareness about
these new services Staples is offering.
</P>
<P>
   In e-commerce circles, it was once thought a retailer that
launched a Web site might take away business from its stores. But
now the conventional wisdom is that the best retailers will offer
customers three ways to buy merchandise _ in a store, from a retail
Web site, and through a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Under this model, the customer gets to choose which is the most
convenient way to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Staples originally placed Internet-linked kiosks in its handful
of airport stores. Business travelers could order what they needed
at Logan International Airport and have it delivered to a hotel or
business meeting in another city.
</P>
<P>
   Now a larger variation of that kiosk will be tested in Staples
conventional superstores. If tests are successful, business
solutions centers will be installed in more stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has made some Staples investors nervous. While
store sales continue to be strong, the company's investment in
Staples.com has been a drag on recent earnings.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, Staples shares have lost nearly 20 percent of their
value since the beginning of the year. Wednesday shares of the
Framingham, Mass. company closed down 27 cents at $16.38.

HEAD FOR HOUSTON FOR A ROAMIN' ROMAN HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ANDREW MARTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can't possibly hop an Alitalia flight to Rome to do as
the Romans do, or if the Rome of the Trevi Fountain and the
Vatican's St. Peter's Square is about as accessible as sharing a
gelato with Sophia Loren, here's the next best thing. Rent a Fiat
or splurge on a Lamborghini, and head on down the highway to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   DESTINATION: ``The Splendor of Rome: The 18th Century,'' at the
new Audrey Jones Beck Building of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston,
at 5601 Main St. The exhibit runs through Sept. 17. For more
information, call (713) 639-7540.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO READ BEFORE LEAVING: It might not strike one immediately
as ``travel guide lite'' but the German writer J.W. Goethe took the
time to pen ``Italian Journey'' (available in a glorious
translation by W.H. Auden), which covered many things rustic and
refined in Italy in the latter part of the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO LISTEN TO WHILE DRIVING DOWN: Rapturous melodies of
almost anything by Domenico Scarlatti or, better still, ``The Four
Seasons'' by Antonio Vivaldi.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU'LL SEE AT THE SHOW: A staggering presentation of 400
paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, maps, architectural
models, furniture and decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU MIGHT BUY: Peruse the museum store's cache of
hand-painted Italian pottery, ceramic plates and urns ($80-$400).
Or, take home a $15 CD titled ``Music, 18th century and Rome''
featuring uplifting melodies by Mozart and Handel, among others.
And for those who can't possibly leave the gift shop without a
little something, there is always the $45 necktie festooned with a
map of 18th-century Rome.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO EAT AFTER A DAY AT THE EXHIBITION: Drop in on the Grotto
restaurant, 20 minutes away from the museum at 3920 Westheimer.
Grotto will replenish all the gray matter exhausted by the
exhibition with such signature dishes as trout Mandorlata (the fish
is almond-crusted and embellished by artichoke hearts and tomatoes,
all swimming in a white wine sauce); or orecchiette con rapini,
little-ear pasta gussied up with broccoli rabe, olive oil, garlic
and Italian bread crumbs. Or take the credit card out for a more
vigorous walk at the nearby River Oaks Shopping Center, and stop in
at La Griglia (2002 W. Gray St.) to sample its shrimp-and-crab
cheesecake or ``snapper La Griglia,'' grilled fish crowned with
lump crab meat and napped in a grape essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``''Buon appetito e buon viaggio.''''

PRODUCING DVDS WITH LAVISH EXTRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a sunny afternoon in the large library of a
large house in Bel Air, the director Richard Donner, the writer Tom
Mankiewicz and a group of production people from Warner Brothers
are watching Donner's ``Superman'' on a 50-inch television screen.
It is doomsday on the planet Krypton and the patriarch Jor-El,
played by Marlon Brando, regards his infant son, whom he is about
to send to Earth in an escape pod. ``The kid's diapers are worth a
fortune,'' Donner says. ``Brando's dialogue is on them.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge hit when it was released in 1978, ``Superman,'' with
Christopher Reeve as the man of steel and a superb cast including
Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford and Ned Beatty, is still
remembered as one of the more entertaining action fantasies. On the
Internet, fans have been clamoring for a special edition on digital
video disc, and early next year Warner will oblige with a DVD
packed with extras, including an alternate version of the movie
with added scenes; two documentaries; screen tests; deleted scenes;
the screenplay with the director's notations; music outtakes;
trailers and myriad other items.
</P>
<P>
   The new, longer version will incorporate nine minutes Donner cut
in 1978. ``Usually there's closure with the films you make,'' he
said, ``but `Superman' has hung on to me. A lot of it has to do
with Christopher Reeve. I have a desire to see it fresh, to go back
to some of the things I had taken out editorially way back then.
For me, it's exciting to have my voice out there, to share how it
was done, why.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc gives him that chance. As DVD becomes more widespread,
viewers are increasingly paying attention to extra features that
illuminate and explain. Six months ago, according to an industry
study, consumers ranked enhanced sound as DVD's leading attribute,
followed by better picture quality, disc durability, no rewinding
and the widescreen format, which flattens the image into the
dimensions it had on the theater screen. The highest-ranking extra,
the director's commentary, was far down the line. Now, though,
supplements not only are more familiar, but they are also becoming
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Occupying two sides of a high-capacity disc called an 18 (for 18
gigabytes), ``Superman'' joins a fast-growing breed of fully loaded
special editions that stand stacked up like jumbo jets on fall and
winter release schedules. As demand increases, studios are taking
more care to rummage their archives and, as is the case with
``Superman,'' are putting a level of effort into producing their
major DVDs that in some ways emulates the kind of attention
directors themselves give to their films.
</P>
<P>
   What viewers get out of this depends on their degree of
interest, of course, but even as amusements the supplements impart
a good deal of information.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon Donner is recording a director's commentary aided
by Mankiewicz, who is listed in the credits as ``creative
consultant'' but who also wrote the final screenplay, for which
Mario Puzo and three others were credited. They are kidding about
the diapers, but Brando, renowned for not memorizing lines, needed
cue cards and other prompters spread around the set. It's the kind
of anecdote made for DVD, and ``Superman'' benefits from having its
principals still around to talk. Also, movies from decades ago
frequently don't have as much of an archive to draw from.
``Superman'' had 8 tons of it, including 1.25 million feet of film.
Some was in France, but most was at Pinewood Studios in London,
where the movie was made. Since February a team from Warner has
been winnowing bits and pieces for the disc, overseen by Michael
Thau, a film editor and Donner's DVD man.
</P>
<P>
   Projects this large emphasize the bifurcated position DVD finds
itself in these days: disc as both tool and plaything. Supplements
have been on laser discs since the early 1980s, but now studios are
in competition to accumulate as many extras as possible (a new
``Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' DVD lists 40). In the early days of
DVD, one dictum held that the movie and its extras should fit on
one side of one disc _ and they still do for most movies. But the
biggest DVDs are running over onto two discs or, like ``Superman,''
onto the back side of one disc. Many DVDs, in fact, are spilling
off the discs entirely and onto the Internet, offering, through
DVD-ROM drives in personal computers, interactive, movie-related
activities like games and chat rooms, live discussions with
directors and, of course, links to the company store.
</P>
<P>
   Warner has not decided what ``Superman'' features, if any, will
go on the Internet. The Web also makes a good repository for a
screenplay or documentary that won't fit on the discs. One can
consult the screenplay and storyboards on the Web, then jump to the
exact spot in the film on the disc. That can be instructive, but it
also can get silly. Toss in a game or two (there will be no games
with ``Superman'') and DVD is pushed to the edge of arcade
entertainment. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but at
the studios serious efforts to illuminate films _ and they usually
are relatively serious _ also recognize that supplements are pop
diversions for many viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Directors just want to see their work out there, or as much of
it as possible. ``When I started, I had to take a portable DVD
player to their office, plug it in and walk them through what it
did,'' said Michael Stradford, executive director of DVD marketing
at Columbia Tri-Star. ``I really had to convince them it was going
to be a viable format. Now they call and say, `Hey, I've got some
stuff for the DVD.'''
</P>
<P>
   Disc has become the reality in the afterlife of their films. Or
as Oliver Stone put it recently: ``DVD has a longer shelf life. For
me, it's the record of what you did. Film is not going to hold
up.'' This fall Warner will issue a set of 10 Stone films
strenuously worked on by the director. DVD is at least an
opportunity to gather and show everything that was involved, to
explain, to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Some directors have their doubts about supplements, of course.
Like viewers, most filmmakers value DVD for the enhanced image and
sound and the widescreen format. ``Videotape I have hated since it
was invented,'' said the director Frank Darabont (``The Shawshank
Redemption,'' ``The Green Mile''). ``It's the worst possible medium
for watching a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Having his films in their original widescreen dimensions pleases
him, but other aspects of DVD don't. ``What I'm not crazy about are
the audio commentaries,'' he said. ``We live in a world with too
much cultural white noise, and I feel why add to it? So many people
explaining themselves, saying how brilliant they are. Adding all
that tends to demystify how we do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, he will make a commentary for a special
edition of ``The Green Mile.'' Fans of the film helped persuade
him, he said.

LOS ANGELES: him, he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not known how often viewers sit through commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Some DVDs have several of them, not only by directors but also
by stars, producers, cinematographers and others. It is great fun
to settle in with Robert Altman for a movie-length discussion of
``The Player.'' On ``The Limey,'' the director Steven Soderbergh
and the writer Lem Dobbs hotly argue their separate conceptions of
the film. Ordinarily, though, commentaries are a snooze, little
more than a vapid and usually self-serving recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting this stuff down for posterity, so they rarely
get negative,'' said Douglas Pratt, editor of the Laser Disc
Newsletter. As a reviewer of DVDs, Pratt is obliged to listen to
all the commentaries. ``Once in a while you get a director who's a
wonderful teacher,'' he said, mentioning Ridley Scott (``Thelma and
Louise'') and Martha Coolidge (``Rambling Rose''). ``Generally,
though, they guard themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Donner is not averse to a Brando tale or two among other
anecdotes or to taking a swipe at the secretive and famously
tight-fisted ``Superman'' producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind,
with whom the director had continual rows and legal difficulties.
But the disc is mainly a tale of movie revival. Thau's first step
was to make new prints from the camera negative, which had seen a
lot of use. Then he color-timed the film, assigning colors and
shading to each frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVD is such a good transfer, the film itself has to look as
good as possible,'' he said. Later the film was transferred to
digital tape, from which the DVD is made. The tape has a higher
resolution than disc and on studio screens has an amazingly clear
look that approaches high definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when you transfer to DVD, you aren't losing anything,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he was restoring John Williams' score _ one of
the first to be recorded in Dolby stereo _ as well as the dialogue
and the sound effects. A movie made in 1978 has a different sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were distinctive, signature effects,'' he said.
Identifying and preparing all the sound elements took several
months. Remixing them into Dolby 5.1 surround sound took six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thau was flying around the country gathering
interviews for the two documentaries. One, about the making of the
film, talks with principal actors _ including Reeve, Hackman and
Kidder _ and production people. On a snippet of tape, Reeve
describes his role as ``temporary custodian of a past that was an
essential piece of American mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   The other documentary will describe the special effects,
reveling in the demands of those antiquarian predigital times.
(With no digital assist, Superman flew on a wire.) In a third
feature _ or ``featurette,'' in DVD lingo _ Anne Archer, Stockard
Channing, Lesley Ann Warren and Deborah Raffin audition for the
role of Lois Lane, won by Kidder. In the clips the ``S'' has not
yet been sewn on Superman's cape.
</P>
<P>
   At Warner, 60 DVD projects might be in development at once. A
special-effects blockbuster like ``The Matrix'' is the prize.
``There are so many more layers of craftsmanship that you can
explore and discuss as opposed to the standard drama,'' said
Jonathan Gaines, founder of Acoustic Visions, an independent
company that helps put together special editions for Warner and
other studios. For big films, directors and movie companies are
shooting behind the scenes with DVD in mind. ``If they know it will
be a hit, they'll bring me in before the movie comes out,'' Gaines
said. ``For `The Matrix,' we got in touch with the producers before
they started filming. Luckily they were very DVD-savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for ``The Matrix,'' which is DVD's top seller. Older
films, coming to DVD years after the fact, often have to scramble
for material. Deleted scenes and outtakes have been lost. Families
and estates have to be consulted, leading to delay and
complication. There are no such problems with ``Superman,'' thanks
primarily to Donner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual for an older production company to come in and
revisit a film,'' said Ned Price, Warner's vice president of
technical mastering operations. ``Very few have survived from the
'70s. Here we know we'll get something pleasing to the director and
have a lot more artistic freedom. They can alter what they like.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point all the ``Superman'' supplements will come
together in a chilly room at a Warner company called CVC out by the
Los Angeles airport. At CVC, computers churn 24 hours a day mixing
elements of scores of DVDs. When the ``multiplexing'' is done, the
package is sent to the replicator, who sends back the ``glass,'' or
test disc. One afternoon recently, several technicians were
intently examining the glass of the moment: Stone's ``Any Given
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone could well be described as the ultimate DVD
director. At the very least, he opens himself to grabbing a second
chance to alter a film. Some filmmakers shy from the term
``director's cut'' because it implies that they settled for less
when the movie was released. For Stone, a film is never really
finished. ``Any Given Sunday,'' his 1999 professional football
story starring Al Pacino, will be released separately from the
other Stone DVDs when the film comes out on videocassette next
month. Later it will join the set of 10 with a commentary added.
</P>
<P>
   As with most Stone films, the point is length. ``We rushed for
December,'' he said, referring to the movie's opening last year in
theaters. ``I'm proud of the film. I'm not running from it. It was
2:42. My film. We cut it to 2:30 for Europe. Meanwhile, the DVD
deal bought me time and space to work. My editor is still
working.'' This film and ``Nixon'' will be ``director's cuts,''
with alterations mixed into the original movie. For the other
discs, deleted scenes, outtakes, alternate beginnings and whatever
else will be added, not integrated.
</P>
<P>
   He has added 24 minutes and 42 seconds to ``Nixon,'' which now
runs 190 minutes. ``It's a better movie at three and a half,'' he
said. (Make that almost four.) ``DVD is the perfect medium to do
this kind of thing because people can watch half or whatever, walk
out and come back to it the next night.'' So take a break. ``I've
added 25 minutes of great scenes and changed the order of the
second half of the scenes, which changes the nature of the film.''
It could change again. ``You don't want to say everything,'' he
continued, ``things you don't feel like saying right now. You want
to think about them some more, go back to those films that you
didn't complete in some way. Maybe when I'm 80 I'll go back and
recut `JFK.' Is that wrong?''

INSTALLING A SCANNER WITH WINDOWS 98
</HEADLINE>
 (Circuits)  
 By J.D.BIERSDORFER 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How difficult would it be for a mere novice to add a photo
scanner to a Windows 98 computer?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. All things considered, it is probably not as hard to add a
scanner to a Windows 98 system as it is with earlier versions of
Windows. Windows 98 can even detect and install the needed driver
software for several scanner models, including ones made by UMAX,
Hewlett-Packard and Logitech. That is not to say that only scanners
by these manufacturers will work with Windows 98; it just means
that you may have to do a manual installation for the drivers from
the floppy disks or CD-ROM that come with a new scanner.
</P>
<P>
   After you have followed the manufacturer's instructions for
attaching the scanner to your computer, restart it and see if
Windows detects the new hardware. If you do not get a message
saying that Windows has found new hardware, go to the Start menu,
then to Settings and Control Panel, and double-click on Add New
Hardware. Follow the instructions of the New Hardware Wizard as it
takes you through the process.
</P>
<P>
   After you are finished with the wizard, you will probably need
to install additional software for the scanner itself, following
the manufacturer's instructions. Once you have completed the
installation process described in your scanner's instructions, you
may want to test the new hardware. Go back to the Start menu, then
Settings and Control Panel, and double-click on the Scanners and
Cameras icon. Pick the name of your new scanner from the list and
click on Properties. Click on Test Scanner or Camera, and Windows
will check whether your scanner is hooked up and working properly.
If you encounter difficulties, you may want to take advantage of
the scanner's technical support contact information.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard of something that is referred to as WAP. and
believe that it is related to the wireless world, but I'm not
really sure. Can you explain?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. WAP stands for Wireless Application Protocol, and it is
indeed related to the world of wireless devices. Just as there are
standards for regulating how data is sent around the Internet, WAP
sets a standard for how data is sent between wireless devices like
handheld computers, Web-enabled cell phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the monochrome screens on these types of mobile devices
are quite small and are not generally navigated with a mouse or
full-size keyboard, the pages displayed on them are created
differently. The WAP system uses something called Wireless Markup
Language _ a sort of optimized version of the Hypertext Markup
Language, or HTML, used for regular Web pages _ to display the
content on the wireless units. For more details on WAP, visit
www.wap.com or www.wapforum.org.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am thinking about adding more RAM to my computer, and I
would like to know how I can find out how much it can take. Where
can I look for that information?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The manual that came with your computer, if you still have
it, is one of the best places to find out how much and what kind of
RAM you can add to your system. If you no longer have the manual,
you might try looking up your model on the manufacturer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   There are many kinds of RAM, and some computers need to have the
chips installed in a specific manner or quantity. An excellent
place to look for information is on the Web sites of the memory
makers, like Kingston Technology (www.kingston.com) and Viking
Components (www.vikingcomponents.com). Both sites have interactive
configuration worksheets that will let you select your computer
maker and model, then will tell you how much RAM your system can
hold and what kind to buy. You can usually buy RAM right there on
the site.  &QL;

&HT;     WHERE ARE THE FEMINISTS IN THIS CAMPAIGN? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where are the prominent women activists in this
election? Their silence is deafening. They are not high-voltage
players this time around.
</P>
<P>
   They are invisible except for the ever-loving wives and
daughters of Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
whom they tout as perfect husbands and fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, featured at the Republican National Convention,
praised her husband as a family man, not like you-know-who. She
also took a few veiled potshots at President Clinton, saying the
American people want someone they can ``respect'' in the White
House, someone who will uphold its dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, before introducing her husband, boogied on the
stage of the Democratic National Convention and brought the
delegates to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Then she told them she and her husband were high school
sweethearts. The scene was a throwback to the '50s when political
wives fixed their adoring gazes on their husbands. And much has
been made of the prolonged, passionate kiss Gore gave his wife
after she introduced him.
</P>
<P>
   But we're asking about other women, successors to the feminist
leaders _ the Bella Abzugs, Betty Friedans and Gloria Steinems _
who helped break through the gender barriers in the '70s and then
hit a plateau in the Ronald Reagan '80s. We're talking about those
women who insisted on being heard politically and who took up the
cause of the ill-fated Equal Rights Amendment that would have put
women on a par with men.
</P>
<P>
   Midge Costanza, who headed the women's liaison office in the
Jimmy Carter White House, said that while a lot of women now have
good jobs, many others still face tough challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For instance. women at work earn about a quarter less per dollar
than men do in comparable jobs. And while women have made some
progress in gaining state and national offices, Costanza cited the
sorry statistics showing that there are only 58 women in the
435-member House and only nine women in the 100-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to mobilize women,'' she said. ``But there is no
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Costanza contends that a ``backlash'' against feminists is
keeping would-be activists in the background in this election.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent woman, who was in the trenches in the women's
movement years ago, said, ``We have disappeared. We scare people.''
Then she added, ``There is such a backlash against Hillary,''
referring to the first lady, bidding for a U.S. Senate seat from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The antipathy to the president's wife by some women in New York
City is baffling, she said. Another source noted that some women
even use the word ``hate'' to express their feelings against Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they liked her better when they felt sorry for her as
the betrayed wife.
</P>
<P>
   But her supporters are predicting that in the coming weeks Mrs.
Clinton will ``connect'' with women voters, who they say will
realize that she can be an effective senator because of her
national stature and her focus on issues women care about _
education, children, gun control. Still, the carpetbagger issue
can't be discounted.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential race, Gore, who had trouble winning over
women voters at the start of the campaign, seems to have found the
key with his appeal to ``working families.'' A new USA Today/CNN/
Gallup poll showed Gore, who had been down 9 points among women,
has leaped to a 22-point lead over Bush with female voters, 58
percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore gained points with women when he stressed that he was
pro-abortion-rights, pro-gun-control, pro-patients'-bill-of-rights
and pro-family-and-medical-leave. Furthermore, with his
``I-am-my-own- man'' acceptance speech, Gore seemed to be free at
last. Now he is sporting a warmer persona and is taking time out to
shake every hand, even schmoozing with reporters on the campaign
trail, tearing a page out of his rival's ``likeability'' guidebook.
The new Gore is trying to erase the impression that he is wooden
and dull compared with the more engaging, back-slapping Bush, who
is viewed as the kind of guy you want to sit down and have a couple
of beers with.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson, head of Project White House, a campaign dedicated
to electing a woman president someday, put it this way: ``Bush is
the guy you want to date, and Gore is the man you would trust to
babysit with your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's momentum may be helped by the abortion rights
leaders who are trying to transform the Clinton 1992 campaign
slogan ``It's the economy, stupid'' into a new call to arms: ``It's
the Supreme Court, stupid.'' Their aim is to evoke fears that
Bush-appointed justices would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling
that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Women should answer this call. They should realize they have a
big stake in the coming election. They are in the majority, and
their votes do count. But if they want to be heard, they are going
to have to speak up.

   RCA to Offer E-Books, The Next Generation
</P>
<P>
   RCA, which made its name in stereo equipment and televisions,
wants to get its consumers reading again. To that end, the company
is releasing two new electronic readers, or e-books.
</P>
<P>
   The two models RCA will begin selling this fall are, in effect,
the next generation of the Rocket eBook and Softbook Reader. The
companies that made those two devices, NuvoMedia and Softbook
Press, were bought earlier this year by Gemstar International,
which also owns TV Guide. Gemstar, in turn, has licensed the
technology to Thomson Multimedia, RCA's owner.
</P>
<P>
   RCA's eBooks, like their ancestors, can handle only electronic
books and magazines produced in a special format that is also
controlled by Gemstar. The REB1100 will hold about 20 novels with
its standard 8 megabytes of memory, but a 64-megabyte memory
expansion card will also be available. Its 5.5-inch black-and-white
screen has about six times the resolution of screens on most
monochrome personal digital assistants, according to Thomson. More
muscular users might like the REB1200, with a full-color 8.5-inch
display. The advantages of full color come at the expense of
resolution, which is slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
   Both devices will feature built-in modems, and the REB1200 will
also have a high-speed Ethernet connection for downloading reading
material without a computer. ``The mass market is what RCA is good
at doing,'' said Lou Lenzi, vice president for new-media business
development at Thomson. ``To bring this to the masses, we need the
experience to be as simple as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenzi expects that the basic model will not cost more than $300.
</P>
<P>
   New Programs Remove Unwanted Internet Files
</P>
<P>
   Hard-disk space may not be as expensive as Manhattan real
estate, but it can be equally precious to computer users who like
to squirrel away as many files on their machines as they can. Web
browser programs are notorious for hoarding disk space with saved
graphics files and other data from previously visited Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But a new category of software is emerging to help clean up hard
drives. One such program, iClean by Aladdin Systems, has just been
released. The software, which runs on Power Macintosh computers
with Version 7.5.3 of the Mac operating system or later, promises
to seek out and delete unnecessary browser cache files safely and
to wipe out Internet history and cookie files for privacy-conscious
Web surfers. The iClean program will scan the Mac, inform the user
of how much space can be saved and will even empty the Trash if so
instructed. The software will also fix broken alias files (the Mac
equivalent of shortcuts) that are scattered around the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The iClean program by itself is available for $29.95, and it
also comes with Aladdin's Spring Cleaning 3.5, a suite of Mac
maintenance and uninstaller tools that sells for $49.95. Curious
Mac users who would like to try iClean before buying can download a
free 15-day demo version at www.aladdinsys.com/iclean/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95, 98 and NT users who have the same urge to tidy up
may want to pick up a copy of Norton CleanSweep 2000 by the
Symantec Corp. The program usually sells for about $40 in stores,
but it can be purchased online and downloaded from
www.symantecstore.com for $26. Norton CleanSweep 2000, which
features an application that will thoroughly uninstall unwanted and
outdated programs, will also remove old cookies, plug-ins, ActiveX
controls and other debris that can wash up on the hard drive after
serious surfing sessions.
</P>
<P>
   You Know How to Whistle, Don't You? Use the Smart Card
</P>
<P>
   ComSense Technologies, a company in Tel Aviv, has developed a
secure way for customers to log on at an online banking or trading
site by using a sound bite instead of a password. The new product,
called Comdot, consists of a credit card with a flat button on it.
When the button is pressed, it sends a sound code to a Web site
through any built-in or plugged-in microphone. The sound code is
used to authenticate the identity of the cardholder.
</P>
<P>
   The code changes every time it is sent, which prevents someone
from recording the code and playing it back to gain access to an
account. Further security is provided by a PIN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the Comdot code is equivalent to swiping your card
through a reader, but it's online,'' said Alon Atsmon, the founder
and chief executive of ComSense. It can be used on a personal
computer or on a cell phone or regular phone, he added. The sound
code could even be used for phone-card calls and to get access to
personal calendars on sites like AOL or Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   The sound button, which will have a battery life of three years,
will begin appearing on credit cards sometime toward the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Atsmon envisions his technology as the logical end to the
process of miniaturization in Internet transactions, from the
personal computer to the laptop, the PDA and the cell phone. He has
plans far beyond the sound button.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put more on the card,'' he said. ``Maybe a tiny LCD
screen so you can view your transactions, or a PDA-type calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Trade-In
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the Apple PowerBook 5300 and 190 models can trade in
their old computers for a significant discount on one of the
company's 400-megahertz G3 laptops if they act quickly. From now
until Aug. 31, Apple is offering $700 off the price of a new G3
PowerBook (usually $2,499) for those who choose to send their old
5300 or 190 models back to the company. The 5300/190 series, which
was released in 1995, gained a measure of infamy because of a host
of design and technical problems, and its overheating _ and
occasionally combusting _ battery. Those interested in taking
advantage of the offer should call Apple at (800) 767-2775.
Although not so dramatic as bursting into flames, the discount
seems a much safer way for the 5300/190 series to go out in a blaze
of glory.

   SCI-EMBRYO-RESEARCH (Undated) _ The National Institutes of
Health on Wednesday issued its long-awaited rules that will permit
federally financed researchers to work on human embryonic stem
cells, cells derived from the very early embryo. Because of their
ability to form every tissue of the body, the cells are believed by
scientists to hold great promise in treating many diseases. But
because the cell lines are derived from human embryos, although
ones due to be discarded, opponents of abortion had objected to
federal approval of the research. By Nicholas Wade. (1075 words)

United States increased markedly between 1990 and 1998, researchers
said, with the increase particularly marked among people in their
30s, among whom there was a 76 percent rise in incidence of the
disease. And they said the new cases will exact a harsh toll in
disability, death and medical expenses in decades to come. The
increase is almost entirely in Type 2 diabetes, commonly called
adult onset diabetes, which accounts for 90-95 percent of all cases
of the disease. Inactivity and weight gain can bring on Type 2
diabetes, and doctors blame much of the current rise on obesity,
which is also increasing steadily, with more than half of Americans
now overweight. By Denise Grady. (1100 words)

   TEACHER-TRAINING (Boston) _ Convinced that teacher education

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE-ASSESS (Moscow) _ A news analysis: With the

he feels ``responsibility and guilt'' for the loss of the nuclear

new kind of post-Soviet turn. Military commanders are offering to
resign. The government and the private sector are competing to
raise millions of dollars to comfort the families of the Kursk's

   NY-SUBWAY-OBSESSION (New York) _ If Darius McCollum were a

neither. And his unusual problem _ his obsession, as he calls it _
has gotten him in so much trouble that people aren't even laughing
anymore. Since he was a high school freshman, McCollum, who grew up
in Queens and is now 35, has been in and out of jail for
masquerading as a New York City transit worker. New York is a city
of quirky people. It is also a place where train buffs rank among
the quirkiest. Even so, the authorities say McCollum towers above
the best of them, so expert at his chosen quirkiness that he has
repeatedly fooled riders, subway employees and the police into
believing he belongs in transit blues. By Dean E. Murphy. (1800

MOVEMENT GROWS TO SPEED NEW TEACHERS INTO THE CLASSROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa., Ky., Calif., Mo., La.)   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A growing number of states and school districts are
short-circuiting the usual route to teacher certification with
their own crash courses that put new teachers in the classroom
after as little as three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they are driven by a severe teacher shortage, the
demands of higher standards and, increasingly, concerns that
traditional teacher education programs are failing and deterring
talented candidates from entering the profession.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs run counter to the years of course work and
practice under which teachers have long been trained. In essence,
they adopt the model created by Teach for America, which a decade
ago bucked the education establishment by putting fresh graduates
of the nation's top colleges into classrooms after brief summer
training. And they have run into the same criticism among educators
who say the programs gamble with the future of the poorest and most
vulnerable students by giving them teachers who lack the necessary
training.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs are forcing a struggle over fundamental
questions about what makes a good teacher, and how much of that can
be taught.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is both fortuitous and risky. With retirements,
growing enrollments and class-size reductions, the nation's public
schools will have to hire 2.5 million teachers over the next decade
_ about the same number of teachers now working (2.8 million). With
educational options like vouchers and charter schools growing
nationally, officials say there is also an increased willingness to
experiment with teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher education people just can't escape the idea that
the college or university experience is what it takes for teachers
to be successful,'' said Clayton Wilcox, deputy superintendent for
hiring in Louisiana's East Baton Rouge Parish school district,
which includes the state capital. ``We think we can do it better,
and faster.''
</P>
<P>
   States have created other quick credentialing programs as
emergency responses to teacher shortages. But the new programs
emerge from concerns as much about quality as quantity. In some
cases, policy makers express near hostility to teacher education
schools and note that the best private schools do not require
teacher certification.
</P>
<P>
   The new shortcuts, the officials say, attract better candidates
and those who are traditionally hard to recruit: men, scientists,
minorities, those people willing to teach in middle schools and
high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Los Angeles, Kansas City,
New York City and Baton Rouge, La., have all recently started their
own teacher-training programs, and legislatures in other states are
considering bills that would allow them to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Schools of education have long had a reputation as the least
rigorous branch of undergraduate education, with lower admissions
standards and fewer graduation requirements than other professional
schools. Critics say they spend too much time on pedagogy and not
enough on content _ that is, too much on how to teach without
enough on what to teach. A math major, for example, would be
required to take more math courses than a math education major,
whose course load might include sociology of education or theory of
curriculum design.
</P>
<P>
   Courses in methods of teaching might be useful for those who
want to teach in elementary schools, critics say, where the focus
is on teaching students to read and do basic arithmetic. But in the
higher grades, teachers need to know more about the subjects they
are teaching, especially since most states now require students to
pass demanding tests for high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When teachers come through the classroom,'' said Michael Lane,
a former Teach for America teacher who is coordinating the
Massachusetts program for the Boston public schools, ``a lot of it
is trial by fire, and an intelligent self-reflective person can
handle that. Our people are coming through with the content area
expertise. You don't get that in education school.''
</P>
<P>
   Some education theorists, though, say it takes more than content
to be a good teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who go through teacher education learn how to look at
kids, how to understand what's going to be appropriate for
different kids at different ages, how people learn and how to
instruct a curriculum that builds on the way people learn well and
easily,'' said Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor of education at
Stanford University and the head of the National Commission on
Teaching and America's Future. ``They learn about what's going to
give kids problems and what you do about those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Allen, who as assistant headmaster at Hyde Park High
School in Boston has overseen the prospective teachers in the
shortcut program this summer, said his own time in education school
gave him invaluable common sense experience. It taught him how to
break down complex math concepts into lessons that students would
understand, he said, how to talk about fractions in a way that
would not make fourth-graders' eyes glaze.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every state has established some alternative route to
teacher certification, allowing those who do not have an
undergraduate education degree to enter the profession. The first
to do so, New Jersey, has trained almost 10,000 teachers over the
past 15 years in a year-long program run by local school districts.
But most of those programs, such as a longstanding one in
Connecticut, have required prospective teachers _ anyone from a
recent college graduate to a physicist with 15 years in industry _
to complete a heavy load of courses at schools of education at
nights or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Those options failed to attract significant numbers, education
officials said, because the path to teaching still seemed
cumbersome, and many of the courses mind-numbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I would have found the same level of
professionalism, energy and maturity in a regular education
school,'' said Diane Brancazio, a mechanical engineer who is
training in the Massachusetts Institute for New Teachers, or MINT,
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Another new MINT teacher, Kira Sherwood, taught in a private
school where a teacher who had gone to education school, she said,
told her ``Thank God they didn't get you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He really felt it had done more harm than good,'' said
Sherwood, who will teach in Boston this fall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Teacher education programs in Massachusetts suffered a harsh
blow to their reputation when 59 percent of prospective teachers
failed a basic test for certification when it was first given two
years ago. MINT was born out of that debacle. While it first
enrolled only elite students who had won $20,000 signing bonuses,
the state found that so many people were interested in a faster
route to certification that they opened it up to others, including
some who are willing to pay to attend the summer institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will become a major source of classroom teachers for
Massachusetts schools, and a source of competition with the schools
of education,'' said Alan Safran, deputy commissioner of education
for the state, where officials say MINT will train 1,000 teachers a
year by 2003. ``We are not shy about that, because competition will
improve both the higher ed programs and the MINT program.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the prospective teachers teach summer school in
the morning, and attend class into the evening. There, they give
demonstration lessons that are critiqued by other candidates, ask
questions about problems they have had in class, and discuss
readings on theories about effective schools. At the end of the
candidates' first year in the classroom, the principal of the
school or a state official decides whether they have earned full
certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger issue is that this kind of power ought to be at the
school level, the principals ought to be deciding who teaches well
and who doesn't,'' said Gary Huggins, executive director of the
Education Leadership Council, a group of eight aggressively
reform-minded state education leaders, several of whom are looking
to start state teacher education programs. ``With all the talk you
hear about shortages to be or shortages that exist, it's exactly
the wrong time to cut off the market with overregulation that's
going to block people who have no incentive to go into teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission on teaching, however, says its research shows
that those who go through longer programs in education schools _
five years in all _ stay in the profession longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up fooling the public that you've actually solved the
teaching crisis, when in fact you've only exacerbated it,'' said
Barnett Berry, director of state policy and partnership for the
commission. ``Those folks are far, far more likely to leave the
classroom, and in a hurry, creating a constant revolving door for
inexperienced teachers who are, according to the evidence, ending
up in front of the kids who most need the best teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   To supporters of the new programs, length of time in the
classroom is just one more element of what defines a good teacher
that should be open to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop saying that this person needs to be here 30
years to make it a success,'' Huggins, at the Education Leadership
Conference, said. ``We should take advantage of people who say `I'd
love to do this for four or five years and I have the heart and the
ability' and see that as a success, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The states and districts say they will rely more heavily on
tests _ for teacher certification, and student performance _ to
judge whether the new teachers succeed. But in states that are in
the second year of the new programs, officials say principals are
calling for more of the new recruits, which suggests they like the
quality they are seeing. Texas used to allow teachers to enter
through the shortcut method only in districts where there was a
shortage of teachers, but now allows them in any district.
Pennsylvania also approved the program despite a glut of teacher
education school candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, the teachers union is suing to block the
program. But in other states, the unions welcome the programs as
soon as they see that the new recruits join their ranks.

JACK OF HEARTS
</HEADLINE>
  Daughter captures Elliott's ramblin' ways on film and builds a bond
with the man she's only starting to know 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aiyana Elliott always had it in her mind that she would make a
film about her folk singer father, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, one day.
She just didn't figure it would be her first movie.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year that she graduated from New York University's
film school, a host of her father's friends and contemporaries,
people like Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, folk
singer Townes Van Zandt and country's John Denver, died. And Aiyana
realized that if she was going to tell the remarkable story of the
cowboy singer who acted as folk music's bridge from Woody Guthrie
to Bob Dylan, she'd better make it her first priority.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting labor of love, ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack,''
came after Elliott spent two years traveling down America's back
roads with her father, trying to find out what makes him tick. She
admittedly didn't have a clue because she never has really known
her father. He lived up to his nickname during her formative years,
and even as adults, Aiyana admits that she had never enjoyed an
``actual conversation'' with Jack until after the documentary
premiered this year at the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a struggle to talk to him, and that's been
baffling and hurtful to me because my dad has such a natural gift
with people,'' Aiyana, 31, says. ``The challenge has always been to
get him to share that gift with me.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a large way, that's what ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack''
is about _ a daughter trying to bond with her charming, but
distant, father. That personal aspect gives the documentary a
universality that made it a hit with audiences at Sundance (the
movie won the special jury prize for artistic achievement) and at
subsequent film festivals. Moviegoers' enthusiasm has, in turn,
finally helped the Elliotts communicate for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey we've taken since completing the film _ sharing
the movie with audiences and talking about it with them and each
other _ has brought us a long way,'' Aiyana says. ``It has totally
improved our communication. In fact, in recent weeks, we've started
to talk more and more freely and kind of gotten to know each other.
I'm sure the problems we have communicating will persist in certain
ways, but it feels to me that we've begun a great new chapter in
our relationship. It has been a wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jack about that, though, and you're likely to get a more
veiled response, not because he doesn't feel the same way but
because _ well, he's Ramblin' Jack Elliott. And as friend Kris
Kristofferson says in the movie, Ramblin' Jack earned his name as
much for his storytelling as his wandering ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the movie 10 times, and each time I see it, I get
more and more little laughs out of it,'' Jack, now 69, says. ``I
see more funny things that I didn't think were funny before. But I
don't ever get used to seeing myself. I'm too ugly to be able to
tolerate looking at myself that much. But there's parts that are
beautiful and I'm amazed by that and tickled by that and fascinated
by that. I don't ever get tired of watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack'' mixes current interviews and
concert performances with extraordinary archival footage to present
a portrait of a man who's truly one of a kind. Born Elliott Charles
Adnopoz, the son of a Brooklyn doctor, Jack rebelled from an early
age against his parents' expectations (when his mother saw him in
concert for the first time, she remarked, ``Look at those hands.
What a fine surgeon he would have made'') and the confines of city
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the footage of him as a little boy and it's amazing to
see how much his personality was already formed,'' Aiyana says.
``His love of adventure and the West and his desire to explore the
world are all fully there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack ran away from home at 15 and joined a traveling rodeo. He
soon fell in love with cowboy songs and folk and roots music, and
became fast friends with Woody Guthrie after showing up at
Guthrie's Coney Island home one day. Elliott learned much from
Guthrie (Guthrie once said that ``Jack sounds more like me than I
do''), but his flat-picking style of guitar playing was all his
own.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, it was Elliott's turn to teach, acting as a
mentor to a young Bob Dylan. In fact, at Dylan's first concert at
the legendary New York folk venue Gerde's Folk City, a sign was
posted outside reading: ``Now appearing: The Son of Jack Elliott.''
</P>
<P>
   However influential, Elliott has never aspired to be a star,
although he hasn't necessarily desired the periods of obscurity
that have distinguished his long career, either. He has received
some recognition late in the game, including a Grammy for his 1995
folk album ``South Coast.'' In 1998, President Clinton gave him the
National Medal of Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The film includes footage of Elliott receiving that award as
well as fascinating, never-before-seen clips from the Guthrie
family's private collection and raw material from filmmakers D.A.
Pennebaker (who made the Bob Dylan documentary ``Don't Look Back'')
and Bobby Neuwirth. Elliott's favorite scene revolves around an
appearance on the Johnny Cash Show, where he had to simultaneously
tune and play his guitar during a duet with the Man in Black.
</P>
<P>
   After fashioning a two-hour film from the 100 hours of material
she shot and the 50 hours of archival footage, Aiyana kept the
movie from her father until its January premiere at Sundance. The
reason? Self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is somebody, if left to his own devices in a room with
this movie, could easily convince himself that it is a terrible
indictment of his own character,'' Aiyana says. ``He's paranoid
that way. But seeing it with an audience helped give him some
perspective on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it ever. Jack calls the movie ``great'' and appreciates the
attention it has given his music. And even though he recently
married (for the fifth time) and, for the first time, truly has a
home to call his own, Jack Elliott is ramblin' more than ever these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a dramatic explosion, but I'm getting a lot
more gigs,'' Elliott says. ``And I still like performing in front
of a live audience, providing that the audience is alive. And they
seem to be these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Aiyana: ``Wavy Gravy called my dad the Lee Strasberg of the
Lone Prairie, like a Method folk singer. I think people respond to
that. He's just up there telling a story, but he does it in a way
unlike anybody else. There's nobody else like him, I can tell you
that.'' &QL;

CLINTON DEFENDS MOVE TO SEND ANTI-DRUG AID TO COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday defended his
decision to sign a waiver freeing up $1.3 billion in anti-drug
assistance for Colombia, saying that the country is improving on
human rights even though the government of Andres Pastrana has yet
to meet all the conditions imposed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it because I believe President Pastrana is committed to
dealing with the human rights issues, about which we're still very
concerned,'' said Clinton, who signed the national security waiver
on Tuesday night, a week before he flies to Colombia for a brief
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Congress voted in July to support a White House request for
economic and military aid to Colombia, a package designed to
interrupt the flow of cocaine and heroin to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package, called Plan Colombia, includes $1 billion to
train and equip the army and police forces of Colombia, as well as
additional funds to promote economic development, judicial reform
and human rights improvements. Congress put conditions on the
assistance amid concerns about the Colombian military's poor human
rights record and ties to paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers said Clinton could waive the conditions for
national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's use of the waiver was widely expected but it still
drew criticism from some members of Congress and human rights
organizations, who accused him of overlooking the Colombian
military's brutal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need or justification for waiving the
conditions,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who pushed for
conditions on the aid. ``These conditions are nothing more than
what the Colombian government and our administration said they
would do, and this is not too much to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., an opponent of the aid package,
was even more critical. ``A waiver that ignores Colombia's abysmal
human rights situation gives the green light to the Colombian
military to continue business as usual,'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, in a Rose Garden appearance Wednesday with
reporters, said the situation in Colombia was too precarious to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've protected our fundamental interests in human
rights and enabled Plan Columbia to have a chance to succeed, which
I think is very, very important for the long-term stability of
democracy and human rights in Colombia and for protecting the
American people and the Colombia people from the drug traffic,''
the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the conditions imposed by Congress were requirements that
the military suspend personnel believed to have committed human
rights violations and that it set up a judge advocate general corps
to investigate abuses. Of seven conditions over all, Pastrana has
satisfied only one, by issuing a statement warning the military
that soldiers accused of human rights abuses will be tried in the
country's civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, exercising a waiver on the ground of national
security, declared that a ``drug emergency'' exists in Colombia and
that Pastrana is making progress on human rights. The president
said the United States could still turn down specific military
units for aid if abuses are uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that while Colombia is improving
its human rights climate, it is unlikely to meet one condition
imposed by Congress _ that it eliminate the country's total coca
and opium poppy production by 2005. The Colombian government has a
goal of eliminating half its drug crop over the next five years,
officials said. Eliminating all the cultivation, the officials
said, would require even more resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia confronts a drug emergency that directly affects the
United States,'' the White House said in a memorandum justifying
the waiver. ``In spite of aggressive counter-drug efforts, coca
cultivation in Colombia has increased 140 percent over the last
five years. This massive rate of increase threatens to reverse the
counter-drug successes in Peru and Bolivia.''

A WELSH TALE OF TRAGIC LOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alternately dour and hyper-tragic, the Oscar-nominated Welsh
film ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor'' is intriguing most of the time despite
its flailing narrative swings. That's largely due to fine
performances all around, a generally insightful script by director
Paul Morrison and a juxtaposition of ethnic genres that, while
nurturing the conventions of each, makes fascinating formations out
of their collision.
</P>
<P>
   It's also ``Romeo and Juliet'' once again, and like most
versions it reaffirms the concept's durability.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen Welsh mining movies before. You've seen Jewish
immigrant movies before. But this is the first Jewish immigrants in
a Welsh mining village romance, and it covers the hybrid
possibilities pretty thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1911, a strike is brewing, and Gaenor (soulful ingenue Nia
Roberts), the daughter of a pious, narrow-minded miner's family, is
feeling pretty pinched. She was engaged some time ago, but the
marriage was called off when her betrothed had some undescribed
accident in the coal pit, leaving her neither a virgin nor very
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Newly arrived Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd, star of the British
``Horatio Hornblower'' TV series) meets Gaenor while selling fabric
door-to-door. Though his Orthodox family members on the other side
of town have done little to disguise their Russian origins (the
film's dialogue shifts between English and subtitled Yiddish and
Welsh), Solomon aspires to assimilation and speaks the King's
tongue perfectly. Gaenor thinks she's English. He thinks she's
something. She reciprocates.
</P>
<P>
   But Solomon is so worried about revealing his true ethnicity
that he claims his name is Sam and that his father is a railway
engineer, rarely home and thus unable to be introduced to his new
girlfriend. Although Gaenor displays no trace of anti-Semitism,
Solomon's fears are understandable. Prejudice is evident everywhere
in the community, and when economic times get tough (as they always

minister goes so far as to stir up a scapegoat pogrom against the
new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another reason for Solomon's deception: his parents
are just as bigoted as Gaenor's, as their actions prove when
evidence of his romance with the gentile becomes undeniable.
Ostracism, forced separation, perhaps even martyrdom comes to test
the lovers' commitment. Twenty years later, in America, this would
all be the stuff of a vulgar but benign comedy called ``Abbie's
Irish Rose.'' But in this time and place, it's tragedy of truly
biblical proportions.
</P>
<P>
   As overwrought as it gets, however, ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor'' boasts
behavioral accuracy down to its pettiest characters, an
appreciation of how two long-oppressed ethnic groups maintain their
dignity through (often unforgiving) faith and a convincing portrait
of everyday life as it's lived by both cultures. And while modern
audiences may rightfully despise the small-mindedness that causes
Solomon and Gaenor so much difficulty, the movie accurately places
some responsibility for their fate on unwise choices the couple
make together and individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor'' may go overboard on the grim melodrama at
times, but it more often displays emotional, social and ethical
intelligence of a high order.
</P>

  R&AMP;B Singer draws inspiration from church and factory 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Sunday' refers to Aug. 27.) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Avant sits at the back of a bus as it rolls toward Oakland with
the Mary J. Blige tour, for which he's been opening all across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which pulls into the Universal Amphitheatre on Sunday,
is a sort of coming-out for the 22-year-old singer, whose
love-gone-wrong r&AMP;b single, ``Separated,'' has been sweeping the
airwaves. It's also a chance for Avant, born Myron Avant, to show
people there's plenty more where that came from.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not holding anything back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gyrating and everything on stage so people can really
enjoy themselves,'' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that winning over Blige's audience has little to do
with gyrating on stage, at least for a singer such as Avant. He was
schooled in the church choir during his Cleveland upbringing, and
by listening to the records of such legendary soul singers as
Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Avant's tenor flows over libidinous grooves in ``Separated'' and
his sentimental next single, ``My First Love,'' a duet with
newcomer Ketara Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make you envision everything that I'm going
through,'' he says. ``Not that it's all about me, but it's about
something I've been through or seen, so I take it personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both songs are found on Avant's debut ``My Thoughts,'' an album
that is overflowing with songs about heartache, lost opportunities
and the possibilities for new love _ something the singer is always
in pursuit of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you married?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships are something Avant ponders over a lot, even when
he's in the most unlikely of places.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lyrics and melodies from songs on ``My Thoughts''
were conjured while Avant was still working the assembly line of a
Planter's peanut factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In working at a peanut factory, you have a lot of time to
think,'' Avant says. ``Basically, I just put all my thoughts into
relationships and not nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, that quality songwriting time led to his penning
some tracks for a demo, which eventually led to his cementing a
record deal.
</P>
<P>
   Avant is the first artist signed by Magic Johnson Music, an
offshoot of MCA Records started by the basketball legend.
</P>
<P>
   And it couldn't have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get signed for the longest,'' Avant says. ``I
tried every record company. But at the time, they just weren't
feeling me or what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Johnson called.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson first heard Avant's demo blaring from his assistant's
boom box, and that was that _ ``I gotta have this kid,'' he said.
So Johnson phoned Avant and invited the Cleveland native to L.A.
for a face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat at a round table and told me all the things he could do
for me,'' Avant says. ``And he's making it happen. So it's all
good.''
</P>
<P>
   While Avant says he's focused on his music, right now he is
flirting with the possibility of expanding his career to include
acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of acting things that are supposed to be going
on,'' he says. ``But I don't want to quote something that hasn't
happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Avant's getting the most he can out of playing
for Blige's crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really receiving me very well,'' he says. ``They know
me from `Separated.' But they're getting a whole lot more, for
sure.'' &QL;

Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing quite like the feeling of being a couple of
steps ahead of the characters you're watching. Call it the
theatrical equivalent to talking-back-to-the-screen syndrome: Don't
do it, buddy! Open your eyes!
</P>
<P>
   Or blind yourself. That works, too.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its dramatic unlikeliness, the Oedipus myth can
successfully be transported to another time in another place, as
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Rita Dove has done with her play ``The
Darker Face of the Earth.'' ``Darker Face'' may be accustomed to
having more sprawl space, but director Anthony J. Haney's
production for the Fountain Theatre is confined, compact and very
much in your face. As it should be: There is nothing quiet or small
about Dove's examination of slavery and identity. This is a
production that finds a way to celebrate despair.
</P>
<P>
   A joint venture between the Fountain and Black Artists Network
Development, Haney's production is the California premiere of a
work that has played to great success at larger venues in Ashland,
Ore.; Washington, D.C.; and London. The Fountain was lucky to get
it, and the NoHo district more fortunate still that the Fountain's
Hollywood venue was too small to hold it. Here it is, then, with
all of its ironic punch.
</P>
<P>
   A free-form adaptation, ``Darker Face'' is as much a story of a
proud man's quest for freedom as it is the story of how that same
man is struck down by forces outside his control. The wheels of
fate _ or of a curse _ are as powerful in the pre-Civil War South
as they were when Sophocles was drawing the noose around his
misguided king.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Augustus Newcastle, a well-spoken slave, acts as
he does because he exists on a South Carolina plantation in 1840.
Because he has no choice. Built into the play is the knowledge that
Newcastle's assignation with a white female plantation owner,
Amalia LaFarge can come to no good. What Dove's story lacks in
suspense it makes up for in tragic irony. Newcastle believes he is
healing the land even when people are telling him he's actually its
downfall.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Renegade, Edward Haynes' set is an
often-crowded, two-level stage, hung with bits of white linen. Up
above is the ``big house,'' the LaFarge estate where blacks come
only when invited. Down below are the cotton fields. Characters
enter all corners of the theater, often singing, occasionally in
chains. When Amalia (Jacqueline Schultz) gives birth to a son, the
slaves down below wait eagerly for news and for the first cry. But
when the baby is the wrong color, a plot is hatched by plantation
patriarch Louis LaFarge (played by William Schenker), the doctor
and a very reluctant Amalia. The child will be carried off, but it
doesn't take an oracle to know we haven't seen the last of Amalia's
sewing basket or its precious cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward 20 years. Hector (Michael McFall), the father of
Amalia's child, has fled to the far reaches of the swamp. Louis has
taken to boozing and bouts of isolated madness, leaving a hardened
and bitter Amalia to treat her slaves with a newly discovered
cruelty. Everything changes when she purchases Newcastle (Jason
George), a slave with a reputation for intelligence, breeding and a
fighting spirit. With his idea-planting stories of rebellion aboard
the Amistad, the literate and well-spoken Newcastle is fascinating
to his fellow slaves. All except Scylla (Denise Dowse), a kind of
slave priestess who has been talking about a curse on the land
pretty much since the curtain rose.
</P>
<P>
   As he is starting to receive overtures from a group of
conspirators, Newcastle finds himself summoned to the ``big house''
for a meeting with the mistress. Their talk turns to literature.
``The Greeks were too predictable,'' Newcastle says. Fires back
Amalia: ``A slave doesn't have opinions!'' You can probably see
where this is headed.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-person cast is strong pretty much across the board.
George is steely-eyed but charismatic Newcastle, while Schultz
guides Amalia from despair to near tyranny and back to warmth, no
easy task particularly since the character drops out of sight for
most of the first act. Particularly noteworthy among the ensemble
are Joy DeMichelle Moore as Phebe, a slave willing to help
Newcastle fan the flames of revolt; Clinton Derricks-Carroll as the
musical Scipio; and, particularly Michael McFall, a towering,
silent and potentially menacing Hector.
</P>
<P>
   Dove tells her story not through verse, but through song. Cast
members sing traditional and gospel renditions performed a capella
and beautifully arranged by musical director DeWayne Knox. Equally
affecting is the lighting design by Kathi O'Donohue. &QL;

ATTACKS PROMPT UNITED NATIONS TO SUSPEND RELIEF WORK IN WEST
TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT `130 miles' to `78 miles') 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
Wednesday that all aid operations in West Timor have been suspended
following the severe beating of three relief workers by
pro-Indonesia militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   When the attack took place on Tuesday, the three workers were
distributing plastic sheeting to East Timorese refugees in West
Timor, which is still ruled by Indonesia. All three were assaulted
with machetes, clubs and stones, and one worker had his head held
under water in a rice field until he choked and nearly drowned,
officials in Geneva said. All suffered severe injuries, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soren Jessen-Petersen, the assistant high commissioner, accused
the Indonesian government of allowing the pro-Indonesia militiamen,
at least some of whom are thought to be backed by the Indonesian
military, to behave with impunity, making ``a mockery of statements
by responsible officials in Jakarta guaranteeing security for aid
workers and refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that Indonesian military units in the area
failed to respond to calls for help during the attack, at
Kefamenanu, about 78 miles from Kupang, the capital of West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   There have now been more than 100 cases of assaults on aid
workers in the year since the East Timorese voted for independence
from Indonesia and many fled or were driven from their homes in the
militia-led violence that ensued. Officials say that Tuesday's
attacks may have been the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was sending a senior refugee official to West
Timor to investigate the attack, the refugee commissioner's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 125,000 East Timorese remain in West Timor. The United
Nations has been trying to register them to determine how many want
to stay on Indonesian territory and how many want to return to
their homes. Nearly 170,000 East Timorese have already returned to
their homeland to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government periodically announces that it will
close all the refugee camps in West Timor and resettle some of the
East Timorese in other parts of Indonesia if they want to stay in
the country, but there has been no action. An Indonesian official
in Dili, the East Timorese capital, on Wednesday promised to close
down refugee camps in West Timor in three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency has repeatedly asked that the militiamen
be removed from the camps and not be allowed to intimidate
refugees. Many of the remaining displaced East Timorese are thought
to be afraid to voice their wishes to return home for fear of
attack by the roving militia groups.

ANALYSIS: HINTS OF POLITICAL EVOLUTION IN AFTERMATH OF SUBMARINE
CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-SUBMARINE) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a public confession Wednesday night by President
Vladimir Putin, who said he feels ``responsibility and guilt'' for
the loss of the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk, Russia's political
evolution seems to be taking a new kind of post-Soviet turn.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders are offering to resign. The government and
the private sector are competing to raise millions of dollars to
comfort the families of the Kursk's crew. The airwaves are ringing
with mea culpas from the haughty admirals of the once mighty Red
Banner Fleet of the north.
</P>
<P>
   And on the surface of the Barents Sea, Russia for the first time
cracked open the door to Norwegian and British seamen and asked
them to enter the inner sanctum of a powerful Cold War leviathan
named Kursk and to help retrieve the 118 crewmen _ sons of Russia,
Ukraine and other lost fragments of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   It did not start out that way.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kursk exploded and crashed to the bottom of the Barents
Sea on Aug. 12, Russians spontaneously reacted with indignation
when military leaders dropped into a familiar defensive crouch,
distorting and withholding information and paying little heed to
the human dimension of the tragedy for the crew members and their
families, many of whom live in rank poverty in Russia's far north.
</P>
<P>
   And they were even more appalled when Putin, instead of rushing
home like the disciplined and pragmatic public servant they voted
for in March, tarried at his favorite resort on the Black Sea. Day
after day he remained there, as one of the most extraordinary
rescue dramas at sea unfolded. Lives were at risk. Last breaths
were being drawn, but still Putin vacationed.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels to the Soviet era raged from the front pages of the
Russian press, and many Russians harked back to Chernobyl, where
the worst nuclear accident in history spewed radiation into the
heavens for days in late April and early May 1986 before Soviet
leaders begrudgingly admitted that something had gone terribly
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But in the din of recriminations of the loss of the Kursk and
with the sudden awakening of Putin, what many have missed is the
repudiation of the Soviet era that is also present in this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk families have expressed their outrage and pain, and
Putin elevated their plight this week to a national priority.
Politicians have said that officials must be held accountable, but
Putin said Wednesday night that the old Soviet game of laying blame
gratuitously would be set aside. ``It has been like that before,''
he said Wednesday on national television, adding that ``nothing
will be done'' until ``a full understanding has been gained about
what happened and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Russia's military made mistakes and was too slow to ask
for Western help, its officials also became surprisingly accessible
and accountable. One admiral admitted that rescue gear was not
available because it has been rented to oil companies. And a
Russian television reporter was given exclusive access to the deck
of a Russian cruiser from which to make his reports.
</P>
<P>
   It was also impossible to ignore the moment when former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev joined the ranks of critics chiding
Putin for delaying Russia's request for Western assistance too
long. For it was Gorbachev who in 1986 let the flames of Chernobyl
burn without warning his countrymen _ not to mention Europe _ that
a radioactive cloud was headed their way. And, of course, Gorbachev
refused all Western assistance to contain the worst nuclear
disaster ever.
</P>
<P>
   But with his criticism, Gorbachev showed that he, too, is well
beyond the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the sinking of the Kursk foreshadows that some
reckoning is ahead for the pared-down remains of the armed forces
of the former Soviet empire, whose once vaunted technological
prowess was already looking battered and bloodied by rebels in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an investigation proves that Russia's nuclear-powered
leviathan Kursk was sunk by a collision with a so-far illusive
foreign submarine, or by a misfired torpedo or a World War II mine,
the lasting image from the surface of the Barents Sea will be the
hapless attempts by otherwise heroic Russian rescuers to reach the
Kursk's escape hatch in outdated mini-subs powered by batteries too
old to hold a charge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Norwegians and the British arrived with their shining
technology _ underwater cameras and command centers that looked
like an electronics store showroom _ these ``foreigners'' went to
work in the deep-diving suits and cracked the stubborn hatch in 36
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The wrenching drama of the Kursk has been another painful step
in the education of Putin, the youthful president and longtime KGB
officer who had vowed to strengthen the Russian state and rebuild
its military forces to defend Russia's interests, whatever those
turn out to be in the transition that still is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is discovering in the most poignant way that invoking the
imagery of Russia's military tradition is not the same as
exercising it effectively _ and safely _ every day. In his visit to
Severomorsk on Monday, Putin was reminded again that although
Russia possesses the nuclear arsenal of a global power, the
infrastructure of the Russian military has gone to rust and that
most of its personnel live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions in which our nuclear submarines are maintained
do not meet any standards, and we could witness another serious
accident at any moment,'' Alexsander Rutskoi, the former vice
president and a war hero who led a political rebellion against
Boris Yeltsin in 1993, said on Monday. In a fiery denunciation of
the navy, Rutskoi, now the governor of the Kursk region for which
the submarine was named, added, ``When the Russian fleet does not
have the necessary means to conduct rescues, the very fact that
submarines go to sea is already a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   After the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. commanders complained
that a ``hollow'' military was the cause of a significant decline
of U.S. prestige in the world, one that would invite challenge from
any adversary. And what ``hollow'' came to mean was the loss of
synergy between recruiting and training professional cadres of
soldiers and a high level of spending on maintenance, spare parts
and ever-improving technologies for weaponry and on safety for the
most important weapon in any arsenal _ the soldier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia now faces a much broader hollowing of its military
forces. Putin speaks as if he is determined to come to terms with
this reality, but without acknowledging that rebuilding the Russian
armed forces can only be accomplished through an inevitable
contraction of Russian power and global pretension. Overreaching
for the glory days of the Soviet past, when Moscow supported a blue
water navy that could compete for power and influence in the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, could easily lead to the disasters
that Rutskoi predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, venting his
frustration on national television on Monday night, said the
``whole reason'' why there were no Russian deep sea divers to race
down to save the Kursk's crew was that the military ``over the
course of the past several years'' has been ``robbed and stripped''
and the armed forces are being funded at ``less than 50 percent''
of their requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But requirements for what?
</P>
<P>
   Putin must now answer that question for the Russians and for his
neighbors in Europe, whom he has alarmed with his ``strong state''
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, flags over the Kremlin flew at half staff Wednesday,
a sign of mourning not only for the lost sailors but for the lost
pride that so many Russians feel.

 &HT;    Monitor fighting a losing battle on ocean floor
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Off the coast of Cape Hatteras, in the graveyard of
the Atlantic, time and tide are erasing the remains of a naval
legend.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Monitor, the icon of Civil War ironclads, is
surrendering to the natural forces and maritime mishaps that have
dogged it since it sank in a storm on New Year's Eve, 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Like the H.L. Hunley, the Confederate submarine raised from
Charleston Harbor this month, the Monitor _ the first ship built
entirely of iron _changed the face of naval warfare and sounded the
death knell for wooden warships. Like the Hunley, the Monitor was
lost at sea for more than a century. And like the Hunley, it is the
object of a multi-million dollar effort to save as much of it as
possible for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   There, however, the tale of these two ships diverges. The Hunley
is now safely ashore, tucked securely in a laboratory built to help
conserve it. The Monitor will not be so easily plucked from the
sea. And its caretakers fear that time is running short.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Monitor, which lies in the heart of a
federal marine sanctuary 16 miles offshore in more than 200 feet
deep _ a depth which divers need specialty gear to reach _ might
seem supremely secure. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found fishing trawl nets snagged on the hull,'' says
John Broadwater, director of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary.
``A while back, a boat pulled some pieces loose with its anchor. We
don't really know how many artifacts have been removed by divers,
but we sometimes hear rumors of items for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadwater says there has been a marked increase in naturally
occurring damage too. ``The hull is deteriorating at a rapid
rate,'' he says. ``The armor plating is falling off. If we let
these things go on much longer, we are going to loose an awful
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its discovery in 1974, underwater archaeologists have
retrieved what they can from the Monitor one piece at a time. The
ship's anchor, a red signal lantern, the three-ton propeller and
more than 100 other artifacts are on display at the Mariner's
Museum in Newport News, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But as the ship crumbles, there is a growing sense of urgency to
save more massive artifacts _ components that were unique to the
fleet of Monitor-like ironclads turned out by Union shipyards in
the 1800s. There are no plans to raise the entire ship, but the
U.S. Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) are in the midst of a $20 million project _ funded primarily
from the Department of Defense's legacy program _ to save the
engineering essence of the historic vessel.
</P>
<P>
   This month, as Civil War buffs celebrated the Hunley's recovery
in Charleston, divers were struggling in the heavy seas off Cape
Hatteras with the latest phase of the decade-long effort.
</P>
<P>
   Because it came to rest upside down on the bottom, the weight of
the Monitor's hull rests on top of its distinctive ``cheesebox''
turret, putting enormous strain on the corroding, 138-year-old
hull. To keep it from collapsing, divers this summer shored up the
wreck with massive concrete-filled bags to buy a little more time.
</P>
<P>
   During three expeditions to the wreck in July and August, they
retrieved a 10-foot section of the ship's propeller shaft, the
21-foot portion of the ship's skeg, which held the rudder and
propeller shaft in place, and a number of smaller artifacts. They
also erected an underwater crane that is a vital part of next
year's expedition. Broadwater says if weather and his budget
permit, divers next summer will slice through the ship's hull and
hoist the Monitor's 36-ton steam engine.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was the first of a generation of coal-burning engines
whose low profile made it possible to locate them safely below the
ship's waterline. It was designed by Swedish engineer John
Ericsson, who so passionately championed the revolutionary design
of the Monitor that it was known for a time as ``Ericsson's
folly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutti year.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of wooden ships, however, the fact that an iron ship
floated at all was enough to earn it a place in maritime history.
Modern navies were never the same afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the Monitor, in fact, can still be seen in the
U.S. Navy's million Zumwalt-class destroyers, the first of which is
expected to be delivered in 2010. Although the new ships fire
Tomahawk missiles and artillery shells with a range of 60 miles,
the sharply pointed hull, the low, virtually empty deck and
enclosed superstructure make the new ship look surprisingly like a
21st century edition of the Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, the Navy doesn't call the sleek new look a
``cheesebox on a raft'' _ the nickname given to the Monitor. Today,
it's called stealth technology. Inf

 &HT;    U.S. Open draw leaves possibility of all-Williams final
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, winners and losers at the U.S. Open will be
decided on the court, but on Wednesday, the luck of the draw had
its way. Venus and Serena Williams got their wishes, while dreams
of a Pete Sampras-Andre Agassi final were shattered.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters, who have lost just one match to other
opponents since Wimbledon, were placed on opposite sides of the
women's bracket in the random-draw selection at the National Tennis
Center.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps open the prospect of the first sister-sister final in
the modern history of the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, the defending U.S. champion but seeded only
fifth, could run into 1999 champ Lindsay Davenport as early as the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The news is more disappointing for Davenport, however. The No. 2
seed, who has a sore foot and a five-match losing streak against
Serena, also is seeded to meet Anna Kournikova in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, who has a sore foot of her own, opens against
No. 61 Tina Pisnkik, while Davenport faces No. 30 Gala Leon Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams' path appears easy to the semifinals, where she
could meet No. 1 Martina Hingis. Venus' first match is against No.
32 Anne-Gaelle Sidot. Hingis opens with No. 100 Alina Jidkova.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the women's draw is Atlanta's Ansley Cargill, who got a
favorable draw when matched with another wild-card entry, former
Florida All-American Dawn Buth. Cargill, a new Duke freshman, is
the first Georgia native in a U.S. Open main draw of singles since
Shannan McCarthy in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Agassi and Sampras are in the same side of
the draw and would meet in the semifinals. Otherwise, the biggest
names in men's tennis had to be pleased with their paths.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's first match is against NCAA champ Alex Kim of Stanford,
and Sampras faces No. 67 Martin Damm. Both are seeded to face
clay-courters in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other tournament favorites are on the opposite side
of the draw, including Marat Safin, Alex Corretja, Gustavo Kuerten,
Patrick Rafter, Nicolas Kiefer, Todd Martin and Magnus Norman.
</P>
<P>
   In a qualifying match Wednesday, Melanie Schett of Austria
defeated Jewel Peterson of College Park 6-2, 6-3.

LIEBERMAN GETS HEARTY WELCOME AT SENIOR CITIZENS CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMARAC, Fla. _ Women screamed his name and strained across each
other to touch his cheek. One admirer managed to squeeze in close
enough to kiss his hand.
</P>
<P>
   In this predominantly Jewish, mainly female, senior citizens
center, Liebermania had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like kissing the Torah, kissing you!'' gushed a
silver-haired woman, leaving a bright red lipstick mark on the back
of Connecticut Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love you, Joe!'' yelled out residents of the Kings Point
Community, a retirement center where Lieberman, the first
Jewish-American to be nominated for vice president on a major party
ticket, campaigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was also along for the trip, and promised
to protect Social Security and Medicare. He also pledged to provide
a $3,000-a-year tax credit to families paying for the long-term
care of their elderly relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Lieberman, peppering his speech with Yiddish and
speaking emotionally about how the family of his wife, Hadassah,
survived the Holocaust, who stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd leapt to their feet and roared when Lieberman walked
onstage, as a senior citizen band played ``Happy Days Are Here
Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually feel like I'm in a room full of family members,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore and Hadassah Lieberman have received such warm
welcomes that he and Gore ``feel like `nuchschleppers,' '' or
hangers-on, the senator said, drawing a loud chuckle from the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted them with the phrase, ``Shalom Aleichem,'' or ``peace
to you,'' and talked about how grateful he was to be picked as
Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my family, we said, `In America, nothing's too good for a
`mensch,' '' Lieberman said, getting applause for his use of the
Yiddish word for a nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop me!'' Lieberman said, holding up his hand self-mockingly,
as if he were unable to stop uttering Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   The group, overwhelmingly Democratic and hailing largely from
New York, New Jersey, and Boston, is presumed to be solidly behind
the Gore-Lieberman ticket. Lieberman is expected to help galvanize
the Jewish vote in Florida, and to help raise money here. A
fund-raiser Wednesday night in wealthy Parkland raised $500,000 for
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Jewish voters make up only 6 percent of the Florida's
electorate, and the Democratic duo faces a tougher fight in the
rest of the state, which has a hefty 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in 1996 became the first Democratic
presidential candidate to take Florida since 1976, and the Gore
campaign believes the state is in play this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida is still largely conservative. Central Florida
voters are irked by Gore's pro-gun control stance, and the
Cuban-American community in southern Florida is historically
Republican. Moreover, GOP nominee George W. Bush's brother, Jeb
Bush, is governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is certainly a state Gore needs. He has to find some
way to neutralize the Republican advantage in the South,'' said
Earl Black, a Southern politics expert at Rice University in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult'' for Gore, ``especially if he
continues to characterize this as an election between the working
families and the powerful few. A lot of middle-class people think
they are workers, too,'' and may be offended by Gore's
class-struggle theme, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to campaign Thursday in Miami to deliver a
speech on foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. Those plans
were in some doubt, however, because of Hurricane Debby.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, the Bush campaign also plans to become more
aggressive in countering Gore's criticism of the governor's
10-year, $1.3 trillion tax-cut proposal. Bush plans to point out
that Gore's $500 billion proposed tax cut would be less than half
the size of his own, and will argue that it would further
complicate the tax code with a series of targeted breaks that leave
out as many as 50 million Americans, said a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Republican campaign released a statement Wednesday
criticizing Gore's comments on helping families pay to care for
their elderly members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that Republicans in Congress and the
Clinton-Gore administration have proposed long-term health care
initiatives, Washington failed to get it done. Governor Bush will
bring a new tone and leadership to Washington so that families can
finally receive the long-term care they've been promised,'' said
Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   In their appearance at the seniors' center, Gore and Lieberman
headed into an overflow room after their speeches to greet
supporters who couldn't fit into the meeting hall. Gore was
surrounded by seniors, but the group abandoned Gore and swarmed
around Lieberman when the senator approached.
</P>
<P>
   ```Tachlis! Remind (Gore) of the word!'' a man shouted at
Lieberman. The senator explained later that the word means
``telling it like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These two are really talking and feeling what the average
person is feeling,'' said Ruth Epstein, who described herself as
``early '70's'' in age. ``We love them both.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``this is their territory,'' Epstein added. ``I would like
to see what the response would be from another group'' in Florida.

KENNEDY LIBRARY RELEASES MORE PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thousands of pages of classified material, documenting
foreign policy issues during the Kennedy presidency, were released
Wednesday by the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,500 documents were opened to the public, including
memos between Kennedy and his National Security Council adviser,
McGeorge Bundy, and US efforts at political subversion in Cuba,
according to Maura Porter, an archivist at the library.
</P>
<P>
   While library officials said the material will provide the
general public with a look into the inner workings of the
government, they expect the information will be far more useful to
historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing you could really call ground-breaking but
historians will really enjoy researching it,'' said Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the library said the disclosure is part of a
massive ``declassification'' effort started in 1995 by President
Clinton. During that time, Clinton ordered all secret documents 25
years and older be reviewed for disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that order, the Central Intelligence Agency came
to the Kennedy Library in 1998 with scanners to examine hundreds of
thousands of pages of declassified material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA took the disks and brought them back to Washington to
be reviewed. Other agencies reviewed the disks and the disks were
returned to the library. It's sort of a long process,'' said
Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's 1995 order, more than 600 million pages of
secret documents on subjects ranging from the Cold War to the
failed Bay of Pigs have been released. The information has helped
researchers and historians to rewrite chapters of American history.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress in 1998 slowed down the disclosure
process after they worried classified documents may contain
top-secret information on nuclear weapons. Since then, the federal
government mandated that the CIA scan the documents page by page
for nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The documents opened Wednesday include memos concerning US
relations with the Dominican Republic, The Congo, Germany, Vietnam,
India, and the Soviet Union. Cables sent from the US Embassy in
Laos to the State Department during the height of the Vietnam War
were also released.
</P>
<P>
   Other documents remain classified, but officials expect more
releases soon.

SPRINT PCS TO OFFER FIRMS E-MAIL OVER CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint PCS plans to become the first wireless carrier to offer
businesses a service giving access to company e-mail systems over
cell phones, reflecting the rapid evolution of the wireless Net
from limited phone ``Web surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   The service, to be launched Sept. 1, will give firms that sign
up for premium Sprint calling plans the capability to give
employees access over their phones to their company Lotus Notes and
Microsoft Outlook e-mail and other corporate software and a popular
airline reservation system.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects a growing consensus that the first generation
of wireless Net phone offerings, including access to news, weather
forecasts, and stock quotes, is unlikely to be sufficiently
compelling to build a big market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two things that business customers really want are
connections to the (whole) Internet and connections to their own
network,'' Richard S. Cremona, president of business sales for
Sprint PCS, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers with AT&AMP;T Wireless, Nextel, Sprint, and Verizon can
now use Net phones to gain access to e-mail accounts such as
Hotmail and Yahoo or special accounts with the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   A number of start-ups have launched services giving wireless
phone access through security ``firewalls'' to corporate computer
networks, but Sprint contends it is the first carrier to promote a
service directly in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Besides access to the most popular company e-mail systems, the
service will also link to Siebel Systems sales management software
and the Sabre airline reservation system, allowing subscribers to
use the phone to book flights and hotel and car rental
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The cost per employee using the system is $40 a month for
unlimited usage as long as they have a voice calling plan costing
at least $50 a month. Companies would typically have to pay $40 to
$60 a year per employee to Lotus or Microsoft for a special
wireless-access license to the e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Howie Waterman, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless, said his
company has been able for more than three years to offer companies
wireless access to corporate networks through laptops and hand-held
devices, ``but we haven't found many business customers who want to
go through the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If customers want it, we can get it for them, so in some ways
Sprint is just coming late to the wireless data party with a
slightly different marketing tack,'' Waterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaugarin Oliver, vice president of marketing for Ultiverse, a
Waltham, Mass. start-up offering wireless access to company
networks, said the Sprint announcement is ``good for the industry
as a whole,'' promoting awareness of capabilities for wireless
phone access.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said he believes there will still be a big market for
companies that want to provide wireless access without limiting
their employees to one carrier. Ultiverse's system can also offer
access to a unified mailbox with voice mail and faxes blended in
with e-mail, something Sprint does not now offer.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Cremona said, Sprint will also offer a $400 wireless
connection device for laptops that, with special ``compression''
software installed at business sites, can provide the equivalent of
56 kilobit per second Internet access.

NO ART FOR `ART'S' SAKE HERE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to Hollywood: Enough with Sun Tsu, already. If we had a
dollar for every time some feature film or TV movie superficially
used the Asian general's ancient handbook ``The Art of War,'' we
could make our own movie and do Sun Tsu right. That, or we'd just
buy ownership of the rights and refuse permission anytime some
idiot producer came calling.
</P>
<P>
   We mention this because another brainless, Tsu-inspired action
movie is rolling into theaters, probably prompting the old general
to roll over in his grave or urn or wherever his mortal remains
rest. Titled _ you guessed it _ ``The Art of War,'' it manages to
thoroughly obliterate its Tsuian premise (``appearances are
everything _ in politics and deception'') by being numbingly
obvious at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Tsu might have believed that wars could be won without ever
having to fight, but action movies _ the mediocre ones typically
lacking, as they do, such cunning _ need to rely on good,
old-fashioned combat techniques. Canadian director Christian Duguay
shows flashes of ability to choreograph solid action scenes, but
because of poor pacing and chunky editing, he never manages to make
his movie's brain-rattling explosions and graphic violence coalesce
into a genuinely thrilling experience.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's story involves the half-baked conspiracy behind the
violent efforts to stop a trade agreement between the United States
and China. Wesley Snipes plays a United Nations covert agent trying
to figure out who's behind the plot and why there are so many dead
Chinese people littering the streets of New York. Helping him is a
pretty U.N. interpreter (Marie Matiko), who _ feisty one moment,
subservient the next _ seems to suffer from a personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Matiko isn't the only who suffers at the hands of the screenplay
by Wayne Beach (who wrote Snipes' ``Murder at 1600'') and former
cameraman Simon Davis Barry. When not awkwardly stealing from Sun
Tsu, the script has its characters spouting a never-ending parade
of cliches, apparently hoping that one of them sticks and becomes a
catchphrase. Let us just say that'll be the day, and then let
sleeping dogs lie.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Archer, Donald Sutherland and Maury Chaykin collect what we
hope were substantial paychecks for their work here, although it is
nice watching Archer playing something other than the dutiful wife.

CAFFEINE: IS IT THE ``NEW NICOTINE'' ?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SCOTT SIMONSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
The alarm goes off; you stumble out of bed. And before you grab
your toothbrush or let the dog out, you grab a hot cuppa joe. It's
your morning wake-up call.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By midafternoon you're restless and headachy. You grab a crisp
dollar and head to the pop machine for your ``fix.''
</P>
<P>
   It's caffeine, and it seems harmless enough (in moderation, of
course). But could caffeine _ as headlines indicated recently _ be
America's ``newest nicotine''?
</P>
<P>
   Johns Hopkins Institute researchers suggested that caffeine in
soda pop is the equivalent of nicotine in tobacco _ an additive
intended to ``hook'' consumers. They published the results of
research in August's Archives of Family medicine, a publication of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   One of the study's authors was quoted calling caffeine ``a
mildly addictive, mood-altering drug, one which accounts for the
fact that people drink far more sodas with caffeine than without.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink industry's reply can be roughly summarized as
``hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply incorrect to compare caffeine with the effects of
serious drug abuse,'' said Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the
National Soft Drink Association.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dispute, the public's response seemed to be a
collective ``pour me another pop.''
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is caffeine? What does it do, and why do we
love it so? And despite what scientists say, are all of those
caffeine lovers out there really addicted?
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic thing is that it's the world's most widely used
psychoactive drug, and has been for thousands of years,'' said G.
Ken Goodrick, a psychologist at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston. ``And if used in moderation, there's nothing wrong with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one nation under caffeination.
</P>
<P>
   The average American adult drinks 54.5 gallons of soft drinks
per year. For every 16-ounce bottle of water consumed, Americans
drink the equivalent of a 64-ounce soda, according to the soft
drink association.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing soft drink in 1999 was Mountain Dew, which
has the highest caffeine content among major brands.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine occurs naturally in coffee beans and tea leaves. It
tastes slightly bitter, and a synthetic version traditionally has
been used as flavoring in soft drinks and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   It can produce a short-term increase in energy. Caffeine
triggers a reward response from the brain, Goodrick said, but it
comes from a different part of the brain than the one affected by
drugs like cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine also is a diuretic, which accelerates dehydration.
Caffeine stimulates production of stomach acids. In large quantity,
it can cause restlessness, insomnia or irregular heartbeat, not to
mention disqualification from the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And while the scientific consensus is that caffeine doesn't
qualify as an addictive drug, habitual users can experience
withdrawal symptoms. Headaches can occur, along with restlessness
or insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Fleckman, a certified clinical nutritionist for Whole
Health Associates in Houston, said clients who drink three or four
sodas a day can feel immediate effects if they stop drinking
caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, when we pull the sugar and caffeine, it's almost
like a withdrawal,'' Fleckman said. ``They don't have that joie de
vivre, that push or that charge.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that people with low energy should change their diet to
gain more energy from fuels like carbohydrates, instead of
resorting to caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrick, an avowed coffee drinker whose 1999 book ``Energy,
Peace, Purpose'' talks about ways to find energy without caffeine,
said people should avoid more than three cups of coffee per day.
That's equal to about 72 ounces of soda. To get off caffeine
without headaches, he said, reduce caffeine intake by one serving
per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is moderation, and be sure you select quality
beans,'' he said.

A LOT AT STAKE
</HEADLINE>
  Trying to shed her bad-girl persona, Eliza Dushku brings on the new
roles 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Art available.) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popularity. It can be a double-pointed stake.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Eliza Dushku has got that lesson down. The Boston-bred
actress has certainly seen her pop-culture profile spike in the
last two years as her recurring role as Faith _ a vampire-slayer
gone bad _ on the ``Buffy'' and ``Angel'' television shows has made
her a teen icon. Her movie career is heating up, too, with a
co-starring role in the cheerleading comedy ``Bring It On'' as the
latest example.
</P>
<P>
   But success comes with complications. The darkly attractive,
smokey- voiced Dushku, a college professor's exuberant daughter who
shares an L.A. home with one of her big brothers, is already having
to counter ``bad girl'' stereotyping. And while fans of the WB's
horror dramas have mostly been idolizing, there are the few, she
acknowledges, ``who are so far into the fantasy aspects of the show
that they get in my face with, `Who do you think you are, trying to
start something with Buffy? You think you're tough?' And I'm like,
'No! I'm just an actress.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the letters from prison are lovely, too, let me tell ya,''
she adds with a nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On,'' of course, is all about the popularity issue in
its purest, most ritualized form. The film stars Kirsten Dunst as
the new captain of a championship high school cheerleading squad
and Dushku as Missy, a transfer student who only joins the pep
contingent because the school doesn't have a program for her real
specialty, gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Missy was really important for the movie
because she represents the audience's point of view about
cheerleading,'' explains ``Bring It On'' director Peyton Reed.
``She comes in very skeptical of that world and very cynical, and
Eliza has a certain tough, tomboyish quality that was the furthest
thing away from a cheerleader, which was perfect for that role. But
of all the actors, she was the one that really, really dug in and
bonded with all the others during cheer training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually the kid who made oaths on the sideline with my
best friend that we'd never be cheerleaders,'' admits Dushku, who
followed noteworthy juvenile appearances in such films as ``True
Lies'' and ``This Boy's Life'' with a high school-finishing
education break. ``But doing it for this movie, I learned so much.
That sounds kind of cliched, but I had never been part of a team
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gave me a whole new respect for not just cheerleading
as a sport, but for the people involved and their devotion. I mean,
it takes so much; you need to know dance and gymnastics, and it's
pretty admirable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku (her Albanian-derived name rhymes with ``push'') spent
four weeks at cheer boot camp to train for the production. Real
competition cheerleaders, who also appear as members of assorted
teams in the movie, helped get the actors up to acrobatic,
enthusiasm-oozing speed. Dushku is duly proud that her resulting
performance in the film only required one stunt-doubled shot:
Missy's audition for the squad that included multiple gymnastics
flips.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the trust games in the world can't build confidence
where only experience will do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got hurt; the guys caught us every time,'' she says.
``But I grew up with three older brothers who I never knew would
catch me when they threw me up in the air or not, so for the first
week or two I was always holding onto the guys' scalps. They were
like, 'Ouch! You've gotta let go!' ''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging some similarities between the movie and her
action-packed TV gig, Dushku is quick to note that most of the
fighting on ``Buffy'' and ``Angel'' involves highly trained
stuntpeople _ hence the reluctance to take on viewers who want to
show her how tough they are. Call it a modern actress's dilemma; in
previous generations, it was only macho stars like John Wayne and
Clint Eastwood who had to answer challenges to their make-believe
images.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dushku longs for the days of female delicacy or
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do anything my brothers could do, better or
as well,'' she reveals. ``Times are changing, obviously. When I was
younger, little girls couldn't play tag football with the boys,
they were supposed to play with dolls. But it's an equality thing
now, acknowledging that women are strong and can be fierce and
don't have to live under the stereotype that they can't break a
nail.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new culture is, of course, just as quick to churn out
other stereotypes. Dushku understands that typecasting has to be
undercut before it has a chance to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy playing Faith, because the bad girl can be a
very interesting character who's too often played very
black-and-white,'' she observes. ``I enjoy playing bad girls in a
way that surprises people and I play them well, but it's in no way
the only role I would want to play, or that I have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I don't play the bad girl in 'Bring It On.' But I'm
not a blond-haired blue-eyed girl, so I'm still kind of thought of
in that way. Right now, I don't mind it because contrast and
conflict is interesting to me. But in the future, I'll probably
want to be a good girl at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Checking the career near-term, it looks like a one-out-of-three
score. Dushku plays the party animal from the wrong side of the
tracks in the upcoming supernatural thriller ``Soul Survivor'' and
a New York gang girl in the Francis Coppola-produced ``Taking on
the Neighborhood.'' She describes her role in the high school
comedy ``The New Guy,'' however, as ``the norm, sweet character in
this movie full of comic madness.''
</P>
<P>
   But while she's savvy enough to pay some attention to career
management, Dushku generally approaches acting with a refreshing
lack of neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to sound cocky or anything, but the truth is that
acting was never my passion and it isn't even now,'' she says. ``I
do love it, but I just choose roles on the basis of doing things
I've never done before and, hopefully, will learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku's attitude is apparently inherited. It was one of her
brothers, Nate, who first caught the bug; she got her initial
commercial job from tagging along with him to an audition. But
neither kid was the product of stage-mothering. Quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 10, my mother wouldn't even come home to drive me
to my first open call,'' she recalls with a laugh. ``When they
called for my first L.A. screen test, she said 'No, I don't want
that kind of life for my daughter.' My stepfather was like, 'Judy,
it's a free trip for you and Eliza. You guys can go to the beach!'
Then she was like, 'Oh, yeah.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was partially mom's idea to take the two-year
school-finishing break back home (grades had been sliding), but
also a desire on Eliza's part to live the last stretch of her
childhood as normally as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But her celebrity preceded her. As we said, popularity can stab
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was immediately labeled 'The Movie Star' and not invited
into a lot of the cliques that had been created in the first half
of high school,'' she recalls. ``No one in school likes actresses,
and they give you a hard time. Part of it's cool, though, because
you get so glorified when you're working. Everyone on the set is
always flattering you, so going back to high school and having to
fend for yourself kind of balances everything out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was hard,'' she admits. ``I came home many days, like,
sobbing crying. They made fun of everything: my clothes, my body,
my perceived attitude. But you get through it; I'm alive to tell
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alive and kicking.

CHEERLEADING FILM DELIVERS _ HONEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe sitting through so many incompetent Hollywood movies this
summer dulls critical faculties. Yet the more I think about ``Bring
It On,'' the more I feel justified in having enjoyed it from start
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a cheerleader comedy, you say. There's only been one
good cheerleading film in mankind's history, that Texas murdering
mom thing on cable ... and that was more about a murdering mom.
More commonly, whenever pompons appear in a movie, such as in the
current ``Replacements,'' they represent the cranial content of the
film's creators.
</P>
<P>
   So, liking this thing is kind of embarrassing. And some guys
just aren't going to get behind a movie about cheerleaders, no
matter how witty its comedy, surprisingly solid its plotting and
character work, and its copious exposure of teen-age midriffs.
There are several words for those kinds of men, but in this case
we'll just call them fools.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, ``Bring It On'' indeed boasts all of those virtues and
many more, among them the best coming-of-age story a major studio's
stumbled onto since ``Clueless'' and _ I gulp here _ absolutely
thrilling cheers.
</P>
<P>
   There, I said it. And I don't care! Being respected was nice
while it lasted, but these days respect seems a fair tradeoff for
that increasingly rare experience of a full-out good time at the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one of the smartest moves in Jessica Bendinger's
marvelously juggled script is its constant acknowledgment of just
how little respect the average person naturally bears for the
insufferably peppy. She constantly plays into our prejudices while
sneakily accruing detail upon detail about just how much talent and
hard work it takes to rise to the top of the competitive
cheerleading pyramid. This narrative strategy disarms skepticism to
the point where we can fully appreciate the athletic artistry of
complicated cheer routines.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see, then, why the cheer squad at San Diego's
cheekily named Rancho Carne High is the school's pride and joy.
Five-time national competition winners, they outshine the fumblebum
football team at every game.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of her senior year, all bubbleheaded, newly
anointed cheer squad captain Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) can
apply her limited reserves of serious thought to is maintaining her
upscale alma mater's stellar reputation as America's handstand
Harvard. But a series of calamitous events confirm her
superstitious notion that dropping some stupid sacred baton at
cheer camp cursed her (``Cheerleading urban legends?'' an appalled
confidant says, eyes a-rollin', upon hearing the troubled
confession).
</P>
<P>
   But adversity turns Torrance's brain bubbles into thought
balloons. She has to pump her imagination, tax her people skills,
develop both political savvy and social consciousness, confront her
doubts and locate her true confidence _ all while still mainly
caring about winning the nationals. In other words, Torrance must
become a real leader, and it's hard to think of any actress who's
charted such a thorough journey to maturity while maintaining the
crack comic timing and girlish hysteria Dunst displays here.
</P>
<P>
   And she can jump, too.
</P>
<P>
   So can Dunst's equally entertaining co-stars. Eliza Dushku from
TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' adds delectably judged mockery as
a punkish gymnast transfer who can't believe she's got to work with
these spirited squealers. Gabrielle Union and Natina Reed, Shamari
Fears and Brandi Williams of the pop group Blaque express nicely
modulated anger and pride as the East Compton Clovers, an
inner-city squad that, Torrance learns, to her horror, her
predecessor has been ripping off for years. The male contingent is
represented by Jesse Bradford's supportive skeptic and Ian Roberts'
hilarious, Bob Fosse-inspired choreography Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, director Peyton Reed, making his feature debut
following some Disney TV movies and Comedy Central sketch shows,
handles the racial conflict here as adroitly as he balances farce
and precision acrobatics. Pacing and tonal management is expert
throughout, even if the film could have done without the kooky,
cliched teen argot some adult obviously made up. Minor characters
sometimes transcend stereotypes, sometimes don't, and the sex
jokes, while underplayed in comparison to most recent raunchfests,
are predictably immature.
</P>
<P>
   But a few flaws don't prevent ``Bring It On'' from winning you
over. Go girls.  &QL;

Bjornson, Rutledge, and Eitzmann have two receptions total. Such
stats pale before the legacy of players like Ben Coates, a
five-time All-Pro in the 1990's; Marv Cook, an effective player
prior to Coates's tenure, and 1970's stars like Don Hasselbeck and
Russ Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end has become the lost position in New England. The War
Room, a publication in which NFL scouts rate every player, team,
and position, ranked the Patriots 25th out of 31 teams at tight
end. The Patriots also received poor grades at running back (29),
defensive line (29), and offensive line (31).
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots thought Coates's career was over and that
they'd easily be able to replace his 32 catches, that may now be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us has done much so far,'' said Rutledge.
``Basically, we've been concentrating on our blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge has been typecast as a blocker, but Coates always
thought that with work, Rutledge could become something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had a lot of balls thrown his way, he'd get better and
better,'' said Coates. ``He's big and strong and he runs alright.
Keep throwing it to him and he might develop into a good tight
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that commitment will be made by the coaching staff
remains to be seen. Bjornson is the more nimble _ an H-back type
who can be set into motion, split wide, and look more like a
receiver as he draws one-on-one coverage with linebackers and
sometimes safeties. On paper, Bjornson could be a decent pass
receiver. But he needs to get open. The veteran dropped a clear
touchdown pass in the end zone during the game against the Detroit
Lions, and since then hasn't had many balls thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge is playing a pure tight end position, on the line as a
blocker when the Patriots are trying to run the ball. But he'd like
more opportunities to act as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new experience for me and I'm trying to learn as
much as I can,'' said Rutledge. ``They've asked me to help control
the line of scrimmage and I've been happy to do that, but I'd also
like to touch the football.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been some school of thought that coordinator Charlie
Weis's offense doesn't incorporate the tight end as much as other
team's schemes, but that can only be true if he feels he doesn't
have enough talent at the position. Weis coached Coates when he
caught 94 passes to set the NFL season record for tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Weis understands that the tight end can bail the quarterback out
of tough spots. He's seen the chemistry between Coates and Bledsoe
over the years. Having a tight end who can be a threat opens the
field for the outside receivers, but the Patriots aren't showing
any of that capability. Also helping the tight end get open would
be the threat of the quarterback being able to dump the ball off to
the fullback. Tony Carter is capable of catching the ball, but that
hasn't happened much, either.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge was a second-round draft choice out of Alabama, and the
experts have said that Rutledge shouldn't have been picked that
high because he was one-dimensional, clumsy, and lacked
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   But Rutledge was ranked in the top five tight ends in the 1998
draft class which also included Alonzo Mayes, Stephen Alexander,
Cam Cleeland, and Blake Spence, who was recently released by the
New York Jets. None of them have set the world on fire. Alexander
and Cleeland have been hamepered by numerous injuries, while Mayes
has been an uninspired backup for the Bears and Spence had served
mostly a special-teams player the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The rap on Bjornson has been that he runs average routes and
doesn't do enough to get himself open. Also, his lack of bulk has
always paid a part in his inability, at times, to get off the line
of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also took a blow when they couldn't get fifth-round
pick Dave Stachelski to play because of physical and personal
problems, eventually releasing him. Stachelski has since hooked up
with the New Orleans Saints, which lost Cleeland to a season-ending
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the league is weak at the position, which is why Ozzie
Newsome, one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history and now the
vice president of player personnel with the Baltimore Ravens,
signed Shannon Sharpe and Coates.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots thought that Coates's skills had diminished to the
point where he was no longer worthy of his $2.5 million paycheck, a
smart move if the team had found suitable replacement(s) or had
sought to reduce his salary.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the Patriots having the complete tight end again
is slim, but most teams face that. They have either a good
receiving tight end or good blocking tight end. Tony Gonzalez and
Rickey Dudley types are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots can only wish they had a right end named Rod
Bjornson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Darius McCollum were a millionaire, he might be
excused as an eccentric. If he were a genius, allowances probably
would be made as well. But McCollum is neither. And his unusual
problem _ his obsession, as he calls it _ has gotten him in so much
trouble that people aren't even laughing anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was a high school freshman, McCollum, who grew up in
Queens and is now 35, has been in and out of jail for masquerading
as a New York City transit worker. He is back behind bars, for the
19th time in as many years, on charges that he pulled a subway
emergency brake during rush hour and then, dressed for the part,
came to the rescue as a phony transit supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Though little known outside the underground world he craves,
McCollum is the transit agency's biggest personal headache. Police
say his shenanigans are dangerous and have distributed his picture
to thousands of subway and bus workers with a stern warning: Be on
the lookout. He has a sprawling rap sheet and has spent five years
in prison. Still McCollum refuses to be just a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city of quirky people, the authorities say, McCollum
stands out, so expert at his chosen quirkiness that he has
repeatedly fooled riders, subway employees and police into
believing he belongs in transit blues. At wit's end, his elderly
parents have turned to a lawyer who is bent on proving that
McCollum is not in his right mind. A done deal with the city's No.
1 subway nut? No one is expecting an easy ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not insane,'' McCollum said recently in an interview at
the Rikers Island jail. ``I am just your average guy who doesn't
mind helping out. To tell you the truth, I wish they would just put
me to work on the trains. It would be a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a careful look. That self-satisfied smile is the only
giveaway. You may know him as Manning or Morning, two of his most
engaging personas, who, with a friendly wave and knowing nod, have
driven off with city buses and transit agency trucks. He first got
caught at the controls of a subway train at the age of 15, picking
up passengers at the World Trade Center before he had ever sat
behind the wheel of an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   He has signed out two-way radios and cheerfully collected fares
at ticket booths. (The radios have always been returned, and never
has a penny gone missing from the till; his most costly blunder was
leaving a commuter bus with a flat tire, police say). He has
cleared debris from tracks and put out fires. He has glad-handed
commuters in full uniform and has even reported sick to the transit
authority's infirmary to get aspirin for a headache.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, McCollum had the keys to three crew lockers at
subway buildings, where he has kept everything from protective
goggles to mud guards for his boots, all official transit agency
issue. If someone questions his credentials, McCollum not only
flashes an identity badge (he says he found it) but he produces a
letter of authorization on official stationery (he admits to
writing it himself, but insists the paper was a gift).
</P>
<P>
   When police are in hot pursuit, as they have been on nearly two
dozen occasions, his favorite hideout is at the transit agency
headquarters in Brooklyn. He exudes the confidence of someone who
belongs there, and it is usually the last place the police think to
look.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I describe it?'' McCollum said. ``It is one of those
things, I guess I want to be seen, to get attention toward me. I
like the activity. I like the noise. I like the people. I like the
people who work there. There is not something that I can say I like
the most. I like everything involved with it. I like the
operations. I like the scenery. I like the schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum is in custody awaiting trial on a host of charges,
including criminal impersonation. If found guilty, it will be his
sixth felony conviction, according to correction officials, all
related in one way or another to play-acting as a transit worker.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Tracey Bloodsaw, says McCollum needs help. He has
been living in a ``fake world'' and nobody has bothered to do
anything about it, she says. She has filed notice with the state
Supreme Court in Manhattan that she intends to fight the latest
charges with an insanity defense, the first time his state of mind
has been raised as an explanation for his behavior, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't think he is doing anything wrong,'' Bloodsaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Why nobody has offered such an argument before is anyone's
guess. A spokesman for New York City Transit, the unit of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. that operates the city's
buses and subways, would not comment. A police official familiar
with his cases said ``something is wrong'' with McCollum, but ``it
is not like he has a condition where he needs to be medicated or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloodsaw blames indifference on the part of McCollum's previous
court-appointed lawyers and the judicial system bureaucracy. ``They
just screwed up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, though skeptical, says insanity is worth a try. He was
twice admitted to a psychiatric hospital as a child, according to
records kept by his family, but he is lucid and articulate and
knows how to chat up just about everyone. He serves on an inmate
grievance committee at Riker's Island and volunteers to do typing
and other work for a variety of prison programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admit what this guy does is kind of wacky, but he
is very much on the ball,'' said an official with the City
Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most judges have considered McCollum more of a curiosity than a
menace. During one sentence hearing, he said, the judge joked that
he would like McCollum as his chauffeur. On another occasion,
McCollum said he got rave reviews when he appeared in court in full
transit uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she is going to ask me that question, about why I do
this,'' McCollum said of Justice Carol Berkman, who is hearing the
current case. ``I will have to come up with something the best I
can. I will say, `Listen, I have an obsession with trains.' That is
just it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent incident, on Feb. 21, the authorities say,
McCollum dressed up in transit blues and tripped the emergency
switch at the 57th Street station, bringing a Queens-bound train to
a screeching stop. He then went down on the track to sort out the
mess, which, as in his previous escapades, caused no injuries but
plenty of consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been doing this for so long that he knows all the
terminology and he knows how to operate the equipment,'' said Sgt.
Jack Cassidy, who heads police investigations of transit crimes.
``Honestly, just looking at him, you'd think he was an employee.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The truth, however, is that McCollum has never held a steady
job. He says he has applied to the transit agency, but his name
does not appear on any Civil Service lists. He once volunteered as
a tour guide at the transit museum in Brooklyn, but was let go when
police figured out who he was and became concerned that he would be
inclined to take exhibits on he road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me up and begged me to get that job back,'' Cassidy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials say there are umpteen train buffs who on
occasion break the law, but none with the repeat compulsion that
drives McCollum. His arrest in February came just six weeks after
he was released from state prison for a previous offense, taking a
joy ride in a transit agency vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum has been in custody 17 times in the last 15 years, city
correction officials say. He has also served in state prisons in
New York and North Carolina, where his parents moved 10 years ago
and where McCollum once stole a car to sneak back to New York.
Samuel and Elizabeth McCollum have given up posting bail for their
only child. His fiancee, Nelly Rodriguez, a clothing designer from
Ecuador who met McCollum on a subway platform in January, has
called off their intended nuptials because there is no telling when
he will be free again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't let him out,'' said Samuel McCollum, 79. ``He is
like an alcoholic or a drug addict. He has to first admit that he
has a problem. Until he does that, we can't help him.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the train thing seemed funny. As a teen-ager, McCollum
ended up in family court in 1981 for taking the controls of a
subway train for six stops from 34th Street to the World Trade
Center. In the days that followed, so many reporters and camera
crews staked out his home in Jamaica, Queens, that the boy missed a
week of school.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum said the trip was ``really very routine for me''
because he had been driving trains in the rail yards since he was
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came to a point, where on different occasions, people would
come to me and would say, `Want to cover the yard for me?' I would
say, `Cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth McCollum said she was advised at the time not to talk
about her son's troubled childhood, but her calendar from January
1981, which she still keeps in a dog-eared manila folder, speaks
volumes about his torment. Thursday, the 29th, is clearly marked as
the day Darius drove the E train. But the rest of the tiny boxes
are also scribbled in, 14 of them with the word ``OUT.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the days Darius did not come home,'' Mrs. McCollum
explained. ``He would run right down there into the subway. I would
go down there and look for him, but the workers would say he wasn't
there. But he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCollum was right, said a former track worker who left a
transit job two years ago on a disability pension. The man
described McCollum as more Boy Scout than criminal, someone always
looking to do a good deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never felt part of anything, and people in transit made him
feel welcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCollum said that her son always had trouble fitting in at
school, but that his troubles spiraled out of control when, at 10,
he was stabbed in the back with a pair of scissors by a student in
his special education class. Darius became so frightened, she said,
that he would sit at a desk only if his back was against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The McCollums sued the Board of Education for negligence over
the stabbing but lost. They tried a half-dozen schools, including a
military academy. He also got therapy and psychiatric treatment.
But nothing helped. After class, Darius would descend into the
subways. By 10th grade, he had dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good kid,'' McCollum said. ``He doesn't drink. He
doesn't smoke. He doesn't gamble. His thing is to go down into that
subway system. In his mind, he is still 15 driving that train.''

TRUSTEES COUNCIL CHEERS BOTH VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry L. Martin, president of the American Council of Trustees
and Alumni, cheered when George W. Bush tapped Dick Cheney as his
running mate. He cheered again when Al Gore chose Sen. Joseph
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which party wins, so does the council, an advocacy
group that fights what it considers political correctness on
college campuses and seeks to move power from 1960s-era faculties
into the hands of alumni and trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The council has strong ties to both vice-presidential
candidates. Lynne Cheney, Cheney's wife and the former chairwoman
of the National Endowment for the Humanities, is the council's
chairwoman. Lieberman is one of the most active members of its
advisory board. Both Mrs. Cheney and Lieberman were among its
founders five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just two members of our council, but our two
most active members,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The council, based in Washington, bills itself as bipartisan,
citing Lieberman and former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado,
another Democrat, who is its vice chairman. But its positions are
those more often associated with conservative intellectuals like
Mrs. Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   One council priority is for campuses to impose more strictly
regimented core curriculums anchored by American history and
Western civilization, like the ones that were the norm before the
late '60s, when colleges began to give students more latitude in
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Another priority is to make more room for conservative
viewpoints on campuses. Waving the banner of academic freedom _
once the rallying cry for professors trying to protect themselves
against the blacklists of the McCarthy era _ the council wants to
protect students and faculty members who take stands that may be
unpopular, like opposing affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anticipated connection to the White House, Martin
rejects the notion of hoping to dictate a national higher education
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the answer to higher education lies in the
federal government,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   With a limited budget _ about $550,000 drawn from foundations
and individuals _ what he hopes is that the new visibility for Mrs.
Cheney and Lieberman will translate into greater visibility for the
council, too. And he is not above using the leverage that such
prominent names can offer.
</P>
<P>
   In June, for example, the council worked with Lieberman on a
congressional resolution calling for university trustees and
administrators and state officials to press colleges to require
students to take courses in U.S. history in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Educators, parents and others should be alarmed at ``the
nation's growing ignorance of our past and what it implies for
America's future,'' Lieberman said in a heartfelt speech. The
resolution passed both houses unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the council's aims is to gather support among alumni
and trustees to use their power as donors and trustees to remake
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The council is trying to encourage more alumni to behave like
Lee M. Bass, who in 1995 withdrew a $20 million gift from Yale
University when it did not expand its Western civilization
curriculum as he had wished. It is also trying to cultivate
trustees who will insert themselves aggressively into campus
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said New York is one state in which the council has had
the most success, so he has plans, he said, to initiate a training
program for activist trustees in 20 states with major public
university systems ``to do in other states what we have done in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State University of New York, for example, where Martin
said he talks informally with Thomas F. Egan, SUNY's chairman, and
Candace de Russy, a vocal SUNY trustee, trustees have approved a
uniform core curriculum for undergraduates that includes American
history and Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he also had a working relationship with trustees at
the City University of New York, talking occasionally with Herman
Badillo, the chairman, and Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo has called for CUNY to study whether it should put in
place a core curriculum similar to SUNY's, and he and other
trustees have said they personally favor an American history
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the council has also fought efforts to trim
rigorous curriculum requirements at both Brooklyn College and the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A former philosophy professor at the University of Colorado at
Boulder, Martin, who is 58, went to Washington as an Andrew W.
Mellon Congressional Fellow in 1982, and stayed. He worked first as
a congressional aide, and then at the National Endowment for the
Humanities under Mrs. Cheney. In 1993, after she left, he became
acting chairman of the endowment. Two years later, he worked with
her again to form the National Alumni Council, the group that later
became the American Council of Trustees and Alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has not entirely abandoned academic life. Between efforts
to reshape universities, he has taught public policy and political
science as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and at the
Catholic University of America.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, the council, which has a staff of six,
including Martin, seems to have taken over his life. He married a
Brooklyn College philosophy professor, Abigail Rosenthal, after the
battle there. (He and she were on the same side.) Last week, he cut
short a vacation to think about how he could capitalize on the
Cheney and Lieberman candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had better come back and figure this out,'' he
said.

FAMILY WINS $328M VERDICT AGAINST PAIR WHO KILLED SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A jury has awarded the family of Jeffrey Curley, the
10-year-old Cambridge boy raped and smothered by two men, a
stunning $328 million in their wrongful death suit against the
boy's killers.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the award is little more than a moral
victory, since neither man convicted of the murder, Salvatore
Sicari or Charles Jaynes, has any assets to speak of, the Curley
family's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as probably the largest award ever in the United States
for the wrongful death of a murdered child, attorney Lawrence
Frisoli said, it sends an ``important'' message to other
pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a measuring stick by which to judge people who rape
kids and get caught,'' Frisoli said. ``We can't stop pedophiles
from raping children, but we can make it harder on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Curley family, which spent an emotionally-wrenching day on
the witness stand Tuesday testifying about how they have dealt with
their son's murder, was not in the Cambridge courtroom for the
verdict and declined comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But Frisoli said they were ``grateful'' to the Middlesex County
jury for the symbolic gesture and were ``ready to fight on'' in
their $200 million federal lawsuit against the North American
Man/Boy Love Association, a group which the family blames for
inciting and nurturing Jaynes' obsession with Jeffrey Curley.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in the courtroom as the verdict was read was surreal,
given the magnitude of the award. Neither the family nor the
defendants were in the courtroom. And Jaynes' attorney -- who was
told by his client to essentially offer no meaningful defense in
order to ``make it easier'' on the Curley family -- actually
praised the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a statement to deter future conduct by others,''
attorney Robert Bonsignore said of the jury award. ``This is an
example of how the justice system can affect positive societal
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore, who accepted a court appointment to the case from
Superior Court Judge Allen van Gestel to represent Jayne's
interests, refused payment. Sicari, who has appealed his
first-degree murder conviction, essentially ignored the civil case
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the jurors left through a side entrance of the
courthouse without commenting, but one female juror stopped long
enough to describe the verdict as ``self-explanatory,'' given the
horrifying testimony and evidence they saw during the two-day
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors heard how Sicari and Jaynes lured the boy into their car
with the promise of a new bike, tried to molest him, then smothered
him by stuffing a gasoline-soaked rag into his mouth and sitting on
him after he fought their advances.
</P>
<P>
   They then brought the boy up to New Hampshire, had sex with his
lifeless body, and then dumped his body in a river in Maine, police
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were shown the 50-gallon Rubbermaid storage container
Curley's body was stuffed in and an underwater police videotape of
the plastic coffin being recovered from the river bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people can use their own imaginations about why we
came up with the decision we did,'' said the juror, who asked not
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Robert and Barbara Curley and their surviving
sons, Robert Jr., 22, and Shaun, 20, a total of $128 million for
pain and suffering and loss of consortium, and $200 million in
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Jaynes, a 25-year-old from Brockton, and Sicari,
24, of Cambridge, now owe the Curley's $164 million each, but
neither has any money, Frisoli said. Both are serving life terms,
although Jaynes will eventually be eligible for parole on his
second-degree murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money to get,'' the family's attorney said. The
real importance of the verdict, he said, will be its affect on the
federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Frisoli said the family cannot stop NAMBLA from advocating for
changes in the laws governing sex with children, but will now press
in federal court for an injuction barring NAMBLA from ``telling
people how to get around the laws'' protecting children from
pornography and sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   The large damage award is important, he said, because it
``quantifies the family's loss'' for the federal lawsuit. Frisoli
said the Curleys now hope that a large award against NAMBLA in
federal court will effectively shut the organization down in the
same way pro-choice groups forced the founder of Operation Rescue
into bankrupcty with civil damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to a NAMBLA answering service in New York City
went unanswered Wednesday. A recording described the group as an
organization that ``speaks out against societal oppression and
celebrates the joy of men and boys in love'' and is ``serious about
empowering all people to love those to whom their hearts lead.''

CAMBRIDGE SEEKS DONATIONS TO PURCHASE COLLECTION OF NEWTON'S
PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Cambridge University opened a campaign Wednesday to
keep the papers of its alumnus Sir Isaac Newton in Britain, seeking
donations to prevent part of the scientist's legacy from falling
prey to the gravitational pull of outside buyers and market forces
as powerful as the natural laws he chronicled.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the privately owned Macclesfield Newton Collection,
an assemblage of letters, notebooks and autographed texts relating
to Sir Isaac's work on calculus, optics, mathematics and gravity.
The collection, held by the Macclesfield family since the 18th
century, complements a Newtonian archive that has been at
Cambridge's University Library since 1872.
</P>
<P>
   The current Earl of Macclesfield _ the ninth _ is offering to
sell the collection, through Sotheby's, to Cambridge University for
around $9.56 million. Britain's National Lottery has offered to put
up three quarters of the cost. The remaining quarter, $2.39
million, needs to be covered by the university, which is seeking
benefactors to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't raise this money, the danger is that the
collection might go abroad and be split amongst private collectors,
which would be a tragedy for scholars and a great loss for the
nation as a whole,'' said Peter Fox, the Cambridge University
librarian.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Cambridge and Sotheby's called the
collection ``arguably the most important and valuable collection of
scientific papers in private hands in Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce the campaign, Cambridge has enlisted a string of
supporters ranging from Carol Vorderman, a television game-show
presenter with a vaunted gift for mathematics, to professor Stephen
Hawking, who holds the same Lucasian chair at Cambridge that Newton
secured in 1669. ``These papers are important to show how his ideas
developed,'' Hawking said. ``Science doesn't appear out of the
blue. It's a series of steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Macclesfield is selling the collection to raise money to
maintain his family seat and its art collections at Shirburn Castle
in Oxfordshire, according to Sotheby's. He said in a statement that
Cambridge _ where Newton first studied in 1661 _ was ``clearly the
best place'' for the archive.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quarrie, the senior specialist in Sotheby's book
department, said the collection was donated to the Macclesfield
family in the 18th century by William Jones, an astronomer who had
acquired them from a friend of Newton. He said the collection
comprised ``some bound volumes of letters,'' notebooks and loose
papers. ``The most valuable are 50-plus letters and a great number
of autographed documents'' dealing with calculus and gravity, he
said. Until now, Quarrie said, the collection had been kept ``in a
cupboard'' at the Earl of Macclesfield's home.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Newton's contribution to science lay particularly in his laws of
motion, which established the modern science of mechanics, gravity
and calculus. His discoveries were challenged by 20th-century
science, notably by Einstein's theories of relativity, but are
still held to be valid for most purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge is especially keen to obtain the collection because it
already holds the Portsmouth Collection, presented by the fifth
Earl of Portsmouth in 1872, and the two archives complement one
another. ``Many of the letters included in the Portsmouth archive
have their replies among the documents held by the Earl of
Macclesfield,'' Cambridge University said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Portsmouth collection was initially handed over to the
university part as a gift and part as a loan. The Portsmouth family
put the loaned papers up for auction at Sotheby's in 1936, and
Cambridge bought the bulk of them back, according to Sotheby's. The
present sale of the Macclesfield collection is the most important
transaction involving a privately-owned scientific archive since
then, according to Quarrie.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hesketh, a fund-raiser at Cambridge, said the university
was looking for a small number of private benefactors _ or possibly
a single benefactor _ in Britain or the United States to support
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's said it had set an unspecified time limit for
Cambridge to raise its share of the money but, Quarrie said, `'we
are not going to quibble over a month or two.''

``BRING IT ON'' IS A ROUSING SLICE OF EXUBERANT HIGH-SCHOOL LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
After so many mundane and miserable teen movies _ from slasher
flicks to guy-meets-chick _ cynical disdain may await ``Bring It
On,'' yet another comedy about high school high jinks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet this film stands out _ not as an original (its focus on
fierce competition is nothing new), but as a well-executed story
with likable characters and fresh flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the cliche-littered sports arena, ``Bring It On''
concerns those who bounce, bound and cheer jocks on: cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cheerleading itself is considered a sport, especially in
this affectionate film, which resists the notion that cheerleaders
are vain airheads.
</P>
<P>
   The peppy kids at upscale Rancho Carne High in San Diego aren't
just leading yells for their lousy football team. They're five-time
national champs in cheerleading competition, which involves not
just school spirit, but inventive choreography and tough
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   The Toros' new captain is Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), a
good-hearted girl who wisely recruits sullen transfer student Missy
(Eliza Dushku of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''), a top gymnast,
while fending off power plays by Heatheresque girls in the group.
</P>
<P>
   But her chief rivals turn out to be 100 miles away: an
ethnically diverse squad from Los Angeles, embittered because
Torrance's predecessor stole their routines.
</P>
<P>
   Led by prideful captain Isis (Gabrielle Union), the underdog
Clovers are naturally destined to meet the Toros in competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, director Peyton Reed doesn't play this for an
inflated sense of inspiration. Both squads have flaws, and
tunnel-visioned drive is arguably one of them.
</P>
<P>
   We also see cheerleading from the other side, via Missy's
brother (Jesse Bradford), a rocker-intellectual who sneers at
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Torrance's sibling (Cody McMains) shares his perspective, and he
does his little-brother duty by mocking sis with hearty enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   But largely, this is a happy teen fantasy, marked by the usual
wealth trappings and almost utter absence of parents.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bolstering cheerleaders' image, screenwriter Jessica
Bendinger has an ear for witty youthful repartee. Her dialogue
often adopts the wordplay of cheers and is combative without being
mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   In such ways, ``Bring It On'' avoids the tiresome belligerence
of so many teen movies. Its infighting subsides in the face of team
spirit, and the film settles into the more manageable rivalry
between the Toros and Clovers.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Torrance hires a choreographer (Ian Roberts) for
fresh material. Branding his charges ``sweater monkeys,'' he's a
crazed, abrasive and hilarious Bob Fosse-wannabe who steals the
show.
</P>
<P>
   But so do the crisp, elaborate and highly athletic routines. In
tone and execution, ``Bring It On'' plays like a recruitment film
for the cult of cheerleading.
</P>
<P>
   Dunst, 18, was a cheerleader in high school, and it shows. But
beyond making the moves, she has smiling good spirits atop a
grounded grasp of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the former child star of ``Interview With the Vampire''
has grown up to be a lovable actress. Known for her professionalism
on the set, on screen Dunst radiates warmth, girlish femininity and
a spry sense of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On'' (meaning: put your best foot forward) also
injects a budding romance between Dunst and Bradford. They adore
from a distance, sharing a weird courtship ritual while brushing
their teeth and locking eyes from the stands at a game.
</P>
<P>
   That prompts one girl to taunt, ``Don't play dumb. You're having
cheerleader sex with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boy-girl maneuvers are minimized, and sex is brushed
over.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Bring It On'' is a rousing slice of exuberant
high-school life, played with enough energy, spirit and sassy
attitude to make any cheerleader proud _ and perhaps to make jaded
viewers cheer, not jeer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Bring It On'' &QL; 
Starring: Kirsten Dunst &QL; 
Rating: PG-13, for sex-related material and language &QL; 
Running time: 100 minutes &QL; 
Grade: B+  &QL;

COMMENTARY: PARDON ME, BUT ... 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former President Bill Clinton will never look out
at us from behind bars. He will (1) escape indictment by the new
grand jury; (2) be acquitted at trial; or (3) be pardoned in
advance. With ``Jail to the Chief'' not an option, we can begin to
weigh the arguments about prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence,''
decided Federal Judge Susan Webber Wright in the Paula Jones suit,
``that the president responded to plaintiff's questions by giving
false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to
obstruct the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright fined Clinton $90,000 for civil contempt, leaving it to
the independent counsel to pursue the criminal charge with no risk
of double jeopardy. Wisely, Clinton did not appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the president had repeated his false testimony under oath to
a federal grand jury. If any other citizen lies both in court and
before a grand jury, prosecution follows.
</P>
<P>
   After the House impeachment, the Senate voted largely on party
lines not to remove him because his wrongdoing did not amount to
``high crimes.'' Many senators voting to acquit explained that the
wrongdoer could be prosecuted after he left office for these
``lower'' crimes of perjury and obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The general feeling was that he had been lying about
extramarital sex, which so many do. What needed correcting was the
privacy-invasive sexual harassment law that lets a plaintiff demand
that a defendant reveal experience with others. It's a bad law.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a law that Clinton signed, and when the oath is broken
in plain view by the national leader sworn to uphold it, its
enforcement becomes unavoidable. If a president is allowed to
testify falsely with impunity, then so could everybody else _ and
without equal compulsion to tell the truth, equal justice becomes a
mockery.
</P>
<P>
   How do we uphold the law when most of the country wants to
``move on''? It's not enough to say the possible perjurer has been
punished enough or that prosecution is expensive. The way to
preserve the power of the oath to coerce truthful testimony is to
apply the equal-justice standard _ but then to follow the
Constitution's willingness to make it unequal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in April by newspaper editors about a presidential pardon
by Clinton's successor, Al Gore said: ``President Clinton is way
ahead of you on this. He said publicly some time ago that he would
neither request or accept a pardon.'' Before the same group a day
later, Clinton left out the ``accept'' part: ``The answer is I have
no interest in it. I wouldn't ask for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore treats the question of pardon as mooted by Clinton's
dismissal of the idea. And too many have bought the notion that a
pardon must be sought or ``accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not so. Controlling legal authority is in Biddle vs.
Perovich (1927), a case in which a convict objected to the method
of a presidential commutation of his sentence: ``Just as the
original punishment would be imposed without regard to the
prisoner's consent and in the teeth of his will,'' wrote Justice
Holmes for the Supreme Court, ``whether he liked it or not, the
public welfare, not his consent determines what shall be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is it written that a pardon must be requested; it can
come on the president's initiative, as when Ford pardoned Nixon.
The pardoned person can refuse, but the merciful deed is done ``in
the teeth of his will.'' Prosecution stops. The accused or
convicted is free _ martyrdom denied _ like it or not. (See
Margaret Colgate Love's analysis in the June 2000 Fordham Urban Law
Journal.)
</P>
<P>
   This means Gore will have to stop dancing away from the question
as if the pardon decision were somehow shared with the pardonee.
It's time he chose the hard right over the easy wrong answer. (For
Bush, it would be an opportunity to demonstrate nonpartisan
compassion on a grand scale.)
</P>
<P>
   Let the independent counsel and grand jury lay out detailed
charges, if the evidence calls for it, with no political
consideration or fear of retribution _ as the law demands. That's
the punishment of humiliation. Then, if need be, with no folderol
about request or acceptance, let the new president intervene with a
pardon _ as Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution gives him
exclusive power to do.
</P>
<P>
   That's constitutional justice. That's the system working.
</P>

RENO WON'T NAME SPECIAL COUNSEL TO PROBE GORE'S 1996 CAMPAIGN
ACTIVITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that she
will not name a special counsel to examine Al Gore's 1996 campaign
activities, prompting Republicans to suggest the American voters
would have the final say on his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Defending her decision, Reno said her own review of the vice
president's comments to investigators gave no indication that he
was untruthful when he denied knowing that a Buddhist temple event
and White House coffees were fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fund-raising in 1996 had been at the center of a lengthy
political storm and resurfaced when he began his drive to become
the Democrats' presidential nominee this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because further investigation is not likely to result in a
prosecutable case under applicable criminal law and principles of
federal prosecution, I have concluded that a special counsel is not
warranted,'' Reno said. ``I've concluded that there is no
reasonable possibility that the further investigation could develop
evidence that would support the filing of charges (against Gore)
for making a willful false statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, locked in a tight race against Republican Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, said through a spokesman that he was ``pleased''
with Reno's decision _ the third time she has rejected an internal
Justice Department call for an independent investigation of the
vice president's 1996 fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is going to keep doing what he has been doing all
along,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane, referring to the vice
president's focus on education, social security and other national
issues. ``It's illuminating that Republicans seem more interested
in talking about this than George W. Bush's tax-cut plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, dismissing Reno's decision, said Gore continues to be
marred by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's clear that Al Gore engaged in a number of
questionable fund-raising activities and gave the FBI statements
that continue to raise the issue of his credibility, the American
people are sick and tired of all these scandals and
investigations,'' Bush said. ``The best way to put all these
scandals and investigations behind us is to elect someone new. I'm
running to uphold the honor and dignity of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   With her decision, Reno rejected calls from Robert Conrad, the
department's chief investigator of campaign abuses, that she name
an independent, outside counsel to investigate Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno said she concluded last weekend that an outside inquiry
is unnecessary after reading a transcript of Gore's April 18
interview with federal investigators. Naming a special counsel to
review such flimsy evidence of lying would violate the American
concept of justice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the heart of everything we care about in this
country: that you don't pursue a case where there is no basis for
concluding that you can make a case,'' the attorney general said.
``You don't put people through an investigation where you don't ...
think that you can find the evidence that would justify further
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has rebuffed similar requests for a special counsel to
investigate fund-raising calls Gore made from his office and
whether he truthfully told investigators that he thought the money
raised was for general Democratic purposes and not for President
Clinton's 1996 re-election, which would be illegal under federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   Reno reiterated that her decisions not to name special counsels
were motivated solely by the facts and law and not by any desire to
prevent embarrassment to Gore and his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do things based on politics,'' Reno said. ``I realize
that politics will be hurled around my head. I just sit there and
duck as it comes and continue to look at the evidence and the law
and make the best judgment I can after consultation with as many
people as possible who have relevant information.''
</P>
<P>
   While Conrad's call for an outside investigator was shared by
many in the department, Reno said many other aides were just as
forceful in arguing that an independent inquiry was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno's spirited defense of her decision drew sharp criticism
from Republican senators who have strongly opposed her refusal to
name special counsels to investigate alleged Democratic
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno has steadfastly refused to follow the
recommendations of her career law enforcement officers and allow an
independent investigation of high-ranking administration
officials,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who chaired Senate
hearings on alleged campaign improprieties. ``There was never any
reason to believe that she would do any differently in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a frequent and outspoken critic of
Reno, said the attorney general's refusal to name an outside
investigator ``flies in the face of strong evidence'' that Gore
knew the California temple event and coffees were fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he would not call for a congressional investigation
of Reno's decision until after the presidential election in
November, saying such an inquiry now would ``politicize'' the
important issues of whether an attorney general can ever conduct an
unbiased investigation of administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to what happens to Mr. Gore, we will leave it to the voters
to decide the issue of the vice president's honesty,'' Specter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Political donations by religious organizations are illegal under
federal law. The Hsi Lai Temple luncheon netted more than $65,000
in illegal donations for the Democratic Party, federal
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   When news of Conrad's recommendation that Reno name an outside
counsel surfaced in June, Gore quickly released a 124-page
transcript of his occasionally rancorous interview with federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Gore at one point told the investigators that prior to his
temple visit he ``sure as hell did not have any conversations''
that would indicate it was to be a fund-raising event. ``I still do
not know that any funds, that any money changed hands there,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the coffees, Gore said he understood the events
to be merely friendly get-togethers that might be followed by
Democratic Party requests that those in attendance contribute to
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's campaign-finance investigation is continuing, the
Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Conrad's task force has prosecuted 25 people outside
the administration for alleged fund-raising violations. In March,
Maria Hsia, who helped organize Gore's visit to the temple, was
convicted of hiding $109,000 in illegal contributions and causing
false statements to be made to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   She awaits sentencing next month.

UN CRITIZICED FOR PEACEKEEPING METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Nations peacekeeping operations failed abjectly
throughout the 1990s due to wishful thinking, poor strategic
planning, and insufficient use of force, senior international
peacekeepers and relief officials reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As their report was submitted, the United Nations was forced to
suspend some of its operations on the strife-torn south Asian
island of Timor after Indonesian militias attacked peacekeepers
with machetes and terrorized the occupants of West Timor refugee
camps the United Nations was supposed to be protecting.
</P>
<P>
   Two peacekeepers have been killed in the Timor operations, and
militias are operating with growing boldness in the border region
between West Timor, which is part of Indonesia, and the former
Dutch colony of East Timor, which voted for independence in
UN-sponsored balloting a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's setbacks in Timor underscored the findings of the
international panel that the UN, namely that the world organization
has not learned the lessons of its disgraces and defeats in Bosnia,
Rwanda, and Sierra Leone _ all places where inept or impotent UN
forces contributed to the deaths of innocents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major red flag to member states,'' said J. Brian
Atwood, former head of the US Agency for International Development
and the only American on the panel. ``The job (of peacekeeping) is
not being done. We're saying if it can't be done well, don't
attempt it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The most profound change advocated by the panel was that the
United Nations discard its traditional neutral posture in
situations with clear victims and aggressors. Reluctance to do this
was a major failing of recent UN operations and contributed to
hundreds of thousands of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``(W)here one party to a peace agreement clearly and
incontrovertibly is violating its terms, continued equal treatment
of all parties. . . may amount to complicity with evil,'' the
report stated. ``No failure did more to damage the standing and
credibility of United Nations peacekeeping in the 1990s than its
reluctance to distinguish victim from aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the panel's other major recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Member states should create several multinational,
brigade-size military forces, with support units, so that effective
force can be swiftly deployed. The United Nations should maintain
lists of field officers who could beginning planning and organizing
operations as soon as it appears a deployment is likely.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United Nations should develop a capacity for military and
political intelligence-gathering so that it can assess more
realistically what dangers its missions face and what level of
force will be needed to deter what the report called ``spoilers'' _
parties that agree to a UN intervention only to gain time to
prepare for renewed aggression.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Security Council should not authorize new operations until
member states have pledged sufficient troops, but the
secretary-general should be authorized to spend up to $50 million
to prepare an operation in advance of the authorization. The aim
would be to keep preparations moving swiftly but avoid dispatching
understaffed missions.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said the main reasons missions are dispatched slowly and
with insufficient manpower are that, currently, little can be done
before a Security Council resolution is passed, and there is little
cooperation between the diplomats in the council and the military
and administrative leaders the United Nations sends to
troublespots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disconnect between the diplomacy of negotiating
peace and the mechanisms of upholding peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rotberg, director of the program on intrastate conflict
at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, praised the
panel's effort to distinguish between traditional peacekeeping
efforts and peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The report stressed that UN operations in the 1990s have shifted
from the concept of peacekeeping that developed before 1990.
Because of the US-Soviet standoff, Cold War-era operations on which
major powers disagreed were almost never launched. Those that were
launched generally involved two sides that wanted a peace monitored
by a third, neutral party so that ceasefire violations would not
escalate into renewed warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those operations involved unarmed Fijians and Canadians
essentially verifying that people weren't harming each other,''
said Rotberg, author of an upcoming book on peacekeeping and peace
enforcing in Africa. ``Nowadays we need people capable of imposing
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael T. Corgan, a former political and military planner for
NATO planner who now is associate professor of international
relations at Boston University, agreed, and added that ``we have to
recognize that peacemaking essentially involves war. You must be
able to convincingly threaten full combat even if doesn't come to
that, and you incur many of the costs of a war.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report was commissioned by Secretary General Kofi
Annan in response to earlier, highly critical reports on the
failings of UN missions in Bosnia and Rwanda. It will be presented
to international leaders at the Millennium Summit at the United
Nations in early September.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda in 1994 hundreds of thousands of people were
slaughtered when undermanned UN forces failed to stand between the
Hutu ethnic group and its target, the Tutsi ethnic group. In Bosnia
in 1995, more than 7,000 Muslims were massacred when peacekeepers
withdrew from Srebrenica, a town which had been under UN
protection.
</P>
<P>
   But, Atwood said, the UN debacle in Sierra Leone earlier this
year _ when 500 UN troops were taken hostage and robbed of their
vehicles _ ensured that the panel would reach consensus on a
bluntly worded analysis recommending major changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first met in New York, I thought maybe there would be
trouble reaching concensus,'' Atwood said, ``but by the next
meeting, in Geneva, the full extent of the Sierra Leone problems
were apparent, and it was never again in question that we would
reach concensus.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report does not make specific references to the Sierra
Leone mission, references to the need for UN units to be capable of
defending themselves and for the Secretariat not to ``apply
best-case planning to situations where local actors have
historically exhibited worst-case behavior'' reflect the Sierra
Leone situation.
</P>
<P>
   By lagging in paying its UN fees and constantly pushing to lower
its contributions to the organization, the United States has become
a major obstacle to more robust UN operations, but Atwood said the
result is costing the United States more and delivering less for
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is going to pay a lot more training Nigerians and
others now going into Sierra Leone than it would have paid had the
UN been equipped to do the job in the first place,'' he said. ``And
the killing and humiliation of US forces in Somalia _ people forget
that they were there as the result of a failed UN mission.''

 &HT;    Air delay data flies erratically
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Making sense of the government data that track airline
delays and late arrivals isn't nearly as frustrating for the
average traveler as an unexpected stay in an airport terminal, but
it's no trip in first class either.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation
Administration each produce monthly numbers but use different
metrics in assessing the airlines' performance.
</P>
<P>
   Delay statistics have received more attention than usual this
summer as labor troubles and stormy weather boost cancellations and
late arrivals, even as some airlines add minutes to flight
schedules to better the odds of being on time.
</P>
<P>
   Rising delays prompted Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to
summon airline executives and labor leaders to Washington this week
to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
   With all the statistics flying around in political discussions
and media reports, it's easy to lose sight of what the numbers
actually show.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT statistics, which rank airlines according to arrival
performance, have been published monthly for years and are most
closely followed in the industry. But this summer the FAA delay
data, which track late takeoffs, have generated more chatter and
criticism of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's statistics are based on the time a plane leaves the
airport. A flight usually is labeled delayed if it takes off more
than 15 minutes past the scheduled departure _ even if it goes on
to reach the destination on time.
</P>
<P>
   The standard taxi time _ about 11 minutes at Hartsfield
International Airport _ also is factored in before a plane is
considered delayed. The FAA logs delays related to air traffic
control issues, including bad weather, crowded skies, air traffic
control equipment and closed runways, but not airline-specific
issues such as maintenance problems. Weather generally accounts for
about 70 percent of all delays.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, which generates the numbers itself, doesn't rank
airlines' results. ``We're looking at the big picture,'' said FAA
spokeswoman Tanya Wagner. ``We're not looking at the individual
airlines to make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on FAA numbers for January through June, delays rose to
251,874 this year, or 2.59 per 1,000 flights, from 227,719 delays,
or 2.38 per 1,000 flights, in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT each month publishes a consumer report on its Web site,
dot.gov/airconsumer/, including on-time percentages for the 10
biggest U.S. airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT considers a flight on time if it arrives at the gate
within 15 minutes of the scheduled time, regardless of any delays
en route. Airlines supply the raw data through automated reports;
the DOT compiles the data and ranks the carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT has not released statistics for June or the first six
months of the year because it is changing the computer system that
produces the data. But in May, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines
sported the best numbers of the major airlines with slightly more
than 80 percent of flights on time. Facing labor trouble and stormy
weather, Chicago-based United Airlines was last at 56.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 major airlines as whole, 74.3 percent of flights arrived
on time in May, down from 76.2 percent a year earlier. The DOT
hopes to report June numbers before the end of August, a spokesman
said. For the industry as a whole, on-time performance slipped in
four of the first five months of this year compared with the same
months in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So which numbers mean more? John Talmadge, Delta manager of
customer excellence, said the DOT's data are more widely accepted
in the industry, although the FAA numbers, which break down the
reasons for delays into categories, help airlines understand which
types of complaints to expect from travelers.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers on deadlines, an airport delay might not cause as
much damage as a late arrival. If a plane is stalled in an airport,
it can easily make up the lost time if it hits favorable tailwind,
Talmadge said.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT's list might seem like a handy guide for people
concerned with punctuality, but for business travelers paying top
dollar for tickets, on-time performance probably ranks third or
fourth in importance, said Chris McGinnis, an Atlanta travel
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Business people generally are more concerned with schedules and
frequent flier perks, but trends don't go unnoticed, McGinnis
noted. ``Everyone knows that Southwest Airlines has the best
numbers,'' he said, ``and when Delta was really bad a few years
ago, I think people recognized that.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Trippler, a consultant for Web site Onetravel.com, said
consumers are most concerned with arrival time. Most don't mind if
airlines pad flight times to boost on-time performance if it means
they'll reach the destination at the advertised time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the rules of the game, and that's all consumers can
ask,'' Trippler said.

 &HT;    Woods' success sparks more interest in East Lake's Tour
Championship
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Timing is everything. In a golf swing. In a golf
tournament's anxious preparation for the arrival of the sport's
mega-star.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night at the peak of the PGA Championship telecast
and the riveting battle between Tiger Woods and Bob May, a
promotion ran on CBS-TV for the Nov. 2-5 Tour Championship at East
Lake Golf Club, featuring you-know who.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything. The Tour Championship's defending
champion, Woods, had just sunk a birdie putt at the first playoff
hole prior to the commercial break. A half hour later, Woods, 24,
had secured his third major of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday morning,'' said Ron Cross, the Tour Championship's
tournament director, ``the phone was ringing off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Tour Championship, which also will bring the other 29
top PGA Tour moneywinners to East Lake, is only 66 days away, as
Woods was reminded Wednesday during a teleconference from Akron,
Ohio, where he is (what else?) the defending champion at the NEC
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour Championship pre-tournament mood and the Sunday
leaderboard are expected to be much different this time.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Hal Sutton won at East Lake, Woods finished
20th, getting most of his attention for wearing a gag Halloween
Afro wig walking to the 18th green. The raging debate in late '98
was whether David Duval or Mark O'Meara would win PGA Tour player
of the year. Woods had it won this year by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the golf course was playing difficult,'' Woods said
of East Lake. ``You had a lot of bermuda rough that was pretty deep
and it was pretty high. The ball settled down to the bottom and you
never got a good lie. The guy who drove the ball in the fairway was
doing to have a lot of success. Hal is a wonderful driver of the
ball and he proved that by winning the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour Championship officials Wednesday also unveiled the first
Payne Stewart Award, which will be awarded during tournament week
to the player most upholding the late U.S. Open champion's conduct
and commitment to the game.

IN `THE TAO OF STEVE', STEVEHOOD IS THE STATE TO WHICH ALL MEN
ASPIRE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
It probably is tempting _ if you're male and single and of a
certain mindset _ to try to commit to memory The Tao of Steve's
rules for attracting women. After all, they work well enough for
Dex.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dex is the overweight, underemployed lothario at the center of
the movie who is never at a loss for female companionship. Not only
has he mastered the art of seduction, Dex has broken down its
components and worked up a set of principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursue that which retreats from us,'' he tells an acolyte,
quoting philosopher Martin Heidegger. ``You must learn to eliminate
your desire.''
</P>
<P>
   This is important, he says, because women can always detect a
man with an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   One minute Dex (Donal Logue) seems like just a roly-poly,
fun-loving guy, the next minute he's still a roly-poly, fun-loving
guy but he's dispensing wisdom like a holy man. Not for nothing
does a statue of Buddha sit at the head of his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Central to his philosophy is the notion that ``Steve is the
prototypical American male.'' Super-cool Steve McQueen was the
``ultimate Steve,'' but there's also Steve Austin (television's
``Six Million Dollar Man'') and Steve McGarrett (the hero of
``Hawaii Five-O''). Stevehood is the state to which all men aspire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan is a Steve,'' Dex says.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this sounds a bit like a religion, then Dex is the
high priest of Steveism.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the movie, one soon suspects that this elaborate
philosophical framework may be nothing more than his way of
justifying a lifestyle that consists primarily of pursuing women,
smoking dope and hanging out with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing stuff is overrated,'' Dex says when someone suggests he
do something with his life. ``Like Hitler _ he did a lot, but don't
we wish he'd stayed home and got stoned?''
</P>
<P>
   Dex seems to genuinely believe the things he says, and he makes
the Santa Fe slacker lifestyle seem an attractive choice. Still,
it's hard to shake the notion that he's self-deluded. Especially
when he becomes enamored with Syd, a woman he'd known 10 years
earlier in college and whom he doesn't remember.
</P>
<P>
   She retreats, and he pursues, thus proving the validity of his
teachings. Meanwhile, he continues to teach the tao of Steve even
as he himself violates most of the principles.
</P>
<P>
   This is an amiable little film about an amiable large man.
Neither is in much of a hurry to get anywhere, which can be either
mildly bothersome or one of the movie's chief charms.
</P>
<P>
   Once it starts to amble with a greater sense of purpose, you
might want to put on the brakes _ not because it's going in the
wrong direction (although it doesn't feel quite like the right
one), but because Dex's teachings about Steve get called into
question. And the single men in the audience who are still jotting
down notes haven't even had a chance to try out what they've
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Greer Goodman, who plays Syd, also co-wrote the movie with
Duncan North, a kindergarten teacher from whose life the film is
drawn. Goodman's sister directed it, which probably accounts for
all the adoring close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has fun with the notion that Dex easily gets women who
are much better looking than he is. Goodman resembles Farrah
Fawcett without the Fawcett hair, only her body is more angular and
her face isn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   One of the good things about the film is that most of the
characters look the way real people look. Real people put on weight
and have too-thin lips and eyes that are set too close together.
It's good to see a movie about people like us.
</P>
<P>
   What is most unbelievable about the Dex-Syd relationship isn't
that they aren't a good physical match, but that their lifestyles
and values seem completely different.
</P>
<P>
   She's athletic, has a good job and an apparently healthy sense
of self-esteem. He's a slob who smokes grass for breakfast and
works just enough to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``opposites attract'' is one of the Steve principles that
never gets mentioned. &QL;

IN BEIJING, A MUSEUM EXHIBIT ON THE EVILS OF AVARICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Foreign Journal) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The multitudes visiting Beijing's newest museum
exhibit are greeted by pretty young guides in neat white dresses.
Providing nonstop fact-filled commentary through a half-hour tour,
the escorts cheerfully explain highlights of the posters and
showcases that fill two large halls of the Military Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The scene resembles a commercial fair or a convention, and you
would hardly guess that the show is devoted to an evil that
Communist leaders call one of the gravest threats to China's
stability.
</P>
<P>
   This oddly toned ``Beijing Exhibition on Attacking and
Preventing Economic Crime'' has been staged by the city government
together with the police, prosecutors and courts. Ostensibly
intended to educate the public about bribery, embezzlement and
fraud, it will run for a month.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a growing national propaganda campaign that
officials hope will scare off potential miscreants and _ most
important to the party's survival _ convince an angry and skeptical
population that the authorities are resolutely battling corruption.
</P>
<P>
   While would-be voyeurs did not find any mink coats or pictures
of errant officials' secret love nests, some of the tens of
thousands who crowded the show in its opening days this week did
shake their heads at the stories of audacious swindles. As one
woman studied the picture of an embezzler sentenced to life in
prison, she muttered, ``He should be shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were intrigued by the suitcase of counterfeit bills on
display or fascinated by the re-created living room, with fine
furniture and liquor bottles, of a now-executed official of a state
enterprise and his wife who stole millions in company assets.
</P>
<P>
   But the exhibition also pulls its punches, reflecting the
party's unease with full exposure of a cancer that has spread so
deeply in its own ranks. And as a result, many concerned citizens
left the halls expressing dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   As he fanned himself outside the museum, Li Yushu, a retired
teacher in his late 70s, said he had come ``because corruption is
such a serious problem,'' but he added that ``exhibitions like this
one can't get at the root of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with corruption requires building up the rule of law
and reforming the government,'' Li said. ``Ordinary people like me
feel that the government's crackdown is not intense enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring omission in this exhibit of 70 major ``economic
crimes'' is the infamous case of Chen Xitong, Beijing's former
mayor and Communist Party chief as well as a member of the party's
all-powerful Politburo, who is now serving time for his giant
bribery schemes.
</P>
<P>
   This decision to ignore the country's most sensational and
politically sensitive case did not escape notice. Many Beijing
residents are skeptical about the consistency of law enforcement
anyway, often repeating stories about senior well-connected
officials and their relatives who escaped prosecution for misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   One notorious case does get good exposure: that of Cheng Kejie,
until recently a vice chairman of the national Parliament and the
former kingpin of a backward southern province who is now on death
row for extorting $5 million in payoffs. The crowds lingered
longest before a giant photograph of the handcuffed Cheng in court
and a small one of his mistress, Li Ping, who shared the money and
got a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But many other examples in the exhibition involve private crimes
like credit-card fraud or consumer swindles rather than the gross
abuses of official power that are of greatest public concern. And
lumping these two categories together as ``economic crimes'' tends
to blur the crucial distinction.
</P>
<P>
   An editor with a government publication who brought along her
teen-age daughter said she had found the exhibit disappointing in
ways she couldn't quite put her finger on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody already knows about these kinds of cases anyway;
they're in the newspapers every day,'' said the editor, who would
give only her surname, Li. ``I was expecting something more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the papers said that the largest display was
devoted to Cheng Kejie,'' she said, referring to the convicted
legislator, whose bribery scandal had implicated many other
officials. ``But it didn't tell us anything new at all. I'd like to
know more of the inside story, more detail about what really
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to permit a free press or free elections _ which
foreign analysts say are most vital to curbing corruption _ the
government is relying on propaganda, showcase executions and the
fitful strengthening of law enforcement. This week, officials
trumpeted a new policy that could make a difference if consistently
enforced: routine financial auditing of retiring senior officials
and heads of state enterprises. An assumption is that officials
facing retirement are especially likely to stash away money to
supplement their pensions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fighting back any qualms about a double-edged message, top
officials have also publicly endorsed a gripping new feature film
that portrays the noble stand of a fictional city mayor against the
corruption all around him _ vice that engulfs his brother, his
party patron and even his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, ``A Life and Death Choice,'' was adapted from a
popular novel and produced by the Shanghai Film Studios. It has
already opened in several cities and appears to have struck a
chord. In Shanghai alone, the producers say, more than a million
tickets have been sold, to individuals as well as to government
employees required to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The film is to open in Beijing theaters on Friday, after a
drumbeat of anticipation in the local papers. Last week, after an
advance screening, Beijing's mayor, Liu Qi, and Communist Party
secretary, Jia Qinglin, publicly praised the film and instructed
all city workers to see it.
</P>
<P>
   By now, China's leaders can hardly avoid acknowledging that the
party has harbored many bad apples. But a potential danger, as they
strive to cleanse the one-party system while preserving it, is the
unleashing of uncontrollable resentments.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the new exhibition, next to the stack of fliers
telling citizens how they can report examples of fraud or bribery
without fear of reprisals, is a sign of the new, more open China.
Several city officials and private attorneys sit in a row, offering
free legal consultations to museum visitors.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the prosecutor's office got more than she
bargained for the other day. A man who had traveled from Jilin
province, in China's remote northeast, to pursue his grievance in
the capital sat before her, waving old legal papers and a map of a
forest area. Corrupt local officials there had cheated him out of
land and logging revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal official said she could only give him the phone
numbers of authorities back in Jilin _ who, the man pointed out,
had already refused to help. He became louder and more agitated,
and refused to give up his seat. Finally, a policeman came and led
him away.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: When installing wallpaper around a window I have trouble
fitting it neatly against the edge of the wood frame.
 &HT;    No matter how carefully I measure, cut or trim this strip to the
correct width before I apply it, it still doesn't hang as evenly as
it should.
 &HT;    What am I doing wrong?
 &HT;    A: When less than a full width of wallpaper is needed it is best
not to cut and trim until you actually hang it on the wall and
paste it in place.
 &HT;    Here's what most pros do:
 &HT;    If less than half a width of wallpaper is required to fit right
up against the window molding, cut the strip lengthwise to several
inches wider than necessary (if more than half the width is needed,
don't bother to cut it).
 &HT;    Hang this strip on the wall, allowing the excess width to lap
onto and over the window frame as though it were not there.
 &HT;    Smooth the paper against the wall, and use a smoothing brush to
crease the paper firmly against the edge of the molding along its
full length.
 &HT;    Then run a razor blade down the joint to trim off the excess.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My house has aluminum panels installed over the overhanging
eaves around the outside.
 &HT;    During hot weather these panels expand and buckle slightly
between the nailing points, leaving gaps between them and the wood
fascia boards.
 &HT;    When it cools off the panels return to their flat position.
 &HT;    What do you think causes this? And what should I do about it?
 &HT;    A: It sounds as though the panels were not nailed up properly.
 &HT;    Aluminum always expands in hot sun so when installing panels or
siding the nails should never be driven in all the way.
 &HT;    They normally go through slots in the aluminum, rather than
small holes, which allows the aluminum to ``move'' or stretch
lengthwise as it expands.
 &HT;    One solution now would be to pull out the old nails and use
these slots to drive in new ones _ but do not drive them in all the
way.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My wood kitchen cabinets are stained a light mahogany color
and I want to lighten them by giving them a bleached or ``limed
oak'' look.
 &HT;    How can I do this without completely stripping and refinishing
the cabinets?
 &HT;    A: Start by cleaning off all wax and polish, then sand lightly
and apply a coat of thinned-down white flat paint, brushing it on
directly over the existing finish.
 &HT;    As you finish each section, partially wipe it off with a coarse
rag or wad of cheesecloth so as to leave some of the darker color
still showing through the white coat.
 &HT;    This will create something like a bleached or ``limed oak''
finish, although the final tone will depend on how opaque the white
stain is and on how much of it you wipe off.
 &HT;    Experiment first on the back of a door or the inside of a drawer
until you get the effect you want.
 &HT;    After you are done protect the finish with a coat of clear satin
finish varnish.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The cedar siding on my house has turned dark and is weathered
looking _ in spite of the fact that we applied two coats of wood
preservative.
 &HT;    What can we do to lighten the siding and make it look nice
again?
 &HT;    A: Cedar weathers and changes its color unevenly, sometimes
turning darker and sometimes fading and turning lighter.
 &HT;    A clear sealer doesn't prevent this, but a pigmented shingle
stain would have helped prevent this, especially if you had
initially applied something like one of the ``weathering gray''
stains that are made by Cabot.
 &HT;    Your best bet now is to have the wood professionally cleaned by
power washing, then apply two coats of a light colored,
semitransparent, pigmented shingle stain.

FLORIDA MAN CHARGED IN WEB EXTORTION PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal agents have charged a Florida computer consultant with
trying to extort $1 million from a Massachusetts software company,
after he allegedly threatened to post on the Web a password that
would allow people to use the company's programs for free.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Michael Pitelis, was arrested late Tuesday based
on a series of threatening e-mails he allegedly traded with
executives at Parametric Technology Corp. of Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Pitelis, of Tarpon Springs, Fla., near Tampa, was freed on a
$25,000 bond, prosecutors said. He couldn't be reached for comment
Wednesday. He is expected to enter a plea at a hearing set for the
first week of September.
</P>
<P>
   The case is among an increasing number of actions brought in
response to complaints from software makers who fear blackmail.
Though it is still unclear exactly how Pitelis allegedly obtained
the company's secrets, prosecutors praised Parametric for bringing
the threat to their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has created new opportunities for crimincal acts.
This prosecution is an indication that federal law enforcement
intends to meet the challenge,'' said US Attorney Donald K. Stern.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on a single count of extortion, Pitelis faces a
maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric, also known as PTC, develops and sells
three-dimension mechanical design software. Last year, it reported
net income of $119 million on sales of $1.06 billion, the bulk of
which came from its Pro/Engineer product line priced from $5,000 to
more than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Every customer receives the same CD-ROM, but users who pay more
receive special installation codes that allow them to use
additional software contained on each disk.
</P>
<P>
   According to an FBI agent's affidavit filed in US District Court
in Boston, the matter began on Aug. 3 when Parametric's chief
executive, Richard Harrison, received an unsigned e-mail asking,
``What would be the ramifications to PTC of releasing this software
installation procedure over the Internet through all the
Pro/Engineer user group bulletin/news boards?''
</P>
<P>
   Sent from an account hosted by Yahoo Inc., the message also
contained a password given to Parametric engineers that would yield
access to all the program's functions, the affidavit states.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison passed the email to Parametric's general counsel, David
Friedman, and he traded further messages with the sender who once
signed himself ``mr. Bill Myers.'' On Aug. 11, the sender wrote
that he expected Parametric to pay $400,000, plus $40,000 a month
to keep the information confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The sender later wrote that ``one or more of our associates,
under our payroll, is also under the payroll of PTC.'' On Aug. 21,
the sender wrote that it would cost the company $1 million to learn
this person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, meanwhile, conducted an investigation of his own,
analyzing the header information of each e-mail sent to trace them
back to an Internet service proider, UUNet. He then obtained a
civil subpoena to discover the telephone lines used by computers
that dialed into the network.
</P>
<P>
   The affadavit says one was registered to Pitelis, who also
seemed to maintain a Web site for a company, Pitelis &AMP; Associates,
described as ``Pro/Engineer Consultants/Application Engineers.''
Clients include Colt's Manufacturing Co., and units of Thermo
Electron Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp., according to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Another telephone line was registered to a public library in
Tarpon Springs, near Pitelis' home, according to the affidavit.
Friedman then turned over the information to the FBI, who obtained
a photo of Pitelas from driver's license records and spied on him
using the libary computer to send at least part of the text of an
e-mail received by Parametric.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that evidence, Pitelis was arrested late Tuesday in
Florida and his passport was confiscated. Assistant US Attorney
Stephen Huggard said he doubted the Pitelis' alleged claim he had
an accomplice inside Parametric. Huggard said none of the company's
employees are targets of an ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric spokewoman Roberta Carlton Hefferman said the
incident was the first case like it for the company. Aside from
exposing the threat, she said, ``We never considered having any
dealings with this person.''

OFFICIAL SAYS IRAQ WON'T COOPERATE WITH INSPECTION TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As a two-day meeting of international arms
inspections experts convened on Wednesday to review new monitoring
operations for Iraq, a leading Iraqi official denounced the
inspection commission and vowed again never to cooperate with it.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and the
person considered to be the most authoritative spokesman for
President Saddam Hussein, said in Baghdad that his government would
not allow the new arms inspection team to visit the country, as
called for in a U.N. Security Council resolution last December.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Blix, the executive chairman of the new arms panel, the
U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, said this
week that a team of 44 inspectors from 19 countries have been
trained and are ready to go to Iraq to restart inspections after a
20-month lapse. The last inspectors of an earlier commission were
withdrawn from Iraq in advance of American and British bombing in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said in Baghdad: ``I have said that Iraq will never
cooperate with resolution 1284. This means it will not receive Blix
or any person related to this resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has also refused to allow Yuli Voronstov, a Russian
diplomat charged with studying the cases of 600 Kuwaitis and others
still missing since the 1990 invasion and occupation of Kuwait by
Iraq, to enter. And Peter van Walsum, the Dutch ambassador to the
United Nations and chairman of the Security Council sanctions
committee on Iraq, has also been refused entry. He said he has been
eager to see for himself what effects a decade-long embargo is
having on the people of Iraq. The embargo was imposed by the United
Nations after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Blix, a former Swedish foreign minister and director general of
the International Atomic Energy Agency during the period when it
was discovered that Iraq had been working on a secret nuclear
weapons program, was widely assumed to be more acceptable to Iraq
as a chief inspector than his predecessor, Richard Butler of
Australia, who headed the now-defunct commission known as Unscom.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear inspectors under Blix had concluded several years ago
that Iraq was free of nuclear weapons, but needed long-term
monitoring. Butler's inspectors, who were responsible for
destroying and monitoring biological, chemical and long-range
missile programs, still had a list of questions for the Iraqis
about missing arms components and materials for germ warfare, and
were aggressive in demanding answers. Iraq objected, demanding more
diplomatic treatment, which some U.N. officials also advocated.
Butler now says this undermined his work and gave the Iraqis the
opening to become more defiant of all inspection systems.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq must be declared free of all prohibited weapons of mass
destruction in order to have sanctions lifted, although the new
commission, in a gesture to Iraq, is permitted to recommend a
suspension of the embargo if the Iraqis cooperate on
still-undefined ``key'' disarmament tasks for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Blix was expected to report on Wednesday to his international
advisory board, called a college of commissioners, on his readiness
to return inspectors to Iraq and Iraq's rejection of the new
program.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz's comments underlined the problem the Security Council will
face when it receives a report from Blix on Sept. 1. The report is
being discussed this week by the commissioners in a closed meeting,
with no information was made available.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials were searching for a response to Aziz
short of threatening Iraq. Richard Boucher, the State Department
spokesman, said Iraq's attitude will only mean that it will face
sanctions indefinitely.

SUIT CHALLENGES DEBATE FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Challenging the use of corporate money to fund the
fall's presidential debates, a group of voters led by Ralph Nader
and the Green Party is urging a federal judge to declare the
donations illegal and halt the debates unless the money is
returned.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Patti B. Saris, who said she expects to rule
on the case within a few weeks, voiced concern Wednesday that the
lawsuit filed in June against the Federal Election Commission may
create ``pandemonium'' because the first debate is slated for Oct.
3 at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston Attorney Scott P. Lewis, who represents Nader,
insisted the debates could go forward, even if corporate donations
are banned, with money from government entities, private donors,
candidates, political parties, and media outlets. He said the group
isn't opposed to media outlets contributing to the debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to stop corporate sponsorship of debates,'' said
Lewis, contending that the events amount to corporate-subsidized
advertising for the leading Republican and Democrat to the
exclusion of third-party candidates, like Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debates aren't non-partisan, they are at best
bi-partisan,'' Lewis said. ``The debates have been used to further
the interests of the two leading political parties. They are paid
advertisements subsidized by the supporters of those two
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1907 federal law has prohibited corporations from
contributing to candidates for president and congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis argued that the Federal Election Commission acted
unlawfully when it created an exception to the law by adopting
regulations that allow corporations and labor unions to make
unlimited donations to the Commission on Presidential Debates. The
commission is a nonprofit corporation established in 1987 to
organize debates for presidential and vice-presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington Attorney Stephen E. Hershkowitz, assistant
general counsel for the Election Commission, argued that federal
law allows corporations to spend money to encourage people to vote.
And, he said, the presidential debates are part of a major effort
to interest the public in voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not offer any benefit to either candidate,'' said
Hershkowitz, referring to Vice President Al Gore and Governor
George W. Bush, who are expected to face off during the fall
presidential debates at UMass/Boston, Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Washington University in St.
Louis. ``Both are being offered the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Commission on Presidential Debates said
Nader will be invited to participate in the debates if he scores
over 15 percent in national polls taken after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   National sponsors of the debates include Anheuser-Busch, The
Century Foundation, 3Com and the Marjorie Kovler Fund.
</P>
<P>
   UMass-Boston and the John F. Kennedy Library, are working to
raise $2 million to cover the cost of hosting the Oct. 3 debate at
the university's Clark Athletic Center. While a number of
corporations, including The Boston Globe and The Boston Herald,
have contributed to the event, the largest contributor is the
state, which is authorized by the legislature to pay $900,000 of
the costs, according to Annemarie Lewis-Kerwin, who is coordinating
the debate for the university.
</P>
<P>
   Other contributors include the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, Fidelity
Investments, FleetBoston Financial, the Greater Boston Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau, Liberty Mutual, Boston Capital Partners, the
Carpenters Union, the Boston Red Sox, Arthur D. Little Inc., and
EMC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly could not host this event if we did not get support
from the Legislature and all of the people and organizations that
contributed,'' said Lewis-Kerwin. ``Not only is it benefitting
UMass and helping us put on this historic event, but it's
benefitting the city and the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader and the Green Party aren't alone in their suit against the
Federal Election Commission. Joining them as plaintiffs in the case
are movie actress Susan Sarandon and television personality Phil
Donahue, who co-chair Nader's national steering committee. Heidi
Becker, an independent voter who wants Nader to participate in the
debates, is also named as a plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershkowitz insisted Wednesday that the suit was filed too
late to halt this year's debates because the Federal Election
Commission is entitled to file appeals that likely won't be
exhausted before the voters elect a new President.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry this group waited too late to bring this case in
this forum to stop this debate,'' Hershkowitz told the judge.

IN ADDRESS TO NATION, PUTIN TRIES TO CURB CRITICISM OF KURSK
DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-SUBMARINE-ASSESS) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia grieved for 118 seamen lost in the remains of
the submarine Kursk, President Vladimir Putin moved decisively to
contain the incident's political impact, going on national
television Wednesday night to take responsibility for what some
Russians call a badly botched response.
</P>
<P>
   In an abruptly scheduled half-hour interview on the
state-controlled television network RTR, Putin said a family member
of a submarine crewman had told him that the sinking was his cross
to bear as president, and that ``this person was right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the fact that I have been in office in the Kremlin
a little over 100 days, I feel the full sense of guilt and
responsibility for this crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said that Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and the commander
of the navy's northern fleet had offered their resignations on
Tuesday and that they had been rejected, at least until experts
found out what caused the submarine to explode and plunge to the
Barents Sea floor just before midnight on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get an objective picture of the reasons for this
tragedy,'' Putin said. ``Only after that can we make some
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he broadly suggested that the tortuous
pace of the military's rescue effort, and his own seeming
diffidence at the start of the incident, played no role in the
sailors' deaths because they were doomed from the moment the
submarine went down.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's somber mea culpa and explanation were clearly intended
to quell criticism, which continued Wednesday even after he
returned from a tightly scripted visit to the Arctic town of
Vidyayevo to offer condolences to the families of the perished
sailors.
</P>
<P>
   The military has come under scathing attack for its inability to
pry open the submarine in a week of attempts, especially after a
crew of Norwegian and British deep-sea divers arrived and opened
the submarine's damaged hatch with apparent ease.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Putin has been criticized for staying on vacation
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, once the preserve of senior
Communist Party officials, for days after one of modern Russia's
worst military fiascos began to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   The affair has dented Putin's once-bulletproof reputation for
competence and efficiency, though it is not clear whether the
damage is severe or lasting. A poll of 1,574 people released on
Wednesday by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center concluded that
one in five respondents attribute the incident to the Kremlin's
poor control of the military.
</P>
<P>
   A second poll suggested that Putin's popularity had also
slipped, but that almost two in three Russians still approved of
his performance, a level most politicians would envy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Putin insisted that it was premature to
accuse the military of incompetence, and that a naval rescue effort
began ``the moment contact with the submarine was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, Norway's offer to help in the rescue was
immediately accepted, at least in principle, and that the
much-criticized two-day delay in sending Norwegian divers to the
site was dictated by unnamed ``technical parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   One question that Putin said investigators would explore is why
the Russian navy was unable to mount the type of deep-sea diving
operation that Norway employed to open the hatch. Russia is not
capable of sending divers to the 350-foot depth at which the Kursk
now lies.
</P>
<P>
   While that alone would not have saved any crewmen, he said,
investigators need to study why the Russian navy was not prepared
to rescue sailors trapped in one of its own submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Wednesday that Putin had sent the head of the
Federal Security Service _ the domestic successor to the KGB _ and
the government's general prosecutor to Murmansk, near the Kursk's
home port of Severomorsk, to oversee a preliminary criminal
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Although no evidence of a crime exists, military officials
continued to insist Wednesday that the most likely cause of the
Kursk's sinking was a collision with an unidentified foreign vessel
that they claim to have detected with sonar on the sea floor near
the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   A senior military official, quoted anonymously by the
semiofficial Interfax news service, said Wednesday that the navy
had dispatched three ships to scour the seabed off the Kola
Peninsula for pieces of a second vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Russian sources have variously hinted that a U.S. or British
ship might have been involved in the incident, but both nations
have flatly denied any role.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Putin had set aside for grieving over the naval
disaster, it was apparent Wednesday that the Kursk's sinking has
hit typically stoic Russians with unusual force. The Kursk incident
continues to consume newspapers and television news broadcasts,
which were filled Wednesday with somber music and roll calls of the
dead, and both local governments and individuals were massing
donations for the seamen's survivors. Flags everywhere were strung
at half staff.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin promised the families more than a dozen years of
military pay to compensate for their loss, the total pay will
amount to only about $7,000 per family, and charitable efforts to
increase that figure have sprung up across the country. In
Rostov-on-Don, Russian television reported, the government pledged
30,000 rubles, or about $1,100 per family, to the survivors of two
crewmen who had lived there.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Patriarch Alexei, the leader of the Russian Orthodox
Church, led a service for the crewmen in which he urged the nation
to put aside finger-pointing and unite around the families of the
crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on you today to come together before the face of the
common calamity,'' he said, ``not to split, not to look for the
guilty, not to draw fast conclusions, but to accept what happened
as our common cross. And the cross, no matter what it can be, has
to be carried.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Falcons at ease even though cuts will be made soon
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Michael Booker and Winslow Oliver seemed at
peace Wednesday after the Falcons finished their last preseason
practice even though the ``Grim Reaper'' might visit both this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven players who will dress for tonight's preseason finale
against the Jaguars will be cut in the next few days, and Booker
and Oliver are players ``on the bubble,'' said Oliver, a running
back.
</P>
<P>
   When 12 players were cut last Saturday, word got out. Booker, a
cornerback whose departure has been publicly speculated about for
many months, could smile while telling the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the weight room working out, and all of the sudden
guys were saying they were cutting people,'' he said. ``I went and
took a shower and just waited. You never know when the 'Grim
Reaper' is going to come and tap you on the shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons trim their roster from 64 players to the NFL
regular-season limit of 53, perhaps as early as Friday. Oliver, who
has returned eight punts for a 13.8-yard average in relief of Tim
Dwight, will be waiting and wondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teammates talk about it lot, trying to figure out numbers,''
he said. ``I can't see how it will work out. But I keep my ear to
the ground, and there have been a lot of dropped punt returns
(around the league). I believe I'm a starting punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know, it might be a good thing, because I don't know
if I'd ever start here.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at possible cuts:
</P>
<P>
   Secondary: Five safeties and six cornerbacks are on the roster,
and 10 defensive backs probably will make the team. Most likely,
the last spot is among Booker, rookie cornerback Anthony Midget and
third-year safety Omar Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons drafted Midget and Darrick Vaughn. Booker, the
team's first-round draft choice in 1997, has played well this
summer, but Eli Williams apparently has won the nickel cornerback
job. Then, Booker would be a No. 4 cornerback with a $1.65 million
price tag.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Midget ($231,000 cap charge) and Vaughn
($204,667) are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salary cap makes it difficult sometimes,'' coach Dan
Reeves said. ``The way the league is set up today, you have to
count on younger players quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback: Reeves has said that Danny Kanell ($1.29 million
cap charge), who will play the second half tonight, and fourth-year
pro Tony Graziani ($472,000) are competing for the backup job, with
the implication that the loser will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free-agent Doug Johnson is expected to be kept as a
developmental project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing to keep four quarterbacks,'' Kanell said. ``We'd
like to hang out for another year together, but I also realize this
is a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line: The roster has 11 linemen and the team will keep
nine or 10.
</P>
<P>
   The last slot or two appear to be coming down to guard/center
Evan Pilgrim, rookie free-agent center Matt O'Neal, and
guard/tackle Jose Portilla.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver: The roster has eight, and the team will keep five
or six. Sixth-round draft choice Mareno Philyaw is a longshot
unless he is kept for a few weeks while Jammi German (sprained left
ankle) gets healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Harris, who like German is of value on special teams, and
Eugene Baker, who is perhaps the most pure receiver of the group,
are the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Running back: Oliver and Gary Downs, probably the team's best
all-around special-teams performer, appear to be competing for one
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle: The fourth and final spot will come down to
third-year veteran Shawn Swayda ($358,000), who has seven preseason
tackles, and rookie free-agent Adriano Belli ($194,500), who has
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird last week, seeing guys you've gotten to know not
around any more,'' Belli said. ``I'd be happy even if I was on the
practice squad because I'm the type of player who gets better each
week, each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker: Seven are on the squad, and all of them might make
the team. If anybody goes, free-agent acquisition Marcus Buckley,
working behind weakside linebacker Keith Brooking and reserve Chris
Draft, is the leading candidate. Buckley,6-3, 240 pounds, also can
play the strong side and in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams: It is not likely, but Reeves has kept two kickers
before, both in Denver and with the Giants, where Brad Daluiso and
David Treadwell shared the job for the better part of two years.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-year-old kicker Morten Andersen ($1.045 million)has been
impressive. He is in the final year of his contract, though, and
rookie free-agent Jake Arians ($195,000) looks as if he might have
a future in this league.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, players are trying to keep from letting it
worry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit around and think,'' Booker said. ``I know something's
got to happen. I know they like to keep the rookies they draft, and
I've been here a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm saying is, if I'm going to get cut, just be, you know,
cool about it. Don't say, `Mike, this and that.' I know I've played
well. If I don't make it here, I'll be on the market and will get
picked up by somebody else. Atlanta will still be my home.''

ADVERTISING: LEVI STRAUSS LAUNCHES MULTIMEDIA CAMPAIGN FOR
SILVERTAB LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is introducing a multimedia campaign to
promote its Silvertab line of clothing, part of a continuing effort
to stimulate steeply declining sales.
</P>
<P>
   Directed at young adults 18 to 22, the new campaign, which has
been dubbed ``Lost but not lost,'' follows the adventures of three
young Americans traveling through Morocco. Eye-catching and exotic,
the ads show the travelers on camels, in a beaten-up bus and on the
beach wearing the new Silvertab line, which is made of the latest
high-technology materials, and using Sony electronic equipment like
a portable CD player and digital video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Photographed by Albert Watson, who has collaborated with Levi
Strauss since 1990, the new Silvertab advertising replaces a
two-year-old campaign, focused on teen-agers 15 to 19, that used
illustrations to depict what the company called ``youth tribes''
with a ``blending of ethnicities.''
</P>
<P>
   Morocco was chosen as the setting for the campaign ``because
it's a place where there's little technology,'' said Sean Dee,
director of marketing for the Levi's brand. ``It was a great way to
showcase our product and introduce our positioning, which is that
Silvertab is equipment for modern living.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony equipment is also featured because it ``helps us deliver on
that premise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key things that differentiates Silvertab from the
Levi's brand is its positioning,'' Dee added. ``Silvertab is not
what you expect from an old, reliable pair of Levi's. It allows us
to expand what we offer the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss is employing both traditional and new media to
promote the new line. Magazine advertising, which will run through
December, is appearing in magazines like Rolling Stone, Source,
Spin, Vibe, GQ, Maxim and Jane. Postcards that reproduce images
from the print advertising will be distributed through the fall and
early winter in restaurants in 15 cities nationwide, as well as in
stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Dillard's and J.C. Penney. Outdoor
ads will also appear in Manhattan through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Levi Strauss will introduce the Internet component
of the campaign next month. It will tell the ``Lost but not lost''
story through various Web sites, including www.lostbutnotlost.com
and www.sony.com, and has created 15-second commercials for movie
theaters to promote the Web campaign. Levi Strauss also has joined
forces with Imoviestudio.com, a site that brings visitors behind
the scenes when films are made; Shockwave.com, a game and
entertainment site; and Omnipod.com, a new company that makes
multifunctional desktop software.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss executives would not disclose the budget for the
new campaign but said it would exceed previous spending. According
to Competitive Media Reporting, Levi Strauss spent $5 million to
promote Silvertab last year, $2 million in 1998 and $1 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Levis Strauss is counting on advertising to help reverse a
decline in sales. Overall sales for the company, which is privately
held, dropped to $5.1 billion last year, down 28.2 percent from a
peak of $7.1 billion in 1996. Sales also declined 6.4 percent in
the second quarter of this year, compared with results in the
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The new Silvertab campaign is being conducted by the San
Francisco office of TWBA/Chiat/Day, whose new campaign for Levi's
Red Tab jeans was introduced late last month. The agency is part of
the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts of the apparel industry and youth market gave the new
campaign mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, called
the campaign part of a ``near-desperate attempt by Levi's to change
its image from dowdy to with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional Levi's product has come on hard times, and
they're now beginning to realize that their salvation lies in
addressing a completely new audience, college students and
younger,'' he added. ``That's who they're apparently addressing
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Bernard, a partner in Colton Bernard Inc., a fashion
consulting firm based in San Francisco, said that if Levi Strauss
could make Silvertab work, ``the line will become more important
than ever. It will be the fulcrum that brings them up over the top,
if it becomes a desirable brand for the younger individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising ``does the right thing, in terms of getting the
target audience's attention, but it doesn't tell me that this is
something I have to have,'' he noted. ``They've got to take it
another step beyond sheer imagery, focus on the product itself. If
a line doesn't have its own raison d'etre and identifiable
signature, it isn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just beginning that process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Zandl, who runs a research firm in New York that tracks
spending by consumers younger than 30, said the advertising had ``a
very European sensibility; it looks very sophisticated, arty,
aloof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so aloof and unengaging, I doubt it will really connect
with American teens and young adults,'' she said.

RENO WILL NOT NAME PROSECUTOR TO INVESTIGATE GORE'S '96 FUND
RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The decision by Attorney General Janet Reno not to
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Vice President Al
Gore's statements about his role in 1996 fund-raising activities
means Gore is essentially free and clear from any criminal
jeopardy, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because further investigation is not likely to result in a
prosecutable case under applicable criminal law and principles of
federal prosecution, I have concluded that a special counsel is not
warranted,'' Reno told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging that she had rejected the advice of a top
Justice Department investigator to name a special prosecutor, Reno
sought to portray her decision as a narrow one that cleared Gore
only of making false statements in an April 18 interview with
law-enforcement officials. She said the four-year inquiry into
fund-raising would continue.
</P>
<P>
   But some law-enforcement officials said Wednesday that the
reasoning Reno used in declining to seek a special prosecutor for
Gore meant that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
investigate the vice president for any issue related to his role in
raising campaign donations during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she had concluded that the transcript of the April 18
interview did not show that Gore was lying when he insisted that
White House coffees and his 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple were
not fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transcript reflects neither false statements nor perjury,
each of which requires proof of a willfully false statement about a
material matter,'' Reno said. ``Rather, the transcript reflects
disagreements about labels.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Robert J. Conrad Jr., the head of the department's
campaign finance unit, recommended that a special counsel be named
to investigate whether Gore had made false statements in describing
his role in the April 1996 visit to a Buddhist temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif., and numerous coffee sessions at the White House
with potential donors. Both the appearance at the Hsi Lai Temple
and the coffees resulted in campaign donations to the Democratic
Party or the national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told Conrad in the April interview that he did not regard
any of those events as fund-raising events. Gore initially said
that he was at only one such coffee. Conrad then told him that the
record showed that he had, in fact, been the host at 23 of them and
had attended an additional eight with President Clinton as the
host.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Conrad's advice, Reno said, ``Mr. Conrad's
recommendation did not go to the underlying events, it went just to
the statements.'' She said the campaign task force headed by Conrad
was free to pursue any violations that might have been committed
during the coffees or the temple visit.
</P>
<P>
   But the law enforcement officials said Gore's only potential
legal liability was whether he had misrepresented the events, not
his participation in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has now cleared him of that,'' said one official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. That means that Gore is inoculated
from new efforts to prosecute him as he heads into the final months
of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans reacted angrily to Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the decision ``follows a pattern
of the attorney general protecting the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who headed a committee which
investigated allegations of fund-raising improprieties in 1996,
said, ``Janet Reno has steadfastly refused to follow the
recommendations of her career law enforcement officers and allow an
independent investigation of high-ranking administration officials.
There was never any reason to believe that she would do any
differently in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential
nominee, said in a statement, ``While it's clear that Al Gore
engaged in a number of questionable fund-raising activities and the
gave the FBI statements that continue to raise all the issues of
his credibility, the American people are sick and tired of all
these scandals and investigations. The best way to put all these
scandals and investigations behind us is to elect someone new.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On two previous occasions, Reno rejected advice to seek an
outside criminal inquiry of Gore. She did so on those occasions
over the objections of Louis J. Freeh, the director of the FBI, and
several senior Justice Department officials, including Charles G.
LaBella, who was a predecessors of Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Conrad was ``an excellent prosecutor'' with whom she
had an honest disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Reno's opening statement was devoted to complimenting
Conrad, a longtime federal prosecutor from North Carolina. ``I am
impressed with his judgment, his management of the task force and
his knowledge of the law,'' she said. She said her ``regard for Bob
Conrad has only increased as I have dealt with him on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno acknowledged that Conrad was supported in his
recommendation by others in the Justice Department, disputing news
accounts today that quoted a senior department official as saying
Conrad was alone in his view that a special counsel was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Conrad said he was deeply troubled by Reno's
decision and concerned by what one said were ``attempts to
marginalize'' his role. Another associate said Conrad was ``angry
and disappointed'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said, ``We are pleased with
today's Justice Department announcement. However, Al Gore is going
to continue to do what he has been doing all along _ focus on
America's families.''

COMMENTARY: STANDING IN THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We think there is a parallel between federal involvement in
education and the decline in profit over recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   -Ronald Reagan in 1983
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't noticed, American schools are becoming
more and more crowded. The Department of Education reported this
week that the nation's elementary and secondary schools would
enroll a record 53 million students this fall. By the end of the
century, student enrollment in the United States is expected to
soar past 90 million, and could reach a phenomenal 100 million
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a century of growth ahead of us, a crescendo of
children,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley. Americans would
be wise, he said, ``to figure out where we will put these children
and who will teach them.''
</P>
<P>
   Education is one of the hot issues in the presidential campaign.
All the candidates are in favor of enhanced student achievement,
tough standards, rigorous testing. And all agree that steps have to
be taken to improve the performance of black and Latino students.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants school kids to grow up spelling like Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, the report this week from Riley's office is
ominous. Overcrowded schools undermine two critical components to
improving student performance _ smaller classes, especially in the
early grades, and widespread access to pre-kindergarten programs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made a stop in South Brunswick, N.J.,
Wednesday to visit a school that will be holding some classes in
portable trailers this fall. He was pushing his school construction
initiative. If you want kids to do better, the president said,
squeezing them into overcrowded classrooms is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has traditionally been absent on the issue
of federal education assistance. Ronald Reagan wanted to abolish
the Department of Education, and GOP hostility to a federal role in
education remained ferocious right through the Gingrich era. School
lunch programs, Head Start _ you name it, top Republican
politicians were against it.
</P>
<P>
   This year is supposed to be different. The ebullient George W.
Bush wraps his arms around the education issue at every
opportunity. Dick Cheney, who voted against funding for Head Start
when he was in Congress, said this week that education was probably
``the single most important issue'' in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But when you look closely at the proposals that would help
students most _ federal assistance in building and modernizing
schools and putting more teachers into classrooms _ the enthusiasm
for education aid among top Republicans evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership in Congress is standing in the way of
the initiative touted by Clinton Wednesday _ a $25 billion tax
proposal to help states finance the building of new schools and the
renovation of old ones in need of repair. Such federal help is
crucial if smaller classes are to become a widespread reality.
</P>
<P>
   There are 226 co-sponsors of the legislation, which means more
than half the members of the House support it. But the Republican
leadership is blocking a vote on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore strongly supports the legislation, but
Bush does not. He has derided it as a ``bricks and mortar''
approach to education reform.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leadership in Congress is also blocking Clinton
administration efforts to provide federal funding for the hiring of
100,000 teachers. This is part of an effort by the administration
to help reduce the average class size in grades one through three
all across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans do not have a lot of credibility on the
education issue. That will hardly improve if Bush and Cheney travel
the country claiming to be education champions while at the same
time standing in the way of those programs that would help children
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overcrowding is not simply an issue of inconvenience,'' said
Leonie Haimson, an education consultant and author of a recent
report on class size reduction in New York City. ``We now know for
certain how critical smaller classes are for improving achievement
levels among kids, and specifically for reducing the achievement
gap. We are just not giving a fair shake to the kids in these
overcrowded and falling-apart schools.''

(See also RUSSIA-SUBMARINE) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a public confession Wednesday night by President
Vladimir Putin, who said he feels ``responsibility and guilt'' for
the loss of the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk, Russia's political
evolution seems to be taking a new kind of post-Soviet turn.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders are offering to resign. The government and
the private sector are competing to raise millions of dollars to
comfort the families of the Kursk's crew. The airwaves are ringing
with mea culpas from the haughty admirals of the once mighty Red
Banner Fleet of the north.
</P>
<P>
   And on the surface of the Barents Sea, Russia for the first time
cracked open the door to Norwegian and British seamen and asked
them to enter the inner sanctum of a powerful Cold War leviathan
named Kursk and to help retrieve the 118 crewmen _ sons of Russia,
Ukraine and other lost fragments of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   It did not start out that way.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kursk exploded and crashed to the bottom of the Barents
Sea on Aug. 12, Russians spontaneously reacted with indignation
when military leaders dropped into a familiar defensive crouch,
distorting and withholding information and paying little heed to
the human dimension of the tragedy for the crew members and their
families, many of whom live in rank poverty in Russia's far north.
</P>
<P>
   And they were even more appalled when Putin, instead of rushing
home like the disciplined and pragmatic public servant they voted
for in March, tarried at his favorite resort on the Black Sea. Day
after day he remained there, as one of the most extraordinary
rescue dramas at sea unfolded. Lives were at risk. Last breaths
were being drawn, but still Putin vacationed.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels to the Soviet era raged from the front pages of the
Russian press, and many Russians harked back to Chernobyl, where
the worst nuclear accident in history spewed radiation into the
heavens for days in late April and early May 1986 before Soviet
leaders begrudgingly admitted that something had gone terribly
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But in the din of recriminations of the loss of the Kursk and
with the sudden awakening of Putin, what many have missed is the
repudiation of the Soviet era that is also present in this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk families have expressed their outrage and pain, and
Putin elevated their plight this week to a national priority.
Politicians have said that officials must be held accountable, but
Putin said Wednesday night that the old Soviet game of laying blame
gratuitously would be set aside. ``It has been like that before,''
he said Wednesday on national television, adding that ``nothing
will be done'' until ``a full understanding has been gained about
what happened and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Russia's military made mistakes and was too slow to ask
for Western help, its officials also became surprisingly accessible
and accountable. One admiral admitted that rescue gear was not
available because it has been rented to oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   And a veteran Russian television reporter, Arkady Momontov,
known for his professional news delivery from the front lines in
Chechnya, was given exclusive access to the deck of the cruiser
Peter the Great. Far from being a mouthpiece for the navy, he
delivered a stream of video and reporting to an international
audience that showed Russian journalists' determination to reach
the same professional standards as their colleagues in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It was also impossible to ignore the moment when former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev joined the ranks of critics chiding
Putin for delaying Russia's request for Western assistance too
long. For it was Gorbachev who in 1986 let the flames of Chernobyl
burn without warning his countrymen _ not to mention Europe _ that
a radioactive cloud was headed their way. And, of course, Gorbachev
refused all Western assistance to contain the worst nuclear
disaster ever.
</P>
<P>
   But with his criticism, Gorbachev showed that he, too, is well
beyond the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the sinking of the Kursk foreshadows that some
reckoning is ahead for the pared-down remains of the armed forces
of the former Soviet empire, whose once vaunted technological
prowess was already looking battered and bloodied by rebels in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an investigation proves that Russia's nuclear-powered
leviathan Kursk was sunk by a collision with an elusive foreign
submarine, or by a misfired torpedo or a World War II mine, the
lasting image from the surface of the Barents Sea will be the
hapless attempts by otherwise heroic Russian rescuers to reach the
Kursk's escape hatch in outdated mini-subs powered by batteries too
old to hold a charge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Norwegians and the British arrived with their shining
technology _ underwater cameras and command centers that looked
like an electronics store showroom _ these ``foreigners'' went to
work in the deep-diving suits and cracked the stubborn hatch in 36
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The wrenching drama of the Kursk has been another painful step
in the education of Putin, the youthful president and longtime KGB
officer who had vowed to strengthen the Russian state and rebuild
its military forces to defend Russia's interests, whatever those
turn out to be in the transition that still is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is discovering in the most poignant way that invoking the
imagery of Russia's military tradition is not the same as
exercising it effectively _ and safely _ every day. In his visit to
Severomorsk on Monday, Putin was reminded again that although
Russia possesses the nuclear arsenal of a global power, the
infrastructure of the Russian military has gone to rust and that
most of its personnel live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions in which our nuclear submarines are maintained
do not meet any standards, and we could witness another serious
accident at any moment,'' Alexsander Rutskoi, the former vice
president and a war hero who led a political rebellion against
Boris Yeltsin in 1993, said on Monday. In a fiery denunciation of
the navy, Rutskoi, now the governor of the Kursk region for which
the submarine was named, added, ``When the Russian fleet does not
have the necessary means to conduct rescues, the very fact that
submarines go to sea is already a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   After the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. commanders complained
that a ``hollow'' military was the cause of a significant decline
of U.S. prestige in the world, one that would invite challenge from
any adversary. And what ``hollow'' came to mean was the loss of
synergy between recruiting and training professional cadres of
soldiers and a high level of spending on maintenance, spare parts
and ever-improving technologies for weaponry and on safety for the
most important weapon in any arsenal _ the soldier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia now faces a much broader hollowing of its military
forces. Putin speaks as if he is determined to come to terms with
this reality, but without acknowledging that rebuilding the Russian
armed forces can only be accomplished through an inevitable
contraction of Russian power and global pretension. Overreaching
for the glory days of the Soviet past, when Moscow supported a blue
water navy that could compete for power and influence in the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, could easily lead to the disasters
that Rutskoi predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, venting his
frustration on national television on Monday night, said the
``whole reason'' why there were no Russian deep sea divers to race
down to save the Kursk's crew was that the military ``over the
course of the past several years'' has been ``robbed and stripped''
and the armed forces are being funded at ``less than 50 percent''
of their requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But requirements for what?
</P>
<P>
   Putin must now answer that question for the Russians and for his
neighbors in Europe, whom he has alarmed with his ``strong state''
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, flags over the Kremlin flew at half staff Wednesday,
a sign of mourning not only for the lost sailors but for the lost
pride that so many Russians feel.

CREEPY VIRTUAL BEINGS, ATTITUDE INCLUDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER OLAFSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gillmen in the Sega Dreamcast simulation Seaman do not seem
to like me.
</P>
<P>
   I know that because they have told me so. ``You make me mad,''
said one that looked like Queen Victoria. Then it gave me a
sidelong glance that could freeze lava as it swam languorously
through the upper reaches of the three-dimensional virtual aquarium
the Gillmen call home.
</P>
<P>
   Another, which looked like a soccer hooligan, was so incensed
that it was beyond words. It could only growl at me as it passed. I
felt properly chastised.
</P>
<P>
   The Gillmen _ fish with the gift of human speech, a biting sense
of humor and disturbingly human faces _ are the stars of Seaman.
This occasionally dark but wonderfully original simulation
occasionally suggests a sophisticated turn on Eliza, a text-based
exercise in artificial intelligence that began in the mid-1980s,
but Seaman is also an exercise in sustained maintenance. The player
becomes the Gillmen's custodian, their governess and their
father-confessor as they evolve into an air-breathing, land-based
life form.
</P>
<P>
   I have to feed the Gillmen regularly, but not too regularly,
from a finite supply of food pellets. (A Gillman itself will
eventually point the player to an additional food source.) I have
to keep the tank clean by keeping up the flow of air. I must keep
it warm (but not too warm) by periodically running the heater.
</P>
<P>
   And I must encourage the Gillmen's intellectual growth by
speaking to them in simple phrases that the program can recognize.
Symbols that appear on the screen of the Dreamcast's Visual Memory
Unit, a piece of hardware required to play the game, indicate
whether the Gillmen understand what I am saying. When they do
understand, they often respond sensibly. The adults use a rather
mannered male voice that suggests a cranky Dr. Frasier Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson from Seaman: nothing tears at the heart like a
thankless child. The feedings, the belly tickles, the meticulous
adjustments of their environment appear to have been for naught.
The baby fish that once smiled at me guilelessly and chimed,
``Play, play, play,'' have become cynical adults that appear to
regard me as a necessary evil. Somehow, I have earned their
contempt, and somehow, that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Their metamorphosis has been swift. By the second day, the
infant Gillmen were responding (albeit in indecipherable baby
burbles) to queries I had spoken into the microphone included with
the program. By the third day, they had matured sufficiently to
complain in plain English about the lack of heat and their fear of
the dark. On the fourth and fifth days, they were full-size adults
and had started to ask me questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're 44?'' the fish asked. ``You're not going to go and have
a midlife crisis on me, are you? I mean, I care, but I do have
problems of my own.''
</P>
<P>
   In a real-world household like mine, with three dogs, two cats
and three birds, five helpless Gillmen might seem like candidates
ripe for neglect. But they have fit in to the morning routine.
Right after the dogs bicker over which one is going to carry in the
newspaper and before I feed the pigeons out front, I talk to the
Gillmen. I ask if they want food. I ask if they are happy. I make
the same kissing sounds to them that I make when I kiss the dogs on
the ears. I figure that affection is a universal language and can't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   One morning a Gillman responded coldly: ``I'm not your dog.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it know about the dogs?
</P>
<P>
   Seaman is not simply a Sega spin on the ubiquitous Pokemon. In
fact, this could be the anti-Pokemon. This odd creature sometimes
seems to have been assembled with an eye to horror movies. The
hatchlings that spring from the egg you deposit in the tank at the
outset look like nothing so much as floating eyeballs. Watching the
octopuslike creature that ingests the eyeballs, then dies
convulsively as they mature into tiny Gillmen, it is hard not to
think of the movie ``Alien.''
</P>
<P>
   And the stalk that erupts from the peak of a Gillman's forehead
recalls the extended pineal gland of the protagonist in the 1986
movie ``From Beyond.'' (The Gillmen also use this tube to rub their
noses and, if upset, to squirt a brown substance at you.) The very
placement of a human face on the front end of a fish suggests the
conflation of a man and his dog in the 1978 remake of ``Invasion of
the Body Snatchers.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's to say nothing of a penchant exhibited early in the
Gillmen's career. As I chatted with one of the Gillmen, another
swam up from behind and below and connected its forehead tentacle
to the underside of the Gillman I was addressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get off,'' the first Gillman protested. The aggressor would
have none of it. The tentacle remained in place, the victim's mouth
opened helplessly and the light went out of its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   My babies are cannibals.
</P>
<P>
   I learned from the narrator, the actor Leonard Nimoy, at the
start of the next session that this was simply survival of fittest.
At the outset of each Seaman session, Nimoy brings the player up to
date on events within the habitat (events that occur even without
your participation), offers suggestions and notes the frequency of
your visits. (``You visit often,'' Nimoy intoned on a day I had
looked in on the Gillmen four times. ``If one didn't know better,
one might assume you're quite obsessed _ or have nothing better to
do.'')
</P>
<P>
   If you cut him off by hitting the start button too
precipitously, Nimoy will respond with a cough or a side comment.
The message is clear: even small actions carry consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The game bears that out. The Gillmen are children, and you must
be careful what you say and do around children. After turning my
initial brood of Gillmen into non-breathing, tank-bottom-based,
former life forms, I am being a cautious surrogate parent. So far,
I have been rewarded with a more elaborate, balanced dialogue with
my two surviving adults.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there are no bad dogs, there are no intrinsically bad
Seamen _ just inattentive owners. The Gillman is largely a
reflection of its environment and the level of care it receives. It
gives as it gets, and hence is particularly bad-tempered when it
hasn't been fed. (``Hey,'' the soccer hooligan said. ``Food. Here.
Now.'')
</P>
<P>
   That Gillman's current topic of inquiry is my wife (whom it
sarcastically calls ``your sweetie''). It noted that my wife's
birthday and mine were in the same month and observed laconically
that we should just have ``one big party.'' It has read our
horoscopes and asked if we planned to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children can bring great joy,'' the soccer hooligan said, ``if
you don't wring their necks first.''
</P>
<P>
   That finally got to me. I really wanted to put the Gillman in
its place _ not for the first time _ and started to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But I cut myself off. Seaman's central mystery for me has become
engaging the Gillmen's affections, and I didn't want to jeopardize
our fragile bond.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer hooligan acted as though it had not heard me. But the
look of mingled mirth and impudence on its face spoke volumes.

BUSH CAMP SEEKS ROUNDTABLE FORMAT FOR DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While George W. Bush is chuckling over the
debate about presidential debates, his staff is serious about
shaping this year's encounters to be favorable for their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Bush adviser, the GOP presidential candidate
opposes the podium-and-panelist method that has dominated recent
presidential debates. Instead, Bush wants a more intimate
roundtable discussion like the primary debate in February where he,
Senator John S. McCain of Arizona, and former ambassador Alan Keyes
sat face-to-face with CNN's Larry King before a live audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can stand and deliver, but those are stupid formats,'' said
the adviser, speaking Wednesday about recent presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers think the traditional debate format features
``gotcha'' questions from reporters who serve as panelists.
Roundtables are also preferable to town-hall style debates, which
were favorable to President Clinton in 1992 and 1996, according to
the adviser. During the CNN debate, Bush, McCain, and Keyes were
able to respond immediately and at length to criticisms, rather
than waiting to be called upon or speak within a prescribed time
limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates has proposed three
encounters this fall between Bush and his Democratic opponent, Vice
President Al Gore, all in October. The first is scheduled for Oct.
3 in Boston. While the Bush campaign has committed to three debates
with Gore, it has said he may participate in only two commission
events, noting that it has received some 40 other offers for
debates. The commission has yet to set a format for its debates and
has sought input from the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed debate at the University of Massachusetts-Boston,
which would take place a traditionally Democratic state, could be
at risk because it would be in unfriendly territory for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that show of your leadership skills to be in those
eighth-grade style debates?'' said the adviser. ``You're never
going to be in a situation like that in real life....What they want
is a forum that provides more give and take, is more integrated
than those formats are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called on Bush to drop all TV advertising in favor of
twice-weekly debates. The vice president has accepted all offers
tendered to him and Bush, but Gore's campaign is not yet wedded to
a particular format. The pair has received offers from such
wide-ranging sources as Voter.com, which wants a debate broadcast
over the Internet, to David Letterman, who has offered to moderate
a face-off on his late-night talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general parameters we have are to take issues to the
greatest number of people we can, have as many as possible, and get
this going as quickly as possible,'' said Gore spokesman Douglas
Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Tuesday with reporters aboard his campaign plane, Bush
chuckled about ``the debate about debates'' but declared, ``I think
three is plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are some wonderful people that have asked to
be moderators, really great news networks that are interested in
participating. We're going to look at them all in equal light, give
everybody a fair chance.''
</P>
<P>
   During another session with reporters Monday, he appeared to
indicate support for a nontraditional format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I'd like to do is have debates where people get a
sense of what we both believe and that it's structured so that both
of us are able to share our ideas in a way that people will listen
to,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In withholding its immediate acceptance of any debate offers,
the Bush campaign has gained leverage in determining how and when
their candidate will be featured in what are traditionally viewed
as high-stakes affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent in the memory of the Bush campaign is a 1992 town-hall
debate between then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Texas
billionaire H. Ross Perot, and Bush's father, former President
Bush, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   In that Richmond, Va., session, moderator Carole Simpson of ABC
News encouraged questioners from the audience to prevent Bush from
focusing on trust and judgment issues as they related to Clinton's
antiwar efforts. Later, Simpson was accused of partisanship, a
charge the journalist denied.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are being handled by Bush campaign manager Joe
Allbaugh and Andrew Card, who managed the recent Republican
National Convention. On the Democratic side, the negotiators are
Jim Johnson, former Fannie Mae chairman, and Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman.

 &HT;    McDonald's egg suppliers must give hens more space
 &HT;    By Scott Leith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not often that a single customer changes an
entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, not every customer is a behemoth like McDonald's
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning soon, the fast-food giant will only buy eggs from
suppliers that provide more space for hens. McDonald's also wants
egg suppliers to put an end to ``forced molting,'' in which hens
aren't fed as a way to spur production.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Riker, a spokesman for McDonald's, said the change has been
in the works for several years. ``Animal welfare comes first,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Gregory, senior vice president of United Egg Producers, an
Atlanta-based trade group, said the entire industry will likely
move toward larger cages. UEP worked with McDonald's to develop the
new guidelines and wasn't surprised by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to make these changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced to suppliers Tuesday, comes after lobbying
from groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or
PETA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that pressure, McDonald's would be satisfied,''
Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   PETA has long pushed for animal rights and maintains a Web site,
www.mccruelty.com, that focuses on McDonald's. A PETA spokesman
said the group welcomes the move by McDonald's but would prefer
that hens roam free rather than live in cages at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new guidelines, McDonald's suppliers must provide 72
square inches of space for each hen, up from 50 now.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory said it will take a decade or so for the entire industry
to adapt. ``These things can't happen immediately'' or egg prices
would skyrocket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory doesn't expect the criticism to ebb. ``The pressure is
coming from groups that are vegetarian,'' he said. ``They are
groups that don't even eat eggs.''

`STAND BY ME' COMES TO DVD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Short fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King's reputation as a frightmeister overshadows what
sets him apart from others who mine the horror field: his ability
to bring the real and familiar of our everyday lives and
experiences into his stories.
</P>
<P>
   His semi-autobiographic novella ``The Body'' shows how well he
can do this even without the supernatural shocks. Turned into the
1986 film ``Stand by Me,'' which comes out for the first time on
DVD on Tuesday, the book tells the story of four 12-year-old boys
in Oregon in 1959, who set out to find a dead body that they heard
was in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told as a remembrance by one of the grown boys,
Gordie (played by Wil Wheaton, voiced by Richard Dreyfuss). Gordie,
now a writer, reflects on their trip together after hearing that
one of the other boys, Chris (River Phoenix), has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   In a story about youths at a crossroads in their lives, it is
difficult to not be somewhat nostalgic (particularly considering
the framing of the story). But the portrait of the four boys is as
dark as it is light, and under the direction of Rob Reiner, the
film avoids falling into a sentimental trap.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the summer before junior high, the boys sense that they
will be going separate ways once school starts and their worlds
expand. Until then, the four had been inseparable, secure in their
insular world, but differences between them _ class and personality
_ would inevitably pull them apart. The journey then becomes one
from the end of childhood to the beginning of adulthood, and along
the way we catch a glimpse of their hopes, childishness, fears and
dreams in a way most of us can understand.
</P>
<P>
   What helps this coming-of-age tale, though, is the honesty in
the performances of the boys. Phoenix, as the tough but vulnerable
Chris, is the most memorable. But there is an added poignancy now
to his performance. Like Gordie thinking about Chris, while
watching Phoenix with all his youthful potential, you can't help
thinking about his loss to drugs in 1993. The other two _ the
psychologically battered Teddy (Corey Feldman) and the pudgy
scaredy-cat Vern (Jerry O'Connell) _ are quite good, too.
Ironically, O'Connell has grown up to look like quite a stud _
playing the romantic interest in a number of films, including
``Scream 2,'' which only goes to prove that things do change when
you grow up.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Movie with heart: Mel Gibson's 1995 Oscar-winning film
``Braveheart'' probably got too many accolades in a weak year, but
there's no question that the superstar approached the project with
a surplus of elan. The gory battle scenes alone are worth the film,
which is at heart an old-fashioned epic. (A special DVD edition
arrives on Tuesday with commentary from Mel.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on the story of Scottish hero William Wallace, the story
does take some liberties with history. Princess Isabel (Sophie
Marceau) was a child at the time and Marceau _ needless to say _ is
more developed than that. Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks (King
Edward I of England) is properly vile (Longshanks was a
particularly despicable monarch), and Angus McFadyen as the
waffling Robert the Bruce proves that he's an underappreciated
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it's Gibson's charm that either wins you over or
not. The added features on the DVD (Mel enjoyed the battle scenes)
are fun, though. &QL; 
---- &QL; 
``Stand By Me'' (Columbia) is $29.99 for the DVD, and includes
commentary by Reiner, a featurette with interviews with King and
Reiner, a Ben E. King music video and a making-of documentary. The
special edition DVD of ``Braveheart'' (Paramount) is $29.99. It
includes commentary by Gibson and a behind-the-scenes documentary. &QL;

uncomfortable. The sign disappeared and employees were ordered to
speak only English. Several hairstylists allege that they lost

   COXNET FOCUS 0826: MADAM PRESIDENT -- What's next, ``Vice
President Ken''? The joking perhaps was inevitable when the
nonprofit group the White House Project teamed up recently with
Mattel and Girls' Inc. to launch a President Barbie doll. With a
politically correct helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand
nuclear war and an unintentionally funny advisory on the back of
her box _ ``Podium not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this
Leader of the Free (Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous
light. But many people aren't laughing these days when the subject
turns to a woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican and
Democratic conventions, and both George W. Bush and Al Gore
reportedly included a woman on their ``short list'' of potential
running mates (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes

   MEXICO-CENTAM _ TAPACHULA, MEXICO _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene
Lopez, 15, said she was willing to do anything if she could just
get to the United States. ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take
care of babies,'' the Salvadoran teenager said earnestly, her eyes
as wide as saucers. But Lopez never made to Houston or El Paso, her
dream cities. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all teen-age
girls _ ended up in a jail cell here for undocumented migrants
crossing into Mexico's southernmost Chiapas state. While U.S.
officials conduct their own battle to stem illegal crossings,
Mexican officials here say they've seen a 30 percent increase over
last year in the number of undocumented immigrants they're

   catching along the southern border with Guatemala. Although
they've taken South Americans into custody, too, the vast majority
detained are Central Americans bound for the United States. An
increasing number appear to be willing to take perilous journeys to
avoid capture, suffocating in cargo trailers or drowning at sea.
Those captured often say they're looking for a way out of poverty
that hasn't abated after years of civil war and 1998's Hurricane
Mitch. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

ABORTION OPPONENTS REACT TO NEW CLINTON STEM CELL RULES 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angry abortion opponents took aim at new federal
guidelines on stem-cell research, accusing the Clinton
administration Wednesday of playing presidential politics with a
science they call unethical and unlawful and vowing to overturn the
action in the courts or Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma over research that has life-saving potential but
destroys human embryos divides the major presidential candidates _
Governor George W. Bush of Texas opposes the use of federal funds
for it, while Vice President Al Gore supports it. And it could
emerge in the upcoming campaign because it touches the hot-button
issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be easy for this to become a political football,''
said Ronald Green, who directs the Ethics Institute at Dartmouth
College. ``And because there is not a large constituency for
patient-care groups, it is prone to get more emotional criticism
than emotional support.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health Wednesday won praise from many
scientists for riding out a heavy storm of criticism and publishing
ethical and clinical guidelines that will allow medical reseachers
to obtain federal funds to study the fast-developing biology of
embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The cells, which are culled from week-old human embryos and grow
and differentiate into organs and tissue, show breakthrough promise
in treating many serious conditions, including diabetes,
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if the public will look at, first of all, the
potentially staggering benefits of this research _ everything from
birth defects to Parkinson's, certain kinds of cancer, diabetes,
spinal-cord injuries _ it's a potential change for the future,''
President Clinton said. ``I think we cannot walk away from the
potential to save lives and improve lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policy was put in place despite a 1996 federal law,
championed by abortion opponents in Congress, the National Right to
Life Committee, and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
that prohibits public funding of research in which human embryos
are destroyed or discarded.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NIH guidelines, the source of research stem
cells must be frozen embryos left over from fertility treatments,
and with the patient's consent, are to be discarded. The policy
prohibits federal money from being spent on the process that
separates the stem cells from the embryo, which results in the
embryo's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the guidelines were a transparent and politically
motivated end-run around the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embryonic stem-cell research is illegal, immoral, and
unnecessary,'' Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said in
a statement. He argues that researchers should concentrate on
regenerating adult stem cells because it would moot the abortion
issue. ``It is never acceptable to deliberately kill one innocent
human being in order to help another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jay Dickey, an Arkansas Republican who sponsored
the 1996 funding ban, called the NIH rules a ``boldfaced violation
of the law.'' He said in an interview that he will seek either a
court-ordered injunction or attempt to withhold funds appropriated
for the NIH if the agency makes a grant for stem-cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey also charged the Clinton administration with manipulating
a federal agency to help Gore. ``The administration didn't have to
bring this up right in the middle of the election,'' Dickey said.
``Their concern is not so much with science as it is with promoting
the Clinton-Gore pro-abortion agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who supports abortion rights, is counting on raising the
abortion issue often to help him win win over independent voters,
particularly women. Spokesmen for Gore and his running mate,
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said both men support
the NIH funding guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who opposes abortion except in the cases of rape, incest,
and the life of the mother, is wooing the same voters and is
conducting a campaign in which the issue plays little or no role.
``Governor Bush opposes federal funding for stem-cell research when
it involves destroying a living, human embryo,'' said Ray Sullivan,
a spokesman for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters say that as president, he would issue an
executive order overturning the NIH policy. ``The question for the
next president is whether he is going to enforce the plain letter
of the law,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the
National Right to Life Committee, which has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An overheated debate in Congress this fall between abortion foes
and the medical advocates over stem-cell research may not benefit
Bush, who asserts that he is a compassionate conservative. Dickey
Wednesday compared the NIH-approved research to ``the horrors
committed by Nazi doctors,'' which ``taught us the lesson that
`science' can sometimes be used to hide other agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a conference call arranged by the American Society for
Cell Biology that included more than 50 reporters, Lyn Langbein of
Olney, Md., deescribed how stem-cell research may be the best
therapeutic hope that children such as her 5-year-old daughter,
Jamie, who suffers from juvenile diabetes, have of reaching age 20
as a healthy young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me when I hear opponents to embryo research say,
`Let's rely on adult stem cells,' '' Langbein said. ``What if five
years down the road we find they aren't about to do what we want
them to do? Time is not on our side when it comes to juvenile
diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say it would be a mistake to pursue only one avenue
of stem-cell research. Even in the best case, it will be at least
three to five years before human clinical tests can begin.
Researchers in cell biology say they are encouraged by the early
stem-cell experiments in animals, which have improved the mobility
of those with spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed in a riding accident,
has become a national spokesman for stem-cell research and raised
money for the cause during the Democratic National Convention.
Michael J. Fox, an actor with Parkinson's disease, now has a
foundation and is also lobbying for a stem-cell breakthrough. He
held a fund-raiser at the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the NIH guidelines will enable this critical
research to advance without violating the moral and ethical
sensibilities of the American people,'' said Paul Berg, a Stanford
University biochemist who won a Nobel Prize for cancer research.
``It would be immoral not to proceed, in that it has the potential
to save lives.''

TIVO AND REPLAYTV MAY CHANGE VIEWING HABITS, BUT NOT YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard LaFrance, an engineer in Lake Tahoe, Nev., was intrigued
when he heard about a new product for his television, a gadget that
would search for the programs he wanted, automatically recording
them on a hard drive, and would allow him to put live programs on
``pause'' and skip commercials at the press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   But last winter, when he rushed to the salespeople at a local
electronics retailer, Good Guys, searching for one of the devices,
known as a digital video recorder, ``they didn't know about it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to give up easily, LaFrance walked around the store
until he found one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had it on the floor, and they didn't know about it,'' he
said. ``They didn't even put it next to the VCRs _ it was somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that digital video recorders _ also known
as personal video recorders or by the brand names of the two
competing services, TiVo and ReplayTV _ are a powerful and, for
many, an attractive technology. Online reviews at Web sites like
Deja.com, ePinions and Amazon.com brim with glowing testimonials on
the order of, ``How did I watch TV before this?''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts even suggest that the DVR will help reshape
commercial television by giving people the power to program their
own personalized networks, watching programs whenever they want and
completely avoiding commercials. With a DVR, for example, a
Humphrey Bogart fan can instruct the machine to find and record all
Bogart movies that are broadcast, then can watch them at will,
skipping the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their promise, however, DVRs have not flown off the
shelves since they were first introduced a little more than a year
ago. Philips Electronics and Sony devices use the TiVo service,
while Panasonic and Sharp receivers use the ReplayTV service, and
ReplayTV also offers its own hardware. TiVo devices, the most
highly promoted of the brands, sold about 48,000 units in their
first year. ReplayTV shipped about 9,500 of its own boxes to
retailers in 1999. Panasonic started selling ReplayTV devices in
May, and sales figures were not available; Sharp is just getting
into the market.
</P>
<P>
   The DVR is a good example of how even relatively easy-to-use
technology with a huge potential market can be slow off the mark.
While price is an issue _ the units cost from $99, with a monthly
fee of $9.95, to $499 _ there are thornier problems, like getting
consumers to understand a product that has too many features to sum
up neatly in an advertising slogan.
</P>
<P>
   And even if consumers understand the product, will millions feel
that it is useful enough _ and different enough from a VCR _ that
they cannot do without it? Or will DVRs go the way of, say,
quadraphonic sound, which was introduced in the 1970s as the next
big thing in audio but was rejected by consumers?
</P>
<P>
   The companies are betting that the DVR will not fizzle.
(ReplayTV's partners include Time Warner and the Sundance Channel,
and TiVo's include America Online, CBS and Disney. Showtime and NBC
are partners of both services.) The companies point to a high level
of satisfaction among early adopters, some of whom liked it so much
that they bought a second or third unit. The companies have little
doubt that more consumers will eventually see how convenient the
DVR is, and how much more it can do than a VCR. But they
acknowledge that DVR's can be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until people get their hands on it,'' said Rebecca Baer, a
spokeswoman for TiVo, ``they don't understand why they need this.''
Salespeople who want quick sales often do not have the time to
promote a new technology, she said. ``The retail environment is an
extremely hostile one,'' she said, ``especially for products that
require education.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem facing DVRs, as LaFrance found, is that salespeople
often know little about the machines, even though they have been on
the market for more than a year. ``The retailers that sell it don't
push it,'' LaFrance said. ``I don't understand it because it's a
big ticket item.'' LaFrance was so happy with DVR that he now owns
two and has a third on order _ one for each one of his televisions.
A fan of science, he uses one just to search for and record science
programs.
</P>
<P>
   To educate salespeople, the companies are sending out marketers
to conduct demonstrations in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hollingsworth, the senior vice president for sales and
marketing at ReplayTV, said his company would put on 10,000
demonstrations nationwide _ in stores like Circuit City, Best Buy
and The Wiz _ between now and end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo plans about 1,000 demonstrations this year. It has just
built a traveling demonstration theater in a tractor-trailer that
will tour 25 cities this year.
</P>
<P>
   One barrier to consumer acceptance may be that in addition to a
cable or satellite hookup, each DVR needs access to a phone line to
download information about broadcast schedules. While that phone
line can still be used for calls or data transmission, some
consumers may be reluctant to hook up another device to a phone
line or install another jack. Stores have also been slow to hook
showroom DVRs up to phone lines, even though a DVR needs a phone
line to show how it can track programs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To address consumers more directly, both TiVo and ReplayTV have
commissioned advertising campaigns. One TiVo advertisement was
banned by CBS because it tried to make the point that network
programmers were obsolete by showing a pair of bouncers marching
into a programmer's office and throwing him out the window. An
advertisement for ReplayTV shows a boxing match in which a viewer
hits Pause to freeze the action, leaving the boxers standing
around, waiting to resume. The punch line is, ``Pausing live TV _
weird, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say their goal is to stir up attention. The
difficulty is that neither advertising campaign really answers the
question as to what a DVR is. What they are, and how they differ
from VCRs, is not an easy question to answer in 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a logical prospect does not understand the product,'' said
John Roberts, a former marketing executive with Sony who is now
with Gotham Advertising in New York, ``it's hard to say the produce
is well served _ unless there's so much buzz and hype that the
information is already being taken cre of.''
</P>
<P>
   DVRs are, in fact, both a piece of hardware (each one has a hard
drive that can hold 20 to 30 hours of low-resolution television, or
seven to 10 hours of high-resolution programs, for later viewing)
and a service that tracks down the programs a viewer wants even if
they are delayed or rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware is plugged into a telephone line so it can call the
service daily for schedule updates and software enhancements. It is
also plugged into the homeowner's cable or satellite box.
</P>
<P>
   One of the DVR's big attention grabbers is the ability to make a
live television program pause, then continue the show without
skipping a single word of ``NYPD Blue,'' for instance _ even if a
pizza arrives in the middle of the show. That is possible because
the device is recording whatever is being watched. When viewers
resume watching, they are actually seeing recorded material. But
more compelling to viewers is the DVRs ability to sort through the
numerous channels to find programs the viewer likes so they are
never missed.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kusler, a product manager at a software company,
CrowdBurst.com in San Francisco, bought the first model of TiVo so
he would not miss his favorite sports event, the Tour de France
bicycle race. ``ESPN treats it one step below soccer, and they
would move it without telling you,'' he said. ``Now even if the
listing changes, TiVo still finds it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both TiVo and ReplayTV allow users to configure the listings to
display only programs of the type they want to watch, so there are
fewer listings for the viewer to scan. The daily schedule of shows
is then available in an on-screen guide. The DVRs can be set to
record specific programs, or any shows it finds with a specific
actor.
</P>
<P>
   The services will also monitor what the viewer watches and
suggest that similar programs be recorded. With TiVo, the
suggestions become more refined as the viewer approves or
disapproves of the suggestions, using a button on a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get used to it,'' said Charles Weiss, a photo
assignment editor at The Baltimore Sun. ``It changes the way you
watch television. I sit down with the remote and my impulse is to
channel-surf, but then I go to the listings, very quickly find out
what is on, and go to the show I want to watch.'' He keeps a cache
of ``Seinfeld'' and ``Drew Carey Show'' episodes on hand.
</P>
<P>
   A DVR's recording capability may not seem that different from a
VCR's, but a viewer can make a DVR recording with one push of a
button and without setting a timer. Most VCR owners cannot even set
the clock, and they seldom _ if ever _ use the timer to record a
show. With a DVR, the viewer chooses programs from an on-screen
menu, and the machine does the rest. The machines are not intended
for the long-term storage of programs _ for that, the programs can
be transferred to a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD's recording feature was particularly important for
Kusler, who keeps a stock of ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``South Park'' on hand. ``I don't watch a lot of TV,''
he said, ``but I'd come home and the things I wanted to see weren't
on.''
</P>
<P>
   DVRs also let viewers skip commercials. TiVo has a fast forward
button that is similar to the one on a VCR. ReplayTV has a button
that skips ahead in 30-second chunks (if the program is running at
least 30 seconds ahead), which was the main reason that LaFrance
bought his. ``I was so fed up with commercials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those features do not necessarily come cheap. And
consumers who are not familiar with the features of a DVR are
likely to look at the price and buy a VCR instead, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about VCRs,'' he said. ``Everyone has one, and it's
cheap. You have to be an idiot to spend more than $200.'' Even
entry-level DVRs with a recoding time of 14 hours were selling for
about $500 during the critical Christmas sales period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have responded by lowering prices. This year, a
low-end TiVo unit sells for $99, not including the program-listings
service, which is $10 a month or $199 for the life of the unit (
for a total of $298).
</P>
<P>
   Basic ReplayTV units start at $299, with service included.
Top-of-the-line models, which record up to 30 hours of television,
sell for about $600.
</P>
<P>
   That $299 price may be a pivotal number, according to Gordon
Hodge, a media analyst for Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment
firm in San Francisco. ``When DVD and MP3 moved into that range, it
seemed to be a magic price point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another barrier is the ``teeter factor,'' said Hodge, who owns a
TiVo and uses it to record sports events. ``There's a lot of
clutter in the family room,'' he said. ``Do you really want to
stack another box on the others teetering on top of the TV?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both DVR companies say that before Christmas, they will release
``combo boxes,'' which will put a DVR in the same box as a
satellite television set-top controller (Sony's combo box will cost
$399, the same price as the stand-alone recorder). The combo box
will not only reduce clutter but will also piggyback DVR sales on
the high sales volume of satellite television service. Hodge
estimates that TiVo will sell more than 100,000 units on the
strength of the combo box. ReplayTV is not a public company yet and
has not fully divulged its balance sheets, so Hodge had no
projections for its sales.
</P>
<P>
   DVRs may be easy to use, but some buyers have complained that
they are not easy to set up. Not every configuration of devices is
covered in the manuals, and even the basic instructions might be
daunting for someone who just wants to plug in the device and turn
it on.
</P>
<P>
   In a test, setting up the TiVo initially required two phone
calls to customer service, about an hour to configure the system
and about three hours for the system to download and install its
software. The ReplayTV, which allows more programming customization
than TiVo, took less time to download its software, but it required
a lot of time poring over the manual to configure and learn its
features.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two units, the TiVo was easiest to use. It has an curvy,
comfortable remote control with an intuitive arrangement of
buttons. The ReplayTV remote control had more features, but lots of
small buttons that could vex someone with less than perfect vision.
It also required an occasional look at the manual to locate a
feature on the remote control (the quick skip, which jumps 30
seconds at a clip for excising commercials, eluded the tester for
two days).
</P>
<P>
   As with any new electronic product, some users have reported
technical difficulties. One of them is Robert Hill, an executive
recruiter from Leesburg, Va., who likes to tape old ``Saturday
Night Live'' shows and vintage movies. ``I had the thing for about
six weeks,'' he said, ``and all of a sudden the thing wouldn't _
the phrase I would use is boot up.'' He exchanged it for a new unit
but still experiences some problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when it is recording it will switch off early,''
Hill said, ``so you'll get 1} hours for a Hitchcock movie, then it
changes channels. So you miss the last 15 minutes.'' But he does
not mind. ``To tell you the truth, I've seen most of them before,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are hustling to iron out glitches while still
introducing new products. ReplayTV has announced that it will make
personal programming available on the Internet so people can tell
their units to tape shows their co-workers discussed at water
coolers that day and have them ready for viewing after work. TiVo
is working on a similar service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the promotion, the companies say that when it comes
to brand-new technology, the public cannot be rushed. ``We have an
educational challenge to help people understand what TiVo is,''
said Mike Ramsey, the chief executive of TiVo. ``It's more than
just spending money on marketing _ it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the best salespeople may be users like Kusler.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come over, I forget I have it and pause the TV, and
they want to know how I did that,'' he said. ``I think I've
personally sold about five of them, maybe six.''
</P>
<P>
   REPLAYTV OR TIVO?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following is a comparison of the Panasonic ShowStopper 2000,
which is a ReplayTV unit, and the Sony SVR-2000, a TiVo model.
</P>
<P>
   PRICE: Panasonic/ReplayTV: $599 (programming service included);
Sony/TiVo $399 plus $199 for service.
</P>
<P>
   RECORDING TIME: Both models allow 30 hours of recording at
lowest quality, 10 hours at highest quality.

</P>
<P>
   SETUP AND PROGRAMMING
</P>
<P>
   Digital Recorders Aren't Quite Plug and Play &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that connecting a digital video recorder is as
easy as hooking up a VCR. Let that be a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Although connecting and programming these units is not
especially daunting to the technically adept, they are not quite
``plug and play.'' At their simplest, the units require that the
user connect a coaxial cable and a phone cable to the box, then
follow a series of commands on the TV screen. Such a setup can take
as little as an hour. But setup can be more complicated when a
digital recorder is used with a home entertainment system, a cable
box or any number of devices that can be hooked to a television.
</P>
<P>
   In a test, the TiVo receiver (a Sony model) was the easier to
set up, requiring the user to answer questions on a series of
screen menus. There were confusing moments _ when the machine asked
for the selection of a cable provider, it did not provide the
correct name. And several days after the machine was set up and
operating, it suddenly could no longer complete its nightly call to
update the TV schedule. The machine had switched the dial-in number
from a toll-free number to an incorrect local one. The machine had
to be configured all over again.
</P>
<P>
   SETUP OF THE REPLAY
</P>
<P>
   TV receiver (a Panasonic model) required more time, largely
because it had more customizable features. The manual did not make
it easy. Take the section on setting recording options, which
includes this passage: ``Guaranteed. Choices are yes and no.
Guaranteed means space is reserved for the show. Nonguaranteed
means the show will be recorded if there is space available (after
space is reserved for Show-based Replay channels). See Guaranteed
and Nonguaranteed Recording on Page 40.''
</P>
<P>
   As easy as a VCR indeed.

   MIAMI _ Tropical Storm Debby lost momentum as it spun westward
through the rough mountains of the island of Hispaniola and headed
toward the northern coast of Cuba, where the storm was expected to
weaken even more before threatening the Florida coast or moving
into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   South Floridians, who have tensely followed the arrival of the
first hurricane this season to threaten the state's coastline, were
relieved when the storm was downgraded Wednesday morning to a
tropical storm, but forecasters here warned that the state is still
in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Winds had slipped to below 60 mph by Wednesday evening as the
storm moved across the Dominican Republic and then Haiti, dumping
heavy rain and tearing the tin roofs off homes.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged terrain broke up the already weakening storm, which
was good news for Florida and the rest of the coastal United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountains of Hispaniola have really disrupted the
circulation,'' said Max Mayfield, the director of the National
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Not only has it not strengthened, it
has weakened and will likely continue to weaken as the center moves
up onto Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane is already looking ragged _ a tight spiral of
clouds denotes a stronger, more dangerous storm _ as it seems
headed, forecasters tentatively predicted, for the Florida Straits
and then on into the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   That would carry the storm over or close to the Florida Keys,
where emergency management officials Wednesday ordered an
evacuation of tourists _ a move that they hoped would open up the
roads for Keys residents if they are ordered to leave later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just asking residents right now to put their hurricane
plans into effect,'' said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the
Monroe County Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing that could happen, said the state's emergency
management officials, is for people fleeing the coast to be trapped
in traffic as a storm bears down.
</P>
<P>
   Keys residents, who are accustomed to such things, boarded up
windows with plywood, stocked up on water and flashlight batteries,
and watched their televisions for the latest weather updates. But,
as the storm weakened, some residents relaxed, let their dogs out
for a run on the unusually quiet streets, and waited.
</P>
<P>
   In the usually boisterous bars on Duval Street, people who rely
on the tourists for their living said they definitely were not
better off alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead, for us,'' said Kathy Wolfort, a bartender and
waitress in the famous Key West bar, Sloppy Joe's. ``Usually right
now, our whole dining room is full.'' Of the 65 tables in the
restaurant, only 15 were being used.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters warned that the good news about Debby might not
last, and that the storm could strengthen once it heads back over
water, perhaps in the Straits or the Gulf, and said it could
threaten the west coast of Florida, or the Panhandle, or elsewhere
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The storm skirted Puerto Rico, but brought only minimum damage
there and in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, some residents went to buy plywood and other emergency
supplies, but the threat, at least for the city and surrounding
area, seemed to have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look to us like there is any chance this will
become a hurricane, at least in the short term,'' said Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still a chance that the storm would turn slightly
more north, and threaten South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to let our guard down,'' said Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   If the storm does pass through the Straits and heads into the
warm waters of the Gulf, it could pick up strength and threaten the
Gulf Coast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Frederick in 1979 did just that, he said. It was a
ragged storm, too, but became a dangerous hurricane as it swept
across the Gulf to the coast of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Even if winds do not create much damage, the storm is expected
to bring torrential rains, wherever it makes landfall.

ABORTION OPPONENTS REACT TO NEW CLINTON STEM CELL RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angry abortion opponents took aim at new federal
guidelines on stem-cell research, accusing the Clinton
administration Wednesday of playing presidential politics with a
science they call unethical and unlawful and vowing to overturn the
action in the courts or Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma over research that has life-saving potential but
destroys human embryos divides the major presidential candidates _
Governor George W. Bush of Texas opposes the use of federal funds
for it, while Vice President Al Gore supports it. And it could
emerge in the upcoming campaign because it touches the hot-button
issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be easy for this to become a political football,''
said Ronald Green, who directs the Ethics Institute at Dartmouth
College. ``And because there is not a large constituency for
patient-care groups, it is prone to get more emotional criticism
than emotional support.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health Wednesday won praise from many
scientists for riding out a heavy storm of criticism and publishing
ethical and clinical guidelines that will allow medical reseachers
to obtain federal funds to study the fast-developing biology of
embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The cells, which are culled from week-old human embryos and grow
and differentiate into organs and tissue, show breakthrough promise
in treating many serious conditions, including diabetes,
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if the public will look at, first of all, the
potentially staggering benefits of this research _ everything from
birth defects to Parkinson's, certain kinds of cancer, diabetes,
spinal-cord injuries _ it's a potential change for the future,''
President Clinton said. ``I think we cannot walk away from the
potential to save lives and improve lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policy was put in place despite a 1996 federal law,
championed by abortion opponents in Congress, the National Right to
Life Committee, and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
that prohibits public funding of research in which human embryos
are destroyed or discarded.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NIH guidelines, the source of research stem
cells must be frozen embryos left over from fertility treatments,
and with the patient's consent, are to be discarded. The policy
prohibits federal money from being spent on the process that
separates the stem cells from the embryo, which results in the
embryo's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the guidelines were a transparent and politically
motivated end-run around the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embryonic stem-cell research is illegal, immoral, and
unnecessary,'' Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said in
a statement. He argues that researchers should concentrate on
regenerating adult stem cells because it would moot the abortion
issue. ``It is never acceptable to deliberately kill one innocent
human being in order to help another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jay Dickey, an Arkansas Republican who sponsored
the 1996 funding ban, called the NIH rules a ``boldfaced violation
of the law.'' He said in an interview that he will seek either a
court-ordered injunction or attempt to withhold funds appropriated
for the NIH if the agency makes a grant for stem-cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey also charged the Clinton administration with manipulating
a federal agency to help Gore. ``The administration didn't have to
bring this up right in the middle of the election,'' Dickey said.
``Their concern is not so much with science as it is with promoting
the Clinton-Gore pro-abortion agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who supports abortion rights, is counting on raising the
abortion issue often to help him win win over independent voters,
particularly women. Spokesmen for Gore and his running mate,
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said both men support
the NIH funding guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who opposes abortion except in the cases of rape, incest,
and the life of the mother, is wooing the same voters and is
conducting a campaign in which the issue plays little or no role.
``Governor Bush opposes federal funding for stem-cell research when
it involves destroying a living, human embryo,'' said Ray Sullivan,
a spokesman for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters say that as president, he would issue an
executive order overturning the NIH policy. ``The question for the
next president is whether he is going to enforce the plain letter
of the law,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the
National Right to Life Committee, which has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An overheated debate in Congress this fall between abortion foes
and the medical advocates over stem-cell research may not benefit
Bush, who asserts that he is a compassionate conservative. Dickey
Wednesday compared the NIH-approved research to ``the horrors
committed by Nazi doctors,'' which ``taught us the lesson that
`science' can sometimes be used to hide other agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a conference call arranged by the American Society for
Cell Biology that included more than 50 reporters, Lyn Langbein of
Olney, Md., deescribed how stem-cell research may be the best
therapeutic hope that children such as her 5-year-old daughter,
Jamie, who suffers from juvenile diabetes, have of reaching age 20
as a healthy young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares me when I hear opponents to embryo research say,
`Let's rely on adult stem cells,' '' Langbein said. ``What if five
years down the road we find they aren't about to do what we want
them to do? Time is not on our side when it comes to juvenile
diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say it would be a mistake to pursue only one avenue
of stem-cell research. Even in the best case, it will be at least
three to five years before human clinical tests can begin.
Researchers in cell biology say they are encouraged by the early
stem-cell experiments in animals, which have improved the mobility
of those with spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed in a riding accident,
has become a national spokesman for stem-cell research and raised
money for the cause during the Democratic National Convention.
Michael J. Fox, an actor with Parkinson's disease, now has a
foundation and is also lobbying for a stem-cell breakthrough. He
held a fund-raiser at the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the NIH guidelines will enable this critical
research to advance without violating the moral and ethical
sensibilities of the American people,'' said Paul Berg, a Stanford
University biochemist who won a Nobel Prize for cancer research.
``It would be immoral not to proceed, in that it has the potential
to save lives.''

LIFE OF A RAMBLIN' GUY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a wonderfully telling scene toward the end of ``The
Ballad of Ramblin' Jack'' where folk legend Ramblin' Jack Elliott
tries to take his daughter to the house where she grew up. Driving
around Mendocino backroads in his beat-up RV, Jack eventually gives
up, saying the house must be there somewhere, but finding it will
have to wait until another day.
</P>
<P>
   That Ramblin' Jack couldn't find his old house doesn't come as
much of a surprise given how seldom he hung his cowboy hat there.
That his only daughter, Aiyana, barely knew him is kind of a given,
too, and that gulf between father and child is at the heart of this
compelling documentary. Aiyana Elliott, a New York University
graduate making her directorial debut here, has crafted an
extraordinary portrait of an American original as well as a
beautiful story of a daughter trying to come to terms with her
distant father.
</P>
<P>
   Ramblin' Jack isn't known to many people outside the folk music
scene, but his influence on popular music is substantial. He's an
unlikely cowboy, being born Elliott Charles Adnopoz, the son of
Jewish doctor in Brooklyn. But Jack, as we can clearly see from
early home movies, was born with the spirit of wanderlust, and at
15, he ran away from home to join the rodeo. Thus began a lifetime
of living up to the nickname he gave himself.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack was 19, he heard Woody Guthrie on the radio for the
first time and soon determined to meet the legend. He visited
Guthrie's Coney Island home and quickly became a member of the
household. Jack loved Guthrie's honest sound and working-man spirit
and began emulating his hero, causing Guthrie to observe, ``Jack
sounds more like me than I do myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, after becoming one of the folk music scene's
most influential figures, it was Jack's turn to become the teacher,
mentoring a young Bob Dylan. Now Jack was the subject of imitation,
with Dylan being billed as ``the son of Jack Elliott'' before his
first concert at Gerde's Folk City in New York.
</P>
<P>
   These triumphs, along with the singer's long periods of
obscurity, are shown through an amazing wealth of archival footage.
Jack's love for freedom and spontaneity served him well, but came
with a price _ four broken marriages and a perpetual state of
financial disarray. As friend Kris Kristofferson notes: ``The story
of Jack's life is other people having hits for things he was
responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ramblin' Jack'' is more than a straight biopic. As
daughter Aiyana spends two years traveling with her father, she
comes to the disturbing realization that proximity does not equal
intimacy. And watching her father glad-hand and befriend every
stranger he comes across, Aiyana becomes frustrated, complaining
that she's ``never had an actual conversation'' with him, even
though she's his daughter !ital!and she's making a movie about him.
This conflict _ and its ultimate resolution _ gives ``Ramblin'
Jack'' a universal poignancy and makes it one of the best
documentaries of the year. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack; (unrated; suitable for all
audiences). &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Aiyana Elliott; written by Aiyana
Elliott and Dick Dahl. Released by Lot 47 Films. &QL;

<P>
   LOLO, Mont. _ The fire that burned right up to my house this
year was different than those that leveled more than 65 of my
neighbors' homes in recent days. I set it myself to give me a bit
of buffer against summer's big fires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as blankets of smoke stretch to every horizon line in my
valley and a single afternoon's lightning sets 100 new fires in
western Montana, I spend my days watching the ridges for bolts
close to home and wondering if I have done enough.
</P>
<P>
   Through decades of research, ecologists have established that a
century's worth of suppressing fires has left the West glutted in
trees, which is to say fuel. That was certainly true of my own
land, so I hired a man to log it. This would seem to place me in
the camp of those haranguing the government to open the national
forests to more logging. I am not. Despite what Montana's governor
and his timber allies would have us believe, fires thrive on the
sick and scrawny trees left behind by commercial loggers, who take
the big, fat valuable logs. I did the opposite, keeping the big
trees.
</P>
<P>
   There is a barely hidden agenda in the pro-logging harangue,
having to do with President Clinton's decision last year to prevent
logging on 50 million acres of the remaining unroaded public forest
lands. Building roads and turning loggers loose in these wild
places would be a disaster even greater than suppressing fires.
Those lands are well away from houses, vast and buffered. We can
restore these places with fire alone. The timber companies are
using the fires as a wedge to gain access to wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Forest Service warned us not to line those
timbered ridges with trophy houses, but we built them anyhow. For
more than a decade, the agency's firefighters have been saying that
in a drought year they would be powerless to stop the infernos.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, because we believed we were sufficiently wise to
rework nature, we began fighting forest fires, creating the bomb
that now must be defused. Demanding now that fires be conducted in
an orderly fashion is like ordering lions to become vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 acres I burned around my house this spring are recovering
now. The grand old ponderosa pines, evolved as they are to resist
fire, were spared, clearing the way for a bloom of wildflowers and
grasses. That happens after fires. I have done what I can to make
my peace with my place. Now what happens will happen.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ I voted for Vladimir Putin, despite his KGB past. Just
five or six years ago such an act would have been unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin kept his election promises and swatted the oligarchs,
the oligarchs screamed about suppression of freedom of speech but
the rest of impoverished Russia totally supported him. He didn't
drink vodka, didn't play tennis with his bodyguards, didn't sit in
steam baths while Russia crumbled. He traveled all over the
country, shook state debts and taxes out of oligarchs to pay
pensions and salaries, and tried to maintain the country's face as
a great power before the world and, even more important, before its
people.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my friends among the Moscow intelligentsia and former
leaders who found life after political death in the new parliament
assured me that fascism was coming. But like the people who live
outside the Ring Road, Moscow's Beltway, I did not share their
hysteria. I tried to understand Putin, and I liked almost
everything he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the situation in the country well, I was just afraid
that he would get in over his head. I found justifications for his
errors. People were living in the expectation that Putin offered
Russians a last chance to live normally. I hope our chances haven't
sunk along with the submarine in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the disaster played out like Chernobyl 14 years ago.
Then as today, there was silence, and then they lied. Everyone
lied. Then, as now, the Soviet authorities refused Western aid to
liquidate the catastrophe in the first crucial days _ at Chernobyl,
this was when there was the greatest radiation danger. (I
discovered this refusal six years later in secret transcripts of
Politburo meetings.)
</P>
<P>
   I realize that emotions are not the best advisers in any
situation, and haste is good only in catching fleas. But it is
clear that our leaders have tried to play games again, even as they
offered their belated bursts of candor and remorse. The military's
versions of what happened _ a training error, a leftover bomb from
World War II or a collision with an undefined ``large object'' _
send conflicting signals. The last account, which sounds the most
conspiratorial, actually sounds plausible, because such collisions
have occurred regularly.
</P>
<P>
   According to unofficial data, Soviet and Russian subs have had
about 150 accidents. Fourteen collisions between Soviet or Russian
atomic subs and vessels of other nations are known. Soviet and
Russian subs have collided with American ones at least 10 times,
most recently in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The problem now is that any statement of blame is suspect, and
will continue to be unless Russia calls in a commission under aegis
of the United Nations to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Putin expressed ``responsibility and guilt,''
something Mikhail Gorbachev never got around to after Chernobyl.
Putin also faced the angry relatives of the sub's crew in a
marathon meeting. But contrast him with the president of Latvia,
who immediately interrupted her vacation and returned to work after
a terrorist attack in her country last week, even though no one was
dead at the time (one person has since died).
</P>
<P>
   Russians, who have taken the tragedy of the submarine's crew
personally, are once again disillusioned with their leaders. The
difference now is that they have learned to express their anger
effectively. In 1986, Vladimir Putin was a KGB agent in East
Germany. He no doubt remembers that Chernobyl, or rather its
cover-up, was the beginning of the collapse of the Communist
empire.
</P>

Chernobyl disaster and nonproliferation, was a member of Boris

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something very strange about the top 10 zone of the pop
charts this week: Sting is on it.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Britney won't budge, 'N Sync is unstoppable and
Papa Roach continues to threaten everyone, the middle-aged
Englishman seems a bit, well, out of place.
</P>
<P>
   He is not popular with kids.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are probably unaware of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, point to a 13-year-old who's even heard of the Police _
Sting's old band, that is, not who Eminem is always wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Born Gordon Sumner, Sting does indeed look odd next to the
soundtrack to ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.'' What may be a
little odder is that Sting's disc, ``Brand New Day,'' will be a
year old next month. In other words, it's taken this long for it to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   Credit that to the single ``Desert Rose,'' a staple of adult
contemporary radio. ``Brand New Day's'' first batch of singles all
but flopped, temporarily dooming ``Day.'' ``Rose'' resurrected it.
</P>
<P>
   The song could not have come at a better time, as Sting has
embarked on a concert tour with ticket prices going up to the
ludicrous amount of $100. That's for one ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Sting's career has always been a series of horror stories
that take a turn for the better and conclude happily.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime construction worker, tax clerk and teacher was a
fool, he was told at the time, to walk away from the Police, which,
in 1983 and '84, was the most popular rock group in the country,
with a multi-platinum album, ``Synchronicity,'' a string of singles
(including the immortal ``Every Breath You Take'') and a massive
world tour that would set precedents for other tours.
</P>
<P>
   But Sting would find fame as a solo artist. And as that solo
career began, Sting was dogged for abandoning the Police's
reggae-tinged rock for a jazzier, smoother, more polished sound.
</P>
<P>
   Again, naysayers were proven wrong: Sting's solo discs have sold
incredibly well and are anchored by numerous hits. Even if he
didn't play any Police material in concert _ he does, by the way _
his shows could easily be a greatest-hits disc played live. He's
had that many hit singles.
</P>
<P>
   And if ``Rose'' is any indication of his staying power, he'll
continue to do so.

soundtrack to ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.'' What may be a
little odder is that Sting's disc, ``Brand New Day,'' will be a
year old next month. In other words, it's taken this long for it to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   Credit that to the single ``Desert Rose,'' a staple of adult
contemporary radio. ``Brand New Day's'' first batch of singles all
but flopped, temporarily dooming ``Day.'' ``Rose'' resurrected it.
</P>
<P>
   The song could not have come at a better time, as Sting has
embarked on a concert tour with ticket prices going up to the
ludicrous amount of $100. That's for one ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Sting's career has always been a series of horror stories
that take a turn for the better and conclude happily.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime construction worker, tax clerk and teacher was a
fool, he was told at the time, to walk away from the Police, which,
in 1983 and '84, was the most popular rock group in the country,
with a multi-platinum album, ``Synchronicity,'' a string of singles
(including the immortal ``Every Breath You Take'') and a massive
world tour that would set precedents for other tours.
</P>
<P>
   But Sting would find fame as a solo artist. And as that solo
career began, Sting was dogged for abandoning the Police's
reggae-tinged rock for a jazzier, smoother, more polished sound.
</P>
<P>
   Again, naysayers were proven wrong: Sting's solo discs have sold
incredibly well and are anchored by numerous hits. Even if he
didn't play any Police material in concert _ he does, by the way _
his shows could easily be a greatest-hits disc played live. He's
had that many hit singles.
</P>
<P>
   And if ``Rose'' is any indication of his staying power, he'll
continue to do so.

GORE'S IN SPOTLIGHT, BUT LIEBERMAN DAZZLES FLORIDA RETIREMENT
COMMUNITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMARAC, Fla. _ Al Gore may be the big shot on the Democratic
presidential ticket. But it was the man he tapped to be his running
mate, Joe Lieberman, who swept away the crowd Wednesday when he and
Gore dropped by a South Florida retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   As the first Jewish American on a major party presidential
ticket, Lieberman was greeted by the heavily Jewish crowd at the
Kings Point Community Center with the affection and enthusiasm
usually showered on a bar mitzvah boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in a roomful of family,'' Lieberman told a
crowd so large that many had to watch the event on a television
screen in an adjoining lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be in South Florida. Where else would the mayor
come up to me and say `shalom aleichem?' '' he said, referring to
the Hebrew greeting ``peace be with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, sprinkled Yiddishisms throughout his
speech, at one time referring to himself and Gore as
``nuchschleppers'' _ or tag-alongs _ saying their wives, Tipper and
Hadassah, often appeared more popular with voters than the
candidates. Lieberman also described Gore as having a ``Yiddishe
neshoma'' _ a Jewish soul.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the speeches, the senior center band struck up a
rendition of ``Hava Nagila,'' as the enthusiastic crowds mobbed the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One woman grabbed Lieberman's hand and kissed it, leaving a
residue of bright red lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like kissing the Torah,'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Saylor, who watched the event on the television screen in
the lobby, said Lieberman was a good choice not just because he was
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing negative has been said about that man,'' she said.
``He is just what we call a `mensch' '' _ a Yiddish word
characterizing a good or dependable person.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also played to the partisan sentiments of this
overwhelmingly Democratic crowd. The two-term Connecticut senator
ripped Republican opponent George W. Bush's $1.3 trillion tax plan,
arguing it would ``give the most to those who need it the least and
the least who need it the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He also mocked Bush for acknowledging this week that he had not
explained his tax plan well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't explaining the tax cut plan. The problem is
the plan itself,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett responded, ``Senator Lieberman is
severely distorting and misrepresenting Governor Bush's tax plan
based on faulty numbers provided by the labor-backed group Citizens
for Tax Justice. Al Gore believes that 50 million Americans
representing more than half of all taxpayers don't deserve any tax
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent a day off the campaign trail in Austin Wednesday. He
has campaign appearances scheduled Thursday in Louisiana and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore refrained from attacking Bush but suggested that he and not
his Republican rival was providing detailed explanations of his
campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to hear about generalities and platitudes or do
you want to hear about specifics?'' he asked the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Tailoring his message to a crowd familiar with health care
needs, Gore promoted one piece of his $500 billion tax cut plan
that would provide a $3,000 a credit for long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also joined in the shtick when someone in the crowd yelled
``mazel tov'' after he mentioned the birth of his first grandchild
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mazel tov,'' said Gore, repeating the Hebrew phrase used to
extend congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides believe that having Lieberman on the ticket will help
them in states like Florida that have large Jewish populations. But
some analysts contend that the benefit will be only marginal since
Jews historically have voted Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the Jewish population, many of them retirees from
the Northeast who are clustered on the southeast coast, make up
about 6 percent of the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even though George W. Bush's brother, Jeb, is the state's
governor, Gore campaign officials still hold they have a chance in
a state won by President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may have scored points with the crowd at the senior
center, most of those interviewed said they never were inclined to
vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like having a president who doesn't have a Jesus Day in his
state,'' said Jeanne Hirschman, referring to Bush's designating
such a day in Texas last June.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Baer said, ``I would have voted for Gore in any case. But
Lieberman makes it nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shirley Hirchbein disagreed with her friends who said that
religion wasn't a factor in their support of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lieberman ``is a good man and the fact that he's Jewish
helps, don't kid yourself.''

`AMERICAN BEAUTY': PUTTING A STOP TO THE ART IN THE NAME OF
ACTIVISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know that the greatest surgeons believe in something beyond
cutting, that the greatest generals believe in something beyond
war.
</P>
<P>
   With artists it's not clear: art for art's sake or for something
beyond? Even if it is for the beyond _ truth or transformation, say
_ do you get there by looking past the instruments (the surgeon
putting aside the knife for a moment; the general silencing the
guns) or by using them with greater exigency and abnegation?
Perhaps it is not the artist's, general's or surgeon's vocation
that is set aside, but the hyper-trophied modes and swollen
ambitions that encrust themselves in it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a generational question for the distinguished Polish poet
Adam Zagajewski. In the 1970s, along with many of his fellow
artists and intellectuals, he interrupted his modernist ironies and
aesthetic explorations _ involving mainly nonlethal clashes with
the communist censorship _ for outright activism.
</P>
<P>
   His group called itself Now. It sent rickety shuttle-loads of
the black-sweatered (the garb favored by these ex-aesthetes) to
unheated meeting halls in towns and cities around Poland. Instead
of poetry they talked about justice and political and economic
change. A police car stood outside, but in those erratically
repressive years the policemen rarely stepped inside.
</P>
<P>
   Now offered Zagajewski ``the bitter bread of urgency, of
contemporaneity,'' he writes in ``Another Beauty. ``It ripped me
from the lovely sphere in which time doesn't count, where I could
read Norwid one day and Kafka the next, as if the real, historical
worlds in which they lived were completely extraneous. It was a
descent from the clouds, a departure from the land of dreams, a
brutal encounter with the ugliness of the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this `now' was uncommonly ugly: a graceless moment in an
ugly country conquered by Moscow and sentenced to mediocrity in
virtually every domain.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``I proclaimed the primacy of `obligation' over
pleasure, sobriety over reverie, society over the solitary reader
and poet. Amazingly enough, a program closer to self-flagellation
than to art began at some point to attract the attention of a
public that would no doubt have remained entirely indifferent if I
had stayed true to my leisurely, `eternal' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. But Zagajewski, unlike some of his black-sweatered
fellows, has become neither a politician nor founder of a start-up
money pot. He remains a poet; one whose distinction is to reconcile
aesthetic exploration with what happened to him in Now's decrepit
train-and-van trips. ``If,'' he writes, ``such a thing can be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Well it can be. If Zagajewski is not on the titan level of a
Czeslaw Milosz (his mentor in some respects), it may be because,
belonging to a younger, post-Stalin generation, he has not been
plunged into Milosz's depths, nor had to work back up from such a
profound sense of the tragic. He too is a healer, of sorts, but the
wound is not so deep and the healing not so uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, though, it is remarkable and shines through this
commonplace-book of sketches, reflections and bits of personal and
poetic history. Zagajewski places himself at an opposite end from
the French-Romanian E.M. Cioran, compiler of an epigrammatic
encyclopedia of despair. He, to the contrary, can write only out of
happiness. A touch of Panglossian uplift occasionally creeps into
``Another Beauty.'' Mostly the author _ sadder and wiser and
nonetheless hopeful _ is a far-from-gullible Candide.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of self-mockery, phrased with comic
indirection. Zagajewski pictures himself typing a manifesto for
Now, while Sunday Mass-goers clack by beneath his window.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two kinds of tapping _ high heels and my typewriter _
mingled from time to time. There were no other sounds; the
blackbirds hadn't started singing yet. Carpenters didn't saw wood
on Sundays, ironworkers didn't labor in their cramped, noisy
shops.'' As for him, ``I churned out leaflets and counted on the
support of the working class.''
</P>
<P>
   The author describes the reading room at the Beaubourg library
in Paris. Every little while a loudspeaker breaks into the readers'
reveries, warning them to watch for pickpockets. ``Each reader
glances up involuntarily, struggling to understand what's going on.
But it's only pickpockets.'' He imagines the loudspeakers taking
over: ``Would the lady seated at table four please cease her
ecstasies over Baudelaire and pick up something pleasanter and
easier to read?''
</P>
<P>
   He writes evocatively of strolls through Krakow, an
architectural frontier between German Gothic and the lightness of
Northern Renaissance. He longs for Mediterranean light but is loyal
to his city's darkness. The stained glass windows in the churches
are splotches of black, he recalls, contrasting them with the
light-dazzled windows of Chartres Cathedral, which ``towered
proudly above a small provincial town like the Iliad over Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   There are melancholy portraits of his old professors, prewar
stars bypassed and impoverished when the communists took over. He
writes of a retired clerk who preserves his three suits by lying
down all day. ``If he used up anything it could only be oxygen and
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He touches on poetry and a summer evening musicale. He cites a
friend on what most impressed him traveling about the world: ``The
ubiquity of sparrows.'' The writer Alexander Wat is quoted:
``Compare French and German string quartets. You'll see at once who
has the stronger army.'' He evokes Krakow's cramped apartments,
where broken things are retained, just in case (counter to the
decreed utopian future) time were to run the other way suddenly and
tick-tock broken things back into repair.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this lovely bric-a-brac, we read of a devout aunt who made
friends with the parish priest next door and invited him to dinner.
The priest hit it off with her philologist husband, a devout
atheist. Friendship and regular dinners ensued. To the aunt's
bemusement it was not piety but the whet and flash of argument that
lured the visitor. A pleasant story, but beware the bomb concealed
when a poet is being pleasant. The priest was Karol Wojtyla.

CHINA ARRESTS INTERNET CAFE OWNER FOR POSTING POLITICAL ARTICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 2nd graf to correct spelling of Nontong to NANCHONG; subs

 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The owner of an Internet cafe in southern China has
been arrested and charged with subversion for posting articles
critical of the Communist Party, the latest sign of the
government's campaign to tame the explosion of electronic
information.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang Shihua, a high school teacher who operated the cafe in the
city of Nanchong in Sichuan Province, is the third person in recent
months known to face serious charges for political statements on
the Internet. His arrest on Aug. 16, five days after he began
posting the articles under a pseudonym, was reported this week by
the Free China Movement in Washington, based on accounts by Chinese
television and Reporters Without Borders, a media watchdog group in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have embraced the Internet as a key to
development but also fear it, and special ``Web police'' units have
been formed to search for illegal activities like fraud and
pornography as well as outlawed political debate.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Huang Qi, who ran a Web site from Sichuan that
published statements on the student democracy movement that was
crushed in 1989 and other rights issues, was charged with
subversion in June.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Qi Yanchen, of Hebei Province, has been charged
with the same crime for posting anti-government messages, according
to rights groups. None of the three arrested men has been tried,
but convictions in such cases are nearly certain and can bring long
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the authorities shut down New Culture Forum,
a Web site in Shandong Province that sponsored debate on the need
for democracy.

AMAZON.COM PLANS TO SELL CARS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Amazon.com, one of the world's largest online
retailers, announced on Wednesday that it would begin offering a
car-selling service on the Internet, the latest and potentially
most serious challenge to the ability of automakers to control the
distribution of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early Thursday morning, Amazon shoppers will be able
to compare features for hundreds of models from various brands.
They will be able to configure a chosen car or light truck with
various options and then obtain a price quote and estimated
delivery date for their vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But while buyers will be able to put down a deposit through
Amazon, using their credit cards, customers will buy the vehicle
itself from a local dealer, either at a dealership or by having
dealership employees deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will market automobiles through an alliance with
Greenlight.com, a privately held online company owned by several
big chains of auto dealerships and by various venture capitalists.
In January, Amazon announced that it had bought a 5 percent stake
in Greenlight.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring customers to buy vehicles from dealers at the end
of the process, Amazon and Greenlight hope to circumvent
restrictive state laws that have entangled companies that have
sought to buy cars from dealers and actually resell them to
consumers. Greenlight has affiliated dealers in 27 metropolitan
areas who will provide the cars for the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, and Joel
Manby, the chief executive of Greenlight, said their companies had
carefully designed the plan to comply with state laws. Tweaking the
auto industry, they announced their plan on Wednesday at the
Automotive Hall of Fame, less than a mile from Ford's headquarters
in this southwestern suburb of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's shares rose 2 5/16 to 38 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who buy from CarsDirect.com, another online car buying
service, pay all of the vehicle's price directly to the service,
which then passes the money on, after subtracting a small profit
margin, to a dealer, who delivers the car and its title directly to
the buyer. Because the company acts as a principal in the
transactions, it drew criticism from some state regulators and
recently decided not to do business in Texas and 10 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Manby said that Greenlight, by not acting as a principal in a
transaction, would be able to do business nationwide, including
Texas. He declined to say how much of the deposit that customers
pay Amazon would be forwarded to the dealers supplying the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Kent, the enforcement director in the motor vehicle
division of the Texas Transportation Department, said that her
agency was allowing Greenlight to do business there.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. quickly criticized the plan, saying that it did
not allow dealers to play a large enough role in selling the
vehicles. Stephen Lyons, Ford's general sales manager, said the
arrangement essentially amounted to brokering cars that are
purchased from dealers _ an activity that some states prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their model isn't satisfactory to us in terms of how they
satisfy customers and bring dealers in,'' Lyons said. ``We view
them, as others, as electronic brokers, because what they do is
offer our vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors announced plans a week ago to set up its own site
that would provide information on all brands of automobiles,
including those of rival automakers, but would refer customers to
dealers for actual sales. Terry Sullivan, a GM spokesman, said that
the automaker did not comment on other companies' Internet
ventures, but believed in general that dealers should handle sales.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say they want dealers to sell their cars because only
dealers have the experience and knowledge needed to teach customers
about a new vehicle and then provide warranty repairs and other
service during subsequent years. The automakers have taken this
position partly because of pressure from multifranchise dealers,
who have warned that they may be less energetic in selling models
made by those automakers that do not fight back against online
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have the legal ability to create problems for Amazon
and Greenlight. Ford and GM have announced plans not to send
dealers new cars to replace cars that they sell through services
that the automakers view as brokers. Foreign automakers have said
that they want to sell cars mainly through dealers, although they
have not made specific threats to withhold new vehicles from
dealers that work with brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said that one of the dealership chains involved with
Amazon and Greenlight, Sonic Automotive, had already agreed not to
sell Ford vehicles through the service, while Ford is in
negotiations with a chain of 125 dealerships, Asbury Automotive,
which helped found Greenlight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Online retailing of automobiles was dominated until recently by
former car dealers who set up specialty sites, like Peter Ellis,
who created Autobytel.com, the leading online auto retailer in the
late 1990s. But such sites have been struggling as they face
competition from bigger, more established companies.
</P>
<P>
   America Online recently allied itself with the nation's largest
dealership chain, AutoNation, which is controlled by Wayne
Huizenga, the Florida investor best known for having built Waste
Management, the garbage disposal company, and Blockbuster, the
video rental chain. Under a plan similar to Amazon's, America
Online will put an auto retailing link on its home page late next
month that will allow users to select cars from 300 AutoNation
sites around the country and another 900 dealerships that use
AutoNation's online buying program, AutoVantage. AutoNation sold $1
billion worth of vehicles last year to people who initially
contacted the company through its Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jackson, AutoNation's chief executive, said he did not
regard Amazon and Greenlight as a serious threat. He contended that
it was impossible to make money without having a single company
that owns both the dealerships and the Internet referral service.
Automakers have not objected to AutoNation's arrangement because
dealers play a larger role in the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has been struggling with huge losses that have been
draining its cash. Bezos said that Greenlight would pay $15.25
million to Amazon over two years as part of the arrangement. While
Amazon will audit Greenlight's customer satisfaction, Greenlight
will handle most of the auto retailing activities on the Amazon
site. Amazon had previously provided a link to Greenlight's site.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, Dick Cheney pulled off what was widely seen as a
business coup. Ending years of fruitless talks, Cheney arranged a
merger between Halliburton, the company he ran, and its chief
rival, Dresser Industries, creating the world's largest oil field
services and construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the chief executive of Halliburton, initiated the deal
while on a quail hunt with his counterpart from Dresser. The
negotiations that followed were so amicable, the companies
dispensed with the close scrutiny of each other's businesses that
is usually part of a merger, a Dresser official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some key Dresser executives quickly came to regret that
decision, present and former company officials say. They were
startled to learn after the deal closed that several of the major
projects negotiated by Cheney's management team were much less
healthy than they had appeared on the Halliburton's books and were
racking up significant losses. The newly merged company was hit
with several hundred million dollars of unexpected losses,
including an estimated $100 million on a single pipeline project in
South America begun on Cheney's watch, according to company
insiders and others in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresser merger was the biggest deal of Cheney's five years
at Halliburton and the losses that arose soon afterward were one of
several missteps in a business record that has become part of his
political resume since he became the Republican nominee for vice
president. The Bush campaign has defended his multimillion
retirement payment from Halliburton as fair compensation for a job
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people should be pleased they have a
vice-presidential nominee who has been successful in business,''
said Karen P. Hughes, communications director for the campaign of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But just how successful Cheney was as a chief executive is a
matter of considerable dispute, judging by a broad survey of his
record that included interviews with present and former company
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Some praised him for doubling the size of the company through
mergers and a growing government business that has made Halliburton
the nation's fifth-largest military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess Cheney's performance, Halliburton's vice
chairman, Donald Vaughn, said he deserved a ``clearly superior''
grade. ``Mr. Cheney was anything but a status quo man,'' Vaughn
said. ``He changed Halliburton and the popular judgment is he
changed it for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives, however, said Cheney failed to keep a
sufficiently tight rein on the company's aggressive pursuit of
overseas energy projects and road-building work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the last president of Dresser, acknowledged in an
interview that there had been ``overall surprise'' with the losses
that emerged after the Dresser merger. Most of them, he said, came
from contracts on the Halliburton side of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn blamed the reversals on an industry downturn caused by
plummeting oil prices in late 1998 and on the complexity of the
projects and said neither he nor his Dresser colleagues felt
deceived. ``No one was flimflammed,'' he said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's stock price, often regarded as a gauge of
executive performance, rose sharply during Cheney's early years at
the company, but it lagged its competitors in the final year and a
half of Cheney's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   There is a presumption in business that a chief executive is
broadly responsible for everything that happens in his company, for
better or worse. Last year, the company's board of directors
withheld bonuses from Cheney and his management team, which had
failed to meet the board's financial targets for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Lesar, the man Cheney picked to run the company's
day-to-day operations, said his boss was ``hands off, very much a
delegator'' whose main role at the company was cultivating clients
and setting strategic direction. ``He and I talked almost every
day,'' Lesar said. ``On major types of things, I would tell him
what the decisions were.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing Cheney's record at Halliburton, it is difficult to
say _ as it would be with any large corporation _ what specific
role the chief executive played in each initiative during his
tenure. For example, it is not clear how much of a hand Cheney had
in his management team's decision to start bidding more
aggressively on smaller-scale highway projects. The company won a
host of new contracts, but ran into difficulties in North Carolina
and Bush's home state of Texas for failing to meet deadlines for
completing the work. The projects were small by Halliburton
standards, $20 million or less, but a company insider said the
losses on several of them rose as high as $4 million to $5 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Texas eventually fined the company for its
tardiness and North Carolina officials went further, barring
Halliburton from bidding on road work in the state. The company's
travails in Texas are no secret: A partial list of the penalties,
totaling $359,450, is on the Web site of the Bush administration's
highway department.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar, who is now Halliburton's chief executive, said the
setbacks in the road work were ``part and parcel'' of a business
frequently punctuated by commercial disputes. ``It's absolutely not
an embarrassment,'' he said. Lesar acknowledged, however, that the
company, which expanded its road building under Cheney, is getting
out of the business of doing such small-scale projects.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said Cheney was frustrated in his desire to
phase out another Halliburton business: Its dealings with Libya
through its British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the arrangements were within the law. The
American embargo on Libya, imposed by President Ronald Reagan,
allows subsidiaries of U.S. companies to earn money in Libya and
send the profits home, provided the American parent company has no
role in managing the operations and no Americans are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar said Cheney told executives soon after he arrived that he
wanted to get out of Libya but was dissuaded by the argument that
this would harm the company's long-term relationship with its
customers. ``He had a fiduciary responsibility to his
stockholders,'' Lesar said.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's subsidiary maintains smaller, similar business
relationships in Iran and Iraq, said Vaughn, its vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Company insiders said that some of Halliburton's woes under
Cheney were common to corporate America in the late 1990s. The
company has had difficulties creating a unified computer system
across all of its diverse units. It is also still wrestling with a
companywide initiative, begun at the behest of Cheney, to set up
central management of purchasing, personnel and other
administrative functions. Several executives said the results from
this effort, which is costing several hundred million dollars, have
been disappointing thus far.
</P>
<P>
   The financial blemishes on Cheney's record at Halliburton are,
in large measure, a matter of public record. The company's public
financial reports disclosed its disappointing profits in the
highway construction business, without providing specific numbers.
And it said it had ``unusually high'' losses of nearly $180 million
on ``technically complex'' projects in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 81 years ago as an oil well service concern, Halliburton
has grown into a wide-ranging energy technology and construction
giant with revenues last year of $14.9 billion. Its 1962 merger
with Brown &AMP; Root, a Texas contracting company, brought in a wealth
of federal work that the company had won after financing the
political career of Lyndon B. Johnson. ``Brown &AMP; Root became an
industrial colossus thanks to Lyndon Johnson,'' said Robert A.
Caro, author of a multivolume biography of the former president.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Halliburton was still rebounding from the previous
decade's oil bust when its chairman, Thomas Cruikshank, went salmon
fishing for five days with Cheney. The former secretary of defense
had spent the previous two and a half years as a fellow with the
Washington research organization, American Enterprise Institute,
and had decided against a presidential bid. Cruikshank, who was
retiring, championed Cheney as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm often asked why I left politics and went to Halliburton,''
Cheney said in a speech last November at the Institute of Petroleum
in London, ``and I explain that I reached the point where I was
mean-spirited, short-tempered and intolerant of those who disagreed
with me and they said, `Hell, you'd make a great CEO,' so I went to
Texas and joined the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's fortunes were on the rebound in October 1995 when
Cheney arrived as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's stock had been an underperformer for much of the
late 1980s and early 1990s, but what the company called a round of
``strategic actions,'' including payroll cuts and a restructuring
of its basic businesses, substantially improved the company's
results beginning in 1992. For the three and a half years before
Cheney became chief executive at the beginning of October 1995,
Halliburton's stock rose 82 percent, well above the 65 percent gain
recorded by an index of companies in the oil service industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney moved to build on that success. He put Lesar, a top
executive at Halliburton's biggest subsidiary, in charge of daily
operations. Cheney was viewed, from the beginning, as a man who was
to use his worldwide contacts to produce new business. ``When we
brought Cheney in, it really wasn't to run operations,'' said his
predecessor, Cruikshank. ``It was to make the proper strategic
decisions, and to establish relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Cheney's first initiatives were well-regarded mergers that
helped the company master the new technologies reshaping the energy
industry. Halliburton acquired the Landmark Graphics Corp., which
develops software and data-management tools for the oil industry,
and the Numar Corp., which produces magnetic-resonance imaging
instruments for energy exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The company also scored some victories in Washington under
Cheney, winning a $1.1 billion Pentagon contract for support
operations in the Balkans. A Pentagon official said there was no
indication the former defense secretary had any role in sealing the
deal, which expanded a contract Halliburton has held since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's foray into road building went much less smoothly.
The company's Brown &AMP; Root unit had been doing road projects for
most of the 20th century and as Cheney took the reins, it hoped to
cash in on a nationwide boom in highway work.
</P>
<P>
   From November 1995 to November 1997, the company bid on 36
projects in North Carolina and won nine, totaling $100.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty aggressive undertaking by them,'' said Terry
Strickland, the contractual services engineer for the state
Department of Transportation in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   State officials in North Carolina say that while they were
pleased with the quality of Brown &AMP; Root's work, they quickly grew
frustrated at chronic, substantial delays. Of the nine projects
Brown &AMP; Root took on in North Carolina, three failed to meet
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   When problems first developed, the state pressured Brown &AMP; Root
to work faster by imposing daily and even hourly penalties, and
warned that it could be banned as a bidder. Finally, in a letter
dated Aug. 3, 1998, the state banished Brown &AMP; Root.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been unable to find any substantial reasons for the
unsatisfactory progress on these projects except for the lack of
effort that your company has put forth,'' wrote J.D. Goins, the
state chief engineer for operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's results in Texas have been mixed. It won an award
from a nationwide industry group for the design of Interstate 75,
the North Central Expressway, which it completed ahead of schedule.
But state officials say they levied $677,000 in penalties on
several road projects worth $143 million _ double the amount listed
on the highway department's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects on which Brown &AMP; Root faces penalties is in
the eastern Texas town of Lufkin, where the company is two months
behind schedule on a $16 million overpass job begun in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But better late than never, state officials said. ``We're just
hoping they finish this,'' said Cheryl Flood, the state Department
of Transportation resident engineer at Lufkin who is overseeing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with diminished profits and a string of headaches,
Halliburton decided to phase out its smaller-scale road work,
making it even harder to complete the remaining projects.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Gutierrez, a project superintendent at Brown &AMP; Root for
the work in Lufkin, said ``a lot of our key people left the
company,'' when it decided to exit the business. Gutierrez said he
has had to borrow managers from Halliburton's mining, pulp mill and
petrochemical operations. ``All of our jobs are pushed back, mainly
for lack of personnel, qualified people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Cheney went quail hunting in South Texas with
William E. Bradford, chairman and chief executive of Halliburton's
chief rival, Dresser Industries. The two companies, industry
leaders in oil services, had looked several times at the
possibility of merging but had not been able to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Out hunting, the two men agreed to reopen the talks. Within
weeks, the two companies planned to join forces, creating a new
company that would be headed by Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers typically include a process that is known in the
business world as ``due diligence,'' in which both companies look
hard at each other's pending projects to make sure their
assumptions about each other's value are based on solid numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the two chief executives felt so
comfortable with each other they decided this would not be
necessary, according to Vaughn, then Dresser's president.
</P>
<P>
   The deal closed in September 1998, and cultural clashes quickly
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most jarring, present and former executives said, was
over the arcane art of how to account for the profits produced by
long-term projects. Dresser's Kellogg unit was known in the
industry for its conservative approach and its executives prided
themselves on never having to erase profits once they were entered
in the ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton officials, the executives said, were quicker to log
the profits, relying on their ability to forecast how projects
would turn out. This stirred resentment among Dresser managers who
joined the new company. ``They would work you through the meat
grinder,'' said one former executive. ``They would always opt for
the most aggressive treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two management teams deepened in the months
after the merger with the discovery of large losses on some of the
Halliburton projects.
</P>
<P>
   Dresser's construction unit had forecast a banner year for 1999,
expecting profits of more than $200 million, including gains from
the Halliburton contracts. But a spate of unexpected losses after
the merger, mostly from Halliburton projects, shrunk those profits
to roughly $100 million, a former company official said.
</P>
<P>
   Other losses flowed from Halliburton's overseas contracts,
including a technically demanding project to build a natural gas
pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton won a leading role in the $2 billion project in
July, 1997. The company said Cheney had no role in winning the
contract or negotiating its terms.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which traversed a region of the Amazon known for
its heavy rains, ran into unexpected difficulties. Poor weather, a
strike and construction difficulties sent the costs soaring, just
as oil prices began to fall. Halliburton asked for more money but
the Brazilian oil giant, Petrobras, declined to pay. Industry
executives note that Halliburton's request for extra money came at
an awkward moment, just as oil prices were reaching their lowest
point in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton said it was still negotiating with Petrobras over
the contract. Lesar, the chief executive, declined to discuss the
amount of money at issue, but said all calculations of loss or
profit on deals like the Brazil pipeline are estimates until such
disputes are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, just three months after the merger,
Halliburton declared in a public filing that ``extraordinary
pressure'' from customers refusing to pay additional costs on
projects had forced it to take $60 million in losses. Present and
former company officials said the losses from overseas projects and
the highway work have continued to mount this year, and now total
more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The merger stirred up bitterness, as mergers often do, prompting
some Dresser executives to quit. At least three have sued the
company, charging that Halliburton reneged on promises of a
severance package.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar said the company met all its obligations to the executives
whose jobs were eliminated or scaled back after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawsuit by Paul T. Butzberger, former president of Dresser
Oil Tools, accuses Halliburton of repeatedly assuring him he would
be able to keep his options for 60,000 shares of stock after his
departure, and then refusing to honor those options.
</P>
<P>
   That decision stands in contrast to the board's treatment of
Cheney. Halliburton's board voted last month to allow him to keep
options for 400,000 shares, worth $6 million at Wednesday's price,
treating his departure as early retirement rather than a
resignation. It also allowed him to keep 140,000 shares of stock,
now worth $7.5 million, that it could have canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating a chief executive's record is as much an art as a
science. Vaughn, Halliburton's vice chairman, said Cheney should be
judged on the performance of the company's stock, a standard
benchmark. By that measure, Cheney's early years at Halliburton
were more successful than his later ones, when the company
performed less well than its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Cheney years as chief executive saw Halliburton
stock significantly underperform most stocks in its industry. From
the time he became chief executive through the announcement he was
leaving, Halliburton shares rose 110 percent, while the average oil
service company share price rose 158 percent and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, an index of large company stocks, was up 151 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Arvind Sanger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
Cheney did ``an averagely decent job as CEO. I don't think he did
an exceptional job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more comfortable talking about the big picture, not
the nitty gritty of the business,'' said Sanger. ``Deep down
inside, he's a politician at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cheney has a track record as chief executive that is mediocre
against the backdrop of American business, his candidacy is
nevertheless strongly supported by almost all of the executives who
worked with him, even those who disagreed with how he led the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney is a great man, very focused, and he stands for a
lot of the things I stand for,'' said one former executive who quit
in frustration over the company's post-merger culture. ``I just
couldn't stay in that environment,'' he said. ``Life is too
short.''

By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across an expanse of 20-odd years, the glistening pop of
Marshall Crenshaw still shines sweetly, music with smarts and hooks
and, wow, a beat you can even dance to sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's guitar-dominated, and it all starts with wanting to play
the guitar in the first place,'' Crenshaw said. ``It's like highly
nuanced, finely detailed, cool rock music, sort of, with really
good rhythms and just sort of adventurous and different sonic
textures from album to album, intelligent, groovy, passionate
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the album that first put Crenshaw on the pop firmament, his
eponymous debut augmented with several tracks, and a crackerjack
retrospective called ``This Is Easy: The Very Best of Marshall
Crenshaw,'' are hitting store shelves, while Crenshaw himself is
hitting the stage in a show tonight in Santa Monica's McCabe's
Guitar Shop.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been a chance for Crenshaw to review fruits of a
rewarding _ artistically if not always commercially _ career,
starting with that first album, which came out in 1982 to
overwhelmingly positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who really love that record,''
Crenshaw said. ``I'm pleased about that, because it's been a long
while now since I made it and it's stood a test of time. I really
love it. It did make a big impact in its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Crenshaw isn't entirely happy with his work on that
first effort, despite the hosannas it received (and continues to
garner _ Daily News reviewer Glenn Whipp gave the reissue a
highest-possible four stars this week).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raw and unformed as a singer, kind of groping vocally on
some of those tracks,'' he said. ``I have these criticisms of it,
but I'm fond of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Crenshaw was writing the songs for his first album,
he was ``kind of rediscovering and dealing with a lot of rock `n'
roll stuff I'd loved in my childhood,'' he said. ``I was really
listening to a lot of rockabilly and getting back into stuff I knew
during childhood and was getting back to it as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been working as the understudy of the John Lennon
character in ``Beatlemania,'' on both the national tour and in runs
in Los Angeles and San Francisco. And it is the Beatles and Buddy
Holly and some of the earlier rock that influenced his writing of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   He took the big, open sounds and smacking rhythms of that music
and tried to adapt them to a more modern context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the time I was getting there, I think,'' he said. ``I
had this real set idea of song structure, just bam-bam-bam and no
wasted motion. I did that for a while, but after about 20 songs
within those parameters, I had to bag it and throw away the rule
book.''
</P>
<P>
   With his second album, ``Field Day,'' he began exploring
different approaches, not always to the glee of fans he'd collected
with his debut. ``Field Day'' still had a couple of songs left over
from his earlier songwriting phase, including the transcendent
``Whenever You're on My Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``For Her Love,'' another leftover of that initial
songwriting rush, ``really felt like I had to force it,'' Crenshaw
said. So he began trying other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could compose melodies really easily, and could go as deep
emotionally with (lyrics) as I could and stretch out,'' Crenshaw
said. ``That was the direction I went in 'Field Day.' I really
caught a ton of (grief) from people for the way my second album
sounded. But it was just a really great representation of my tastes
then.''
</P>
<P>
   He recorded five albums for Warner Bros. and another for MCA,
put out a collection of demos, a live album and two more recent
studio albums for the independent Razor &AMP; Tie.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he's played with artists such as Don Dixon, the
BoDeans and Was (Not Was); had his songs covered by artists as
diverse as Bette Midler and the Gin Blossoms; acted in ``Peggy Sue
Got Married'' and as Buddy Holly in ``La Bamba''; and helped put
together a book of good and bad rock movies called ``Hollywood Rock
&AMP; Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 46, Crenshaw said the best-of collection, which Rhino is
also releasing, is another source of great pride, a chance for even
him to look back on his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually got really excited about it when it was all
mastered,'' Crenshaw said. ``I got my reference CD and listened to
it on a long plane ride home. I was just happy to hear it. It's a
really good body of work. I don't listen to my stuff, and I forget
what it sounds like. But there's a lot of different textures and
tracks as you go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, with two children less than 4 years old and a place
in New York City, he leads a very different life than in the
knock-around years before he finally got serious about songwriting
in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being here, being back in the city, I'm taking in a lot
of information, and different kinds of information,'' Crenshaw
said. ``Kids change what I listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after reading that some kinds of music can improve
learning skills for young children, he started playing more jazz
and orchestral music, especially great pianists such as Bill Evans
and Fats Waller.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he'll always be a rocker, with none of the classical
and operatic pretensions of quasi-contemporary pop craftsmen such
as Paul McCartney, Pete Townshend, Joe Jackson and Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really drawn in that direction,'' Crenshaw said. ``The
first thing I always deal with when I write songs is the rhythm:
What's the tempo, what's the groove, what's the feel?''
</P>
<P>
   The past couple of years, he's been touring a lot on the East
Coast, often doing solo shows because he is ``really big on the
simplicity of the solo stuff. I don't have to cut any checks (for
other musicians). I don't have to worry about who's going to be the
bass player that night.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's pretty content, Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense of satisfaction now about it,'' Crenshaw said.
``Until I did this `Best of,' I had this ambivalence about the
records I've made. But now I just sort feel like it's a good body
of work. It's all kind of resolved for me at this point.'' &QL;

IF ELEANOR WERE TELEVISION, SHE'D BE PRIME TIME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her first dispatch arrived near midnight on a Sunday, a rambling
voice-mail message about faith and destiny and life being what one
does with blown opportunities and sucker punches strong enough to
disorient the senses. Not until the end of the message was there a
hint of Eleanor's utter disgust over my column about the weekly
sameness of ``Touched By an Angel,'' what I called its superficial
messages of hope and triumph, and my growing annoyance with the
character played by Della Reese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Systematically flawed'' was the way Eleanor described the
column's contents, picking off each paragraph like a sharpshooter
at a firing range. Convinced we'd viewed totally different shows,
she asked, in a straightforward manner: ``Are you mentally stable?
Who in their right mind doesn't like Della Reese?''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, I thought Eleanor was a midnight caller, those
readers who call late so they miss you and thereby get what they
truly want: a one-sided conversation with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   How so untrue. Eleanor called again one morning on another
matter, then a few days later, and in the early evening a week
after that. Our conversations _ or verbal duels or testimonials _
would settle into a routine of two, three times a week, usually at
midday, after Eleanor's two eggs, scrambled, with toast and coffee,
and definitely after ``The View.'' (''I wish that chubby Star Jones
would get a man and shut her trap.'') Sometimes we'd talk five days
a week, depending on my output and how systematically flawed those
stories were.
</P>
<P>
   In due time, the conversations became less confrontational, more
passionate than heated _ and always interesting, to the point, and
edifying. We talked race, gender, children, sports, politics and
even compared the merits of Target, Kmart and Wal-Mart. We were
close on some issues, far apart on many others, a byproduct of two
lives shaped from very different molds. I liked her because she
didn't care about agreeing with me.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor often called herself a typical reader, although I always
told her that such a person does not exist. There is no ``typical''
reader, but there are people who pick up the paper every day who
know what they want out of it and who are less than thrilled when
they don't find it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who read TV columns are fanatics and cynics, the curious
and the bored; they are even people who sit and watch TV only when
they're too tired to think.
</P>
<P>
   There's the housewife in Arlington with a workaholic husband.
She simply likes to talk around 2 p.m., when house cleaning is done
and dinner is started and boredom has set in. There's the retiree
from Southlake, married 52 years to a man whom she has never seen
watch a TV program from beginning to end. There's the 16-year-old
from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth who thinks her
boyfriend is lazy and wonders if dating outside her race is social
suicide. There's the 20-year-old Texas Christian University student
who rewrites episodes of ``Frasier,'' then recites them over the
phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that was a good one _ well-thought out, well-researched,
well-written,'' Eleanor would sometimes say to me. Or: ``Boy, did
you miss the boat on that one. Not feeling well, are we?''
</P>
<P>
   Hers were often the rants of a demanding viewer and reader, so
much a lover of television that the squandering of its promise and
power angered her. She was smart and sharp and frustratingly blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' I said to her one day. ``You're telling me
that it's OK for networks to totally disregard viewers over 50?''
</P>
<P>
   She told me that it was, that it was a business decision, that
advertisers are right when they say older viewers are set in their
ways and should therefore be ignored, and that few viewers want to
watch ``old folks like us'' play TV characters. Eleanor's
assessment was built on the notion that young people can't relate
to older characters and older viewers don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never paid much attention to commercials or print
advertisements; she used the same product for the past 20 years as
long as it was available,'' Sadie, her youngest daughter, said the
other day. ``Same with TV shows. I don't think she's ever missed an
episode of `Law &AMP; Order.' '' Sadie told me that early life for
Eleanor was a two-room shack outside Greenville, S.C., a place kept
clean with old rags soaked in water pumped from a nearby well.
Eleanor came to TV late, after her marriage to Arthur, an insurance
executive, who died 10 years ago in a boating accident. Eleanor
never worked outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur's job brought them to Fort Worth, where they raised three
girls and a boy, now all grown.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie says Eleanor's life became centered on TV after she
developed breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worried at first, but felt relieved, in a strange way, that
she was tied to something like TV programs,'' Sadie says. ``We'd
hear her talk out loud, `Oh, gotta call that Ken about this,' like
it had become her duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Remission brought more calls from Eleanor during the beginning
of last season. She fell for ``Once and Again,'' about
40-somethings navigating divorce, and the White House drama ``The
West Wing,'' which she called ``hokey'' but added, ``Oh, that
Martin Sheen is some looker.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite show was the '60s classic ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show.'' Her least favorite was ``Diagnosis Murder,'' Which made
sense, considering her respect for Van Dyke's talent.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor faded with the season last spring, as cancer returned
and series finales were being aired. The cancer had spread to her
lungs and other parts of her body. She died a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard the news, I thought of our last conversation, a
brief one concerning a column I'd written about the so-called
family hour. She phoned to say there was never such a thing, that
TV networks had always aired objectionable material at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor cut the conversation short, saying she was tired and
needed to get back to her tube.
</P>
<P>
   She'd missed ``Law &AMP; Order'' the night before but had had a
neighbor tape it. ``Hear that?'' she said of the humming sound
vibrating from her old VCR. ``Time to go. You be blessed, you
hear?''

ORDER'

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ Few directors in the 1960s and '70s rivaled
Arthur Penn. His Broadway shows included ``Two for the Seesaw,''
``The Miracle Worker,'' ``Toys in the Attic'' and ``All the Way
Home.'' His work in Hollywood was equally celebrated, with
inventive movies like ``Alice's Restaurant,'' ``Little Big Man,''
``The Miracle Worker'' and the enduring classic ``Bonnie and
Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the mid-'80s Penn's film career seemed to shrink. A bad
experience or two in Hollywood, his decision to live in New York
and not Los Angeles and, most important, the lack of interest among
studios in his socially aware films soured Penn on the movie
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating and more than a little humiliating,'' said
the trim 77-year-old director, who seems a decade younger. His more
recent experience in the theater was not much better. Penn said he
had found that Broadway seemed more hospitable to blockbuster
musicals than to serious drama.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a shock, Penn said, when Dick Wolf, creator of NBC's
``Law and Order'' and one of television's foremost producers, asked
the director to dinner in New York and offered him the job of
executive producer on that show. Penn's pay for the season is
likely to top $1 million, talent agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that television is flagrant in its discrimination against
writers and producers over 50, Wolf's decision to appoint Penn is a
breakthrough for the elderly. ``I think there's this vast pool of
guys who have had incredible careers and are much more talented
than a lot of people who are having movies green-lit right how,''
Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the writing staff on ``Law and Order'' is 46,
he said. ``That's ancient on television,'' said Wolf, 53. ``But I'm
doing dramas, not `Friends.' For serious writing, miles on the
odometer are beneficial.'' (For the second season in a row, Wolf is
also using 69-year-old Ted Kotcheff, director of ``North Dallas
40,'' as executive producer of NBC's ``Law and Order: Special
Victims Unit.'')
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Penn, who has made a handful of television
films, will oversee the creation of each episode of ``Law and
Order,'' working mostly with the directors and actors. Penn's son,
Matthew Penn, is one of the directors on the show, which revolves
around the police and a district attorney's office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf recalled, ``When Ed Sherin, who had been doing this job for
seven years, decided to leave, it was, like, who do you get to
replace someone who was that integral to the daily running and
daily success of that show?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said that Lewis Gould, one of the show's producers, came to
him and said, ``You know who Matt's Dad is _ Arthur Penn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Wow, what a great idea,''' Wolf continued. ``So I
had dinner with him, and when we had coffee I said to him, `Do you
want to run ``Law and Order''?' And he said yes. As you can tell,
it was a very complicated negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said that what appealed to him about Penn was his obvious
experience and talent working with stage actors. The cast of ``Law
and Order'' includes such theater actors as Sam Waterston, Jerry
Orbach and, starting in the fall, Dianne Wiest. (She will replace
Steven Hill, who played a district attorney.)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Wolf said, Penn's signature in his early television
movies, as well as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and other films, was
focusing a sociological lens on various moments in American
history. ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' he said, was not merely a film about
some lovers on a crime spree, but a film about the Depression.
``His pictures operate on two levels _ and we needed that for this
show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn described his role on ``Law and Order'' as serving, in a
sense, as a mentor to the show's directors. Directing episodes has
no interest for him, Penn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather be available to the young directors and be able
to talk to them about the possibilities,'' he said. ``A lot of
directors in television have come up through the technical ranks.
They have all the technical skills in the world. They're not all
that familiar with actors. And on `Law and Order' you have
wonderful racehorsy actors like Sam Waterston, Jerry Orbach and,
now, Dianne Wiest.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn, who talked about his new job in a breakfast interview at
the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, has lived for decades with
his wife, Peggy, a therapist, in a duplex apartment on Central Park
West and in Stockbridge, Mass. Aside from their son, they have a
daughter, Molly, a former arts administrator at Lincoln Center, and
four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Penn said he had always considered himself closer to the theater
than films. His career began in the 1950s in live television, but
his only television work in recent years was directing a drama,
``Inside,'' about apartheid in South Africa, for the Showtime cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   Although his words are shaded in bitterness when he talks about
the movie business, Penn spoke quietly and with some humor. Of the
film studios, he said, ``I didn't particularly like what they are
doing, so it was a very amicable divorce in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged at the notion of meeting studio executives in their
20s and 30s and recalled the famous Hollywood anecdote about the
time that Fred Zinnemann, the director of ``From Here to
Eternity,'' ``The Nun's Story,'' ``A Man for All Seasons'' and
other classics, had a meeting with a young studio executive.
</P>
<P>
   The executive said, ``So Zinnemann, what have you done?'' The
director responded, ``What have you done?''
</P>
<P>
   Penn laughed briefly. ``That's the way it is.'' But then he
added: ``In a sense that's how I was responded to out here. I
hadn't ever been part of the Hollywood community, so I didn't have
all these friendships with movie stars who are getting pictures
made. I wasn't Tom Cruise's buddy or Matt Damon's buddy. Not to
single them out. But there's a kind of buddy relationship that goes
on now in terms of getting pictures made.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn still seemed unsettled by his experience on the 1966
western ``The Chase,'' with Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda and Robert
Redford. While Penn was rehearsing the play ``Wait Until Dark'' on
Broadway, the film's producer, Sam Spiegel, took over the editing
of ``The Chase'' in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty abusive experience for a lot of people,'' Penn
recalled. ``I really lost my appetite for movies for quite a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he has taught at Yale and periodically directed
films and plays. For the past six years he has been president of
the Actors Studio in New York, where he has developed a successful
graduate program.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway, he feels, is too dependent on mega-musicals like
``Cats'' and ``Saigon,'' with the result that talented writers have
turned elsewhere. ``The vigor of the playwrights is somewhere
off-Broadway now,'' he said. ``And what's happened is a whole
generation has bypassed New York and theater and come out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn's film work also includes ``The Left-Handed Gun'' (1958),
``Mickey One'' (1965), ``Night Moves'' (1975), ``The Missouri
Breaks'' (1976) and ``Four Friends'' (1981).
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty, who starred in ``Mickey One'' as well as ``Bonnie
and Clyde,'' said of Penn, ``He has the soul of an artist.'' He
added, ``His intelligence is the factor that resonates most
strongly, his intelligence and a lack of interest in pandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn acknowledged that some of his later films were
disappointments and that studios lost interest in the social topics
that fascinated him. ``In each instance there was a certain social
comment about conditions that were prevalent at the time,'' he
said. ``There doesn't seem to be that kind of social concern now.''
Instead, he said, he sees the country as ``just sort of without
issues.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Penn's most enduring film _ and one that redefined
crime movies with, among other techniques, its use of slow motion _
was ``Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967), about the Depression-era bank
robbers. The film, which starred Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Gene Hackman
and Michael J. Pollard, almost died after it was released. Bosley
Crowther, writing in The New York Times, said it was ``as pointless
as it is lacking in taste.'' Newsweek called it ``a squalid
shoot-'em-up.'' But a rave review by Pauline Kael in The New Yorker
and a drumroll of interest among college students turned the film
into a cultural phenomenon. ``Time magazine panned the movie in a
brief review and five months later put it on the cover,'' Beatty
said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn recalled with a laugh how Beatty, as producer of the film,
manipulated Jack Warner, the studio chief, into supporting it.
``Jack Warner didn't like the film, couldn't figure it out at
all,'' Penn said. ``Warren was very clever. He told him that the
film was an hommage to the gangster films of Warner's past. And
Jack Warner said, `What's an hommage?'''

FOX HOPES TO SEE MORE AND BETTER-TRAINED MEXICANS MIGRATE TO U.S.

<P>
   CORONEO, Mexico _ For eight hours each day, in a desolate
warehouse with stone walls, some 12 men and a couple of women in
this village of squat adobe houses learn to build furniture with
circular saws and power drills.
</P>
<P>
   The government pays for the training and gives each aspiring
carpenter a small stipend, but the goal is not to prepare them for
scarce and poorly paid jobs at home. It is to give them skills they
can use when they migrate _ usually illegally _ to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The program is one of many begun here in the central Mexican
state of Guanajuato by the former governor, Vicente Fox, who is
making his first visit to Washington on Thursday since being
elected president in a landmark victory in June.
</P>
<P>
   Fox plans to use his informal meetings with President Clinton
and the two U.S. presidential candidates _ Vice President Al Gore
and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas _ to encourage them to join in his
vision of a sea change in relations along the 2,000-mile border, in
particular one more open to the flow of Mexican laborers. And as he
does so, the voices of those workers he has helped train in his
home state will echo in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has many working hands and America has many jobs,''
said Claudio Torres Resendiz, 33, one of those being trained in
Coroneo. ``We do the work they need, and they pay us the money we
need to take care of our families. Both sides benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have so far been less than enthusiastic about
Fox's idea. And his job-training programs, like the one here, have
been criticized both within and outside Mexico as encouraging the
exodus of Mexican laborers for menial jobs in the United States.
Some 340,000 already migrate each year.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox defends his initiatives _ which mostly offer training to
Mexicans in low-skill positions as landscapers, construction
workers, factory workers and maids _ as a pragmatic way to increase
the skills and the earning potential of workers that Mexico simply
cannot sustain.
</P>
<P>
   A straight-talking son of ranchers and a former business
executive who focuses on the bottom-line, Fox considers the labor
force one of his nation's proudest and most lucrative assets. His
plans for the border, he says, would force the United States to
face up to its need for Mexican workers, rather than treating the
migrants' contributions to the American economy as a kind of dirty
economic secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the people, and people are an asset'' Fox said in an
interview at his family ranch in the state of Guanajuato, before
leaving for the United States. ``I know many people in the United
States want to see people as a burden, as a problem, but people are
an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we are going to invest and invest heavily in
people,'' the president-elect went on. ``If we have talented
people, not only will Mexico progress, the United States will
benefit and progress.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When asked to explain his visions for an open border and better
work conditions for migrants, the typically practical Fox turns
suddenly passionate and casts back to life here in his home state
of Guanajuato. It is the state with Mexico's third-highest rate of
migration to the United States. During various seasons of the year,
isolated villages almost completely abandoned by able-bodied men
and women as they go to the United States to work.
</P>
<P>
   The carpentry training program Fox began here is far from
cutting edge. Students work primarily with outdated tools and learn
the most rudimentary techniques while assembling tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   But for workers like Torres, who was one of those training here
and has worked illegally on peanut and cotton farms in Mississippi
for the last 15 years, the introductory workshop not only means the
chance to make more money abroad, it will allow him to seek work
with his head held high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working in the fields is very hard, and the pay is getting
worse,'' he said. ``But I did not have the chance to finish high
school, I had to take whatever work I could get. I am trying to
better myself so I do not have to take that humiliation anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign for president, Fox was widely criticized for
a private initiative that has sent some 300 men from Guanajuato to
work legally as landscapers on golf courses in Michigan over the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular promises of former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, as he negotiated the North American Free Trade
Agreement with the United States and Canada, was that Mexico would
strive to increase exports of products, not people. But the
benefits of NAFTA have been felt less among Mexico's 40 million
poor, and the number of Mexican immigrants to the United States has
not significantly declined.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his predecessors, Fox publicly accepts his
country's inability to offer its workers the kinds of salaries and
living conditions as those offered in the United States. Until his
administration is able to begin narrowing wage gap _ he has pledged
annual economic growth of 7 percent and to create 1.35 million new
jobs each year _ Fox wants more Mexican workers to be able to cross
the border without violence and harassment. And he wants to make it
easier for immigrants to invest more of their earnings from abroad
back home.
</P>
<P>
   An example of that kind of economic return stands at the
entrance of a village called Timbinal, where Napa Valley vineyard
workers funded the construction of a small apparel factory to
employ women who stay behind.
</P>
<P>
   One of the workers, Rosa Maria Sierra Lopez, 21, said her job at
the plant was the first thing in her life that made her feel
useful. But its not enough to make up for the pain that the
northern migration inflicts on her town and her home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men there, she said, spend more time in the United
States than they do at home. And each year, her 52-year-old father
risks his life by illegally crossing the United States border to
work in apple orchards in the American Northwest. It's a journey
he's made, Sierra said, since before she was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for us to see him go,'' she said, pressing her
eyes closed to hold back tears. ``It's hard for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Fox's talk of opening the border to increased legal
migration has been met mostly with polite skepticism from officials
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And while analysts consider Fox's trip to be the beginning of a
long campaign _ one that Fox himself predicts could take 30 years _
none dismissed the president-elect's ideas as impossible. Labor
groups as well as immigrant activists have joined together to
support legislation proposed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
that would legalize some 1.1 million undocumented residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the U.S. hear open border and they panic,'' said
Pamela Falk, a former staff director of the Western Hemisphere
Subcommittee in the House of Representatives. ``That's not what
he's trying to do. He's trying to adjust the laws to fit the
reality in a way that would be good for the American economy and
for Mexican workers.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bailey, director of the Mexico Project at Georgetown
University said: ``At first I thought Fox was pushing a nonstarter.
But my second reaction was that what he says is really interesting.
And even though he may not get everything he wants, he will get a
new conversation started.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Rojas, 65, doubts he'll see the day when the men in his
native La Calera will stop leaving their families to work in the
United States. He did it for 25 years _ most of that time as an
undocumented worker _ and his sinuses are still choked from his
work at an Illinois lumber company.
</P>
<P>
   He has retired to the sprawling house he built with his life's
earnings. There are two cars and a tractor parked inside a huge
shed in the back and the garden is full of fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he has, he said, comes from his labor in the United
States. Now it's his sons who work up north. One earned legal
status under a broad amnesty passed by Congress in 1986; the other
has a seasonal permit to work at a golf course in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Like all fathers, he's happy to see that his sons do not have to
endure the insecurity and shame of living illegally in the United
States. Still, Rojas said, the advances are bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico, the choices are you can either abandon your
children to make money to take care of them, or you can stay with
you children and watch them live in misery,'' he said. ``Poverty
makes us leave our families. I want President Fox to create jobs,
jobs that are well-paid, so that our families can stay together.''

IN ADDRESS TO NATION, PUTIN TRIES TO CURB CRITICISM OF KURSK
DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to add new text to end of original article with details of
salvage efforts) 
(See also RUSSIA-ASSESS) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russia grieved for 118 seamen lost in the remains of
the submarine Kursk, President Vladimir Putin moved decisively to
contain the incident's political impact, going on national
television Wednesday night to take responsibility for what some
Russians call a badly botched response.
</P>
<P>
   In an abruptly scheduled half-hour interview on the
state-controlled television network RTR, Putin said a family member
of a submarine crewman had told him that the sinking was his cross
to bear as president, and that ``this person was right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the fact that I have been in office in the Kremlin
a little over 100 days, I feel the full sense of guilt and
responsibility for this crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said that Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and the commander
of the navy's northern fleet had offered their resignations on
Tuesday and that they had been rejected, at least until experts
found out what caused the submarine to explode and plunge to the
Barents Sea floor just before midnight on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get an objective picture of the reasons for this
tragedy,'' Putin said. ``Only after that can we make some
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he broadly suggested that the tortuous
pace of the military's rescue effort, and his own seeming
diffidence at the start of the incident, played no role in the
sailors' deaths because they were doomed from the moment the
submarine went down.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's somber mea culpa and explanation were clearly intended
to quell criticism, which continued Wednesday even after he
returned from a tightly scripted visit to the Arctic town of
Vidyayevo to offer condolences to the families of the perished
sailors.
</P>
<P>
   The military has come under scathing attack for its inability to
pry open the submarine in a week of attempts, especially after a
crew of Norwegian and British deep-sea divers arrived and opened
the submarine's damaged hatch with apparent ease.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Putin has been criticized for staying on vacation
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, once the preserve of senior
Communist Party officials, for days after one of modern Russia's
worst military fiascos began to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   The affair has dented Putin's once-bulletproof reputation for
competence and efficiency, though it is not clear whether the
damage is severe or lasting. A poll of 1,574 people released on
Wednesday by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center concluded that
one in five respondents attribute the incident to the Kremlin's
poor control of the military.
</P>
<P>
   A second poll suggested that Putin's popularity had also
slipped, but that almost two in three Russians still approved of
his performance, a level most politicians would envy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Putin insisted that it was premature to
accuse the military of incompetence, and that a naval rescue effort
began ``the moment contact with the submarine was lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, Norway's offer to help in the rescue was
immediately accepted, at least in principle, and that the
much-criticized two-day delay in sending Norwegian divers to the
site was dictated by unnamed ``technical parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   One question that Putin said investigators would explore is why
the Russian navy was unable to mount the type of deep-sea diving
operation that Norway employed to open the hatch. Russia is not
capable of sending divers to the 350-foot depth at which the Kursk
now lies.
</P>
<P>
   While that alone would not have saved any crewmen, he said,
investigators need to study why the Russian navy was not prepared
to rescue sailors trapped in one of its own submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Wednesday that Putin had sent the head of the
Federal Security Service _ the domestic successor to the KGB _ and
the government's general prosecutor to Murmansk, near the Kursk's
home port of Severomorsk, to oversee a preliminary criminal
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Although no evidence of a crime exists, military officials
continued to insist Wednesday that the most likely cause of the
Kursk's sinking was a collision with an unidentified foreign vessel
that they claim to have detected with sonar on the sea floor near
the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   A senior military official, quoted anonymously by the
semiofficial Interfax news service, said Wednesday that the navy
had dispatched three ships to scour the seabed off the Kola
Peninsula for pieces of a second vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Russian sources have variously hinted that a U.S. or British
ship might have been involved in the incident, but both nations
have flatly denied any role.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Putin had set aside for grieving over the naval
disaster, it was apparent Wednesday that the Kursk's sinking has
hit typically stoic Russians with unusual force. The Kursk incident
continues to consume newspapers and television news broadcasts,
which were filled Wednesday with somber music and roll calls of the
dead, and both local governments and individuals were massing
donations for the seamen's survivors. Flags everywhere were strung
at half staff.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin promised the families more than a dozen years of
military pay to compensate for their loss, the total pay will
amount to only about $7,000 per family, and charitable efforts to
increase that figure have sprung up across the country. In
Rostov-on-Don, Russian television reported, the government pledged
30,000 rubles, or about $1,100 per family, to the survivors of two
crewmen who had lived there.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Patriarch Alexei, the leader of the Russian Orthodox
Church, led a service for the crewmen in which he urged the nation
to put aside finger-pointing and unite around the families of the
crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on you today to come together before the face of the
common calamity,'' he said, ``not to split, not to look for the
guilty, not to draw fast conclusions, but to accept what happened
as our common cross. And the cross, no matter what it can be, has
to be carried.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only in Vidyayevo were observances postponed _ at the families'
request _ until the bodies of the Kursk's crew are brought home for
burial. When that might be was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   With the sailors' fate now sealed, officials here and in Norway
began on Wednesday to address the knotty questions of whether and
when the huge submarine, now a grave for its crew and for two
nuclear reactors, can be safely raised from the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in both countries agreed on Wednesday that the two
reactors, which were shut down in the Kursk's plunge to the seabed,
have not leaked radiation into the surrounding waters. But
environmentalists likened the submarine to a radioactive time bomb,
warning that sooner or later, a catastrophic leak was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some officials studying ways to salvage the
Kursk said any operation to raise the damaged submarine holds some
risk that the vessel would break apart as it rose to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the families pressed the government to recover the bodies
immediately, before the severe Arctic winter sets in in a few
weeks, and Russian officials were considering plans to cut holes in
the submarine to remove the dead.

 &HT;    Bush to visit black New Orleans school
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will step onto
traditionally Democratic terrain today, a historically black
college campus in New Orleans, as he is grappling with problems at
similar institutions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will campaign at Dillard University, a private college
whose president is Michael Lomax. Lomax came from Atlanta where he
was the Fulton County commission chairman. The governor will end
his day in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the stop at Dillard has symbolic value in a state that
both parties are targeting in the presidential election. His
appearance in front of a predominantly black audience is part of an
ongoing effort to portray his campaign as centrist and focused on
winning votes of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton staged a rally on the Dillard campus in the
weeks before his election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's critics complain that he has only recently become
interested in the conditions at his state's two historically black
public colleges, Texas Southern University in Houston and Prairie
View A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   The schools have been chronically short-changed by state
officials, a problem that predates Bush's administration and that
also crosses party lines, said M. Christopher Smith, an expert on
historically black colleges at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Department of Education civil rights
division said the state may still be discriminating against those
schools. Civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
protested the funding disparities in March.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Bush-appointed Texas Higher Education Coordinating
Board, which sets policy for public colleges, recommended giving
the black colleges an extra $380 million over 20 years, mostly for
new construction.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Bush signed an agreement with federal officials to
enhance education at the schools, including making them more
attractive to white students without compromising their historic
character.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he doubts Bush would have committed to making changes
without the pressure of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's not genuine, his new outreach,'' Smith
said. ``I'm saying it certainly is suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, was more
blunt. Bush's interest in black colleges is part of ``an
election-year conversion'' after years of neglect, Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not make higher education a priority in Texas by his
own admission and that has hurt historically black colleges,''
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign spokesman, disputed Hattaway's
comments. ``That's typical partisan attack rhetoric,'' Sullivan
said. ``Governor Bush has helped make those schools more
accessible, more affordable and more academically excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism also does not take into account Bush's actions
prior to his signing the agreement, said Don Brown, the Texas
commissioner of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had earlier made significant changes on Texas Southern's
Board of Regents, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush and his aides pushed for including goals in the
agreement with the Education Department that will allow the state
to measure its progress every two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just have to disagree that this is about any kind of
conversion,'' said Brown, who has worked in Republican and
Democratic administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving aside the presidential politics, Lomax said he is
delighted to be ``on the radar screens'' of Republican politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very dependent on the federal government for important
financial support and you can't get that without being
bipartisan,'' said Lomax, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   He was among 75 presidents of black colleges who met this year
with Republican congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas situation is far from resolved. The Higher Education
Board is supposed to adopt a final plan in October, which then will
go to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If he signs off, which is expected, the Texas legislature will
have to find the money in the state budget when it meets in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Pierce, the deputy assistant education secretary for
civil rights, said he is confident that Texas will honor the
commitment made by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me say this. It's one thing to sign a commitment,''
Pierce said. ``It's another thing to actually execute it.''

DISCOURAGING FINDING ON ESTROGEN THERAPY AND HEART DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif., Mass., Md.)  By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study being published Thursday has found that estrogen
replacement therapy does nothing to slow the progression of heart
disease in women whose arteries are already partially blocked.
</P>
<P>
   But another study, in the same issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine, cites the hormone therapy as a factor _ along with
diet and exercise _ in the decline of heart disease among women who
do not smoke. An editorial accompanying the studies says that women
will not know whether hormone therapy protects the heart until
larger studies are completed in several years.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10 million American women take estrogen replacement
therapy; Premarin, an estrogen made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories,
is the nation's best-selling prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   The drug was approved for the treatment of menopausal symptoms,
like hot flashes, and for the management of osteoporosis, but there
had also been a widespread belief that the drug would protect
against heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Heart
disease is rare among premenopausal women, but its incidence begins
rising in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   In the first study, which involved 309 women, investigators
injected women's coronary arteries with a dye and then examined the
arteries with X-rays. They found that the women's arteries
gradually narrowed as the study progressed, whether or not they
took estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Their results, experts say, complement those of another recent
study that found that estrogen replacement therapy did not reduce
heart attacks in women who already had heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David M. Herrington, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at Wake
Forest University School of Medicine and the lead author of the
artery study, said he began the work in hopes of confirming the
belief that estrogen would help women with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier study, called HERS, had already shown discouraging
results, but some researchers wondered whether that might have been
because the women in it took either a combination of estrogen and
methoxyprogesterone, or a placebo. Some experts proposed that if
the women took estrogen alone, the hormone would protect their
hearts. So the women in Herrington's study were randomly assigned
to take estrogen alone, estrogen plus methoxyprogesterone or a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still hopeful that there would be an underlying effect
on the progression of atherosclerosis,'' Herrington said. Now, he
said, he thinks the question has been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this study coupled with the HERS trial is a pretty
compelling combination of evidence showing that estrogen
replacement therapy is not effective in reducing the risk for heart
attacks or heart disease deaths or for slowing the disease that's
responsible for those heart attacks in women with established heart
disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its very convincing that after three years in a well
designed study there was no evidence of benefit,'' said Dr.
Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a professor of family and preventive
medicine at the University of California in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But these studies do not address the question of whether hormone
therapy at menopause can prevent the development of heart disease
in women who do not yet have it. Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the
scientific director for clinical research at the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute, said she was withholding judgment on the
issue of the hormone therapy and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the average age of the women in the study of
artery narrowing was 65 and that they had entered menopause 23
years earlier. ``Would hormone replacement therapy possibly be more
effective if it was initiated at the onset of menopause?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the women were followed for only three
years. ``It may be that protective effects may be apparent only
years later,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most experts said, the data were not encouraging
and added that a new study of 25,000 women without heart disease
was also finding hints that estrogen might not help their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   In April, directors of that study, known as the Women's Health
Initiative, informed participants that those taking estrogen were
having slightly more heart attacks than those taking a placebo,
possibly because of estrogen's well-known proclivity to encourage
blood clots in susceptible women.
</P>
<P>
   The finding reminded scientists of data from the HERS study,
which looked for heart attacks in women who already had heart
disease. There, too, the women taking estrogen initially had more
heart attacks, but later the incidence of heart attacks declined so
that, in the end, estrogen had no effect on heart attack incidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at
the University of California at San Francisco, said the preliminary
results from the Women's Health Initiative made it statistically
unlikely that hormone replacement therapy would turn out to prevent
heart disease. ``It's very unlikely in my mind that they will ever
be able to show an overall benefit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a study to be published Thursday alongside
Herrington's work on artery narrowing attributed a reduction in
heart disease among women in part to hormone replacement therapy.
While it was not a randomized trial _ the women chose to take
estrogen or not to take it _ it was huge. Dr. Walter C. Willett of
Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues followed 85,941
female nurses for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   But epidemiologists said that such studies could be misleading.
And, in fact, observational studies had previously indicated that
estrogen could slow the progress of heart disease, making it all
the more surprising when it did not and stunning some who believed
in the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Grady was so convinced by observational studies on
estrogen's benefits and by biological reasons it might prevent
heart disease that she helped write guidelines for the American
College of Physicians recommending that women at high risk for
heart disease take the drug. Now, she says, studies like the one
today have convinced her that that advice is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the elements were in place for hormone replacement therapy
to prevent heart disease,'' Grady said. ``Now it's starting to look
like it won't. It's kind of staggering for us epidemiologists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, medical experts said, women should rely on
established methods of heart disease prevention, like keeping their
cholesterol and blood pressure low, eating healthy diets,
exercising and staying away from cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For primary prevention, lifestyle modification definitely
works,'' Nabel said.

ANALYSIS: HINTS OF POLITICAL EVOLUTION IN AFTERMATH OF SUBMARINE
CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 3rd graf to clarify; subs 2nd graf to replace `to comfort'
with `for') 
(See also RUSSIA-SUBMARINE) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a public confession Wednesday night by President
Vladimir Putin, who said he feels ``responsibility and guilt'' for
the loss of the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk, Russia's political
evolution seems to be taking a new kind of post-Soviet turn.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders are offering to resign. The government and
the private sector are competing to raise millions of dollars for
the families of the Kursk's crew. The airwaves are ringing with mea
culpas from the haughty admirals of the once mighty Red Banner
Fleet of the north.
</P>
<P>
   And on the surface of the Barents Sea, Russia for the first time
cracked open the door to Norwegian and British seamen and asked
them to enter the inner sanctum of a powerful Cold War leviathan
named Kursk and to help retrieve 118 sons of the lost Soviet
empire.
</P>
<P>
   It did not start out that way.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kursk exploded and crashed to the bottom of the Barents
Sea on Aug. 12, Russians spontaneously reacted with indignation
when military leaders dropped into a familiar defensive crouch,
distorting and withholding information and paying little heed to
the human dimension of the tragedy for the crew members and their
families, many of whom live in rank poverty in Russia's far north.
</P>
<P>
   And they were even more appalled when Putin, instead of rushing
home like the disciplined and pragmatic public servant they voted
for in March, tarried at his favorite resort on the Black Sea. Day
after day he remained there, as one of the most extraordinary
rescue dramas at sea unfolded. Lives were at risk. Last breaths
were being drawn, but still Putin vacationed.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels to the Soviet era raged from the front pages of the
Russian press, and many Russians harked back to Chernobyl, where
the worst nuclear accident in history spewed radiation into the
heavens for days in late April and early May 1986 before Soviet
leaders begrudgingly admitted that something had gone terribly
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But in the din of recriminations of the loss of the Kursk and
with the sudden awakening of Putin, what many have missed is the
repudiation of the Soviet era that is also present in this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk families have expressed their outrage and pain, and
Putin elevated their plight this week to a national priority.
Politicians have said that officials must be held accountable, but
Putin said Wednesday night that the old Soviet game of laying blame
gratuitously would be set aside. ``It has been like that before,''
he said Wednesday on national television, adding that ``nothing
will be done'' until ``a full understanding has been gained about
what happened and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Russia's military made mistakes and was too slow to ask
for Western help, its officials also became surprisingly accessible
and accountable. One admiral admitted that rescue gear was not
available because it has been rented to oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   And a veteran Russian television reporter, Arkady Momontov,
known for his professional news delivery from the front lines in
Chechnya, was given exclusive access to the deck of the cruiser
Peter the Great. Far from being a mouthpiece for the navy, he
delivered a stream of video and reporting to an international
audience that showed Russian journalists' determination to reach
the same professional standards as their colleagues in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It was also impossible to ignore the moment when former Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev joined the ranks of critics chiding
Putin for delaying Russia's request for Western assistance too
long. For it was Gorbachev who in 1986 let the flames of Chernobyl
burn without warning his countrymen _ not to mention Europe _ that
a radioactive cloud was headed their way. And, of course, Gorbachev
refused all Western assistance to contain the worst nuclear
disaster ever.
</P>
<P>
   But with his criticism, Gorbachev showed that he, too, is well
beyond the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the sinking of the Kursk foreshadows that some
reckoning is ahead for the pared-down remains of the armed forces
of the former Soviet empire, whose once vaunted technological
prowess was already looking battered and bloodied by rebels in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an investigation proves that Russia's nuclear-powered
leviathan Kursk was sunk by a collision with an elusive foreign
submarine, or by a misfired torpedo or a World War II mine, the
lasting image from the surface of the Barents Sea will be the
hapless attempts by otherwise heroic Russian rescuers to reach the
Kursk's escape hatch in outdated mini-subs powered by batteries too
old to hold a charge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Norwegians and the British arrived with their shining
technology _ underwater cameras and command centers that looked
like an electronics store showroom _ these ``foreigners'' went to
work in the deep-diving suits and cracked the stubborn hatch in 36
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The wrenching drama of the Kursk has been another painful step
in the education of Putin, the youthful president and longtime KGB
officer who had vowed to strengthen the Russian state and rebuild
its military forces to defend Russia's interests, whatever those
turn out to be in the transition that still is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is discovering in the most poignant way that invoking the
imagery of Russia's military tradition is not the same as
exercising it effectively _ and safely _ every day. In his visit to
Severomorsk on Monday, Putin was reminded again that although
Russia possesses the nuclear arsenal of a global power, the
infrastructure of the Russian military has gone to rust and that
most of its personnel live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions in which our nuclear submarines are maintained
do not meet any standards, and we could witness another serious
accident at any moment,'' Alexsander Rutskoi, the former vice
president and a war hero who led a political rebellion against
Boris Yeltsin in 1993, said on Monday. In a fiery denunciation of
the navy, Rutskoi, now the governor of the Kursk region for which
the submarine was named, added, ``When the Russian fleet does not
have the necessary means to conduct rescues, the very fact that
submarines go to sea is already a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   After the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. commanders complained
that a ``hollow'' military was the cause of a significant decline
of U.S. prestige in the world, one that would invite challenge from
any adversary. And what ``hollow'' came to mean was the loss of
synergy between recruiting and training professional cadres of
soldiers and a high level of spending on maintenance, spare parts
and ever-improving technologies for weaponry and on safety for the
most important weapon in any arsenal _ the soldier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia now faces a much broader hollowing of its military
forces. Putin speaks as if he is determined to come to terms with
this reality, but without acknowledging that rebuilding the Russian
armed forces can only be accomplished through an inevitable
contraction of Russian power and global pretension. Overreaching
for the glory days of the Soviet past, when Moscow supported a blue
water navy that could compete for power and influence in the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, could easily lead to the disasters
that Rutskoi predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, venting his
frustration on national television on Monday night, said the
``whole reason'' why there were no Russian deep sea divers to race
down to save the Kursk's crew was that the military ``over the
course of the past several years'' has been ``robbed and stripped''
and the armed forces are being funded at ``less than 50 percent''
of their requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But requirements for what?
</P>
<P>
   Putin must now answer that question for the Russians and for his
neighbors in Europe, whom he has alarmed with his ``strong state''
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, flags over the Kremlin flew at half staff Wednesday,
a sign of mourning not only for the lost sailors but for the lost
pride that so many Russians feel.

CABINET MEMBER'S DEATH PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON INDIA'S HEALTH SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The death of a popular and lively leader of
India's governing party on Wednesday has shaken the capital's
political elite, many of whom believe that he got faulty medical
care at one of New Delhi's most prestigious private hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   P. Rangarajan Kumaramangalam, who at 48 was the nation's power
minister and a relatively young leader in the gerontocracy of the
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, was treated for a fever
four months ago at what is widely regarded as the city's premier
private hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors there did not detect the cancer that contributed to
his death, acute myeloid leukemia, and say they do not believe that
he had cancer when he was there.
</P>
<P>
   While the quality of health care for hundreds of millions of
Indians is miserable, the country's elected leaders are expected to
get only the best. Government officials generally, and cabinet
ministers especially, are a privileged class, entitled to free
medical care, priority seats on trains and planes, use of
government cars and virtually rent-free housing, among other perks.
</P>
<P>
   So when Kumaramangalam, a fixture in the capital who was
universally and affectionately known by the nickname Ranga, lapsed
into a coma a week ago and was found to have leukemia only a few
days later, there was disbelief among his colleagues and the
journalists who covered him.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindustan Times, a national daily newspaper, wrote, ``The
common man may well wonder: if this is how a minister who has
access to the best doctors and hospitals in the country is treated,
what about the rest of us?''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the coalition
government, are calling for an investigation of Indraprastha Apollo
Hospital, which treated Kumaramangalam four months ago. The
hospital has strongly denied any errors in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that Apollo Hospital could have diagnosed his
problem,'' Madan Lal Khurana, former chief minister of Delhi and a
member of Parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party, said on
Wednesday. ``His death could have been avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, 73, and a parade of the
nation's aging political leaders called on Kumaramangalam's home.
Vajpayee said in a statement, ``The cruel hand of death has
snatched away from our midst a young and dynamic national leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumaramangalam, a longtime member of Parliament from the
southern state of Tamil Nadu and a strong advocate of the
privatization of government-owned enterprises, sought treatment for
a persistent fever four months ago at Apollo, which is part of
India's first corporate chain of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's statements about his care make clear that he was
treated as what is generally known here as a ``V.V.I.P.'' _ a very,
very important person.
</P>
<P>
   Provided with ``extreme care and all personal attention,'' he
was given a battery of tests, was treated with antibiotics for
malaria and left the hospital when he started feeling better,
according to a press release. ``After his discharge, we continued
following Sri Kumaramangalam's health because he was dear to us,''
the hospital said, using a Hindi term of respect for him.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital said that it had consulted medical experts in
Boston who agreed with its care of the minister, and that he had
not returned for recommended follow-up visits. ``Unfortunately,
probably because of his busy schedule, he did not come back,'' the
hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaramangalam's illness was diagnosed only a few days ago after
he was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the
country's premier public hospital, also in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   During his more than 30 years in politics, Kumaramangalam
traveled a long distance from his family's political roots in a
journey that mirrored India's own transformation from a centrally
planned, state-dominated economy to a more market-driven one.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Mohan, made his name as a prominent Communist
politician and member of Parliament who served as a minister in
Congress Party governments. He played a pivotal role in the passage
of an antitrust law that sharply limited the size of private
companies, a law that his son later helped repeal.
</P>
<P>
   And the father was instrumental in nationalizing the coal
industry, while the son recently proposed a law that would
privatize it. As power minister, Kumaramangalam, once a trade union
leader of electrical workers who fought privatization, has pushed
to turn over distribution of power to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaramangalam, who had a wife and two children, spent most of
his political life in the Congress Party but joined the Bharatiya
Janata Party in 1998 and became one of its most recognized
spokesmen in his typically relaxed television appearances.

BLACKS AND JEWS FIND HARMONY IN RETELLING OF EXODUS
</HEADLINE>
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The story of Moses isn't usually sung and danced by a
cast of African-Americans and Jews. Nor is it performed as a work
in progress with new casts at every performance. Yet this has been
one of the goals of Walter Robinson, a composer from Cambridge,
Mass., who has spent the last four years piecing together
``Moses,'' which through black music and dance tells the Old
Testament story of the liberation of the Israelites from slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of blacks and Jews, from professional singers to
children in choirs, have contributed to ``Moses,'' which has had
about two dozen performances in synagogues, churches and theaters
along the East Coast. Question-and-answer sessions usually follow.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent evening in the basement of Temple Israel in
Boston, a cantor in the show chanted a lament for the suffering of
the Israelite slaves. Three gospel singers sang backup. Soon
afterward an Israelite slave broke into a rap harangue. Pharaoh's
magicians engaged in a break-dance battle. By the time a jazz trio
crooned a seductive entreaty to build a golden calf, the audience
and performers were swaying with the rhythms of a Southern Baptist
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of Moses is a universal story, with the universal
themes of freedom, liberation _ leaving the familiar and going
toward the unknown,'' Robinson said. ``Yet there is also something
universal about black music.''
</P>
<P>
   His audiences seem to enjoy and understand it. ``It was a real
thrill to look out and see young people tapping their feet and
clapping their hands,'' said Nancy K. Kaufman, executive director
of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, who
has been both a narrator and fund-raiser for the show. True, the
black teen-agers in the audience were a little more zealous in
their participation, she said, ``but the Jews were holding their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Cohen, the cantor at Temple Emanu-El in Long Beach, N.Y.,
said the crowd that turned out for a show there in June was second
only to attendance for the High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   The show rarely plays the same way twice. Those who saw it in
March at the Emerson Majestic Theater in Boston witnessed it at its
grandest, a musical spectacle with dancers, a full band and a
100-voice children's choir. More often the performances are pared
down, with street-clothes workshops for schools and community
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the principal performers are black, but children from
local synagogues make up the choir and a female cantor usually
plays Moses' wife, Zipporah. At a workshop performance in July,
Rebecca Garfein, senior cantor at Congregation Rodeph Sholom in New
York City, sang ``I Feel Love Here'' with Don Corey Washington, a
professional singer from East Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   There have been difficulties. Some people complained that there
were not enough Hebrew lyrics in the show, or that the nonblack
parts seemed more ``white'' than Jewish in their emphasis. Others
said that all the main characters should have been played by black
performers and that Robinson played favorites in selecting
performers instead of holding general auditions. In response
Robinson has tweaked the script, although he points out that the
show is intended to be a black retelling of the story of Moses, not
an amalgam of Jewish and black music. He says that casting will be
less personal once he has a producer. ``That, I want to be a much
wider process than myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson chooses his venues carefully to avoid neighborhoods
where Jews or blacks might feel intimidated. ``Unfortunately, over
time, everyone has become so separate, that they have built a sort
of fear reference to certain communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion for a musical about Moses, Robinson said, came
from Leonard Zakim, longtime regional director of the
Anti-Defamation League in Boston. But it was a performance of the
show ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' that inspired Robinson
to create the format and feel of his show. What that show did with
dance, he said, he knew he wanted to do with music.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson credits his grandfather, who took him to Southern
Baptist services as a child, for acquainting him with the spiritual
nature of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would get on their knees when they prayed,'' he said.
``I would be there huddled next to my grandfather and all these
big, sweaty people would be moaning in prayer, and all these
wonderful melodies reaching out to God. It was just really, really
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to worship with a variety of Christian groups, from
Baptists to Pentacostal to Charismatic Catholics, some of whom
denounced other denominations in their prayers, leaving him pained,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After touring with Livingston Taylor as a bassist, he spent
eight years as a fellow at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute of
African-American Research at Harvard, where he wrote an opera about
a slave who bought his own freedom, ``Look What a Wonder Jesus Has
Done.'' His folk song ``Harriet Tubman'' is a staple of school
choirs.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a grant from the Meet the Composer Foundation and
community sponsors in 1995 that set the ``Moses'' project rolling.
To the gospel, jazz and choral pieces he wrote, Robinson added rap
songs and break dancing by a troupe called the FloorLords. In the
show, a cadre of step dancers portray midwives who defy the
Pharaoh's orders to kill the first-born male Hebrew children. ``We
will not do it!'' they sing, echoing their words with their
stamping feet.
</P>
<P>
   The showman in Robinson longs to see his music make it to
Broadway, with star-quality performers and perhaps a
technologically dazzling burning bush. He has the ear of major
black dance and theater companies who may help it get there, he
said. In 1998 he received a grant for $35,000 from Steven
Spielberg's Righteous Persons Foundation and in December 1999, a
matching grant from that organization for $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tanglewood Festival Chorus performed ``The Ten
Commandments,'' a classical choral piece from the show, ``I was
immensely impressed and grateful and felt proud,'' he said. ``But
it's no less than when I go to a synagogue and see the kids
struggle and miss a line. Right now I'm blessed with both
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he seemed as he scrutinized the jazz trio's rendering of
``Bring Your Gold Together,'' in which the wandering Israelites
decide to hedge their bets with the old Egyptian gods by building
an idol. ``You know, having a god we can see,'' they croon,
``eliminates anxiety.''

REPORT HELD UP AS ASEAN WORRIES ABOUT FRAGILE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The Association of South East Asian Nations is
declining to release a report that warns of dwindling foreign
investment in the region, at the request of at least one member, an
association official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report on investment, presented to a meeting of
Asean's 10 foreign ministers in Bangkok last month, is normally
made public. Some details in the report, however, have since
appeared in local news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Such a warning is no surprise, but the association's decision
not to release the report shows how sensitive the issue is.
Southeast Asia's economic recovery appears increasingly fragile,
reducing the region's attraction to foreign business and investors.
At the same time, imminent entry into the World Trade Organization
has raised the allure of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southeast Asia has fallen off the radar screen,'' said William
C. Belchere, head of fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Asean Secretary General Rodolfo C. Severino,
warns that Southeast Asia is rapidly losing foreign investment to
competitors elsewhere, especially China, and calls for urgent
efforts to promote regional economic integration to regain
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   According to one published report, the Asean report found that
foreign investment in the region fell 22 percent in 1999 after
falling 21 percent in 1998. Only Singapore enjoyed an increase
among the group, which includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Vic A. Lactaoen, a spokesman at the association's headquarters
in Jakarta, said the report was not released at the request of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied having made such
a request, and said the decision not to publish the report was made
after the secretary broached the issue during an Asean committee
meeting before the ministerial meeting. The ministry spokeswoman
expressed surprise at the suggestion Singapore might have sought to
suppress the report, as its own foreign minister had offered a
similarly critical appraisal at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors have been pulling out of the region's stock
markets for most of the year in favor of markets to the north.
Morgan Stanley Capital International now gives Hong Kong almost the
same weight as all of Southeast Asia in its model Asian index.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign lending, much of which finances foreign investment, has
also been falling from $384 billion in early 1997 to $205 billion
by the end of last year, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A panel of international experts recommended
Wednesday that the U.N. peacekeeping department, under attack for a
series of disasters in recent years, be enlarged and
professionalized, with intelligence-gathering functions that were
essentially forbidden during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The experts, appointed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, urged
that more effort go into preventing situations from becoming crises
_ not waiting for instructions from the Security Council. They also
recommended that peacekeeping officials resist allowing larger
countries to exert too much influence over their day-to-day
activities. It is a vision certain to upset both U.S. isolationists
as well as some Third World leaders who fear that a stronger, more
independent organization would mean a new kind of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   The experts' recommendations are contained in a report released
just ahead of a summit meeting of world leaders in early September
when the issue of how much power the United Nations should have to
intervene in nations torn by domestic crises is expected to be
debated with some passion. Last year, Annan provoked a storm of
protest by saying in a speech to the General Assembly that national
borders should not be inviolate when rulers were abusing their
populations.
</P>
<P>
   But even with a stronger peacekeeping department, the Security
Council will still exercise considerable power over operations, and
the whims of the most powerful five nations _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States _ will continue to be a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a case like Rwanda, where up to 800,000 people died in
genocidal attacks on the minority Tutsi population in 1994 and the
United States prevented the deployment of an effective peacekeeping
operation, experts argue that if the peacekeeping department had
been better informed and more strongly staffed, a warning cable
from the Canadian commander on the ground might not have been given
short shrift by the big powers.
</P>
<P>
   In a case like Sierra Leone, where 500 ill-trained peacekeepers
walked into ambushes in May, Annan was left begging for military
expertise _ finally provided by the British _ because the
peacekeeping department did not have the people to do the job
itself and did not have a roster of ready professionals on loan
from governments to call on. The experts' recommendations follow
nearly a decade in which the United Nations has drifted in trying
to deal with peacekeeping problems. Their suggestions also call for
speeding up response time, so that a simple peacekeeping operation
could be launched in 30 days rather than several months, and
sending expert advance teams to areas where very complex military
and political situations prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, all kinds of new assignments have
been heaped on the peacekeeping department by the Security Council,
free of the paralysis caused by the perpetual checkmating of
initiatives by the Soviet Union or the United States when one camp
or another was involved _ as in Vietnam in the 1960s or Afghanistan
in the 1980s. Many of these assignments have not been practical,
and the expert panel concluded that the United Nations must learn
to ``just say no'' at times, rather than risk debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many tasks which the United Nations peacekeeping
forces should not be asked to undertake, and many places they
should not go,'' the report said. ``But when the United Nations
does send its forces to uphold the peace, they must be prepared to
confront the lingering forces of war and violence with the ability
and determination to defeat them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report, which concentrates heavily on practical measures to
fix the shortcomings of an overstretched, outdated peacekeeping
department, builds on specific earlier studies of the failures of
the United Nations and its member countries to deal with disasters
in Rwanda and Bosnia. The study paints a picture of an understaffed
department with a perennially ad hoc air about it, whose every move
is micromanaged by the 188-member General Assemby.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
who has for months been advocating the strengthening of the
peacekeeping department, the core function of the organization when
its charter was adopted in 1945, welcomed the report as ``a big
step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't agree with everything in this
report,'' he said in an interview. ``But we are prepared to support
it and to support a General Assembly resolution calling for its
aggressive implementation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people in the United States who view the
U.N. as an invasive force that weakens our sovereignty,'' he said.
``But this administration's view is clear: The U.N. is flawed but
it is indispensable. This report will, I hope, address some of its
flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. expert on the review panel was J. Brian Atwood, former
administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and
now president of Citizens International, a private
democracy-building organization. The panel's other experts included
Colin Granderson of Trinidad and Tobago, who has directed missions
in Haiti for the Organization of American States; Dame Anne Hercus,
a New Zealander who headed a U.N. mission in Cyprus, and Richard
Monk, a British police official who was commissioner of a U.N.
police force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the panel was Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, former
chairman of NATO's military committee; Hisako Shirmura of Japan, a
former director of Latin American and European peacekeeping at the
United Nations; Vladimir Shustov, a former Russian representative
to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; Gen.
Philip Sibanda of Zimbabwe, a former U.N. commander in Angola, and
Cornelia Sommaruga of Switzerland, president of the International
Committee of the Red Cross from 1987 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman was Lakhdar Brahimi, a former foreign
minister of Algeria who has served as an international
troubleshooter and envoy of the secretary-general for nearly a
decade in crises from Afghanistan to Haiti to Zaire, now Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Brahimi drew on his own experiences to
illustrate the weaknesses of the peacekeeping bureaucracy, which
his report says needs to be transformed into a meritocracy _ not an
easy task, he admits. For example, he said, in 1993, when he
returned to New York from overseeing the end of apartheid in South
Africa, he was asked to go immediately to Yemen, where a civil
conflict had broken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I asked was, OK, what do we have on Yemen?''
he said. ``The answer was, Nothing. Not one thing.'' He had to buy
his own research material, in Arabic, on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   One of the panel's central recommendations is the creation of a
new information-gathering and analysis office within the United
Nations to create data bases and operate as a policy planning
staff. In facing crises, the report recommends more honesty in
assessing blame and less of a tendency to try to treat all sides of
a dispute as equally responsible in an effort to appear impartial.
</P>
<P>
   Another core recommendation is the creation of an integrated
task force for each mission that combines political analysis,
military operations, civilian police, electoral assistance, aid to
refugees and displaced people, public information, logistics,
finance and recruitment. Brahimi said that the United Nations, with
the help of member governments, needs to compile a roster of
experts in many fields who are ready to go to places like Kosovo,
Congo or East Timor to do development as well as peacekeeping work.

SIMON &AMP; SCHUSTER BECOMES THIRD PUBLISHER TO OFFER E-BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Simon &AMP; Schuster on Wednesday announced a list of
electronic books that it will sell this fall, becoming the third
major trade publisher to make books available for downloading and
reading on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows whether consumers will pay for electronic
versions of trade books, Simon &AMP; Schuster, a unit of Viacom, joins
Bertelsmann's Random House imprint and Time Warner's trade
publishing division in plunging into the e-book business.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster's electronic books will include a handful of
titles sold exclusively in digital form, including a biography of
the winning presidential candidate written for children and set for
release at midnight after the election; a health guidebook produced
with the Harvard Medical School; a book elaborating on events in
``The Blair Witch Project''; books based on video games and books
related to Star Trek.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Romanos, president of Simon &AMP; Schuster, said the titles
were selected to capitalize on the potential for marketing to
groups active on the Internet, like fans of ``The Blair Witch
Project'' or Star Trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we know how to reach an audience for an
electronic book online unless the subject lends itself to that kind
of promotion,'' Romanos said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the list will be published simultaneously with new
hardcover books, including books by Stephen Ambrose, Bob Woodward,
Jesse Ventura and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Random House and Time Warner are creating imprints to publish
their electronic books, but Simon &AMP; Schuster is not. Romanos said
that the publisher wanted ``to pull everybody into digital
publishing's evolution rather than wait for individuals to put up
their hands and say, `I get it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster will charge $5 to $15 for books sold only in
electronic versions, about the price of a trade paperback, and will
sell the other electronic books for the same price as their
hardcover versions. Those prices are somewhat higher than those
charged by Random House and Time Warner.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are times when Tom Campbell clearly relishes being the
un-Republican Republican.
</P>
<P>
   At such moments _ and he has had a lot of them lately _
Campbell, a congressman from Silicon Valley and the main contender
to Dianne Feinstein's Senate seat this election, rolls up his
sleeves and unleashes the poetry of a progressive heavyweight, his
style and substance remarkably like that of a Jesse Jackson or a
Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Face red with emotion, preppie shirt wilted by his intensity,
acting nothing like the extreme longshot he is, Campbell sounded
positively radical at the alternative ``Shadow Conventions'' in
Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Standing on a podium as his own man,
he railed against United States aid to Colombia in the midst of its
civil war _ ``this has Vietnam written all over it'' _ called the
criminal-justice system unjust to minorities and lamented laws that
send drug users to prison instead of into treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded nothing like a Republican, and not much like a New,
i.e. moderate, Democrat, either.
</P>
<P>
   And his audiences, mad-as-hell activists who will probably vote
for the Green Party's presidential candidate, Ralph Nader, loved
him for it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. And yet there are times, such as when he tried
mustering enthusiasm for his party's presidential candidate, Gov.
George W. Bush, during a recent interview (``He is a, uh, very nice
guy'') or when he said there was no compelling reason for a
moratorium on the death penalty, or, especially, when he stresses
small government and individual liberty, that the 47-year-old
Campbell, a former constitutional law professor at Stanford
University, sounds remarkably like a Republican Party animal.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies Campbell's problem. He is giving up his 15th
Congressional District seat (which he held from 1989 to 1993, lost
in his first go at the Senate, and then regained while a state
senator in 1994) to try to make a case for himself against a
popular Democratic incumbent. But his independent streak has thrown
off what would be his core supporters. He is a moderate Republican
who supports abortion rights in a state where conservative,
anti-abortion Republicans rule the roost. Yet while Republicans
might think him not Republican enough, Democrats and independents
don't trust his party label.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help his cause with them when he announces that he
supports the positions of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas, the Supreme Court's two most conservative members.
</P>
<P>
   And recent polls show he has a freeway's worth of ground to
cover if he is to catch up to Feinstein, who first won her Senate
seat in 1992. Earlier this month, a Public Policy Institute of
California poll showed Feinstein with a 52 percent to 33 percent
lead over Campbell among all voters and a 60 percent to 21 percent
advantage among Latinos. Campbell has been so far behind in the
polls that Feinstein has had the luxury of ignoring him completely.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that the gap, based on a poll his campaign
commissioned earlier this month, is narrower: 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But California, where a healthy independent streak has Ralph
Nader, the Green Party's presidential candidate, winning 8 to 10
percent of the vote, appears to favor Democrats over everyone else
these days. It is one of only three states _ Hawaii and Maryland
are the others _ where Democrats have a slight edge over the
Republicans in party registration and control the governor's
office, both U.S. Senate seats, the two state legislative chambers
and the U.S. House delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a moderate who was once mayor of San Francisco, is
acknowledged as the most popular elected officials in California.
She garnered nearly 1 million more votes than anyone else on the
March primary ballot, including Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who is generally soft-spoken and smiley, gritted his
teeth when asked how he could counter his opponent's popularity.
``That I am a maverick is right,'' he said in an interview before
his Shadow Convention speech in Los Angeles. ``I try to give my
best on every issue. I think the voters appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to get my message to the people,'' he added. ``I
believe the gap will close completely. Dianne isn't really popular;
she just has widespread name recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell pointed to the popularity of Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, for whom the word ``maverick'' seemed made this year, to
prove his point. But he omitted the fact that McCain lost his bid
for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This does not appear to be the year for maverick Republicans who
stray from the party platform to run for office. Not when the
party, as its convention showed, wants to show the country one big
happy compassionate conservative face.
</P>
<P>
   One California Republican Party insider, who asked not to be
quoted by name, said Campbell has left the party scratching its
head on a number of occasions. Those include the times Campbell has
teamed up at press conferences with the Green Party Senate
candidate, Medea Benjamin, to criticize the war on drugs, call for
campaign finance reform, denounce the war in Kosovo and try to
force Feinstein into a debate. ``The guy is all over the place,''
the insider said. ``You're not sure whether he's helping the party
or hurting it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Campbell insists he has the full, enthusiastic support of the
Republican Party. But he was booed at the state Republican
convention earlier this year when he mentioned abortion rights. And
a letter he wrote to federal and state lawmakers who support
abortion rights asking them to advance an abortion rights agenda at
the Republican National Convention may have cost him a speaking
slot there.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is money. Feinstein's war chest, more than $8.5
million, makes Campbell's $3.5 million look like lunch money. ``If
we had $10 million I just know we could beat Feinstein,'' said Sean
Walsh, Campbell's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder is why Campbell, who made a name for himself (``Mud''
as far as the Republican Congress was concerned) by amassing the
most liberal voting record of any Republican from California, did
not run for the Senate in 1998. His chances seemed stronger against
Barbara Boxer, a liberal Democrat from San Francisco who was
battling for re-election. Campbell's outspoken opposition to the
re-election of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whom he called a liar,
stunted his chances for advancing through the leadership ranks as
long as Gingrich's allies remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse for his party, Campbell's seemingly
suicidal Senate bid is leaving his House seat vulnerable to
takeover by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell does not offer long explanations for why he entered the
race. ``I ran this time because I knew I could win the primary,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are treating his candidacy as though they were
flitting their fingers at a gnat _ a nuisance hardly worth
mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the widespread support or name ID,'' said Art
Torres, the chairman of the California Democratic Party. ``His
candidacy seems to be an afterthought _ a nice way to end his
political career.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Campbell has been courting Latino voters with television
ads criticizing Feinstein on immigration policy. The commercials
accuse Feinstein of being late to oppose Proposition 187, the 1994
ballot measure that sought to eliminate state benefits, including
medical care and education, to illegal immigrants. The measure,
heavily opposed by Latinos, passed but has been ruled
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's campaign manager, Kum Kawata, has dutifully refuted
Campbell's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein hasn't really bothered. But Campbell insists that come
Nov. 7, voters will know him and like him and want him as their
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm going to win,'' he said, smiling like someone about to
battle a five-alarm fire.

TEXAS TAKES STEP ON WARMING; SOME SEE SHIFT IN BUSH'S POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas' three natural resource commissioners, all appointees of
Gov. George W. Bush, said Wednesday that global warming was a
serious problem and that the state would explore ways to cut its
emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, although just a tentative move toward action, was
praised by some private environmental groups. They said it could
signal a shift in the global-warming stance of Bush, who so far has
said that although earth's climate appears to be warming, more
research must be done to determine whether human activities are the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospect of any such shift, Michael Jones, a
spokesman for the governor's office, would say only that the
commission's action ``is a step in the right direction to help us
get the information we need to address this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   International negotiations on cutting greenhouse gases are to
resume this fall, and emission reductions are an issue on which
Bush and his presidential campaign opponent, Vice President Al
Gore, have sharply differed. Gore has pushed for aggressive action
to cut emissions, while Bush has cautioned against haste.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Wednesday in Texas, which produces far more
greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels than any other
state, was the response by the Natural Resource Conservation
Commission to a petition filed last month by private environmental
groups asking the state to create an emission-cutting plan.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five states already have such plans, or are drafting
them, and 35 compile annual tallies of greenhouse gas emissions.
But in Texas, where it has been almost a decade since the
Legislature authorized the commission to write rules governing such
gases, nothing even preliminary has resulted until now.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the commission is planning only a thorough
review of the state's data on emissions, a review of scientific
research on the problem and an appraisal of other states' climate
programs. Some conservative groups opposed to big emissions cuts
pointed out happily that the agency was essentially calling for
more research and putting off any commitment to cuts until late
next year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless Peggy Venable, the director of one such group, Texas
Citizens for a Sound Economy, lamented what she described as
pressure on the agency stemming largely from election-year
politics.

U.S. COMPANY TRIES TO SELL EUROPE ON THE HOT DOG 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREGENE, Italy _ A blue and yellow umbrella flapped in the
breeze as Andrea Lupo, clad in a blue bathing suit and a deep tan,
ordered lunch with mustard, relish, onions and sauerkraut, to a
chorus of ``disgusting'' from a clutch of wide-eyed contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many hot dogs he had eaten on a recent afternoon,
Andrea, 14, grinned and, with playful exaggeration, replied, ``Oh,
60, maybe.'' His pals ordered theirs slathered in mustard or
swimming in ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea's appetite cheers hearts at a company not far from this
Italian seaside resort that is trying a curious culinary
experiment. If it succeeds, the Sabrett hot dog, icon of Broadway
and habitue of Madison Square Garden, will be added to Europe's
growing menu of American-style fast-food dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the pushcart outside Gilda on the Beach, a beach club
and discotheque, sells 40 to 50 a day, and more than 200 in the
early hours of the morning, when the disco shuts down and exhausted
patrons grab a hot dog before heading home. The company, American
Food Products, began selling the hot dogs last spring, and now
serves soccer stadiums, amusement parks, discotheques, highway rest
stops and dozens of pushcarts in Italian cities.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the venture is as fundamental as, well, a
frank. While American fast-food products like the hamburger, the
donut and fried chicken have captured the palates of Europeans, the
humble hot dog, which despite its Germanic wurst resemblance is
considered the most American of them all, remains stranded on the
other side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of the success of the hamburger,'' said
Pasquale L. Figorito, president of American Food Products,
explaining that the four original McDonalds restaurants in the
Italian capital, Rome, do $10 million sales a year. ``It's just
amazing,'' he said. ``The United States is known as a country for
hamburgers, but statistics show that in America, seven hot dogs are
eaten for every hamburger. So maybe we have fertile terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   This fertile terrain prompted a group of investors, including
some from the United States, to bid enough to win the exclusive
license for Sabrett hot dogs in Europe. Italy is the first market,
but Figorito says he plans to sell the hot dog elsewhere in Europe,
for example in Britain and Spain, if the Italian experiment
succeeds. To do so, American Food has registered a parent company
in Luxembourg. Within a year or so, he said, expansion could begin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Rome's rival soccer clubs, Roma and Lazio, compete in
the capital's Olympic Stadium, hawkers sell Sabrett's hot dogs in
the bleachers. At the recent Italian Open tennis tournament,
Sabrett's distinct yellow and blue umbrellas lured hungry fans. At
highway rest stops in northern Italy, the hot dogs are catching on.
``We're selling about 9,000 to 10,000 hot dogs a day,'' said
Figorito, an unabashed enthusiast of American food. His goal for
Italy, he says, is 60,000 to 70,000 a day, adding: ``My dream is
double that.'' Within a few years he hopes to have Sabrett hot dog
outlets, modeled on McDonalds hamburger restaurants and selling
steak fries, crinkle cuts and, maybe, potato knishes, in Italian
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought Italians would go for pickle relish,'' he
said. Still, he admits, not everything related to Sabrett's travels
well. The company slogan, for instance, ``We're on a roll,'' had to
be abandoned in Europe. ``It would take three years to explain
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Sabrett, a unit of Marathon Enterprises Inc. in East
Rutherford, N.J., which produces about 1 million hot dogs a week,
that is small change. But Sabrett, which recovered last year from a
case of contamination of its products by listeria, a food-borne
bacteria, that is suspected of having caused two deaths, welcomes
the European expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd G. Adelman, Marathon's executive vice president responsible
for Sabrett, said that while Sabrett's priority remains ``a
100-mile radius around New York,'' it had begun expanding
nationally, notably through wholesale clubs, like BJs, and was also
shipping small amounts of hot dogs to South Korea, Japan and
Mexico. ``We are expanding on an international scale, and Italy is
important,'' Adelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Figorito, 39, a big, mustachioed native of Elmwood Park, N.J.,
got to know Sabrett's products while growing up in New Jersey
before settling in Italy after finishing college. After meeting
Adelman through a mutual friend several years ago, he hatched the
Pygmalion-like idea of grooming the New York hot dog for its
continental debut.
</P>
<P>
   Yet first he had to deal with European bureaucracy. Sabrett
stepped into Europe at the height of a trade war between Washington
and the European Union over food products, like bananas, that
prompted the Europeans to cut the number of European inspectors in
U.S. food plants to one, from 16, making it unfeasible to consider
importing hot dogs from Sabrett factories to Europe. Instead,
Figorito signed up Cremonini SpA, an Italian company whose $1.2
billion of annual revenue make it one of Europe's biggest food
processing companies, to make the frankfurters at an Italian
factory using Sabrett's recipe. Since skinless, all-beef sausages
like Sabrett's are virtually unknown in Europe, where pork and
poultry dominate, Cremonini had to master Sabrett's technology,
Figorito said. The spices for the hot dogs, Sabrett's Adelman
added, are shipped from the United States, where they are mixed
``according to our age-old, secret recipe.'' The buns are baked in
Barcelona, Spain, by Bimbo SA, a unit of Earthgrains, the St. Louis
bakers, who also bake rolls in Europe for Burger King. Bimbo
modified its machines to slice Sabrett's typically hinged bun.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrett's pushcarts, too, good enough for Manhattan street
corners, could not meet European standards. Considered mobile
restaurants by European Union definition, the pushcarts had to have
a working sink and a locker for employee clothing. Figorito proudly
showed a redesigned cart, a tiny sink clinging to one side and a
miniature locker, perhaps big enough for a rolled up shirt, on the
other. Moreover, since European hygienic rules don't allow soft
drinks in cans or bottles to be stored in chopped ice, the way they
are in New York pushcarts, the European carts are outfitted with
small refrigerators. Three carts had to be handed over to European
inspectors for crash tests, to see how well vendors and customers
would survive a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Sabrett's onions and sauerkraut could survive the
European bureaucratic onslaught. Formaric acid used as a
preservative in the American-prepared onions is banned in Europe
and had to be replaced with citric acid. Europe also bans the use
of sodium benzoid, a common preservative in sauerkraut, so a
substitute had to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the American Food investors are seeking to cash in on
Europe's unbroken appetite for fast food and the continued spread
of restaurant franchising. But they are also targeting Europe's
growing Islamic population, as immigrants from predominantly Muslim
countries in Africa and the Middle East arrive in search of jobs.
``As Europe grows more multiethnic,'' said Franco Pantaleoni, a
food industry consultant who helped set up American Food, ``we are
using more products that are pure beef.'' But he won't deny that
the biggest market is children.
</P>
<P>
   The hot dogs that sell at Gilda's for the equivalent of $2.50
are double what they cost in New York, where they sell for $1.25, a
steep price considering that the main target is young people. Yet
Sergio Lorina, 52, who operates the pushcart, said price was no
obstacle. ``Mainly kids eat them,'' he said, ``and the more daring
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Marina Ciaralli, whose children Matteo, 12, and Marta, 9, were
munching on hot dogs with the works _ mustard and ketchup, relish
and sauerkraut _ agreed. The slice of pizza she was eating cost
about the same as her children's hot dogs, she said. Asked whether
she had tried a hot dog, she replied hesitantly, ``Not today. Maybe
tomorrow.''

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a tip from Woody Allen, writer-director Valerie Breiman
based much of her debut feature, ``Love &AMP; Sex,'' on a funny
relationship _ that's funny ha-ha and funny insane, like
everybody's _ she once had.
</P>
<P>
   The results aren't ``Annie Hall'' calibre, but they are
remarkably more recognizably human than what passes for most movie
romantic comedy. ``Love &AMP; Sex'' is impolite, messy, obsessive and
embarrassing. It seems like love, in other words, not to mention
like everyone's other favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen, the strapping Dutch model last seen playing it
cool in ``X-Men,'' carries the film with a protean emotional
bewilderment and delightfully awkward physicality as Kate. A writer
for one of those monstrous women's magazines that are always making
up authoritative articles on what works with men, Kate one day gets
sick of all the fabrication and thinks back about where she's
personally gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Several quick vignettes _ her father-figure period with a
married guy during college, the cute-but-dumb action movie actor
liaison _ bookend the central disaster of her love life. His name
is Adam (``Swingers''' Jon Favreau), a painter of grotesque psyche
scapes. He started out all cuddly overconfident, stuck by her
through an unplanned pregnancy and devastating miscarriage, then
let his sexual paranoia _ Kate had a lot more experience going in _
scuttle what was shaping up as a pretty good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after they broke up, things really got intense.
</P>
<P>
   Breiman approaches the usual ``Why are guys so weird and can't I
keep one?'' neurotics with a beguiling, shambling earthiness. The
film's title is not deceptive; when at a loss for how to express a
worrisome feeling, Kate unerringly goes carnal with often
uproarious consequences. Just one small but telling example: Of all
the jokey tongue-kissing that we've been subjected to in this
summer's comedies, this movie's kisses are the only ones that
actually make you chuckle instead of wince because they're
expressions of character rather than cheap grossout displays.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Love &AMP; Sex'' has its share of pat gags,
like Adam's playmate parade of rebound bimbos who are each younger,
dumber and blonder than the last. But Breiman has a way of using
obvious jokes as springboards for smarter humor, and in much the
same way she can stretch standard contemporary rom-com dialogue
into very specific, personal revelation.
</P>
<P>
   All of this gives ``Love &AMP; Sex'' a shaggy, lived-in kind of
feeling. Very enjoyable ambience _ and if Breiman can recapture it
in future projects that she hasn't necessarily lived out, she'll be
a formidable voice in film comedy indeed. &QL;

 &HT;    Infrequent phone calls are only link to husbands battling blazes
 &HT;    By Cynthia Kopkowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Some North Carolina residents are keeping a
closer eye on wildfires out west than most. That's because their
family members are battling the blazes.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Derrick Moore and Tom Harris, two of 231
firefighters from North Carolina that have gone to the fires since
the end of June, are keeping an eye on the situation. A team of 57
firefighters from 10 area counties traveled west in the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic phone calls and news reports provide Suzanne Moore with
a tentative link to her husband, a North Carolina Forestry Service
assistant ranger who is fighting fires in Idaho. She has seen her
husband only four days in the past month, in between his trip to
Colorado at the end of July and his Aug. 13 flight to Pocatello,
Idaho. She expects him to return Aug. 30 or 31.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting and watching are roles familiar to Moore, whose husband
fought fires in Florida and Montana in 1998 and 199 and did rescue
work in Belvoir during Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   When an early morning call came from the state's forestry
service to the Moore's house on July 24, Derrick was packed and
ready to go. He passed physical and skill tests at the beginning of
the year to become eligible for volunteer wildfire duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rough, but I know it's something that he has wanted to do
since he joined the forestry service,'' said Suzanne, a paralegal
with a Kinston law firm. ``And they really need help out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from North Carolina sent west are working under the
direction of the U.S. Forestry Service, said John Shepherd, a
section chief with the state forestry office's Raleigh
headquarters. A group of about 20 North Carolina firefighters is on
standby to head to the fires this week, Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 25-year veteran of the forestry service, is fighting
fires near the Bitterroot River in southwestern Montana. His calls
home have been limited due to few phones and long work days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is, no news is normally good news,'' said
Harris' wife, Darlene, who last talked to him Sunday. ``I've really
become accustomed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harris' have been married 26 years and managed to celebrate
their anniversary Thursday before Tom left for Montana. Darlene
watched her husband fight fires in California in the 1970s, went
eight days without seeing him during Hurricane Floyd and spent
several weeks alone while he battled blazes in Florida this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene, an employee with the U.S. Bankruptcy Office in
Greenville, even takes on the challenge of helping her husband get
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he gets the call, it's a mad dash to help him get packed
and ready,'' she said. ``This time I had to get a pup tent, a
sleeping bag and 14 days worth of clothes in one suitcase. That's
not easy _ it's a lot of smushing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent phone call Darlene got from her husband was
Tuesday morning from the side of a mountain in Idaho. He was on one
of his five-minute breaks in what he told her were 12- or 16-hour
days trying to uncover hot spots and build fire-slowing fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phone calls are very important,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But long days and a three-hour time difference means those calls
may come late at night just before Tom crawls into his tent, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some mornings they're up by 4:30, on the mountain at 6 and not
back at camp until 9,'' Suzanne said. ``He eats, takes a quick
shower and then calls quickly to say, `This is where I'm at, this
is what's going on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're all tired,'' Suzanne said, ``but they realize
that they're there for a good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the necessity of her husband's work doesn't always
make his absence easier, Darlene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companionship is what I miss the most,'' she said. ``We just
purchased a place on the (Pamlico) river. Last time I talked to him
he asked why I wasn't up there when he called and I said, `It's not
any fun,' `` without him.
</P>
<P>
   For Suzanne, waiting for her husband means focusing on work,
singing with the church choir, eating dinner with neighbors and
taking care of the couple's dog, Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the long-distance relationships is fear, both wives
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not nervous,'' Suzanne said of her husband, a
four-year veteran of the forest service. ``He's got a very good
head on his shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, descriptions of the wildfires in newspapers and on
television are supplemented by their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne said the photos from Derrick's first trip to Mesa Verde,
Colo., put the images of burned trees and fields in the palm of her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing her husband's stories about the fires reinforced
Darlene'

 &HT;    Pirates fight for exposure despite 9-win season
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ask Steve Logan how things are in Greenville, N.C.,
and he replies, ``Just hanging out, waiting on the next
hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed that Hurricane Debby was downgraded Tuesday to a
tropical storm, Logan was genuinely relieved. You'd be, too, if you
were the head football coach at East Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 11 months since the hurricane, and Hurricanes, hit
North Carolina. Last September, as Hurricane Floyd swept across the
state, the East Carolina Pirates had to spend a week in a hotel in
Columbia. Flooding in Greenville prompted ECU's game with mighty
Miami to be moved from Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium on campus to
Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh. There, in N.C. State's stadium,
East Carolina rallied from 20 points down to upset the No. 9
Hurricanes 27-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, there was just as much chaos as you could invent,''
Logan recalled. ``Then we won the game and suddenly there was a
great story.''
</P>
<P>
   Another chapter, too, to the nice story Logan and his teams have
written since 1992, a year after ECU went 11-1 with quarterback
Jeff Blake orchestrating Logan's offense. In '92, once Bill Lewis
left for his three-year debacle at Georgia Tech, Logan moved up
from offensive coordinator to head coach. Ever since, East
Carolina's improvement has been evident. Even as the Pirates _ who
went 9-3 (4-2 in Conference USA) last season and to their third
bowl in six years _ continue to fight for more exposure while
upgrading their facilities, schedule and overall talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were 15 teams that won nine or more (games in
'99),'' Logan said. ``Well, doggone, we were one of them. We've
come up in the world, but we're still in a very tenuous little
position here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we good? Yeah. Hard to beat? Yeah. Can we lose? Yeah.
We've got 11 games this year. Any one of 'em, we could win it or we
could lose it. That's the world we live in. We just don't have the
numbers of elite athletes. But don't get me wrong. We've got some
doggone good kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine starters return from an offense that averaged 29 points in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Leading tackler and inside linebacker Pernell Griffin (121
tackles) returns to a defense that lost both starting cornerbacks.

 The following article is based on reporting by Lowell Bergman,
Diana B. Henriques, Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Michael Moss and was
written by Henriques.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, Dick Cheney pulled off what was widely seen as a
business coup. Ending years of fruitless talks, Cheney arranged a
merger between Halliburton, the company he ran, and its chief
rival, Dresser Industries, creating the world's largest oil field
services and construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were so amicable, the companies dispensed with the
close scrutiny of each other's businesses that is usually part of a
merger, a Dresser official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some key Dresser executives quickly came to regret that
decision, present and former company officials say. They were
startled to learn after the deal closed that several of the major
projects negotiated by Cheney's management team were much less
healthy than they had appeared on the Halliburton's books and were
racking up significant losses. The newly merged company was hit
with several hundred million dollars of unexpected losses,
including an estimated $100 million on a single pipeline project in
South America begun on Cheney's watch, according to company
insiders and others in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresser merger was the biggest deal of Cheney's five years
at Halliburton and the losses that arose soon afterward were one of
several missteps in a business record that has become part of his
political resume since he became the Republican nominee for vice
president. The Bush campaign has defended his multimillion
retirement payment from Halliburton as fair compensation for a job
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people should be pleased they have a
vice-presidential nominee who has been successful in business,''
said Karen P. Hughes, communications director for the campaign of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But just how successful Cheney was as a chief executive is a
matter of considerable dispute, judging by a broad survey of his
record that included interviews with present and former company
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Some praised him for doubling the size of the company through
mergers and a growing government business that has made Halliburton
the nation's fifth-largest military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess Cheney's performance, Halliburton's vice
chairman, Donald Vaughn, said he deserved a ``clearly superior''
grade. ``Mr. Cheney was anything but a status quo man,'' Vaughn
said. ``He changed Halliburton and the popular judgment is he
changed it for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives, however, said Cheney failed to keep a
sufficiently tight rein on the company's aggressive pursuit of
overseas energy projects and road-building work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the last president of Dresser, acknowledged in an
interview that there had been ``overall surprise'' with the losses
that emerged after the Dresser merger. Most of them, he said, came
from contracts on the Halliburton side of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn blamed the reversals on an industry downturn caused by
plummeting oil prices in late 1998 and on the complexity of the
projects and said neither he nor his Dresser colleagues felt
deceived. ``No one was flimflammed,'' he said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded 81 years ago as an oil well service concern, Halliburton
has grown into a wide-ranging energy technology and construction
giant with revenues last year of $14.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney arrived as chief executive in October 1995, he was
viewed as a man who would use his worldwide contacts to produce new
business. ``When we brought Cheney in, it really wasn't to run
operations,'' said his predecessor, Cruikshank. ``It was to make
the proper strategic decisions, and to establish relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Cheney's first initiatives were well-regarded mergers that
helped the company master the new technologies reshaping the energy
industry. The company also scored some victories in Washington
under Cheney, winning a $1.1 billion Pentagon contract for support
operations in the Balkans. A Pentagon official said there was no
indication the former defense secretary had any role in sealing the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much of a hand Cheney had in his management
team's decision to start bidding more aggressively on smaller-scale
highway projects. But while the company won a host of new
contracts, it ran into difficulties in North Carolina and Bush's
home state of Texas for failing to meet deadlines for completing
the work. The projects were small by Halliburton standards, $20
million or less, but a company insider said the losses on several
of them rose as high as $4 million to $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Texas eventually fined the company for its
tardiness and North Carolina officials went further, barring
Halliburton from bidding on road work in the state.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Lesar, Halliburton's chief executive, said the setbacks
in the road work were ``part and parcel'' of a business frequently
punctuated by commercial disputes. ``It's absolutely not an
embarrassment,'' he said. Lesar acknowledged, however, that the
company, which expanded its road building under Cheney, is getting
out of the business of doing such small-scale projects.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said Cheney was frustrated in his desire to
phase out another Halliburton business: Its dealings with Libya
through its British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar said Cheney told executives soon after he arrived that he
wanted to get out of Libya but was dissuaded by the argument that
this would harm the company's long-term relationship with its
customers. ``He had a fiduciary responsibility to his
stockholders,'' Lesar said.
</P>
<P>
   Company insiders said that some of Halliburton's woes under
Cheney were common to corporate America in the late 1990s. But last
year, the company's board of directors withheld bonuses from Cheney
and his management team, which had failed to meet the board's
financial targets for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, Halliburton's vice chairman, said Cheney should be
judged on the performance of the company's stock, a standard
benchmark. By that measure, Cheney's early years at Halliburton
were more successful than his later ones, when the company
performed less well than its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Cheney years as chief executive saw Halliburton
stock significantly underperform most stocks in its industry. From
the time he became chief executive through the announcement he was
leaving, Halliburton shares rose 110 percent, while the average oil
service company share price rose 158 percent and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, an index of large company stocks, was up 151 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Arvind Sanger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
Cheney did ``an averagely decent job as CEO. I don't think he did
an exceptional job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more comfortable talking about the big picture, not
the nitty gritty of the business,'' said Sanger. ``Deep down
inside, he's a politician at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cheney's track record as chief executive, his candidacy
is strongly supported by almost all of the executives who worked
with him, even those who disagreed with how he led the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney is a great man, very focused, and he stands for a
lot of the things I stand for,'' said one former executive who quit
in frustration over the company's post-merger culture. ``I just
couldn't stay in that environment,'' he said. ``Life is too
short.''

REPORTING INCREASES IN DIABETES, RESEARCHERS WARN OF DEATH AND
DISABILITY

<P>
   The incidence of diabetes increased markedly in the United
States from 1990 to 1998, including a 76 percent rise in cases
among people in their 30s, researchers are reporting Thursday, and
they warn that the disease will take a harsh toll in disability,
death and medical expenses in decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors blame much of the rise on obesity, which is also
increasing steadily, with more than half of Americans now
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is almost entirely in Type 2 diabetes, commonly
called adult onset diabetes, which accounts for 90 to 95 percent of
all cases of the disease. Inactivity and weight gain can bring on
Type 2 diabetes, and doctors blame much of the current rise on
obesity, which is also increasing steadily, with more than half of
Americans now overweight. Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for most
of the remaining 5 to 10 percent of cases, is caused by a
malfunction of the immune system and is not linked to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers predict that Type 2 diabetes will continue to
snowball, because there is a delay between the development of
obesity and the onset of diabetes, which means that for many
overweight people it is just a matter of time before the disease
sets in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having enough trouble taking care of people with
diabetes today,'' said Dr. Frank Vinicor, director of the diabetes
division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and an
author of the study, which is being published Thursday in the
journal Diabetes Care. ``It's going to get considerably worse in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts blame the rising weight on Americans' increasing
tendency to park themselves in front of TV and computer screens,
exercising too little and eating too much, particularly gigantic
portions of high-calorie foods. The study showed that the risk of
diabetes increased by 4 percent for every pound of excess weight.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the prevalence of diabetes rose from 4.9 percent of the
population in 1990 to 6.5 percent in 1998, an increase of 33
percent, according to the study. Hispanics had a 38 percent
increase in diabetes cases, compared to increases of 29 percent in
whites and 26 percent in blacks. In total, the percentages
translate into 13 million cases of diabetes. During the same time
period, the proportion of people who were overweight rose from 44
percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have estimated that in addition to the diagnosed
cases, more than 5 million other Americans have diabetes without
knowing it, because the disease produces few or no symptoms in its
early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Severe complications make diabetes a substantial public health
problem. It is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure and leg
amputations, and it greatly increases the risk of heart disease and
stroke, the leading causes of death in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The increases in people in their '30s and younger are
particularly worrisome, researchers say. The longer a person has
the disease, the greater the odds of complications. In the past,
Type 2 diabetes was seen mainly in people over 45. Today, doctors
say they are alarmed to find the disease even in teen-agers, as
more and more of them become obese.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of diabetes is estimated at $98 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expensive as we think health care is today, with these chronic
conditions coming on it's going to be very threatening to quality
of life as well as cost issues,'' said Vinicor. ``If we saw a 33
percent increase in infectious diseases like tuberculosis or AIDS,
I believe there would be an understandable demand for action. We
can't just view inactivity and overweight as purely a kind of
cosmetic thing. It's got to be viewed as a serious public health
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Many measures are needed to fight the trend, Vinicor said,
offering several examples: ``We need to insure that people are
informed about healthy choices of foods, that when you build new
homes there are sidewalks where people can walk and be active, that
schools reinstate physical education and that cafeterias at schools
offer healthy foods.''
</P>
<P>
   He said research had shown that school-based programs to
encourage exercise could stop the development of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes has been on the rise for several decades, but Vinicor
said the current rate of increase is slightly greater than in the
past. He said he thought the new study reflected a real rise in the
incidence of the disease, and not just increased diagnosis due to
better screening or a broader definition of the disease established
in 1997. If anything, he said, the figures are conservative,
because they were gathered by a telephone survey and therefore did
not include people too poor to have telephones, who are among those
with the highest rates of obesity and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The figures being reported Thursday come from a telephone survey
of 150,000 households in which people were asked their height and
weight and whether they had been told by a doctor that they had
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Not all overweight people become diabetic; in fact, the majority
do not. But the risk of the disease increases with the degree of
obesity. The main abnormality in diabetes is an excessively high
level of blood sugar, or glucose. Type 2 diabetes is most likely to
develop in people with a condition known as insulin resistance,
which the body cannot make proper use of the hormone insulin, which
normally helps glucose enter cells so that it can be used as fuel.
Insulin resistance is often associated with obesity but researchers
are not sure whether obesity causes insulin resistance, or vice
versa. Many scientists think that the tendency to become insulin
resistant is genetic. In any case, the body tries to overcome
insulin resistance by producing higher and higher levels of the
hormone, which is made in the pancreas. In some people, with
insulin resistance, most of them obese, the insulin-producing cells
simply wear out, leading to a shortage of insulin and high blood
sugar, the hallmarks of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers think excess glucose causes trouble in part by
thickening the blood, which impedes circulation, and by binding to
needed enzymes and other important proteins and sabotaging their
function.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise and weight loss can lower insulin resistance and high
blood sugar and are commonly the first measures recommended to
treat Type 2 diabetes. Each can help, but the combination is more
effective than either one alone. They are also being studied to
determine whether they can ward off the disease in people at high
risk for it.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are able to stick to diets or exercise programs, and
those who do lose weight often regain it. Many people with Type 2
diabetes eventually need pills or insulin shots to lower their
blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that ``tight control'' of blood sugar,
keeping it as close to normal as possible, can forestall the
devastating complications of diabetes. But surveys reveal that few
patients achieve that degree of control. They do not receive
adequate treatment for high blood pressure or high cholesterol,
either, conditions that often accompany diabetes and that increase
the risk of cardiovascular disease.

UNITED ASKS MECHANICS TO WORK OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Ohio, Calif., Ill., Wash.)  By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ To help overcome delays and cancellations that have
plagued it this summer, United Airlines has issued an order
requiring mechanics at five airports to work overtime if asked.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 of the airline's 10,000 mechanics have been working
overtime this week in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and
Indianapolis to try to make sure flights are able to take off on
time, said a United spokesman, Chris Brathwaite. An order, called
an operational emergency, was also issued in Denver, but no
mechanics have been asked to work overtime there, Brathwaite said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract between United's parent company, UAL Corp., and the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union
allows management to declare an operational emergency when overtime
hours are needed to keep the airline operating efficiently. United
and union spokesmen said the airline does not issue such an order
very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have planes backed up, we have out of service aircraft
which are causing cancellations, and we're calling a few mechanics
in to service the aircraft to keep them running on time,'' said
Brathwaite, adding that those working overtime are the most junior
mechanics. ``If it takes an extra hour for somebody to work to fix
a door knob or a broken seat, we need make sure our planes are in
good working order.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Larkin, a spokesman for the machinists union, said that
United officials said in a conference call on Wednesday that ``they
had as many as 40 aircraft out of service, grounded and they were
going to be using mandatory overtime only as long as was needed to
correct the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said: ``Emergency overtime is permitted in our contract.
The concern now is that it does not go from an actual emergency to
covering staffing needs. In this conference call the company said
it would use it as little as possible. Nevertheless we feel it has
the potential to do long-term damage.''
</P>
<P>
   United has been plagued by thousands of cancellations and delays
since the contract with its pilots expired in April. Few pilots
have been willing to work overtime and there is no clause in that
contract that allows United to require pilots to do so. Since July,
when a contract with the mechanics expired, the airline has
reported an increase in maintenance delays. United is seeking
disciplinary action against 36 mechanics that it says participated
in a sickout in Los Angeles on the eve of the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   United has apologized for the scheduling problems and has
canceled about 3 percent of its 2,400 daily flights through
September and announced a reduced flight schedule for the fall.

<P>
   TAMARAC, Fla. _ They used their best Yiddish, not just the Jew
but the Southern Baptist as well. The band, a brassy if somewhat
anemic quintet (you were expecting the Rolling Stones?), played a
medley that ran from ``Rocky Top'' to ``Happy Days Are Here Again''
to ``Hava Nagila.'' And one adoring voter, a lady with silver hair
and red lipstick, told America's first Jewish vice presidential
nominee that kissing his hand was ``like kissing the Torah.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, campaigned in southeast Florida for the first time
Wednesday, setting off a frenzy at a largely Jewish community
center and making a firm statement that they would compete
aggressively in this critical state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how important Florida is,'' Lieberman told
the crowd that filled the 800-seat Cabaret Royale Theater in the
Kings Point Community Center and flowed over into an adjacent room.
``I honestly believe that Al Gore and I are going to win Florida
and as a result are going to win the election in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman were playing on long-established Democratic
terrain Wednesday in a state that is by no means the Democratic
stronghold it once was. But by traveling here _ Gore will be back
in the state on Monday _ the new Democratic team was able to test
its ability to excite party loyalists whose support will be vital
in November.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications, they succeeded, with a pitch that emphasized
their plans for a tax credit for long-term health care, for
prescription drug benefits under Medicare, and for protecting
Social Security. Their listeners rose to their feet with roars of
approval several times, some leaning on walkers and canes, and
mobbed the men after they finished.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Lieberman received an even warmer reception
than Gore. Some wept with pride as they greeted him. Others called
him a mensch. Sophie K. Gold, 72, said she was ``kvelling and
ecstatic'' when Gore selected Lieberman. ``I felt 10 feet tall,''
she said, ``and very skinny.'' Rep. Robert Wexler, who represents
this area, said that Lieberman was regarded as ``a rock star, like
Barbra Streisand'' in south Florida, and that his ability to turn
out votes would make the Democrats ``as competitive as anybody
could ever believe a Democratic ticket could be.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore and Lieberman did their best to speak the crowd's
language. Lieberman introduced Gore as a ``Yiddishe neshoma,'' a
Jewish soul. All the attention paid to his wife, Hadassah, and
Gore's wife, Tipper, he said, made the candidates feel like
``nuchshleppers,'' or afterthoughts. Gore, for his part, greeted
the crowd with a hearty ``shalom aleichem.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the Democrats were playing to voters
they had locked up well before the Lieberman selection. And in any
event, Jews comprised only 6 percent of the state's voters in 1996.
The most recent public polls, taken between the two party
conventions and before Gore's recent surge, showed Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas with a double-digit lead in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South
Florida, said she thinks the state is in play but would give a
slight edge to the Republicans. Gore, she said, is primarily
``coming to Florida to raise money and solidify his strongest
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   David Colburn, a historian at the University of Florida, said
Gore would have difficulty overcoming the popularity and
organizational might of Bush's brother, Jeb, the state's governor,
and in surmounting the state's business-oriented, anti-tax ethos.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, all indications are that Gore is making a serious play
for Florida. His aides argue that the resources they are devoting
to the state are too significant to be dismissed as a mere head
fake aimed at seducing Bush into wasting time and money here. On
Monday, Gore plans to travel to Tallahassee, where Jeb Bush sits as
governor, to discuss health care. Florida also is one of 17 key
states where the campaign is broadcasting its first television
advertisement, a biographical spot that began airing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush plans to visit Florida on Friday, and the
advertisements he began broadcasting this week also are airing in
Florida. ``We feel real good about our chances in Florida right
now,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is arguably the largest state that both campaigns view
as tightly contested. Gore holds an edge in California, a state
with 54 electoral votes that President Clinton and Gore won in both
1992 and 1996. New York, with 33 electoral votes, has been won by
Republicans only three times since 1960, and Clinton won the state
easily in the last two elections. Bush is expected to rout Gore in
his home state of Texas, which has 32 electoral votes. Two hundred
and seventy electoral votes are needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Florida, which has 25 electoral votes, and a history
of fickleness in presidential elections. The Democrats won the
state in 1996 and narrowly lost it in 1992. Once a Democratic
stronghold in local politics from the Panhandle to the Keys, the
state now has one U.S. Senator from each party, and its 23 member
congressional delegation includes 15 Republicans and eight
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Some Florida Democrats worried that Gore had signaled his
surrender in the state by not placing Sen. Bob Graham on his short
list of potential running mates. And Florida remains the locus of
what is considered, both inside and outside the Gore campaign, as
the vice president's most debilitating blunder _ his break with the
White House in calling for permanent resident status for Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where 18 percent of the population is 65 or older,
the largest proportion of elderly in any state, Gore used
Wednesday's appearance to promote his proposal for a $3,000 income
tax credit for long-term care. The credit would go either to
individuals whose disabilities or illnesses leave them unable to
care for themselves, or to family members who pay for their
relatives' care.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign estimates that up to 5 million Americans would
be eligible for the credit. Aides to Gore project that the
initiative would cost $27 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is one component of Gore's $500 billion menu of
targeted tax cuts that would take effect over the next decade and
would primarily benefit middle-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, would cut taxes by $1.3 trillion over 10
years, primarily through an across-the-board reduction in income
tax rates. The Bush plan includes a tax deduction for long-term
care insurance premiums, at a cost of $5.1 billion over five years,
and a new tax exemption, valued at $2,750, for each elderly spouse,
parent or relative that a caregiver tends to in the home. That
proposal would cost $2.3 billion over five years.

 &HT;    Georgians fighting Montana fires
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Montana _ For Bobby and Vickie Kitchens, the past few
weeks seem like a blur.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this month, the two retirees from the U.S.
Forest Service were lounging in the sun on Tybee Island when
Bobby's pager beeped. The message, in short, said their help was
urgently needed to combat the raging fires charring western
Montana, and please get there as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So Bobby, 61, and Vickie, 51, immediately headed home to
Acworth, Ga., hastily packed their recently washed fire clothes and
rushed to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The call was not unexpected. Since he officially retired in 1994
as head silviculturist for the Forest Service's southern regional
office in Atlanta, Bobby Kitchens has helped fight more than two
dozen fires in 20 states. And in several of those battles, Vickie,
a retired fire service dispatcher, has been with him.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other former and current Forest Service
workers across the country, Bobby Kitchens is certified for various
firefighting skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timber management was my day job; fire-fighting was my side
job,'' he quipped. ``Now that I've retired, I'm busier than ever
chasing fires.''
</P>
<P>
   And so for most of this month, he and Vickie have been among the
senior residents of a sprawling, 2,000-plus fire base camp about 60
miles south of Missoula and the rugged Bitterroot Valley, where
some of Montana's fiercest blazes are raging.
</P>
<P>
   They also are among scores of retired federal and state
government employees trained in firefighting who have donned work
clothes to help battle the worst wildfires the West has seen in
more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   At the fire base camp, Vickie has been documenting and filing
daily incident reports, while Bobby, a 32-year Forest Service
veteran, has been helping evacuate residents whose homes are at
risk, conducting community relations and helping coordinate
communications between firefighters in the field and at the base
camp.
</P>
<P>
   For the twosome, it has meant sleeping in a tent for most of
August, using a portable latrine the size of a telephone booth and
eating meals in a mess tent with hundreds of their fellow base camp
workers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we love it,'' said Vickie, as she and Bobby took a break
at the base camp this week inside a green canvas tent with a dusty
floor. ``It means that we don't sleep in our own beds as often as
we'd like, but we enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   What keeps Bobby coming back to fire after fire even in
retirement is what he said is the sheer adrenaline rush and the
adventurous nature of fighting wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when or where you'll be called,'' he said.
``But even more than that, you get the satisfaction of knowing that
you are helping people when they really need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he and Vickie were looking forward to returning home
this week for a few days of rest and relaxation. The Forest Service
requires a mandatory time off period about every two weeks for
personnel battling the flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my grandchildren,'' Vickie said. She and Bobby
have six grown children. Next week, however, the couple expects to
be back in Montana helping fight the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Wooster, heading home today, also is taking a few days
away from the smoke and heat of the Montana fires. ``But I'll
probably be back next Monday,'' he said. ``It looks like these
fires will be going through at least October.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooster is a certified wildlife biologist with the Chattahoochee
National Forest in North Georgia, but as a skilled firefighter he
is liable to be dispatched anywhere in the country to help put out
fires when they erupt.
</P>
<P>
   For most of August, he helped battle the Ryan Gulch fire about
30 miles east of Missoula that has blackened about 18,000 acres.
His main job at the base camp there is as a ``fire behavior
analyst,'' using weather information and other data to predict the
direction of the fire and determine how fast it is moving.
</P>
<P>
   He also has spent a lot of time in the rugged terrain of steep
mountain slopes on the frontlines. At the beginning of the week, he
and his colleagues slipped and slid down a precipitous slope to set
a backfire with kerosene torches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to fight fire with fire,'' he explained. ``This
area is going to get burned by the wildfire if we don't burn it
first; what we are trying to do is make it burn under our terms.
That way we can control it and keep the wildfire from spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   When the backburn was set, Wooster and his colleagues watched
the orange flames rapidly consume the ultra-dry vegetation. ``This
is a textbook backburn,'' Wooster said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the Ryan Gulch fire was mostly contained and fire
officials were planning to release some of the crews, helicopters
and bulldozers fighting that fire to battle other conflagrations
raging elsewhere in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance I'll be fighting another fire next
week,'' Wooster said.

 &HT;    Putting his best rap forward
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Wyclef Jean's work with his record-setting rap group the
Fugees _ or as producer on the Carlos Santana song ``Maria Maria''
_ didn't convince you of his abilities, consider ``The Ecleftic''
Exhibit C.
</P>
<P>
   As in strong evidence that no matter how frequent rap records
seem to speak only of material possessions of late, they can still
say something meaningful about relationships and real issues.
Though hip-hop originated simply, with two turntables playing bits
or samples of other records, this album is proof that it can still
move forward musically. And, yes, Fugee fans, it could even be one
of the points you use to contradict the oft-heard argument that
these solo records must stop, and the group _ 1999's big
Grammy-winning vocalist Lauryn Hill, Jean, and the seemingly
disposable Pras _ should get back together and record.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jean's Grammy-nominated solo debut ``Carnival'' was
released in 1997, he's produced R&AMP;B's Whitney Houston, rap's
Canibus and rock's Sinead O'Connor. So we shouldn't be surprised
that here he's still mixing it up: bringing in country's Kenny
Rogers (somewhat awkwardly on the elementary crowd-rouser ``Kenny
Rogers/Pharoah Monch Dub''); WWF wrestler The Rock (comically on
the dig at material rappers, ``It Doesn't Matter''); and veteran
soul band Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire (dynamically on the simplistic tale
about struggling lives, ``Runaway'').
</P>
<P>
   But seven songs later it's just Jean and his skillfully-played
electric guitar, lamenting last year's police shooting of a fellow
Haitian, the unarmed Amadou ``Diallo.'' After revealing what he can
bring out of others and other genres, the sometimes sleepy sounding
rapper turns rough-hewn reggae singer here, revealing ``The
Ecleftic'' one at his musical and lyrical best.
</P>

   ``One Alone''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brubeck. Telarc. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   It may not be until the sixth track of Dave Brubeck's first solo
piano release in five years that you wake up and realize that he's
still one of those singularly ingenious talents who can captivate
you playing all by himself. Until then, when ``Just Squeeze Me''
segues seamlessly through ``Harbour Lights'' to ``Things Ain't What
They Used To Be,'' it's not readily apparent that this release is a
gift to treasure. Throughout, Brubeck explores tunes best loved for
their vocal interpretations by the likes of Sinatra (``I'll Never
Smile Again''), Armstrong (``That Old Feeling'') and Ruth Etting
(``You've Got Me Crying''). But it's Brubeck's distinguished
virtuosity _ and the prospect of one day losing him _ that'll truly
bring a tear to the eye.

</P>
<P>
   Soundtracks are rarely the main event; so often these days the
music has no bearing on the film. But this collection of rarities
from one of the nation's most enduring folk troubadours is a
riveting exception. The music is the main event in the new
documentary about Jack Elliott, whose pioneering flat-picking
guitar style, cultivated Oklahoma twang and gritty cowboy folk
sound bridged the gap between Woody Guthrie (who influenced him)
and Bob Dylan (whom he influenced). Produced by his daughter,
Aiyana, the film and album feature stellar Elliott performances
with the likes of Dylan, Guthrie and Johnny Cash. While poor sound
quality tarnishes some of these tracks, on the whole, ``Ballad'' is
a worthy accounting of this living legend _ a man Bill Clinton
recently (and rightfully) called ``An American treasure.''

 &HT;    Growing up a subject for critics awards
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Georgia writer's memoir about growing up next to a junkyard
and a North Carolina author's novel about an Appalachian woman at
the turn of the century have won this year's awards from the
Southern Book Critics Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley resident Janisse Ray received the nonfiction award for
``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood'' (Milkweed, $19.95), which
combines natural history and autobiography. The environmental
activist has a graduate degree from the University of Montana and
has published essays and poems in several magazines and literary
journals.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction winner Robert Morgan's ``Gap Creek'' (Algonquin Books of
Chapel Hill, $22.95), which was picked for Oprah's Book Club, is
the story of Julia Harmon Richards and her difficult first year of
marriage. The 17-year-old bride faces death, sickness, starvation
and a number of natural and unnatural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's previous novels include ``The Hinterlands'' and ``The
Truest Pleasure.'' He teaches at Cornell University and will be a
visiting writer this fall at Appalachian State University in Boone,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented Oct. 13 at the Southern Festival of
Books in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New growth: Fans of Stephen King have been providing extra
doses of fertilizer to ``The Plant'' to keep the author's serial
Internet novel alive and well. Amazon.com, which is processing
payments for King, reports that some readers have been sending in
extra money for the $1 installments _ from $2 to $20 _ to make up
for deadbeat downloaders.
</P>
<P>
   As the second installment creeps onto the Web this week at
www.stephenking.com, 76 percent of the readers have upheld the
honor system and sent in their money.
</P>
<P>
   In the new chapter, aspiring author Carlos Detweiller,
distraught at having his novel rejected, retaliates by sending a
strange (and possibly flesh-eating) plant to the editors at Zenith
House.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up reader interest, King says he is considering making
future installments as much as six or seven times longer and
selling them for $2.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Busman's holiday: So what do publishing executives read when
they're on vacation? Publishing Trends newsletter surveyed some of
the major New York houses and found that most were reading books
from other publishers. Nina Hoffman, president of National
Geographic's Books and School Publishing Group, took along Anita
Shreve's ``The Pilot's Wife'' and Barbara Delinsky's ``The
Vineyard,'' but she also is reading the Harry Potter novels to
understand their appeal to adults. And what's on the list for the
folks at J.K. Rowling's publisher? Scholastic vice president
Michael Jacobs says he's reading ``Anil's Ghost'' by Michael
Ondaatje and ``A Good Walk Spoiled'' by John Feinstein. But, he
adds, he's listening to audio tapes of the Harry Potter books ``as
background music.''

 &HT;    Dinah Shore's rice pudding star of show
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several readers including Gisela Brooks of Decatur, Ga.,
unshelved their copies of ``Someone's in the Kitchen With Dinah''
to send in the rice pudding requested by D.C. Taylor of Piedmont,
Ala. Dinah Shore's cookbook, popular in the early '70s, includes
lots of celebrity name-dropping in notes about her favorite
recipes. The late singer said she first enjoyed this comforting
pudding at the Riviera in Las Vegas when she performed there. After
her second show, Vic Damone, who was performing elsewhere, stopped
by and ordered it. She asked the chef for the recipe and 10 years
later she got it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to our readers, Taylor had to wait only three weeks.

 &HT;    With some innovation, smoldering wood flavor can be added to
anything ... well, almost anything
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 10 years ago I cooked in a restaurant where the owner,
perhaps unwisely, encouraged me to indulge in whatever cooking
obsession was gripping me at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   So I surprised everyone one evening with a Russian fish pastry
called coulibiac. Tempura-fried everything in sight. And spent a
fortune on the Mexican seed paste achiote.
</P>
<P>
   I played and played. When I created the infamous cream of taro
soup with sweetbreads, I almost had my creative license revoked.
</P>
<P>
   But then I discovered stovetop smoking. And some really
delicious things started to come out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Like many chefs at the time, I realized that I didn't need to
invest in a full outdoor smoking rig in order to impart the sweet
flavor of smoldering wood. It was easy enough to find a large pan
with a fitted lid, enclose wood chips and foodstuffs inside, place
it over a flame, and let the smoke work its alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   I smoked chicken. Tomatoes. Onions and shallots. And I racked up
success after success.
</P>
<P>
   True, I couldn't make decent ribs or turkey breast on top of my
stove. Nothing that required hours of cooking time. The very best
dishes were the ones that trapped the quick, intense billows of
smoke in a compliant host. A creamy vinaigrette made with smoked
tomatoes and a salad outfitted with fat, glistening smoked oysters
became my signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken and salmon were good, as long as I partially cooked them
in smoke and finished them on the grill to retain their juices.
</P>
<P>
   I smoked and smoked. The designated smoking pan grew so black
with splotchy stains from the wood resin that we had to keep it
outdoors when we weren't using it or else it made the kitchen smell
like a smokehouse.
</P>
<P>
   After a while I tried smoking everything that wasn't nailed to
the floor or didn't run away in abject terror. I smoked ginger. I
smoked potatoes. And found absolutely nothing to do with them. I
knew my smoking craze was drawing to an end. And so I stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But I kept the recipes.

 &HT;    Nature's bonsai designs outshine human sacrifice
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners collect.
</P>
<P>
   By any means necessary, we will find a way to find a plant. We
beg for cuttings in the name of ``improving'' a friend's
``overgrown'' specimen, we ``rescue'' plants that seem threatened
(or out of place) where they're growing.
</P>
<P>
   I know gardeners who boast of the booty they get when flower
shows close and the stunning displays are given away. One friend
says he began a great rose garden with plants propagated from rose
stems he found in curbside trash.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of roses, the fine folks who sell plants at the Antique
Rose Emporium in Dahlonega, Ga., proudly call themselves ``rose
rustlers'' because they've propagated plants from roadsides and
abandoned homesteads and such. My favorite type, these are
sometimes called ``found'' roses.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us has not haunted nurseries, seeking a castaway plant
on its last stem, gasping for its last breath. Just before it is
relegated to the trash heap, we pounce, taking it home for a
pittance, loving not just the bargain but the challenge of nursing
it back to health, the thrill of accomplishing that.
</P>
<P>
   We who love bonsai are particularly keen on plants that
nurseries have a difficult time moving. Sell (or give) us your
gnarled, your stunted, your weird; they make great trees in trays.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the excitement of finding a little red pine at an
Atlanta nursery several years ago, figuring I couldn't afford it,
as it had a 5-inch trunk and was only about a foot high. When I saw
the price _ $12 _ I almost fell down rushing to the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   As good as such a find is, it doesn't approach what I saw
recently when I visited a bonsai garden in Lithonia, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Winchester found a great tree growing not at a nursery but
in the wild near his home. His cedar proves what so many of us
appreciate: Nature, the most extraordinary of designers, can make a
much better bonsai than can any ordinary expert using a roomful of
tools and a headful of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester, a maintenance worker at Georgia Perimeter College in
Dunwoody,Ga., had invited Jo Ann Yeager Adkins, Melanie and Michael
Brough, Marc Fitten and me to his garden on this blue-hot July
Sunday. As we strolled his rocky paths among the dusty miller,
petunias and celosia, we could see his devotion and work in the
aboveground displays of bonsai, including boxwood, pine, juniper
and bald cypress.
</P>
<P>
   Among the miniaturized trees and shrubs, that little found cedar
was the one that jumped into my attention. With fond recollection,
Winchester told us about it.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, with permission of the property owner,
Winchester went exploring and came upon two cedars. One had curled
around a rock, creatison, James Coburn and Robert Vaughn. And, of
course, McQueen, who was then the star of the TV western ``Wanted _
Dead or Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is an American version of the Akira Kurosawa classic,
``The Seven Samurai,'' with cowboys replacing samurai and rescuing
a tiny Mexican village from a rampaging Eli Wallach and his
marauding band of bandits. Reportedly, McQueen and Brynner didn't
get along, but Brynner huffily denied the rumors of a feud, saying,
``I don't feud with supporting players.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Blob'' (1958): Maybe not McQueen's finest movie but
certainly one of his most memorable. He was 28, but played a
high-school student who figures out how to defeat some deadly
Jell-O from outer space that, as one reviewer said at the time,
``eats you instead of the other way around.'' McQueen, who
considered himself a serious Broadway actor, was initially
reluctant to do the movie, but his first wife, Neile, assured him
it was so schlocky it would ``disappear at the drive-ins.'' To
McQueen's chagrin, the movie instead became a hit (it earned 30
times what it cost) and has remained a cult classic of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bullitt'' (1968): Before there was ``Ronin'' or ``The French
Connection'' or the zillion and one car chases that have inundated
movie screens in between, there was ``Bullitt's'' gravity-defying
hill-jumping chase through the streets of San Francisco. McQueen
plays a tough, goes-his-own-way police detective (sort of a
precursor to Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry) who's investigating the
death of a Mafia mobster. His old ``Magnificent Seven'' co-star,
Vaughn, is his nemesis, a suavely corrupt political type. A
gorgeous newcomer named Jacqueline Bisset (with whom McQueen
supposedly had an off-screen affair) is his girlfriend. The
convoluted plot is loosely based on a book called ``Mute Witness,''
but the car chase is what everyone remembers. That and how totally
cool McQueen looks in a black turtleneck.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Great Escape'' (1963): It's the Steve movie. The one
that showcases everything from McQueen's brash, mocking,
street-rebel attitude to his aptitude for riding motorcycles (even
though it's his pal, stuntman Bud Ekins, who actually does the big
60-foot jump over the barbed-wire fence.) The movie reunited a lot
of the ``Magnificent Seven'' cast (Coburn, Bronson) and added
talents such as James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Donald
Pleasance, Gordon Jackson and David McCallum. It's based on the
true story of a heroic escape attempt made by some Allied officers
from a German prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. While it
was being filmed, McQueen was convinced that Garner was stealing
the picture and would emerge the big star. Garner would have his
day _ his role presages his ``Rockford Files'' character _ but it
was McQueen who came out of ``The Great Escape'' a bona fide movie
star.
</P>
<P>
   Other McQueen movies worth checking out: ``The Cincinnati Kid''
(1965), ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' (1968), ``The Getaway'' (1972),
``The Reivers'' (1969) and ``Papillon'' (1973).

   Eleanor Ringel Gshion blends the interior with the outdoors via
glass and natural materials. ``I love being different.''
</P>
<P>
   The brick-and-redwood house, which the owners dubbed Sequoyah,
also lends the perfect backdrop for Dull's collection of
20th-century modern art.
</P>
<P>
   And Georgians will get to hang on to this rare gem among
Southern architecture, thanks to the efforts of the owners and
their interior designer, who persuaded them to revive it. The 1998
project, headed by Herbert Brito of the Atlanta design firm Brito
Serrato, has won a rehabilitation award from the Georgia Trust for
Historic Preservation. The house, among the youngest ever honored,
was cited as the state's best example of Wrightian architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so unusual for this city and this part of the
country,'' Baites said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia claims none of the 270 Wright homes worldwide, which
makes Sequoyah all the greater a treasure among the ubiquitous
traditional-style homes that line Atlanta's streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbert says we're ultimately custodians of things and only
pass them on to others,'' Dull said. ``That thought registered with
me as we took on the house, because in this city, it probably would
have eventually been torn down.''
</P>
<P>
   Brito stumbled onto the house on a tip from a friend and, had
the designer not just launched a major overhaul of his Midtown
condo, would have snapped it up for himself. Instead, he called his
friend Dull (rhymes with ``jewel''), who had been searching for
just the right house for his large-scale paintings, works of
mid-century artists such as Frank Stella and Robert Rauschenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he saw it he got so excited he postponed a business trip
to New York,'' Brito recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The house had Wright written all over it _ the tranquil setting
nestled on a wooded embankment along Tanyard Creek, the
cantilevered decks, the glassed-in corners, the built-in
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   And it should. In 1960, the house was then-24-year-old Green's
first, having just finished his training at Wright's famed studio
school, Taliesin. He designed it for banker Bill Copeland and his
family, the sole owners until Dull came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hadn't been lived in for a year so it was pretty much a
wreck,'' Dull said.
</P>
<P>
   Brito had met Green so he called him, and over lunch the two
pored over the architect's 40-year-old drawings. The house was in
good condition structurally but begged for updated kitchen and
baths. So the goals became to preserve the overall design while
accommodating the new owners' lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   They accomplished that not so much ripping out walls but honing
in on details. While the exterior went untouched, hundreds of feet
of expensive redwood shiplap planks covering interior walls and
ceilings were removed, recut and coded so they could be properly
replaced in the kitchen and other rooms that were remodeled. Brito
designed wooden heating vents to replace metal ones so they'd blend
with the floor. He also created redwood-faced panels to conceal
recessed lights, making the fixtures barely noticeable in the wood
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the only structural change had occurred in 1987 when
Green was called on to enclose an upstairs porch as a study.
(Baites, managing director for Georgia State University's Rialto
Center for the Performing Arts, uses it as a home office.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mission was to find even more space within the 3,800
square foot house while leaving the exterior intact. To ensure no
detail went overlooked, Brito, who has extensive preservation
experience, served as general contractor for the six-month project.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny kitchen was converted to a bar/service area, while the
adjacent family room provided a larger space for a new kitchen.
Upstairs, two of the four bedrooms were joined to make an office
for Dull, who works for Anderson Consulting. A linen closet was
reconfigured to enlarge the master bath.
</P>
<P>
   The three bathrooms were updated with all-natural materials,
including granite vanities, slate floors and beechwood cabinetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every board got taken down, but we reused every scrap,'' Dull
said. ``We recycled everything, including the old kitchen cabinets,
which we moved to the laundry room.''

   United Airlines Requires Overtime for Mechanics
</P>
<P>
   To help overcome delays and cancellations that have plagued it
this summer, United Airlines has issued an order requiring
mechanics at five airports to work overtime if asked. About 50 of
the airline's 10,000 mechanics have been working overtime in
Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and Indianapolis to try to make
sure that flights take off on time. An order, called an operational
emergency, was also issued in Denver, but no mechanics have been
asked to work overtime there. United and union spokesmen said the
airline does not often issue such an order. Shares of UAL, United's
parent, fell $1, to $47.63.

CAN'T SAY TUTU MUCH ABOUT BALLETS TROCKADERO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo may look nutty,
with its male ballerinas, over-the-top stage names and mostly witty
choreographic jokes. But on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, the
company presented the kind of dream repertory one seldom sees these
days. Although this second of two Joyce programs was mostly
classical ballet fare by the big guns of Russian and French ballet
in the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was also a dollop of
dance by that stalwart American avant-gardist Merce Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the program was a new staging by Elena
Kunikova of Alexander Gorsky's ``Russian Dance,'' set to music by
Tchaikovsky. Fetchingly danced by Vanya Verikosa, the solo
incorporated a running gag with the kind of white handkerchief that
features in such folk dances. What made the joke funnier was the
way Kunikova incorporated folk-style moves into picking up and
dropping the handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great pleasures of performances by the Trocks, as
they are affectionately known, is the exquisitely detailed
costumes. David Tetrault's gold and jewel-encrusted pinafore was
beautiful in itself, but the skirt rippled up to reveal a bright,
deep yellow underskirt that was a dazzling surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gonzales' costumes play an important part in the glittering
success of the Trocks' ``Paquita,'' staged by Kunikova after the
Petipa original. The tutus are a subtle rainbow of matte zinnia
colors that enhance the fundamental seriousness of this production.
The inept Igor Teupleze may look like Harry Potter as he wanders
cluelessly but amiably about the stage. But Olga Supphozova, the
company's reigning prima ballerina, proved that she is a seriously
accomplished dancer, rightly drawing cheers as she spun out what
looked like centuple multiple turns in the fouette section.
Supphozova also lives in her ballerina persona as she dances. One
reason audiences seem to love the Trocks so may well be that these
male ballerinas aim for the impossible with such success.
</P>
<P>
   The fine cast was completed by Sveltlana Lofatkina, Nadia
Rombova, a dogged little butterfly named Sylphia Belchick, and the
imposing Ida Nevasayneva.
</P>
<P>
   The dancing in Trutti Gasparinetti's staging of ``Le Grand Pas
de Quatre,'' an homage of sorts by Jules Perrot to four celebrated
ballerinas of the mid-19th century, is on the verge of becoming a
little broad. Less would definitely be more in Iona Trailer's
playing of Fanny Cerrito. Anya Marx is adorable as Lucile Grahn,
however, dancing with a sweetness that suggested why the Danish
ballerina, though contentious in her private life, was so acclaimed
on the stage. Fifi Barkova was amusingly stolid as Carlotta Grisi.
Nevasayneva, dancing the austere Marie Taglioni, protected her turf
with an awesomely chill ferocity that reminded one audience member
of every bad ballet teacher she had ever studied with.
</P>
<P>
   The evening opened with Gasparinetti's staging of the second act
of ``Swan Lake,'' which needs to lose a few of the pratfalls and
other ballet jokes, though its imitation of bad mime is hilarious.
The spunky little Maya Thickenthighya was a no-nonsense Odette,
with the artist formerly known as Prince Myshkin as her Prince
Siegfried. (Things tend to get complicated in Trockland.) Velour
Pilleaux, who bore a striking resemblance to Mme. Nevasayneva in
drag, was a silently cackling von Rothbart. He wore a red-and-black
cape that had the intricate dull glitter of jet beads, one of
Gonzales' most handsome designs.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham? He was represented by his 1964 ``Cross Currents,''
staged by Meg Harper and danced to taped and live music ``after''
Conlon Nancarrow and John Cage. The entertainingly grim danseuses _
Rombova, Gerd Tord and Nikolai Legupski _ were upstaged by the two
uncredited musicians, whose contributions of found sound included
the crackling of candy wrappers and the manipulation of a
free-hanging zipper at several speeds.  &QL;

LUGINBILL: LEAGUE'S ON THE `UP AND UP'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coach of the World Wrestling Federation-subsidized Los
Angeles professional football team, Mr. Al Luginbill, late of the
Amsterdam Admirals, is recalling that epic moment that would
inspire a storybook sporting season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Anaheim to watch an Arena Football League game back
in 1996 to check out a receiver,'' recalls Luginbill. ``But what
caught my eye was the quarterback for the Iowa Barnstormers. The
guy's passes were amazingly accurate, and he just seemed to know
what he was doing out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him after the season, but he told me he was
committed for another year with the Barnstormers. But I never
forgot him, and after the 1997 season I went after him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched him to 13 NFL teams, and only one, the St. Louis
Rams, expressed an interest in signing him. They did, and allocated
him to us. He had a terrific season in Amsterdam. We tied for the
league's championship with a 7-3 record, and two of the losses came
when he was out with an injury. I knew he was an exceptional
quarterback. But I must admit I never thought Kurt Warner would
have the kind of dream season he did last year for the Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was prouder of Kurt Warner's achievements than Al
Luginbill, who watched all his games at a sports bar near his Del
Mar condominium and even was invited by the Rams to be their guest
for their match against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt Warner seems to have what the John Unitases and Joe
Montanas had---tremendous game management,'' says Luginbill. ``He
has that knack for seeing everything on the field, and reacting to
what is happening. For sure, he's an accurate passer. But there are
a lot of accurate passers who simply don't understand how to play
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As he assumes control of a new team that will perform in Vince
McMahon's fledging league, Al Luginbill realizes there are skeptics
who believe that there will be staged shenanigans and contrived
gimmicks befitting a McMahon promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Will Luginbill engage in a feigned feud with Dick Butkus,
another head coach in the XFL? Will he rant and rave during
interviews like the pro wrestlers do? Will he stalk along the
sidelines and spew Hulk Hogan venom when he disagrees with an
official's edict?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way I'd have taken this job if everything weren't on the up
and up,'' says Luginbill, who coached in Amsterdam for six seasons
and also was the head man at San Diego State between 1989 and 1993
(he had a 31-25-3 record). ``Sure, there are going to be some
different rules in this league, like the man in motion toward the
line of scrimmage on offense and the no-fair catch rule on punts
and the no kicks for the extra points. But as far as the actual
game competition, it's going to be totally legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What caught my fancy about this league is that there is going
to be a level playing field. No one is going to have a financial
advantage like it was in the USFL (United States Football League)
when Donald Trump spent all that money to get good players for the
New Jersey Generals and George Allen did the same with the Chicago
Blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, all the players are going to making about the
same---$50,000---and there's going to be a pre-season draft. I'm
really excited for the opportunity to be involved in something I
can foresee as being a big success.''
</P>
<P>
   The energetic Luginbill---he's 54 but looks at least 10 years
younger---already has put together his coaching staff, and a Long
Beach institution, Dave Levy, will be in charge of the offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   A 1964 graduate of Corona High, Luginbill played football at Cal
Poly Pomona and was a head coach eight years at Pasadena City
College, guiding the school into the final Junior Rose Bowl in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as an assistant during two tours of duty at
Arizona State---he worked under Frank Kush and then Darryl
Rogers---before assuming control at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a coach who'll have a lot of rules, but I expect my
players to adhere to the ones I do have,'' says Luginbill. ``I want
my players to have fun. I see nothing wrong with guys celebrating
in the end zone after a score, but no way I want a guy celebrating
before he crosses the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also emphasize to my players that they're role models, and
that they must conduct themselves in a manner befitting their
status. If they don't, then they're off my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Lugbenbill was wearing a red XFL shirt when I had lunch with
him the other day, and his boss, J.K. McKay, the L.A. team's
general manager, wondered where he had obtained it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got it from the league office,'' said Luginbill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get me one,'' said McKay.
</P>
<P>
   Look for XFL apparel soon to flood the Southern California
market, if Vince McMahon has anything to say about it since NFL
paraphernalia has been lagging in the wake of the 1995 departures
of the Rams and Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job will be the to coach the L.A. football team,'' says
Luginbill. ``I know I'm going to be miked during games, and that
everything I say has the potential to be heard on TV. I can't worry
about that. What I'm concerned about right now is finding me
another Kurt Warner.''

By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across an expanse of 20-odd years, the glistening pop of
Marshall Crenshaw still shines sweetly, music with smarts and hooks
and, wow, a beat you can even dance to sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's guitar-dominated, and it all starts with wanting to play
the guitar in the first place,'' Crenshaw said. ``It's like highly
nuanced, finely detailed, cool rock music, sort of, with really
good rhythms and just sort of adventurous and different sonic
textures from album to album, intelligent, groovy, passionate
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the album that first put Crenshaw on the pop firmament, his
eponymous debut augmented with several tracks, and a crackerjack
retrospective called ``This Is Easy: The Very Best of Marshall
Crenshaw,'' are hitting store shelves, while Crenshaw himself is
hitting the stage in a show tonight in Santa Monica's McCabe's
Guitar Shop.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been a chance for Crenshaw to review fruits of a
rewarding _ artistically if not always commercially _ career,
starting with that first album, which came out in 1982 to
overwhelmingly positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who really love that record,''
Crenshaw said. ``I'm pleased about that, because it's been a long
while now since I made it and it's stood a test of time. I really
love it. It did make a big impact in its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Crenshaw isn't entirely happy with his work on that
first effort, despite the hosannas it received (and continues to
garner _ Daily News reviewer Glenn Whipp gave the reissue a
highest-possible four stars this week).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raw and unformed as a singer, kind of groping vocally on
some of those tracks,'' he said. ``I have these criticisms of it,
but I'm fond of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Crenshaw was writing the songs for his first album,
he was ``kind of rediscovering and dealing with a lot of rock `n'
roll stuff I'd loved in my childhood,'' he said. ``I was really
listening to a lot of rockabilly and getting back into stuff I knew
during childhood and was getting back to it as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been working as the understudy of the John Lennon
character in ``Beatlemania,'' on both the national tour and in runs
in Los Angeles and San Francisco. And it is the Beatles and Buddy
Holly and some of the earlier rock that influenced his writing of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   He took the big, open sounds and smacking rhythms of that music
and tried to adapt them to a more modern context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the time I was getting there, I think,'' he said. ``I
had this real set idea of song structure, just bam-bam-bam and no
wasted motion. I did that for a while, but after about 20 songs
within those parameters, I had to bag it and throw away the rule
book.''
</P>
<P>
   With his second album, ``Field Day,'' he began exploring
different approaches, not always to the glee of fans he'd collected
with his debut. ``Field Day'' still had a couple of songs left over
from his earlier songwriting phase, including the transcendent
``Whenever You're on My Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``For Her Love,'' another leftover of that initial
songwriting rush, ``really felt like I had to force it,'' Crenshaw
said. So he began trying other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could compose melodies really easily, and could go as deep
emotionally with (lyrics) as I could and stretch out,'' Crenshaw
said. ``That was the direction I went in 'Field Day.' I really
caught a ton of (grief) from people for the way my second album
sounded. But it was just a really great representation of my tastes
then.''
</P>
<P>
   He recorded five albums for Warner Bros. and another for MCA,
put out a collection of demos, a live album and two more recent
studio albums for the independent Razor &AMP; Tie.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he's played with artists such as Don Dixon, the
BoDeans and Was (Not Was); had his songs covered by artists as
diverse as Bette Midler and the Gin Blossoms; acted in ``Peggy Sue
Got Married'' and as Buddy Holly in ``La Bamba''; and helped put
together a book of good and bad rock movies called ``Hollywood Rock
&AMP; Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 46, Crenshaw said the best-of collection, which Rhino is
also releasing, is another source of great pride, a chance for even
him to look back on his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually got really excited about it when it was all
mastered,'' Crenshaw said. ``I got my reference CD and listened to
it on a long plane ride home. I was just happy to hear it. It's a
really good body of work. I don't listen to my stuff, and I forget
what it sounds like. But there's a lot of different textures and
tracks as you go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, with two children less than 4 years old and a place
in New York City, he leads a very different life than in the
knock-around years before he finally got serious about songwriting
in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being here, being back in the city, I'm taking in a lot
of information, and different kinds of information,'' Crenshaw
said. ``Kids change what I listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after reading that some kinds of music can improve
learning skills for young children, he started playing more jazz
and orchestral music, especially great pianists such as Bill Evans
and Fats Waller.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he'll always be a rocker, with none of the classical
and operatic pretensions of quasi-contemporary pop craftsmen such
as Paul McCartney, Pete Townshend, Joe Jackson and Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really drawn in that direction,'' Crenshaw said. ``The
first thing I always deal with when I write songs is the rhythm:
What's the tempo, what's the groove, what's the feel?''
</P>
<P>
   The past couple of years, he's been touring a lot on the East
Coast, often doing solo shows because he is ``really big on the
simplicity of the solo stuff. I don't have to cut any checks (for
other musicians). I don't have to worry about who's going to be the
bass player that night.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's pretty content, Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense of satisfaction now about it,'' Crenshaw said.
``Until I did this `Best of,' I had this ambivalence about the
records I've made. But now I just sort feel like it's a good body
of work. It's all kind of resolved for me at this point.'' &QL;

NEW YORK RUSTLERS CAUGHT WITH FIBERGLASS COW IN JEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)   By ELISSA GOOTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 500 life-size fiberglass cows that arrived on New
York City streets in June have inspired impassioned opinions. Some
people welcome the playful bovines, with their imaginative designs
by local artists. Others consider the whole cow parade thing just a
hokey import from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the cows inspired some old-fashioned rustling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cow Hands,'' one of the fiberglass creatures in town for the
cow parade, and apparently the ideal tool for a practical joke, was
unfastened from its concrete base at West Houston Street and La
Guardia Place early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrived as ``Cow Hands'' was about to be loaded into
a blue Jeep Cherokee. The officers found Patrick Kraft, 24, of East
Windsor, N.J., and Michael Macisco, 23, of Stratford, Conn.,
apparently clearing their Jeep to make way for the cow, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got closer to the Jeep, I could see that a statue of a
cow'' was leaning against it, Detective Andrew McDermott said.
While the two men were caught cow-handed, the police said, they
initially denied having anything to do with the blue and purple
stray, covered with white handprints.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said the two soon confessed that they were plotting a
practical joke. They told the police that they were probably going
to station ``Cow Hands'' in front of a friend's Manhattan home,
although they were also toying with other ideas, the detective
said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they even considered placing the cow in front of a
vegetarian restaurant, McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon, ``Cow Hands'' stood silently in the
Sixth Precinct station house, on West 10th Street, where she was to
be kept for 48 hours as evidence. Her green eyes pointed at the
front desk, which she appeared poised to charge. A stolen-property
invoice was fastened to her back with masking tape.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping a Polaroid picture for the station house scrapbook,
Officer Jon Goldin shook his head, saying that when he first saw
the cow at the station house, he figured it was a prop in a
publicity stunt. ``Well, that's life in a big city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bounty is hefty. Officials from the city and CowParade
Holdings, the parade organizers, were hoping that ``Cow Hands''
would fetch between $20,000 and $50,000 at an auction planned for
Sept. 28, whose proceeds are to be donated to six charities. Jerome
Elbaum, the president of CowParade Holdings, said a similar auction
in Chicago last year fetched an average price of $35,000, and the
most sought-after cow went for $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cow Hands'' was painted by the artist Edwina Sandys, who is
Winston Churchill's granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my best,'' Sandys said Wednesday, shortly after
learning of the attempted theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the punishment should be for such a crime,''
Sandys mused, suggesting that the suspects do time ``working on a
farm or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said the two men were charged with grand larceny,
criminal possession of stolen property and criminal mischief, all
in the third degree.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cow parade began in June, about 50 of the 500 cows
have been damaged, Elbaum said, most from ``enthusiasm,'' some from
vandalism. In late June, the police discovered that the colorful
``Moo-Stripa'' cow had been removed from her spot in Forest Park,
in Richmond Hills, Queens. ``Moo-Stripa'' has since been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the police arrested three New York teen-agers for a
decidedly rural form of mischief: cow-tipping, in John Jay Park in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said,
``Given the fact that on any given day you have 11 million people
in the city, the way in which the cows were treated was very
respectful.''

 &HT;    Simple stovetop method is really smokin'
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a good amount of trial and error, I've devised this basic
method for stovetop smoking that works on all the following
recipes. Only the cooking times vary.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Soak wood chips in water for 10 minutes and drain. I don't
care for the resiny flavor of mesquite, so I always use hickory
chips.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lay the chips out in the bottom of the designated smoking pot.
The chips should cover the bottom in a shallow layer _ 2 or 3 cups
should be plenty for any pot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cover the chips with a piece of aluminum foil _ heavy gauge is
best. Poke the foil with a small knife or skewer to create several
dozen slits. (The holes allow juices to drain to the bottom.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add food to be smoked in a single layer and cover with a
tight-fitting lid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Place pot directly on one or two (depending on size) burners
set on medium-high. The food should smoke at least 5 minutes for
flavor, but no more than 20 lest the burning wood turn the smoke
acrid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wait one minute before removing the lid or you'll get a blast
of smoke in your face.
</P>
<P>
   SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Smoked Tomato Dressing
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Cooking time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   If there is one recipe on this page that could turn anyone into
a true believer in stovetop smoking, this is it. Talk about
versatile: This creamy, intriguing vinaigrette is sweet and tangy
like coleslaw dressing and would make a super change of pace on
shredded cabbage. Yet it stands up to bitter gourmet greens like
Belgian endive and radicchio. And, like all creamy dressings, it
loves nothing more than ice-cold iceberg and romaine, especially
with some blue cheese scattered on top. Then again, it's wildly
delicious on grilled fish.
</P>
<P>
   5 Roma tomatoes, halved
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons peeled ginger, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt (or 1/2 teaspoon table salt)
</P>
<P>
   1 egg or pasteurized egg (or 2 liquid ounces egg substitute)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Smoke the halved tomatoes for 10-12 minutes, using the technique
described above. When smoke has subsided, remove tomatoes and
transfer to a mesh strainer and place over bowl or sink. Let drain
for 10 minutes, until barely warm. Transfer to blender and add
ginger; blend 1 minute on high. Add vinegar, sugar, salt and egg;
blend 1 minute on high. With motor running, carefully remove
blender lid and drizzle in oil, slowly at first. Blend until pale
and creamy. Strain to remove skins, seeds and ginger bits. Chill at
least 30 minutes before serving.

   Chef Paul Albrecht of Chef Paul's in Destin, Fla., gives salmon
an extraordinary flavor by lightly smoking it first, then grilling
it. Asian seasonings in the marinade play nicely against a plum
tomato vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size zucchini
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size carrot
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size yellow squash

   Plum Tomato Vinaigrette (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   Cut zucchini, carrot and squash in strips the size of fettuccine
noodles and cook in salted water for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
tender; drain, then toss in sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, marinate salmon fillets for five minutes in teriyaki
sauce. While salmon is marinating, prepare smoker. Smoke for 5
minutes, then wait 5 minutes before removing lid.
</P>

   Smoked Chicken With Goat Cheese Stuffing
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 2 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 30-40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This chicken mostly finishes cooking in the smoker by the time
the skin turns golden brown _ after 18-20 minutes. Then it comes
out of the smoker and cools for a few minutes at room temperature
until easy to handle. You then stuff soft goat cheese under the
skin and finish cooking it in the oven. It emerges crisp,
crackling, juicy and captivating. Warm, Spicy Black Bean Salsa
(recipe above right) makes a wonderful bed for it, but this chicken
stands on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Legs are easy to stuff, but breasts take a little practice.
There is a neat trick: A thin membrane attaches the skin to the
meat, and if you don't puncture it, you can slide a good amount of
stuffing underneath. Always begin by wriggling your fingers under
the skin on the thick breastbone side and move toward the thin
backbone side.
</P>
<P>
   1 whole chicken (4-5 pounds, cut up)
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces (1 small log) soft, fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   Kosher or sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground coarse black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the stovetop smoker with soaked wood chips and aluminum
foil. Place the chicken pieces on top, cover and smoke over
medium-medium high heat for 18-20 minutes, or until the chicken is
bronzed and the internal temperature of the breasts registers 150
degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from smoker and let
cool to room temperature. Preheat oven to 375.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff each piece of chicken under the skin with 1 ounce goat
cheese. Sprinkle skin with coarse salt and pepper. Roast in oven
for 12-15 minutes, until internal temperature of chicken registers
at least 160 degrees.

   You can make this salsa ahead and reheat it in a saucepan. It is

   I first ran this recipe in another newspaper, though I figured
few people would try it. Wrong. The last letter I got was two years
later, where one reader said the oysters had become an integral
part of her family Christmas dinner. If you like tinned smoked
oysters, these are a sensational step up.
</P>
<P>
   The oysters are first purified in salt, a time-honored Asian
technique that renders them sweet and clean. They are briefly
smoked to cook, then immediately immersed in olive oil flavored
with garlic and herbs. They can then be served over salad greens,
blended with cream cheese for a dip, tossed into a pasta or _ best
yet _ presented elegantly with a red pepper horseradish sauce
(recipe below).
</P>
<P>
   2 pints shucked Pacific oysters (the largest you can find)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 head garlic, cut in half lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   2 large sprigs fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2 large sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Drain the oysters and toss in a bowl with the salt. Let stand 5
minutes. Rinse very thoroughly in a strainer under running water.
Place the oysters in a single layer in the stovetop smoker and
smoke over medium-high heat for 8 minutes. During that time, place
the olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs in a large, heatproof bowl.
Transfer the hot oysters to the oil and let steep until they reach
room temperature. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until
ready to use. The oysters will keep for several days, as long as
they are immersed in the oil.

her, calling her a ``pastatarian'' rather than a vegetarian, as her

   Teenagers (and older folks) choose vegetarianism for a variety
of reasons, from health concerns to ethical decisions to simply
wanting to fit in with friends who are vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   But for far too many teenagers (and some older folks), the term
vegetarian refers much more to what they don't eat rather than what
they do eat.

pepperoni off the pizza,'' said Lauren Butts, 16, author of ``OK,
So Now You're a Vegetarian'' (Broadway Books, $12.95). To aid new
vegetarians, Butts, working with nutritionist Donna Shields, offers

 &HT;    Candidate pushes socialism in presidential bid
 &HT;    By Saeed Ahmed
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like most third-party candidates, James Harris harbors
no illusions of winning the White House in November. But in his
case, he says it's because he doesn't want to, since real change is
never effected through votes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet here he is, traversing the country _ on leave from his
job as a garment worker in Decatur, Ga., _ and calling on workers
to overthrow the capitalist system in favor of a socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is the presidential candidate for the Socialist Workers
Party, which espouses a brand of politics fashioned after Cuban
leader Fidel Castro's style of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It serves the purpose of the rich capitalist class to entrap
workers in the two-party system,'' he said, of his decision to run.
``We are the independent alternative, advancing the interests of
the working people.''
</P>
<P>
   For 52-year-old Harris, it's his second run at the White House.
In 1996, he finished 10th in the general election, garnering 8,500
votes _ about 0.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he hopes to do better, even though he's on the ballot
in only 11 states _ the same ones as the last time. Georgia, with
its tough ballot access laws, isn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harris is making a three-day swing through the state this
week, capping it off with a rally at Valdosta State University this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's rights, civil rights and the end of apartheid didn't
happen because they were put to a vote _ they started on the
streets,'' he said. ``That's why we are going to states where we
aren't on the ballot to build up a groundswell because we know we
won't be voted in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist Workers Party, which started in 1938 as a splinter
group from the Communist Party, has fielded candidates for
president in every election since 1948. In recent years, it has
been in electoral decline, capturing a dwindling number of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The party's platform calls for basic human rights for all, such
as universal health care, redistribution of wealth and free
education. It touts Cuba as a model socialist state, and calls for
dismantling the military and arming farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the mix, the Socialist Party _ which preaches the same
liberal doctrine but is staunchly anti-Communist _ and parties with
similar sounding names, such as Socialist Equality Party, Socialist
Labor party and even Nationalist Socialist White People's Party,
and it's easy to see why Harris' campaign has to strain to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Harris, a Cleveland State University graduate who
works blue-collar jobs as part of the party mandate to better
organize workers, is confident about his chances of bringing about
change through his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I will give a big speech and all of a sudden
there will be an explosion of activity,'' he said. ``But workers
won't take this brutal assault by the wealthy minority forever.
They are being pushed to the limit and they will fight back, and
we're an adjunct to the participants to spur it on.''

BUSH SEEMS A LITTLE OFF TRACK IN WAKE OF DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Political Memo) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush was supposed to be spending
this week focusing on education, the issue with which his campaign
is seeking the support of women and independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first days on the trail after the two parties'
conventions, he instead found himself reaching for big numbers and
defending his proposed tax cut in a manner that came across as
reactive and not entirely coherent.
</P>
<P>
   In that, and other ways, the brief period following the
Democratic National Convention has not been entirely flattering to
the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Following Vice President Al Gore's fiery pledge at the
Democratic National Convention on Thursday night to fight long and
hard for the presidency and the people he wanted to serve, Bush had
his chance to reclaim the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, his one public event was over by mid-afternoon,
and the high point on his remaining schedule was a run along one of
his favorite trails in allas. On Monday, after a day off, he told
reporters that one of the pleasures of his break was taking a nap.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he added, ``Went to bed relatively early.''
</P>
<P>
   While this sort of thing represents a mere snapshot in time _
and comes in the two weeks before Labor Day, not the two weeks
before Election Day _ it has exposed some of the Texas governor's
weaknesses and quirks at a juncture when small impressions can
sometimes take on big significance as the attention to both
candidates intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said Wednesday that they were not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   One of them acknowledged that the Texas governor's largely
unprompted defense of his sweeping tax-cut proposal on Tuesday,
coupled with his admission that he needed to do a better job of
pitching it, had thrown the campaign off its chosen message.
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser said that the campaign would be back on track
later this week, with new education proposals on Thursday and a new
speech on international relations on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this happen,'' the adviser said. ``It's
overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said, ``If you look at our bad days versus our
good days, I'll take that equation any day.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The great thing about this campaign is that it
always takes the long view.''
</P>
<P>
   These advisers and others said they had always expected the rise
in Gore's poll numbers and that the news media's spotlight on
anything and everything that looks like a sign of trouble in Bush's
campaign was an equally predictable part of the ever-shifting
dynamics of the race.
</P>
<P>
   But that equanimity itself raised questions.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's advisers have taken great pains recently to talk
about how many states he planned to visit in late August, a
preliminary schedule for the next week and a half showed Bush
taking three days off of the campaign trail this weekend, traveling
just three days next week and then taking another three days off
before Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself makes frequent comments about resting and sleeping
and a sensible pace, concerns that do not exactly portray him as a
ball of fire. His advisers sought to frame this as an advantage,
saying it casts him as a sensible man not utterly consumed by
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore runs the risk of looking like he's just an absolute,
total political animal,'' one adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's acknowledgement that he had to sell his suggested tax
cut more forcefully than he has so far pointed to a different
problem: that a proposal that resonated with the Republican base in
the primaries could give pause to swing voters in the general
election. Many polls suggest that a tax cuts is low on a majority
of voters' wish lists.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was discussion in Bush's campaign before he made
that proposal last year about whether the size of it _ $1.3
trillion over 10 years _ was too large, Bush has promoted his plan
as a matter of unswerving principle and economic justice, and both
he and his advisers said he would not retreat from it.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democratic pollsters said that their research indicates
that voters, while happy to have some tax cuts, particularly for
middle-class Americans, worry about the effect of a large, broad
one on Social Security, Medicare and the economy in general. ``Bush
has walked into a significant trap of his own making on this,''
said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   And one Republican strategist in Washington who sometimes
advises the Bush campaign conceded, ``What's Bush going to do? No
matter how hard he pushes his tax plan, it doesn't seem to catch
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republican strategists and pollsters said that a
basic appetite among Americans for tax cuts was obvious in the fact
that Gore has offered a proposal totaling $500 billion over 10
years, and that Bush simply needed to push his plan in more
deliberate ways.
</P>
<P>
   During long stretches of time on the stump, especially recently,
he has often cast it in broad, ideological terms. John McLaughlin,
a Republican pollster, said that Bush ``has got to sell this as a
kitchen-table, pocketbook issue: This is what it means to  &UR; you &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Bush campaign said that there were ample
signs that voters' desires for tax cuts had sharpened with
expanding surplus projections, especially if those voters were
convinced that cuts did not endanger entitlement programs like
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Bush's unprompted defense of his tax cut this
week was an attempt to explain how spending and surplus projections
over the next week enabled him to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   But he stumbled over his numbers in a speech on Monday night and
then, when he revisited the topic with reporters on his campaign
plane the next day, went through the issue so quickly and
elliptically that aides had to come back to provide more detail on
his arithmetic, which turned out to be well in line with estimates
by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   And that underscored a potentially larger concern for the Texas
governor, which has been on intermittent display since the
Democrats' convention: when he departs from the scripted eloquence
of a stump speech (and, sometimes, when he mangles the words within
it), he can seem fuzzy on specifics, less than forceful in his
thinking, tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute he tries to get deep into the weeds, a la Al Gore,
who's excellent there, it runs counter to his personality,''
acknowledged one adviser.

MARKETPLACE: HOME HEATING OIL PRICES SURGE ON SUDDEN DROP IN
INVENTORIES
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers received another dose of bad news on the energy front
Wednesday as an unexpected decline in crude oil inventories sent
home heating oil prices to their highest in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising drop was reported in two surveys, one by the
American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, and one by the
U.S. Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday. On the
New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for October
delivery jumped 80 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $32.02 a barrel, while
the price of heating oil for September delivery rose 5.26 cents, or
5.8 percent, to 95.61 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   What this means for this winter is still hard to predict. But
the average price of home heating oil this month is 52.5 percent
more than it was in August 1999 and 23 percent above the average
for last fall and winter. And although last fall and winter were
warm by historical standards, the average cost of home heating oil,
based of the futures price, was the third-highest since the winter
of 1989-90 and missed being second-highest by less then two-tenths
of a cent.
</P>
<P>
   By examining some of the factors that will affect the price of
crude oil and home heating oil, one can, at the least, get a sense
of what will make for a really bad winter or where some relief _ in
addition to more OPEC oil _ can come from.
</P>
<P>
   One way to do this is to look at the winter of 1996-97. That was
the last time that distillate oil stocks, from which home heating
oil is made, were even tighter than they are now. According to the
American Petroleum Institute, there were 106.1 million barrels of
distillate in inventory at this time in August 1996, compared with
the current inventory of 111.1 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   At this time in August 1996, the price of home heating oil was
around 60 cents a gallon and on its way to a peak of 76.49 cents a
gallon in October. That price was not surpassed until last winter,
after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries curtailed
its production to push crude oil prices back up from lows of less
than $11 a barrel to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   A very cold fall in 1996 helped keep the price of home heating
oil bouncing up back near the October high. According to the
Northeast Regional Climate Center in Ithaca, N.Y., that fall in the
Northeast was the 15th coldest since 1895.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure was let off as the actual winter turned out to
be one of the warmest ever, the 11th warmest, according to the
Northeast Regional Climate Center. By the end of January, when the
weather pattern was becoming apparent, the price of home heating
oil began to plunge, falling as low as 52.54 cents a gallon on
March 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that fall and winter had the second-highest average home
heating futures price since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   If it is cold this fall, ``the price can go very high,'' said
Irene King, the senior markets analyst at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the high cost of natural gas, which jumped
8.5 cents Wednesday, to $4.605 per million British thermal units,
will probably lead many companies that have the ability to do so to
switch to distillates. That would put more pressure on heating oil
supplies and prices. Natural gas inventories themselves are near
six-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fall and winter weather and what happens to
inventories in that time, the politics of the U.S. presidential
election and the politics and production problems within OPEC will
be the other big factors affecting how much it will cost to keep
warm this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is again mentioning the possibility
of using oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
help push prices lower. And the connections of the Republican
ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to the oil industry will
add a spotlight to the issue this fall, especially if it is cold.
</P>
<P>
   Within OPEC, the key player, in terms of possible relief, is
still Saudi Arabia, which pretty much went out on its own to pump
more oil as oil prices rose earlier this summer. So far, strong
demand has kept oil inventories surprisingly tight, offsetting the
benefit of that extra production.
</P>
<P>
   Many oil analysts think that the rising price of crude oil,
which is just below its decade high of $34.13, and heating oil will
put added pressure on the OPEC members to agree to pump more oil
when they meet in Vienna in early September.
</P>
<P>
   The members have already agreed on an informal trigger for the
pumping of more oil: If crude oil stays above $30 a barrel for West
Texas intermediate, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, for 20
consecutive trading days.
</P>
<P>
   But oil politics could make OPEC members ignore this mechanism
or work to get the price just below the trigger level just long
enough to force the beginning of another 20-day period. One reason
that many OPEC members are not interested in approving an increase
in production is that they are already pumping at full capacity.
Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, oil analysts say,
have the ability to increase their current production levels of
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Wednesday that he would discuss the high
oil price this weekend when he meets with President Olusegun
Obasanjo of Nigeria, a member of OPEC. In comments to reporters in
Washington, Clinton indicated that he understood that capacity
restraints within OPEC are a problem. ``We have to look at where
there is excess capacity,'' he said, adding that ``this is a
question of whether the OPEC nations can increase their
production.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I'm going to do what I can to keep these prices
moderated and to continue to argue to all the OPEC nations that if
the price gets too high they will cause recession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil price,'' he said, ``needs to be, I think, in the low
$20s somewhere.''

NTSB CLOSES THE BOOK ON FLIGHT 800 
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday
approved its final report on the crash of TWA Flight 800 and issued
four safety recommendations to help prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote of the five-member board after a two-day
public meeting wrapped up the longest and most expensive
investigation in the agency's 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 800, involving a 25-year-old Boeing 747, was bound for
Paris on July 17, 1996, when it broke apart in midair off Long
Island minutes after taking off from Kennedy International Airport.
All 230 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Washington, the board endorsed the findings of
investigators that a mixture of fuel and air in the airplane's
nearly empty center wing fuel tank blew up after being heated into
an explosive state by the sun and air-conditioning packs attached
to the outside of the tank. Though investigators never found what
ignited the explosion, they said the source was most likely a short
circuit that created a surge of electricity in a low-voltage wire
attached to a fuel gauge inside the tank.
</P>
<P>
   Before voting on the report, board members reviewed the accounts
of eyewitnesses, some of whom believe they saw a missile hit the
jet and have accused the board of ignoring their reports.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Mayer, who led the board's examination of eyewitness
accounts, said that most of the witnesses were too far away to see
the initial explosion of the jet's center fuel tank. He said that
those who saw a flash of light resembling a missile were really
seeing the crippled jet as it broke apart and caught fire, taking
nearly a minute to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Accident investigators who have spent years searching for what
sparked the explosion said the airlines and airplane manufacturers
had not paid enough attention to the condition of electrical wiring
on older aircraft like the one involved in the 1996 accident.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, the safety board chairman, ordered a report by
Nov. 15 to determine whether there is a correlation between
aircraft age and the frequency of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The four safety recommendations issued on Wednesday call for
improved training of maintenance personnel about potentially unsafe
wiring conditions in aircraft and for several actions to limit
possible sources of ignition in fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The board previously issued 11 other recommendations as a result
of the Flight 800 investigation; 90 percent of them have already
been acted upon by the Federal Aviation Administration, the board
said.

<P>
   BOSTON _ New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft tied his team's
image securely to the Internet Wednesday when he proclaimed that
the team's new stadium would be called CMGI Field.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft announced that CMGI Inc., the Andover-based Internet
giant, won the bidding war for naming rights to the stadium,
scheduled to open in 2002, with its offer of $7.6 million a year.
The annual payment equals the largest NFL naming deal to date,
FedEx Corp.'s 27-year contract with the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft said the chief reason he chose CMGI was not the money,
but CMGI founder and chief executive David Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Wetherell, an icon of the Internet community,
heads a network of nearly 70 Internet-related businesses, such as
AltaVista and Engage and controls a stake in dozens of other
companies, including the search engine Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Wetherell saw the opportunity of the Internet and went
on to create a portfolio of companies that touches every aspect of
our economy,'' Kraft said Wednesday. ``We feel that vision and
drive mirrors our goal with the Patriots. And for our fans, who've
put up with a substandard facility for almost 30 years, this
partnership signals the dawn of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Patriots new $325 million stadium is privately
financed, the funds garnered from naming rights are crucial to the
team's ability to maintain a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   And while the rigors of New England's weather will delay the
introduction of so-called ``smart seat technology'' for a few
years, the new partnership is eventually expected to allow Patriots
fans in the new stadium to call up player statistics and view
instant replays from another camera angle on small seatback
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But what does Wetherell, a wunderkind of the New Economy, hope
to gain by spending $120 million for a 15-year naming rights
contract at a football stadium in Foxborough?
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell argues it's a cost-effective way for CMGI, the state's
seventh-largest public company in terms of stock market value but a
cypher to most consumers, to create brand identity. It also offers
the company a foothold in one of the most explosive growth
opportunities on the Web: sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``By partnering with the Patriots and the NFL, the number one
sports league in the world in terms of marketing, we are obtaining
an unmatched brand-awareness opportunity,'' Wetherell said.
</P>
<P>
   Team vice chairman Jonathan Kraft, who became friends with
Wetherell when the two men served on the board on an Internet
company several years ago, noted that NFL games are watched by more
than 100 million Americans each weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When the league's international media exposure is factored in,
it's estimated that the name CMGI Field will be seen or publicly
mentioned more than 2.6 billion times each year _ at a cost of less
than 2 percent of CMGI's annual advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, corporations have been able to build up their
brand names slowly,'' Kraft said. ``But with the Internet, you have
companies that didn't exist a few years ago generating billions of
dollars in revenues on international basis. They need to look at
strategies that can create global awareness almost overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By putting its name on a NFL stadium, a company will be woven
into the fabric of pop culture in this country,'' Kraft said.
``Halfway through the football season, everyone will know the name
CMGI.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, high-tech companies have increasingly sought instant
status by buying the right to name a sports facility, dramatically
increasing the prices. PSINet, a Virginia-based computer-services
company, is paying $5.25 million a year to put its name on the
Baltimore Ravens new nest. Qualcomm, 3Com, PacBell, and Ericsson
also are now known as stadiums as well as high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, CMGI shareholders appeared eager to see the company's
name in lights. While the Nasdaq was up just 1 percent, shares of
CMGI were up 16 percent. Shares rose $6.19 to $43.94 in trading of
13.4 million shares, more than twice the company's three month
average. Aside from the Patriots deal, no other company news was
released Wednesday, CMGI officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A former mathematics major who founded CMGI when he took a small
textbook direct marketing company known as College Market Group
public in 1994, Wetherell is seen as having a particular genius for
on online marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether CMGI would buy naming rights for the Red
Sox new ballpark, Wetherall, a fanatic baseball player in his
youth, demurred.``I think there will be a backlash to renaming
Fenway Park,'' he said. ``Like a lot of people, I think it would be
great if the team could find someone who wants to buy the naming
rights but will keep the name. ''

WHEN HIS HEART STOPPED AT 92, MILT SOSIN FINALLY QUIT REPORTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Milt Sosin lived for the story.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter in South Florida, he interviewed Fidel Castro when
Castro was just another guy with a beard, and Winston Churchill,
and Meyer Lansky. He was in the police station in Dallas when Jack
Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald, and was the first reporter to ride an
airplane into the eye of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   He outlived his newspaper, The Miami News, which went under in
1988, and for more than two decades worked for The Associated
Press, covering the wacky federal court beat in Miami. When he was
80 years old, he scooped the nation with the news that the
Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega had been indicted by the
United States on drug charges. Only four months ago, he did it
again, breaking word of the first federal court ruling in the Elian
Gonzalez case. Last weekend, as he lay connected to an oxygen tank
in his Miami Beach home, he phoned The Associated Press with a
story idea.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, his heart stopped.
</P>
<P>
   And only then, his pen.
</P>
<P>
   He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever story I sent him on, he got it,'' said Howard
Kleinberg, who was Sosin's managing editor at The Miami News. ``He
wouldn't take no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the journalist you see in the movies. I'm not sure
we'll ever see that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosin was a reporter who made his own news, created his own
legend. Remembering him this week, and gathering for his burial in
Miami Wednesday, his friends told Milt stories over and over. One
of their favorites:
</P>
<P>
   Sosin, who often referred to editors as ``amateurs,'' reacted
with his usual contempt when an editor at The News once ordered the
staff to write shorter, punchier paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down at his old typewriter, banged out his answer and
stuck it on the bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what reporter Milt Sosin did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosin was not a handsome man. He was tall and woefully thin, and
had a neck like a turkey's and a long, cadaverous face dominated by
a magnificent nose. He wore ascots and sport coats that looked as
if they had come from Goodwill, and drove a Jaguar. He smoked a
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sport coats were older than some of the lawyers he wrote
about,'' said Bill Cooke, a freelance photographer who chased the
news in Miami with Sosin for decades. ``He liked pastels.''
</P>
<P>
   He regularly beat his competitors, scooping them even when he
was old. In a time before cellular phones, when reporters raced to
the courthouse pay phones to call in news of a verdict, Sosin
carried a pad of yellow ``out of order'' stickers, which he would
slap onto a phone before going into the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   One day a young reporter, Martin Merzer, now with The Miami
Herald, sat beside Sosin in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, kid,'' Sosin asked him, ``have you filed yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Merzer told him the phone was out of order.
</P>
<P>
   Sosin reached into his pocket and showed him the pad of
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this wonderful, evil smile on his face,'' Merzer
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Sosin often outsmarted editors who tried to change him.
</P>
<P>
   He was once given an assignment by The News that took him away
from Miami's warm winter, and bought an overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept turning it in in his expense report, over and over
again, and they kept rejecting it,'' said Will Lester, now an
Associated Press political writer, who once worked with him.
``Finally he stopped. They asked him what happened, why he stopped
filing it. He told them: `It's in there. You find it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Broken into little pieces, in the itemized accounts of meals and
drinks and taxi rides, was Milt Sosin's overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg remembers his first confrontation with Sosin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `You'll find some rum somewhere in this office,
and I'll expect you to keep it there,''' Kleinberg said. ``I told
him that alcohol is not allowed in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he told me: `I go out on fires for this newspaper. I get
wet for this newspaper. And when I come back, I need my shot of
rum. No rum, no fires. Your choice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kleinberg told his assistant, ``Leave the rum there, for
Sosin.''

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Loganville
 &HT;    Friendly old town feels stirrings of growth
 &HT;    By Michelle C. Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOGANVILLE, Ga. _ Traffic zooms by on Ga. 20, but shoppers seem
oblivious to the busy highway. They are discovering unusual finds
at Braxton's Antique Mall, the Vintage Magnolia and the Cobblestone
Cottage lining this main street.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Loganville, a town of 6,500 on the brink of
revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, the first train chugged into town on the
Lawrenceville-Loganville railroad line. Business soon flourished.
But in 1932 the railroad became a casualty of the Depression.
Loganville, 30 miles from downtown Atlanta, remained a stable and
quiet town. Now, comeback fever is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recent openings of fast-food and grocery store
chains, large retail establishments such as Home Depot are planning
to move into the area. Natives speak proudly of embracing change
and welcoming newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great community spirit,'' says Betty McCullers,
president of the Loganville Chamber of Commerce. In addition to
applying for Better Hometown funds from the state, the city is
planning to fix sidewalks, increase parking and add streetlights.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent excursion, we shopped along a Main Street lined
with buildings that reflect the town's three centuries. Each of the
handful of shops is different, making it worth a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton's Antique Mall and Clock World begin the tour. The
nondescript building shared by both stores is deceptive: The
massive store has 20,000 square feet and 75 to 80 vendors in the
antique mall. There are choices galore. We found Wedgwood china
pieces: bud vases ($30 each) and small disheslace in its own right,
Loganville is fast becoming part of metro Atlanta. And when it
comes to shopping, let's just say this town named for an Irish
shoemaker is getting off on the right foot.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From I-285 east, take Exit 39B, U.S. 78 east.
Continue east, passing through the towns of Stone Mountain, Lilburn
and Snellville until you reach Loganville. From I-85 north, take
the Pleasant Hill Road exit. Turn right onto Pleasant Hill Road and
continue until the turn on your right for Ronald Reagan Parkway.
Follow it to the end and turn right at Ga. 124. Go approximately
one mile on Ga. 124 to the intersection of U.S. 78 and turn left.
Continue on U.S. 78 until you reach Loganville.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Generally, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays.
Hours vary on the weekends. Call ahead if you want to visit a
particular shop.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Available on the street, behind the stores and in
front of Braxton's Antique Mall and Clock World.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: No public restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most stores are accessible, although the
sidewalks can be difficult to traverse in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Loganville Chamber of Commerce, 770-466-1601
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Journey's End specializes in Southern fare. It is owned by the
people who own The Blue Willow Inn in Social Circle. The rotating
buffet includes staples such as fried green tomatoes, catfish,
green beans, collards and the essential fried chicken and sweet
tea. Located in the Loganville Town Shopping Center off U.S. 78.
Lunch is 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays, $6.95; $3.95 children
4-11. Supper is 4:30-9 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, $9.95; $3.95
children 4-11. 770-554-1770.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Walden's Fish House. Get your sea legs at this seafood buffet
on Main Street. With over 45 items, house specialties include
hand-breaded catfish and shrimp, broiled fish fillets, baby back
ribs and sirloin strips. Current specials include all-you-can-eat

   Q: I have been a user of English Leather men's products for
years. Specifically, I'm looking for underarm stick deodorant and
after-shave lotion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maurice Glatzer, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   And another request: I am wondering if English Leather Deodorant
Stick has been discontinued or is it just hard to find?
</P>
<P>
   _ William Lee, Smyrna, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another request: I am trying to locate English Leather
Deodorant Stick. It is the only deodorant soothing to my skin. I am
desperate because I am down to my last one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sam Ingram, Dacula, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And a final plea: I am looking for the deodorant English
Leather. I have used this for years and suddenly it has disappeared
from the market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ralph Rutherford, Doraville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Lovers of English Leather can soon be smelling like their
favorite scent. This longtime men's classic, composed of mossy,
woody and leather notes, is sold through Classic Edition
Fragrances. The traditional 2.75-ounce Deodorant Stick is $4. The
company also sells English Leather Musk and Lime Deodorant Sticks
for $4.50 each. To buy, call 1-888-254-5060. You can also order
English Leather after-shave and cologne at this number.

<P>
   Q: Recently I heard about a tradition of using cake charms in a
bridal luncheon cake. Each bridesmaid pulls a charm from the cake
with a ribbon. And each charm has a special meaning. I've contacted
bridal shops but haven't been able to find them. Any idea where I
can look?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kellie Hewitt, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Those Victorians knew how to party. Ribbon pulling is an
event for the bride to share with her bridesmaids at a luncheon or
at the wedding reception. The custom has been passed down for
generations. Tiny charms attached to ribbons are frosted into a
wedding cake, allowing the ribbons to flow from the side of cake.
Each bridesmaid pulls a ribbon, then discovers what her charm
means.
</P>
<P>
   An anchor symbolizes hope and adventures in life; the clover, a
life of good luck; a flower, a life of flourishing love; the heart,
a life with everlasting love; the wedding ring, a wedding date
soon; and the teddy bear, a happy home full of life. The
silver-plated charms from the Anna Rose collection are available at
Cake Art, 5296 Memorial Drive, Stone Mountain (404-294-5005). The
kit is $23.99 and includes six charms, ribbons, and a booklet
explaining the significance of each charm.

<P>
   Q: I would like to know if Red Diamond coffee is sold anywhere
in metro Atlanta. Or can it be ordered directly from the company? I
know it is still very popular in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sandra B. Watts, Doraville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Crank up the ole percolator. Your Red Diamond coffee is
available at several Wal-Mart Supercenters, including the location
at 1355 East-West Connector in Austell (770-863-9300). A 12-ounce
bag of whole beans and the 12-ounce auto-drip vaccum brick are
$1.98 each. Piggly Wiggly stores also carry Red Diamond. Or, order
it directly from the Alabama-based company at 1-800-292-4651.
Prices for each item are $2.65. Other flavors include Latin Magic
Coffee &AMP; Chicory. This Alabama coffee was first made in 1906 by
William Fitz Donovan, who searched for the perfect name. He
reasoned that since a red diamond is the jewel unsurpassed in
quality, it was the right name and standard for his coffee. Today,
the company also produces tea bags.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find Mount Vernon Salad Dressing, which I used
to buy at Winn-Dixie. It's distributed by Hannah's Sweet Dressings
in Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan Morgan, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: How sweet it is. Although these dressings are practically
impossible to find in metro Atlanta, you can pick them up in Publix
stores in South Georgia, Savannah, Hilton Head, S.C., and in North
Florida. Also, in Chattanooga, Winn-Dixie, Fresh Market and BiLo
stores stock these products. But you can order the dressings ($2.95
for an 8-ounce bottle or $36 for a 12-bottle case plus shipping) at
423-266-0290. Flavors include Sweet Celery, Orange Poppyseed, Blue
Onion, Greek Vinaigrette, French Onion and Razzmataz Vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to locate appliance covers for a toaster,
blender and electric mixer. I have looked everywhere and can't find
them. Could you please help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Carolyn Boswell, Newnan, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We've got you covered. Appliance covers in a red apple
pattern banded in green are available through the Blair Shoppe Gift
Gallery catalog. Toaster, blender, mixer, can opener and
bread-maker covers are priced from $7.95 to $12.95 each. To order:
1-800-458-2000. Appliance covers in a multicolored fruit print are
also available at Linens 'N Things, 2900 Peachtree Road N.E.,
Atlanta (404-816-2700). The blender cover is $7.99; the mixer or
coffeepot cover is $9.99; a can opener cover is $5.99.

U.S. TO ALLOW ITS RESEARCHERS TO WORK ON EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health issued long-awaited rules
Wednesday that would permit federally financed researchers to work
on human embryonic stem cells, cells derived from the very early
embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these cells' ability to form every tissue of the
body, scientists believe they hold great promise in treating many
diseases, particularly the degenerative maladies of age.
</P>
<P>
   The rules permit federally financed researchers to use cell
lines that are derived from frozen human embryos due to be
discarded by fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion have objected to federal approval of the
research because the embryos, which they consider to be capable of
life, are destroyed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to sidestep the abortion issue, the National
Institutes of Health will allow its researchers to use only cells
that have been obtained by private firms. The agency's researchers
will not be allowed themselves to extract and culture the cells
from discarded embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The cells may be legally derived by anyone who does not receive
federal funding. Human embryos are created by mixing eggs and sperm
in fertility clinics. Those that are not used are often frozen,
stored for many years, and eventually abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was welcomed by scientific groups like the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, and
President Clinton referred in a press conference Wednesday to the
``potentially staggering benefits of this research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we cannot walk away from the potential to save lives
and improve lives, to help people literally get up and walk, to do
all kinds of things we could never have imagined,'' Clinton said,
``as long as we meet rigorous, ethical standards.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as rigorous ethical standards are met, he said, ``I
think we cannot walk away from the potential to save lives and
improve lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lana Skirboll, director of science policy at the National
Institutes of Health, said that the agency's special review
committee for embryonic stem cells would hold its first meeting
next month and that the first research grants could be awarded
before the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the Senate's leading critic of the
agency's policy, said in a statement Wednesday that human embryonic
stem cell research was ``illegal, immoral and unnecessary.''
Brownback said the research was prohibited by a congressional ban
on financing research that led to the destruction of human embryos,
sought to benefit by taking human life and would lead to treatments
that could be developed by other means: the use of adult stem
cells.
</P>
<P>
   The initial draft of the agency's guidelines, issued in
December, drew criticism as morally inconsistent from anti-abortion
groups and even the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In their final form, the guidelines have been made more
stringent, by the addition of a new level of review. Biologists
seeking federal funds to work on human embryonic stem cells will
have to win approval from four separate bodies _ their university's
in-house review group and three panels within the N.I.H. _ before
receiving their money.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines include several provisions designed to discourage
anyone from donating embryos for profit or for the medical benefit
of relatives. The new version also allows the donor of the
embryonic cells to be identified, since the immunological makeup of
the cells may be important if they are transplanted into patients.
</P>
<P>
   The extra reviews required by the new rules should not delay
research because they will take place within the agency's normal
reviewing cycle, Skirboll said.
</P>
<P>
   One new issue that has been raised in recent months comes from
the finding that a different kind of stem cells found in the organs
of adults are far more versatile than supposed. The opponents of
funding embryonic stem cells have argued that the promised health
benefits can be obtained just as well as from a patient's own adult
stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is not without substance. Most organs seem to have
a small reservoir of stem cells that generate new cells, among them
the bone marrow stem cells that daily replenish the red and white
blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Adult stem cells are less versatile than embryonic stem cells
but they now appear to be less tissue-specific than thought; recent
experiments have shown that the blood-making stem cells can also be
coaxed to make muscle cells and even nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Blood-making stem cells are quite accessible and could perhaps
be converted into dopamine-secreting brain cells, the type lost in
Parkinson's disease. Use of a patient's own stem cells would avoid
both the ethical problems of embryonic stem cells and the threat of
immunological rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But embryonic stem cells grow much more prolifically than adult
stem cells and biologists have in mind several ways of handling the
problem of immune rejection. In short, no one yet knows which type
of stem cell will prove more suitable for clinical use, and
researchers want to try both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is bad public policy for politicians to say
which cells should be studied,'' said Daniel Perry, chairman of the
Patients' Coalition for Urgent Research. ``we think all of them
should be studied.''
</P>
<P>
   Embryonic stem cells are taken from the embryo at a stage when
it is a hollow sphere consisting of a thousand or so cells. Inside
the sphere is a blob known as the inner cell mass, which contains
the stem cells. The cells can form any tissue of the body except
the placenta.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a scientific committee recommended to the British
government that researchers should be allowed to embark on
therapeutic cloning, in which an ordinary body cell is taken from a
patient and inserted into a human egg cell whose own nucleus has
been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Through mechanisms that are not yet understood, the egg's
interior contents or cytoplasm can reprogram the introduced nucleus
and enable it to regain its full potential; instead of operating
just as the nucleus of a skin cell, say, it can make any tissue of
the body.
</P>
<P>
   In principle the inserted nucleus can then direct the egg to
grow into an entire adult organism. This is the process that was
used to clone Dolly the sheep, the nucleus being taken from an
adult mammary gland cell.
</P>
<P>
   A human egg cell with an introduced adult cell nucleus would
presumably be a viable embryo, but inserting it into a uterus would
be a criminal offense in Britain. For therapeutic cloning, the egg
would instead be cultured in laboratory glassware and exposed to
signals that would convert it into the type of tissue that the
patient needed to have replaced. The concept has been demonstrated
in repairing heart tissue in mice and is considered to have
enormous clinical promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, therapeutic cloning could legally be
undertaken by private researchers but no one is known to have done
so, Skirboll said. Therapeutic cloning is specifically prohibited
for federally financed researchers by the guidelines issued
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Skirboll said the N.I.H.'s special review committee for
embryonic stem cells would hold its first meeting next month, and
that the first research grants could be awarded before the end of
next year.

MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIAL VIOLATED ETHICS RULES BY HAVING AIDES
BABY-SIT

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts State Ethics Commission found
probable cause Wednesday that Lt. Gov. Jane Swift, who won her
office in 1998 less than three weeks after bearing her first child,
violated ethics rules by having two aides baby-sit away from the
State House.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel cleared Swift on several other ethics charges
including improperly using a state helicopter to fly home to her
sick baby and using aides to help her move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made some mistakes and I'm very sorry for those mistakes,
and I have a lot of work ahead of me if, as I hope, I am to regain
the trust of the public,'' Swift said Wednesday night on WBZ radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned from these mistakes,'' she said. ``One of the
things I've learned is that I have difficulty publicly admitting
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's finding, which did not recommend any
punishment, capped months of drubbing that Swift, a Republican, has
been taking here in Democrat-dominated political circles, in the
news and in coffee-counter talk. Her decision to run for office
while pregnant in 1998 made her a heroine to some working women, a
model of how women could do it all. But her questionable use of the
perks of office to help balance motherhood with work _ and her
defensive attitude when challenged _ prompted anger from many
supporters and scorn from opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldman, a Democratic political consultant, even printed
up buttons reading, ``Jane `not so' Swift: It Takes an Entire State
Government to Raise a Child.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Swift have been further energized by widespread
talk that the governor, Paul Cellucci, a Republican, might take a
federal job if the next president is a Republican, in which case
Swift would become governor.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be even more at work in Swift's case, said
Elizabeth A. Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics
and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, we have to say that she is new to this high
level, she made some mistakes and, unfortunately, she suffered a
tremendous amount of vilification in the press and the court of
public opinion for it,'' Sherman said. ``That said, I also feel
that it's just been an extraordinary backlash against her.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift's troubles began in January when local newspapers reported
that she had relied on aides for personal services including caring
for her toddler daughter both in the State House and at home,
helping her move and picking up dry cleaning. They also disclosed
that she had used a state helicopter to avoid Thanksgiving traffic
and fly home to her sick daughter in western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   State ethics rules bar officials from asking employees to attend
to their personal chores, because the workers could feel pressure
to obey. At first, in what many see as her biggest mistake, Swift
defended her actions, saying that she shared many of the dilemmas
of everyday working parents but that her schedule was unusually
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   When she was queried about aides' complaints that they felt
pressured into baby-sitting Elizabeth, she replied, ``I would be
stunned if there was anyone who was feeling pressure to spend time
with her and care for her.'' In fact, she said, staff members were
happy to spend time with the baby: ``She is adorable and engaging
and she's learned to blow kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks alienated many working parents and some pointed out
that Swift has a stay-at-home husband, a flexible job and a
supportive superior in Cellucci _ and yet she still needed to call
on aides to help ``hold it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift, 35, soon apologized, and apologized again, saying she was
still learning about being a mother and a lieutenant governor. She
asked for the ethics commission to examine her actions to see if
they violated state ethics rules. On Monday, and again Wednesday
night, Swift said she was sorry that questions about her ethics had
drawn attention away from her administration's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But her apologies did not stop a precipitous slide in her
popularity: She and Cellucci were elected with 51 percent of the
vote; a poll by The Boston Globe in February found that only 20
percent of respondents viewed Swift favorably, while 36 percent saw
her unfavorably.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the bigger picture, said Sherman of the University of
Massachusetts, Swift's story will serve as a case study of how
women in politics are perceived, and may also have a ``chilling
effect'' on young women who consider entering politics, by showing
them the microscopic examination their behavior, including their
mothering, might endure.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the worst part of the baby scandal may be that it
became a missed opportunity _ Swift could have used it to ask what
resources are needed to help parents mix work and child rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a question that needed to be asked and answered, and
it's just hanging out there,'' Sherman said. She said Swift ``had
the opportunity to move that discussion forward, and she didn't,
because she felt embattled, besieged, defensive.''

SENATE HEARING PLANNED ON FIRESTONE RECALL  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Commerce Committee is planning to hold
hearings on the Firestone tires that were the subject of a safety
recall, a congressional aide said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which oversees regulation of interstate commerce
and highway safety, will convene hearings next month to examine the
problems that caused Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. to recall 6.5
million tires, the staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the committee,
requested the hearings, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As the recall continued on Wednesday, two more deaths were
blamed on the faulty tires. Garry Lynn Meek, 56, of Farmersville,
Calif., and his granddaughter, Amy Lynn Meek, were killed on Aug.
16 in Wyoming when the left rear tire tread peeled off causing
their Ford Explorer to skid and roll over. The tire was a Firestone
ATX 75R15, one of the brands that were recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Government data has indicated that virtually all the recent
deaths linked to Firestone tires now being recalled occurred when
sport utility vehicles, most of them Ford Explorers, rolled over
after the tires failed.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will invite a number of officials to testify,
possibly including federal transportation safety officials; Jacques
A. Nassar, the president of the Ford Motor Co.; and representatives
of Firestone, although no invitations have been sent, the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the tires being recalled were put on SUVs
and trucks made Ford over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Firestone acknowledged that millions of
tires manufactured since 1991 were prone to separating. The problem
has caused 46 deaths and 80 injuries and has led to 50 lawsuits and
a federal investigation. The company has said it will provide free
replacements.

 &HT;    Hurricane Debby loses as it heads for Florida Keys
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stumbling on the mountains of Hispanola,
Hurricane Debby lost its punch as it headed west into the peaks of
eastern Cuba today, which could reduce it to a barely tropical
storm force.
</P>
<P>
   If the projected path holds true Debby will aim for the central
Florida Keys Friday evening or Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could still be in for some nasty weather Friday or
Saturday,'' said National Hurricane Center forecaster Krissy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The official forecast is that Debby will have winds of about 45
mph when it reaches the Keys, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Debby became disorganized and weakened to maximum 50 mph winds
Wednesday as it rode along the north coast of Hispanola, the island
shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Forecasters expected
the storm to weaken further as it reached the mountains of eastern
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hurricane center's computer models had the storm
moving along the north coast of Cuba but two projected it to move
south of Cuba where it could strengthen in the southern Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency managers in Monroe County ordered vacationers to
evacuate Wednesday, a precaution for the Florida Keys where 80,000
residents depend on a single highway. Public schools will be closed
today and Friday in Monroe as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take the avenue of least regrets,'' Keys emergency
manager Billy Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers evacuated dozens of people from riverside
shacks in the Dominican Republic and gusty rain tore roofs off
homes in Haiti as Tropical Storm Debby skirted the island of
Hispaniola. So far the storm has caused only one reported fatality,
a man in Puerto Rico who died on Tuesday when he fell off his roof
while taking down a television antenna before Debby hit.
</P>
<P>
   Road construction crews on South Florida highways will continue
working until a hurricane watch is issued, said Barbara Kelleher,
spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. At that
point, crews will be required to shut down projects and remove any
equipment or materials that could fly around in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our maintenance people are already doing an inventory of all
our supplies, like chain saws and everything we may need,''
Kelleher said. ``We're gassing up any vehicles we would use after
the hurricane so we're ready to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Florida's Turnpike, tolls will remain in effect until state
emergency managers order an evacuation, said Turnpike spokesman
Michael Washburn. Then, all lanes in construction zones will be
open to aid with any evacuation, Washburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline and food vendors at Turnpike service plazas brought in
extra supplies Wednesday in case the storm prevents deliveries for
a few days, he said.

WALKOUT'S END SAID TO HINGE ON ONE ISSUE 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An agreement to end a strike by employees of Verizon
Communications in several mid-Atlantic states was held up on
Wednesday by a single issue, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly all significant differences between Verizon and the
two unions representing workers were resolved and a most strikers
returned to work earlier this week, negotiators tried to define
what type of work cable splicers and service technicians can do in
Pennsylvania, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue involves 2,000 to 3,000 of Verizon's 260,000
employees. The union apparently wants to limit the kind and amount
of work cable splicers can perform, while Verizon wants to deploy
cable splicers with greater flexibility, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable splicers generally install and repair telephone cables and
are considered more skilled than service technicians, who connect
and repair telephone service on the outsides of homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it has come down to,'' said Eric Rabe, a
spokesman for Verizon, which was formed by the merger of Bell
Atlantic and the GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and New England, members of the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers returned to work on Monday, while their colleagues in
states including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia remained on
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The unions began their walkout on Aug. 6, and Verizon ceded to
nearly all of the unions' demands in what was considered a pivotal
effort by labor to gain a foothold in a large high-technology
company.

SPORTS COLUMN: A BLAZING COMET AND LADY LIBERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What had been a routinely sedate news media session
suddenly became a raucous and family-like reunion Wednesday when
Cynthia Cooper bounded out the runway at Madison Square Garden,
like a blazing Houston Comet across the New York City sky.
</P>
<P>
   First the woman they call Coop hugged the veteran Liberty
forward, Sue Wicks, once with feeling, a second time at a brassy
cameraman's request. Then she decided, ``I've got to see Spoon,''
and went looking for Teresa Weatherspoon, bumping into Vickie
Johnson first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's going to be a mistake when you retire,'' Johnson
said, pulling Cooper close with both arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I get a chance to come a last time to Madison,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she and the equally mercurial Weatherspoon began pawing
at one another, just as when they were roommates on national teams
and they would conduct killer pushup contests on hotel room carpets
until even they had exhausted themselves to the brink of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her,'' Weatherspoon said, her body language affirming
that this was no case of preening for the purpose of promotion.
</P>
<P>
   What history these women share, and we don't just mean the last
four summers of toiling in David Stern's gender equity annex,
otherwise known as the Women's National Basketball Association.
Cooper's three-time champion Comets are at the Garden Thursday
night to play the Liberty in the league's best-of-three finals for
the third time but telling the story of the WNBA's most dominant
player from 1997 on would be like starting an American history text
at World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her long friendship with Weatherspoon, the braided Miss
Liberty, Cooper played alongside Tari Phillips and against Sue
Wicks in the Italian league that so many American women had to call
home, away from home. And while summer prime time in the big boy
arenas was much too long in coming, those were the days, Wicks
could tell you, that Cynthia Cooper was a sight to behold.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got all the points,'' said Wicks, going all the way back
to the late-1980s. ``It was like Michael Jordan early on _
extraordinary, amazing. When I played against her, I would just
stand in the back of the zone, waiting for her to blow by everyone,
and just try to take a swipe at her. Take 10 swipes, maybe get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's more efficient, good at getting everyone involved,
saving her energy. She's more like Jordan at the end of his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone finishes up sooner or later, but few could understand
why the 5 foot 10 inch dynamo announced on July 4 that she had
decided to retire after this season, while still one of the
league's very best. She spent the ensuing days testily denying her
decision was related to displeasure voiced earlier about losing
shots to Sheryl Swoopes, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The pettiness exists even on teams that win the championship
every season, not just those perennial also-rans with Patrick Ewing
occupying the paint. The Comets, to their credit, managed to move
past or adapt to their internal strife, and returned to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in the locker room doesn't matter,''
Weatherspoon argued. ``I've always said, `You don't have to like
me, just play basketball with me.'''
</P>
<P>
   While that sounded like sensible advice in the event the Knicks
can't unload the ever-alienated Ewing, Cooper was sticking with her
own departure script Wednesday, saying it didn't matter if anyone
believed or understood her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had four years here, the experience that passed over some
others,'' she said. ``It didn't pass over me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable why the American public and press might
believe women's basketball began with Stern's hip marketing, with
``We Got Next.'' But Cynthia Cooper is 37 years old, has played
professionally for as long as Ewing and has logged more
trans-Atlantic miles than Lindbergh could have dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she feels it's time,'' Weatherspoon said. ``If I had to
tell her, I would tell her it's not. But a lot of people have no
idea what she's already put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has made decent money and speaks four languages but along
the way lost a brother to the streets, her mother to cancer and her
teammate and close friend, Kim Perrot, to a brain tumor last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   She knows the difference between substance and show, though game
and life do occasionally mix. A year ago this month, Cooper
dedicated a night to Perrot, and scored 42 points. That's a flair
for the dramatic we expected from another basketball great. If this
really is Cooper's farewell, no one in her extended family will be
shocked if she goes out the way Jordan did, too. &QL;

ELECTROLUX REPORTEDLY TRYING TO ACQUIRE MAYTAG
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Iowa) By DAVID BARBOZA   and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Maytag repairman may be getting a new boss.
</P>
<P>
   The appliance maker based in Newton, Iowa, is negotiating to be
acquired by Electrolux, the Swedish maker of Frigidaire
refrigerators and other household products, for close to $4
billion, according to executives close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The executives cautioned that a deal, which would create the
world's largest maker of ovens, dishwashers and washing machines,
is not imminent and that several other rivals have recently made
their own informal overtures to Maytag about a possible
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Takeover talks have been fueled by a change in the Maytag
Corp.'s bylaws in May that make it easier to acquire the appliance
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say the combination would create a rival to
the Whirlpool Corp., the largest appliance maker in North America,
and General Electric. It is not known whether those companies have
contacted Maytag.
</P>
<P>
   Maytag and Electrolux could be a powerful combination, analysts
contend, because Maytag, which had worldwide sales of $4.3 billion
in 1999, has a powerful U.S. brand that has been strengthened by an
array of innovative, higher-priced products, such as Blodgett
commercial ovens and Neptune washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Electrolux, which makes everything from farm tractors to ovens,
dishwashers and vacuum cleaners, is a major force in Europe. The
company had global sales of about $14.6 billion in 1999, and could
give Maytag the global reach it needs to sell overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have been swirling about a possible Electrolux-Maytag
deal for weeks following reports that Electrolux executives toured
Maytag's plants as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation sent shares of Maytag up $2.88 on Tuesday, to
$38.13, on volume of 1.5 million compared with average daily volume
of 528,141. The stock's volatility and volume simmered down on
Wednesday. Maytag closed at $37.31, down 81 cents. The American
depository receipts of Electrolux fell 44 cents Wednesday, to
$27.50.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schwartz, a spokesman for Maytag, declined to comment. A
representative for Elecrolux could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Maytag say that discussions between Maytag and
Electrolux have been going on for months and may have been held up
over price. Shares of Maytag, which were as high as $74 a share on
July 14, 1999, fell as low as $27 earlier this month because of
concerns that growth at the company had begun to slow.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of spectacular growth, Maytag executives
blamed the profit slowdown on weakness in its lower-priced products
as well as trouble in its Dixie-Narco vending machines division.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to ease concerns, Lloyd D. Ward, the chief executive at
Maytag, announced plans in September to reorganize the company's
operations to cut more than $100 million in costs over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Maytag would move aggressively into electronic
commerce, that it would work to create smart appliances that could
some day be connected to the Internet, and that new strategies were
aimed at selling more products into the international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Maytag's problem, though, was strong competition from
Whirlpool, which has about 35 percent of the North American market,
and GE Appliances, which has about 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts say that the success of GE Appliances success
in selling its products over the Internet and shipping the products
faster to market has shaken the industry and put increased pressure
on Whirlpool and Maytag.
</P>
<P>
   That such a deal with Electrolux is in the works has also
created a buzz in Iowa's newspapers, which have been reporting for
weeks about a possible Electrolux deal and the possibility that
Maytag would move its headquarters to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Maytag say that any plans to move to Chicago
have been put on hold because of negotiations with Electrolux. They
also say that after heavy trading in Maytag shares last year,
insider trading among top executives has dried up, a hint that
executives are restraining from trading because a merger is in the
works.

CUBA STRONG, U.S. IMPROVED IN OLYMPIC BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Baseball may be America's pastime, but when it
comes to winning at the sport's international competitions, that's
Cuba's pastime.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of professional players for the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney is not expected to change that.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. and Japan leaving their best players home to
finish their respective professional seasons instead of sending
lineups comparable to the Dream Team that the U.S. used to regain
basketball supremacy, Cuba remains the favorite. But the
competition Cuba must overcome to win a third consecutive gold will
be the most balanced yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba's showing up every year with these experienced
veterans,'' USA Baseball executive director Paul Seiler said.
``They're used to playing together and facing international
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba's still Cuba, but now everybody's showing up with older,
more- experienced players, too. It sort of levels the playing
field.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Baseball fielded its first team of professionals for the
1999 Pan American Games. The team of minor-leaguers finished second
to Cuba after showing its vulnerability with an opening-game loss
to lightly regarded Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously if we were still out there with an amateur team, we
wouldn't have a prayer,'' Seiler said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team that former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda guides in
Sydney may be a step up from previous years, but maybe not much.
Major-league teams had to approve players to participate, meaning
anyone likely to receive a September call-up won't go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the people I'm surrounded with,'' Lasorda said.
``People who have worked so very, very hard to try to come up with
a team that's going to be very successful over in the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.'s lone Olympic baseball gold came in 1988 when Cuba
boycotted and baseball was a demonstration sport. A 1996 bronze is
the only medal the U.S. has claimed since baseball became an
official Olympic sport in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   This year's eight-team field must overcome a Cuban team that
features essentially the same lineup that defeated the Baltimore
Orioles in a 1999 exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which took silver in 1996, is sending a team containing
several professional all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Korea is shutting down its professional league for a few weeks
to send its best players.
</P>
<P>
   The host Australians are also in the mix with a team led by
former Milwaukee Brewers All-Star catcher David Nilsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing against men who know how to play the game,'' USA
Baseball co-chairman Bob Watson said. ``If we go out there with
talented prospects who don't have much experience, we're not going
to be able to compete. A mixture of youth and experience is key.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic competition starts Sept.17 with the U.S. facing Japan.

 &HT;    South Carolina seeks help from Georgia to clean up reststops
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the image game, South Carolina has won its share of
battles against big neighbor Georgia in recent years, boasting the
historic allure of Charleston, the carpet-green golf courses of
Hilton Head and more peaches produced each year than in the entire
Peach State.
</P>
<P>
   But even South Carolina promoters admit the state is losing
badly in an area most visible to tourists: Highway rest stops. Many
South Carolina rest areas are filthy and some of them are
considered dangerous, officials and travelers said. A rash of
robberies that began in February and culminated with a violent
attack on an elderly woman in Sumter County in June has forced
South Carolina officials to look for serious solutions_and they're
looking to Georgia to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a task force formed by South Carolina Attorney General
Charlie Condon is visiting Georgia to tour rest stops, including
Rest Stop No. 63 off the westbound lanes of I- 20 in Columbia
County near Augusta. ``Our goal is to come up with some long-term
solutions,'' said Rick Daniel, spokesman for Condon's office.
``What Georgia is doing is really common sense stuff, such as
cutting back on their hours of operation, beefing up their lighting
and clearing out vegetation.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty South Carolina counties host rest areas, and officials in
15 of those are participating in the attorney general's task force.
The governor has formed a separate task force. ``They need to do
something,'' said Debbie Hennessey of Atlanta who with her husband,
Bob Hennessey, stopped off last week at the Columbia County rest
area to use the facilities and buy a Coke from the vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones in Georgia are always clean,'' she said. ``But we
ended up in one in South Carolina and it was filthy. It looked like
they hadn't picked up the trash in days.
</P>
<P>
   Crime concerns prompted the AAA Carolinas motor club to issue a
travel advisory on June 8 for I-95 rest stops at exits 135 and 141.
</P>
<P>
   David Kelley is a trucker who every week travels from Alabama to
Sumter, S.C., transporting black-meat chicken to Asian-food
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like rest areas at night,'' Kelley said. ``It's too
isolated, so I tote a Deringer in my hip pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   A South Carolina brick mason is charged with attempted murder
after allegedly kicking open a stall door in the ladies room and
hitting a 63-year-old woman in the head five times and snatching
her purse containing $600 and credit cards. The victim's husband
was able to flag down a trooper after discovering his bloodied
wife, who was treated and released from a Sumter hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Two armed men robbed travelers from New York and Maryland at the
Sumter County rest stops on opposite sides of I-95 in May and are
suspected in February and April holdups.
</P>
<P>
   It was after these incidents that South Carolina officials
dusted off an informal survey distributed nationally in 1997 to
gather information on how other states better protected their
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three states responded to the questionnaire inspired by a
rash of nuisance crimes including prostitution at a rest stop near
Charleston. Georgia's safety record impressed them as much as any
other state, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 43 states that responded to the survey, 28 states had
some type of security, from cameras to someone on duty; 13 states
had electronic security including ``panic buttons''; and a couple
of states had mini police precincts. North Carolina has had a
program in place since 1993 in which officers routinely get out of
their cars and walk around the state's 50 to 60 rest stops. Florida
contracted with armed security guards after a British tourist was
shot and killed in 1993 at a rest stop on I-10 in Monticello.
Immediately following that and a series of other tourists slayings
farther south, former Gov. Lawton Chiles deployed 500 auxillary
state troopers to monitor highway rest areas. Virginia was the only
Southern state other than South Carolina to report a violent crime
this summer. A 41-year-old carpenter was slain in July, allegedly
by two escaped Kentucky convicts he befriended at a northern
Virginia rest stop. Reportedly, they were later seen dumping his
body in the woods in Chatham County, Ga. ``Transients go from rest
stop to rest stop,'' said Louis R. Mizell Jr., chairman of Mizell &AMP;
Co. International Security in Bethesda, Md. ``It's the perfect
camouflage because everyone is a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest stops also offer criminals easy access and quick escape
routes onto the super highways. AAA authorities, Mizell and other
officials said travelers should avoid rest stops entirely in the
middle of the night and plan their stops to coincide with gas
fill-ups and meals in congested areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, including Georgia, have attendants on duty until 11
p.m. In Georgia, bathrooms are locked at 11 p.m., which discourages
late-night traffic and reduces potential hiding places for
criminals. Before that action, bathrooms were being used as a
``hot-bed for illicit sex and drug activity,'' said Jilayne Jordan,
spokesman for the Georgia Department of Transportation. ``It gave
(lawbreakers) kind of a club.'' ``Tourism and trucking in Georgia
are two of our biggest industries,'' Jordan said. ``If we can't
present them with something safe and inviting, we're kind of
shooting ourselves in the foot.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, Dick Cheney pulled off what was widely seen as a
business coup. Ending years of fruitless talks, Cheney arranged a
merger between Halliburton, the company he ran, and its chief
rival, Dresser Industries, creating the world's largest oil field
services and construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the chief executive of Halliburton, initiated the deal
while on a quail hunt with his counterpart from Dresser. The
negotiations that followed were so amicable, the companies
dispensed with the close scrutiny of each other's businesses that
is usually part of a merger, a Dresser official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some key Dresser executives quickly came to regret that
decision, present and former company officials say. They were
startled to learn after the deal closed that several of the major
projects negotiated by Cheney's management team were much less
healthy than they had appeared on the Halliburton's books and were
racking up significant losses. The newly merged company was hit
with several hundred million dollars of unexpected losses,
including an estimated $100 million on a single pipeline project in
South America begun on Cheney's watch, according to company
insiders and others in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresser merger was the biggest deal of Cheney's five years
at Halliburton and the losses that arose soon afterward were one of
several missteps in a business record that has become part of his
political resume since he became the Republican nominee for vice
president. The Bush campaign has defended his multimillion
retirement payment from Halliburton as fair compensation for a job
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people should be pleased they have a
vice-presidential nominee who has been successful in business,''
said Karen P. Hughes, communications director for the campaign of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But just how successful Cheney was as a chief executive is a
matter of considerable dispute, judging by a broad survey of his
record that included interviews with present and former company
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Some praised him for doubling the size of the company through
mergers and a growing government business that has made Halliburton
the nation's fifth-largest military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess Cheney's performance, Halliburton's vice
chairman, Donald Vaughn, said he deserved a ``clearly superior''
grade. ``Mr. Cheney was anything but a status quo man,'' Vaughn
said. ``He changed Halliburton and the popular judgment is he
changed it for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives, however, said Cheney failed to keep a
sufficiently tight rein on the company's aggressive pursuit of
overseas energy projects and road-building work in the United
States. Some Wall Street analysts, too, described Cheney's
performance as little better than average.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cheney declined to make him available for an
interview and referred questions about his tenure at Halliburton to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the last president of Dresser, acknowledged in an
interview that there had been ``overall surprise'' with the losses
that emerged after the Dresser merger. Most of them, he said, came
from contracts on the Halliburton side of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn blamed the reversals on an industry downturn caused by
plummeting oil prices in late 1998 and on the complexity of the
projects and said neither he nor his Dresser colleagues felt
deceived. ``No one was flimflammed,'' he said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's stock price, often regarded as a gauge of
executive performance, rose sharply during Cheney's early years at
the company, but it lagged its competitors in the final year and a
half of Cheney's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   There is a presumption in business that a chief executive is
broadly responsible for everything that happens in his company, for
better or worse. Last year, the company's board of directors
withheld bonuses from Cheney and his management team, which had
failed to meet the board's financial targets for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Lesar, the man Cheney picked to run the company's
day-to-day operations, said his boss was ``hands off, very much a
delegator'' whose main role at the company was cultivating clients
and setting strategic direction. ``He and I talked almost every
day,'' Lesar said. ``On major types of things, I would tell him
what the decisions were.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing Cheney's record at Halliburton, it is difficult to
say _ as it would be with any large corporation _ what specific
role the chief executive played in each initiative during his
tenure. For example, it is not clear how much of a hand Cheney had
in his management team's decision to start bidding more
aggressively on smaller-scale highway projects. The company won a
host of new contracts, but ran into difficulties in North Carolina
and Bush's home state of Texas for failing to meet deadlines for
completing the work. The projects were small by Halliburton
standards, $20 million or less, but a company insider said the
losses on several of them rose as high as $4 million to $5 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Texas eventually fined the company for its
tardiness and North Carolina officials went further, barring
Halliburton from bidding on road work in the state. The company's
travails in Texas are no secret: A partial list of the penalties,
totaling $359,450, is on the Web site of the Bush administration's
highway department.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar, who is now Halliburton's chief executive, said the
setbacks in the road work were ``part and parcel'' of a business
frequently punctuated by commercial disputes. ``It's absolutely not
an embarrassment,'' he said. Lesar acknowledged, however, that the
company, which expanded its road building under Cheney, is getting
out of the business of doing such small-scale projects.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said Cheney was frustrated in his desire to
phase out another Halliburton business: Its dealings with Libya
through its British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the arrangements were within the law. The
American embargo on Libya, imposed by President Ronald Reagan,
allows subsidiaries of U.S. companies to earn money in Libya and
send the profits home, provided the American parent company has no
role in managing the operations and no Americans are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar said Cheney told executives soon after he arrived that he
wanted to get out of Libya but was dissuaded by the argument that
this would harm the company's long-term relationship with its
customers. ``He had a fiduciary responsibility to his
stockholders,'' Lesar said.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's subsidiary maintains smaller, similar business
relationships in Iran and Iraq, said Vaughn, its vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Company insiders said that some of Halliburton's woes under
Cheney were common to corporate America in the late 1990s. The
company has had difficulties creating a unified computer system
across all of its diverse units. It is also still wrestling with a
companywide initiative, begun at the behest of Cheney, to set up
central management of purchasing, personnel and other
administrative functions. Several executives said the results from
this effort, which is costing several hundred million dollars, have
been disappointing thus far.
</P>
<P>
   The financial blemishes on Cheney's record at Halliburton are,
in large measure, a matter of public record. The company's public
financial reports disclosed its disappointing profits in the
highway construction business, without providing specific numbers.
And it said it had ``unusually high'' losses of nearly $180 million
on ``technically complex'' projects in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 81 years ago as an oil well service concern, Halliburton
has grown into a wide-ranging energy technology and construction
giant with revenues last year of $14.9 billion. Its 1962 merger
with Brown &AMP; Root, a Texas contracting company, brought in a wealth
of federal work that the company had won after financing the
political career of Lyndon B. Johnson. ``Brown &AMP; Root became an
industrial colossus thanks to Lyndon Johnson,'' said Robert A.
Caro, author of a multivolume biography of the former president.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Halliburton was still rebounding from the previous
decade's oil bust when its chairman, Thomas Cruikshank, went salmon
fishing for five days with Cheney. The former secretary of defense
had spent the previous two and a half years as a fellow with the
Washington research organization, American Enterprise Institute,
and had decided against a presidential bid. Cruikshank, who was
retiring, championed Cheney as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm often asked why I left politics and went to Halliburton,''
Cheney said in a speech last November at the Institute of Petroleum
in London, ``and I explain that I reached the point where I was
mean-spirited, short-tempered and intolerant of those who disagreed
with me and they said, `Hell, you'd make a great CEO,' so I went to
Texas and joined the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's fortunes were on the rebound in October 1995 when
Cheney arrived as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's stock had been an underperformer for much of the
late 1980s and early 1990s, but what the company called a round of
``strategic actions,'' including payroll cuts and a restructuring
of its basic businesses, substantially improved the company's
results beginning in 1992. For the three and a half years before
Cheney became chief executive at the beginning of October 1995,
Halliburton's stock rose 82 percent, well above the 65 percent gain
recorded by an index of companies in the oil service industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney moved to build on that success. He put Lesar, a top
executive at Halliburton's biggest subsidiary, in charge of daily
operations. Cheney was viewed, from the beginning, as a man who was
to use his worldwide contacts to produce new business. ``When we
brought Cheney in, it really wasn't to run operations,'' said his
predecessor, Cruikshank. ``It was to make the proper strategic
decisions, and to establish relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Cheney's first initiatives were well-regarded mergers that
helped the company master the new technologies reshaping the energy
industry. Halliburton acquired the Landmark Graphics Corp., which
develops software and data-management tools for the oil industry,
and the Numar Corp., which produces magnetic-resonance imaging
instruments for energy exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The company also scored some victories in Washington under
Cheney, winning a $1.1 billion Pentagon contract for support
operations in the Balkans. A Pentagon official said there was no
indication the former defense secretary had any role in sealing the
deal, which expanded a contract Halliburton has held since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's foray into road building went much less smoothly.
The company's Brown &AMP; Root unit had been doing road projects for
most of the 20th century and as Cheney took the reins, it hoped to
cash in on a nationwide boom in highway work.
</P>
<P>
   From November 1995 to November 1997, the company bid on 36
projects in North Carolina and won nine, totaling $100.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty aggressive undertaking by them,'' said Terry
Strickland, the contractual services engineer for the state
Department of Transportation in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   State officials in North Carolina say that while they were
pleased with the quality of Brown &AMP; Root's work, they quickly grew
frustrated at chronic, substantial delays. Of the nine projects
Brown &AMP; Root took on in North Carolina, three failed to meet
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   When problems first developed, the state pressured Brown &AMP; Root
to work faster by imposing daily and even hourly penalties, and
warned that it could be banned as a bidder. Finally, in a letter
dated Aug. 3, 1998, the state banished Brown &AMP; Root.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been unable to find any substantial reasons for the
unsatisfactory progress on these projects except for the lack of
effort that your company has put forth,'' wrote J.D. Goins, the
state chief engineer for operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's results in Texas have been mixed. It won an award
from a nationwide industry group for the design of Interstate 75,
the North Central Expressway, which it completed ahead of schedule.
But state officials say they levied $677,000 in penalties on
several road projects worth $143 million _ double the amount listed
on the highway department's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects on which Brown &AMP; Root faces penalties is in
the eastern Texas town of Lufkin, where the company is two months
behind schedule on a $16 million overpass job begun in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But better late than never, state officials said. ``We're just
hoping they finish this,'' said Cheryl Flood, the state Department
of Transportation resident engineer at Lufkin who is overseeing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with diminished profits and a string of headaches,
Halliburton decided to phase out its smaller-scale road work,
making it even harder to complete the remaining projects.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Gutierrez, a project superintendent at Brown &AMP; Root for
the work in Lufkin, said ``a lot of our key people left the
company,'' when it decided to exit the business. Gutierrez said he
has had to borrow managers from Halliburton's mining, pulp mill and
petrochemical operations. ``All of our jobs are pushed back, mainly
for lack of personnel, qualified people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Cheney went quail hunting in South Texas with
William E. Bradford, chairman and chief executive of Halliburton's
chief rival, Dresser Industries. The two companies, industry
leaders in oil services, had looked several times at the
possibility of merging but had not been able to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Out hunting, the two men agreed to reopen the talks. Within
weeks, the two companies planned to join forces, creating a new
company that would be headed by Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers typically include a process that is known in the
business world as ``due diligence,'' in which both companies look
hard at each other's pending projects to make sure their
assumptions about each other's value are based on solid numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the two chief executives felt so
comfortable with each other they decided this would not be
necessary, according to Vaughn, then Dresser's president.
</P>
<P>
   The deal closed in September 1998, and cultural clashes quickly
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most jarring, present and former executives said, was
over the arcane art of how to account for the profits produced by
long-term projects. Dresser's Kellogg unit was known in the
industry for its conservative approach and its executives prided
themselves on never having to erase profits once they were entered
in the ledgers.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton officials, the executives said, were quicker to log
the profits, relying on their ability to forecast how projects
would turn out. This stirred resentment among Dresser managers who
joined the new company. ``They would work you through the meat
grinder,'' said one former executive. ``They would always opt for
the most aggressive treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two management teams deepened in the months
after the merger with the discovery of large losses on some of the
Halliburton projects.
</P>
<P>
   Dresser's construction unit had forecast a banner year for 1999,
expecting profits of more than $200 million, including gains from
the Halliburton contracts. But a spate of unexpected losses after
the merger, mostly from Halliburton projects, shrunk those profits
to roughly $100 million, a former company official said.
</P>
<P>
   Other losses flowed from Halliburton's overseas contracts,
including a technically demanding project to build a natural gas
pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton won a leading role in the $2 billion project in
July, 1997. The company said Cheney had no role in winning the
contract or negotiating its terms.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which traversed a region of the Amazon known for
its heavy rains, ran into unexpected difficulties. Poor weather, a
strike and construction difficulties sent the costs soaring, just
as oil prices began to fall. Halliburton asked for more money but
the Brazilian oil giant, Petrobras, declined to pay. Industry
executives note that Halliburton's request for extra money came at
an awkward moment, just as oil prices were reaching their lowest
point in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton said it was still negotiating with Petrobras over
the contract. Lesar, the chief executive, declined to discuss the
amount of money at issue, but said all calculations of loss or
profit on deals like the Brazil pipeline are estimates until such
disputes are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, just three months after the merger,
Halliburton declared in a public filing that ``extraordinary
pressure'' from customers refusing to pay additional costs on
projects had forced it to take $60 million in losses. Present and
former company officials said the losses from overseas projects and
the highway work have continued to mount this year, and now total
more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The merger stirred up bitterness, as mergers often do, prompting
some Dresser executives to quit. At least three have sued the
company, charging that Halliburton reneged on promises of a
severance package.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar said the company met all its obligations to the executives
whose jobs were eliminated or scaled back after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawsuit by Paul T. Butzberger, former president of Dresser
Oil Tools, accuses Halliburton of repeatedly assuring him he would
be able to keep his options for 60,000 shares of stock after his
departure, and then refusing to honor those options.
</P>
<P>
   That decision stands in contrast to the board's treatment of
Cheney. Halliburton's board voted last month to allow him to keep
options for 400,000 shares, worth $6 million at Wednesday's price,
treating his departure as early retirement rather than a
resignation. It also allowed him to keep 140,000 shares of stock,
now worth $7.5 million, that it could have canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating a chief executive's record is as much an art as a
science. Vaughn, Halliburton's vice chairman, said Cheney should be
judged on the performance of the company's stock, a standard
benchmark. By that measure, Cheney's early years at Halliburton
were more successful than his later ones, when the company
performed less well than its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Cheney years as chief executive saw Halliburton
stock significantly underperform most stocks in its industry. From
the time he became chief executive through the announcement he was
leaving, Halliburton shares rose 110 percent, while the average oil
service company share price rose 158 percent and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, an index of large company stocks, was up 151 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Arvind Sanger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
Cheney did ``an averagely decent job as CEO. I don't think he did
an exceptional job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more comfortable talking about the big picture, not
the nitty gritty of the business,'' said Sanger. ``Deep down
inside, he's a politician at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cheney has a track record as chief executive that is mediocre
against the backdrop of American business, his candidacy is
nevertheless strongly supported by almost all of the executives who
worked with him, even those who disagreed with how he led the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cheney is a great man, very focused, and he stands for a
lot of the things I stand for,'' said one former executive who quit
in frustration over the company's post-merger culture. ``I just
couldn't stay in that environment,'' he said. ``Life is too
short.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, Dick Cheney pulled off what was widely seen as a
business coup. Ending years of fruitless talks, Cheney arranged a
merger between Halliburton, the company he ran, and its chief
rival, Dresser Industries, creating the world's largest oil field
services and construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were so amicable, the companies dispensed with the
close scrutiny of each other's businesses that is usually part of a
merger, a Dresser official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some key Dresser executives quickly came to regret that
decision, present and former company officials say. They were
startled to learn after the deal closed that several of the major
projects negotiated by Cheney's management team were much less
healthy than they had appeared on the Halliburton's books and were
racking up significant losses. The newly merged company was hit
with several hundred million dollars of unexpected losses,
including an estimated $100 million on a single pipeline project in
South America begun on Cheney's watch, according to company
insiders and others in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresser merger was the biggest deal of Cheney's five years
at Halliburton and the losses that arose soon afterward were one of
several missteps in a business record that has become part of his
political resume since he became the Republican nominee for vice
president. The Bush campaign has defended his multimillion
retirement payment from Halliburton as fair compensation for a job
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people should be pleased they have a
vice-presidential nominee who has been successful in business,''
said Karen P. Hughes, communications director for the campaign of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But just how successful Cheney was as a chief executive is a
matter of considerable dispute, judging by a broad survey of his
record that included interviews with present and former company
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Some praised him for doubling the size of the company through
mergers and a growing government business that has made Halliburton
the nation's fifth-largest military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess Cheney's performance, Halliburton's vice
chairman, Donald Vaughn, said he deserved a ``clearly superior''
grade. ``Mr. Cheney was anything but a status quo man,'' Vaughn
said. ``He changed Halliburton and the popular judgment is he
changed it for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives, however, said Cheney failed to keep a
sufficiently tight rein on the company's aggressive pursuit of
overseas energy projects and road-building work in the United
States. Some Wall Street analysts, too, described Cheney's
performance as little better than average.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cheney declined to make him available for an
interviewer and referred questions about his tenure at Halliburton
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the last president of Dresser, acknowledged in an
interview that there had been ``overall surprise'' with the losses
that emerged after the Dresser merger. Most of them, he said, came
from contracts on the Halliburton side of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn blamed the reversals on an industry downturn caused by
plummeting oil prices in late 1998 and on the complexity of the
projects and said neither he nor his Dresser colleagues felt
deceived. ``No one was flimflammed,'' he said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded 81 years ago as an oil well service concern, Halliburton
has grown into a wide-ranging energy technology and construction
giant with revenues last year of $14.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney arrived as chief executive in October 1995, he was
viewed as a man who would use his worldwide contacts to produce new
business. ``When we brought Cheney in, it really wasn't to run
operations,'' said his predecessor, Cruikshank. ``It was to make
the proper strategic decisions, and to establish relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Cheney's first initiatives were well-regarded mergers that
helped the company master the new technologies reshaping the energy
industry. The company also scored some victories in Washington
under Cheney, winning a $1.1 billion Pentagon contract for support
operations in the Balkans. A Pentagon official said there was no
indication the former defense secretary had any role in sealing the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how much of a hand Cheney had in his management
team's decision to start bidding more aggressively on smaller-scale
highway projects. But while the company won a host of new
contracts, it ran into difficulties in North Carolina and Bush's
home state of Texas for failing to meet deadlines for completing
the work. The projects were small by Halliburton standards, $20
million or less, but a company insider said the losses on several
of them rose as high as $4 million to $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Texas eventually fined the company for its
tardiness and North Carolina officials went further, barring
Halliburton from bidding on road work in the state.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Lesar, Halliburton's chief executive, said the setbacks
in the road work were ``part and parcel'' of a business frequently
punctuated by commercial disputes. ``It's absolutely not an
embarrassment,'' he said. Lesar acknowledged, however, that the
company, which expanded its road building under Cheney, is getting
out of the business of doing such small-scale projects.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said Cheney was frustrated in his desire to
phase out another Halliburton business: Its dealings with Libya
through its British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Lesar said Cheney told executives soon after he arrived that he
wanted to get out of Libya but was dissuaded by the argument that
this would harm the company's long-term relationship with its
customers. ``He had a fiduciary responsibility to his
stockholders,'' Lesar said.
</P>
<P>
   Company insiders said that some of Halliburton's woes under
Cheney were common to corporate America in the late 1990s. But last
year, the company's board of directors withheld bonuses from Cheney
and his management team, which had failed to meet the board's
financial targets for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, Halliburton's vice chairman, said Cheney should be
judged on the performance of the company's stock, a standard
benchmark. By that measure, Cheney's early years at Halliburton
were more successful than his later ones, when the company
performed less well than its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Cheney years as chief executive saw Halliburton
stock significantly underperform most stocks in its industry. From
the time he became chief executive through the announcement he was
leaving, Halliburton shares rose 110 percent, while the average oil
service company share price rose 158 percent and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, an index of large company stocks, was up 151 percent.

VARGAS COULD FACE CONFLICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hillary Dozier, the prosecuting attorney in
Fernando Vargas' assault case, doesn't believe a settlement will be
reached before a scheduled Nov. 2 court date in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   That could complicate Vargas' fight schedule in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets past Ross Thompson on Saturday in Las Vegas, he's
expected to fight Felix Trinidad in what would be a huge
pay-per-view attraction on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a court date a month earlier would make it impossible
for Vargas to fight no matter the verdict: He needs time to train.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's interesting to me,'' Dozier said.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas could avoid the conflict in one of two ways.
</P>
<P>
   One, the two sides could come to an agreement at a settlement
conference on Sept. 6. Obviously, that's what Vargas is hoping for.
He wants to put this behind him and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what we can and hopefully everything will be all
right,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dozier said neither side has been willing to bend
enough to reach an agreement and he doesn't believe anything will
change on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, if no settlement is reached, the trial date could be
moved back a second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already had the date changed once,'' Dozier said. ``I
tend to think it would be difficult to say, 'Hey, let's change it
again.' He could certainly make a request, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's signed (to fight Trinidad), he might be able to get
another continuance.''

   GERMANY: 3 DENY INTENT TO KILL
</P>
<P>
   Three rightist youths said they did not intend to kill Alberto
Adriano, an African, when they assaulted him in the eastern town of
Dessau in June. Speaking in court, where they have been charged
with murder, the youths admitted attacking Adriano and said they
were drunk at the time. A murder conviction requires proof of an

   Joerg Haider, the driving force behind Austria's extreme right

decrees that led to the expulsion of ethnic Germans after World War

   Bowing to European critics, Latvia issued slightly more flexible
rules for a law requiring use of the Latvian language in most
activities. Among other changes, the new rules no longer require
lawyers and doctors to speak fluent Latvian, and allow other
languages to be spoken at international events. Russian-speaking
Latvians, more than a quarter of the population, largely oppose the
rules; some Europeans say the law does not meet the
anti-discrimination standards that Latvia must adopt to join the

PUNTER BECK EXPECTED TO CATCH EYE OF NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ethan Beck doesn't score touchdowns, although he'd
like to. He's not known for making game-saving tackles either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beck is about as important as any skill player on Cal
State Northridge's football team.
</P>
<P>
   Beck - a punter - is a preseason All-American who's expected to
have a senior season worthy of attention from NFL scouts. Beck's
already filling out NFL questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   If Beck makes it to the NFL, he'll be the second CSUN punter to
do so. Bryan Wagner - who punted for CSUN from 1982-84 - played for
several teams, making a Super Bowl appearance with San Diego in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Beck is rated the third-best kicker in college football by
CBSSportsLine.com, which ranks the top five prospects at each
position. Only Nebraska's Dan Hadenfeldt and Ohio State's Dan
Stoltz are rated better.
</P>
<P>
   But the only way Beck can continue to help the Matadors pin
opponents deep in their own territory is if he's on the field and
not on the bench - which is where he was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beck is nursing minor hamstring and groin injuries. He's worked
through several injuries as CSUN's punter the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always my left leg,'' said Beck, who kicks with his right
leg. ``It's a nagging groin injury. It's either the groin or the
hamstring. The last couple of camps it's been nagging me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beck has always shrugged off injuries and, in doing so,
joined an elite group of punters.
</P>
<P>
   He was named a second-team All-American by Don Hansen's Football
Gazette last season. The Sports Network made him a preseason All-
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea until someone told me about it,'' Beck said.
``It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really, considering Beck averaged 43.4 yards per punt. His
longest punt was an 82-yard bomb, which rolled about 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always considered the punt one of our biggest plays,''
said CSUN coach Jeff Kearin, who also coaches punters. ``In a way,
within our offensive framework, it's an offensive play. You play
the field-position game.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck also lines up at receiver for the Matadors. He had eight
catches for 74 yards and one touchdown last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' Beck said. ``But I've found my place in punting.
People call me a kicker. But it's cool. I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck wouldn't mind a few more passes thrown his way but he knows
his opportunity to move to the next level will come through
punting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to stay healthy,'' Beck said. ``I don't want to screw
up my punting because of catching a couple of balls and getting
hurt in a game. At the same time, I like to play receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors have a solid receiving corps with returners Drew
Amerson and Gil Rodriguez, along with newcomer Jason Stone and
others. But Kearin said Beck will play more receiver if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethan is probably one of the most-gifted punters we've ever
had and on top of that, he's a gifted athlete,'' Kearin said.
``He's a threat to run or throw. What I think is attractive (to
scouts) is that he can kick off, too. He has a big-time kickoff
leg. What he needs to do is get the ball off a little quicker and
more efficiently. Then I think he's a prototypical punter.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinyard sidelined: Quarterback Jermaine Guinyard - a true
freshman - didn't practice Wednesday because he was sick. Guinyard
is expected to redshirt this season.

   Now OSI has a chance to rewrite history. In order to win
antitrust clearance for its acquisition of Warner-Lambert, Pfizer
recently gave back to OSI full rights to one of the drugs from
their collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Other drug companies are courting OSI, hoping to take Pfizer's
place. But this time, OSI has more than $80 million, having
recently completed a $56.5 million financing. The company, based in
Uniondale, N.Y., can carry the drug through clinical trials itself,
executives say. And even if it takes on a partner, OSI will be sure
to get a much bigger share of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we are not in a defensive position because of
our financial situation is very important,'' said Colin Goddard,
OSI's president and chief executive. ``The economics are
transformed, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   Money has poured into biotechnology in the last year, changing
the dynamics of an industry that has long lived from hand to mouth
and relied on the deep pockets of the big pharmaceutical companies
to bring its technology and drugs to market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the biotech companies do not need the drug companies'
money as badly as they once did _ but the drug companies still want
to license biotech drugs. So as the balance of power shifts from
the pharmaceutical giants to biotech companies like OSI, the
smaller companies are able to arrange licensing deals that leave
them with larger shares of the profits, and in some cases, direct
roles in selling the drugs they develop.

   Only two years ago, many biotech companies were in financial
trouble because investors had soured. Unable to raise money, some
companies had to close or enter into shotgun mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But that has all changed as fast as you can say ``genomics.''
The excitement at the prospect of unraveling the human genetic
code, announced in June, has transformed investors' view of the
biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks roared from last fall until March, when
they plunged after remarks by President Clinton and Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain that seemed to suggest opposition to patents
on genes. But the stocks have been climbing since then, and most
are well above where they started the year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the face of heightened investor interest, companies have
raced to raise money. In the first six months of this year,
biotechnology companies raised $22.1 billion, well above the $12
billion raised in all of 1999 and more than triple the $8.1 billion
raised in 1998, according to Recombinant Capital, a financial
consulting firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the deals have been breathtaking. While the typical
initial public stock offering for a biotech company in years past
might have raised about $30 million, according to investment
bankers, many of the biotech IPOs now are for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Abgenix, Medarex and Millennium
Pharmaceuticals each raised more than $400 million in single
transactions earlier this year. And Celera Genomics issued stock
worth nearly $1 billion in a secondary stock offering in February,
more than the total raised in secondary offerings by all
biotechnology companies combined in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you stop today, we've broken all records,'' said
Stelios Papadopoulos, the head of biotechnology investment banking
at S G Cowen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But the rush is not stopping. While biotech companies stayed
away from the market after their stocks fell in March, they have
since returned. Since the beginning of July, 30 biotech companies
have gone public, according to Recombinant Capital, raising $2.5
billion. That follows 23 initial public offerings in the previous
six months. Another 16 biotech companies are waiting to go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get our arms around it,'' said Jeffrey
Casdin, chief executive of Cooper Hill Partners, a New York biotech
investment partnership. ``Who's who? Who does what? Who are the
good ones? Who are the bad ones? It's all coming in a rush.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The boom has helped create a class of biotechnology companies
big enough to compete with big pharmaceutical companies to license
technology or buy smaller companies. Millennium Pharmaceuticals,
for instance, recently paid $55 million for Cambridge Discovery
Chemistry, a company with technology for developing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies are also in a better position to develop
more than one drug at a time and diversify. And thanks to their
solid financing, companies making tools for genomic analysis can
afford to develop their technology themselves and sell to all
comers, rather than give exclusive rights to a single drug company
in exchange for an injection of capital.
</P>
<P>
   The newly emboldened biotech companies are also beginning to
demand _ and get _ better bargains in their deals with
pharmaceutical companies. ``A lot of deals that may have been done
in the past are not being done,'' said Lee Babiss, vice president
for preclinical research and development at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some biotech companies are demanding a 50-50 split of profits
from their drugs and a role in the marketing that will help them
become full-fledged drug companies. Abgenix recently struck a deal
with Immunex, a larger biotechnology company, that will give
Abgenix 50 percent of the profits from a cancer drug it is
developing. Millennium Pharmaceuticals recently announced a deal in
which it would be virtually an equal partner with Aventis, a big
European drug company, in several endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Allos Therapeutics of Denver, which raised $90 million in an IPO
this year, plans to take its drugs to market by itself. ``There's
now no need, at least for financial reasons, to seek a corporate
partner in North America,'' said Stephen J. Hoffman, president and
chief executive. The money, he said, ``has really given us control
of our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While biotech companies are more independent, they and the
pharmaceutical giants have long had a symbiotic relationship. In
the years when biotech companies' stocks were depressed and they
had a hard time raising money, deals with big drug companies kept
many smaller biotech concerns afloat. The pharmaceutical companies,
meanwhile, have come to rely on the biotech companies to help fill
their pipelines with new drugs or to provide the latest
technological tools. Many big drug companies now spend 20 to 30
percent of their research and development budgets on outside
collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, big pharmaceutical companies would often pay for
clinical trials and give a biotechnology company some money up
front, various payments along the way, and a royalty on product
sales. But ``most of the deals that biotech has done have rewarded
the pharma investor, not the biotech investor,'' said Louis G.
Lange, chairman and chief executive of CV Therapeutics, a biotech
company in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, biotechnology companies can afford to conduct more
clinical trials themselves, and license drugs at a later stage when
the risk of failure has been reduced. That allows them to get a
bigger share of the profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that `We're Big Pharma and will give you a 2
percent royalty and a million bucks' _ those days are over,'' said
Mark Simon, an investment banker specializing in the life science
industry at Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts caution that biotechnology companies should not get too
cocky. The entire market capitalization of public biotechnology
companies _ about $400 billion, according to Burrill &AMP; Co., a
biotech investment and research company _ is only as much as Pfizer
and Merck combined.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Partnerships with big companies can provide smaller biotech
operations with more than money. They validate a small company's
technology in the mind of investors. And the big company can offer
expertise in bringing a drug through clinical trials and in sales
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is every company rich. Recombinant Capital said 61 of 247
public companies it surveyed in the first quarter had less than a
year's worth of cash. And even the better financed companies can
find they need more than they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genomics is a game of scale and post genomics is even more
so,'' said Kevin Starr, chief financial officer of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals. ``It takes billions, not $100 million, to make
this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, biotechnology has seen waves of investor enthusiasm
before, most notably in 1991 and in 1996. Those boomlets were
followed by prolonged downturns as investors realized that it would
take several years and hundreds of millions of dollars more for the
companies to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The companies raising money now, for the most part, are also
years away from profitability, so analysts say it would not be
surprising for stocks to go down. ``I think it's difficult to
understand the business models of many of the more recent IPOs,''
said Matthew N. Murray, portfolio manager of the Alliance Select
Biotechnology Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Already investors are suffering some indigestion from the run of
IPO's and are getting pickier. One company, Advanced Medicine,
which is backed in part by Bill Gates, dropped plans for a public
offering in late July, citing unfavorable market conditions.
Pharsight Corp., Telik Inc., and Ista Pharmaceuticals all had
initial stock offerings at lower prices than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many companies have already filled their coffers enough
to last through many lean years. ``In 1991 you got two years of
money and thought you did pretty well,'' said Vivek Jain, an
investment banker at Chase H&AMP;Q. ``This time companies are going out
and getting five to six years of financing.''

DAN MARINO WITH A SELLOUT CROWD   AND NO OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The onetime Jets quarterback Ken O'Brien, among a host
of former players and a sellout gathering of 55,000 fans to pay
homage to the retired Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino
Wednesday night, recalled one play in particular that defined the
man who went on to be the most productive passer in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1985 at the Orange Bowl, where the Dolphins once played
their home games, and the Jets had just scored to take a 17-14 lead
with less than a minute left. At the time Marino was a third-year
pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought we had the game won,'' O'Brien said. ``I'm
on the sideline watching and all off a sudden I see Duper come up
to the line of scrimmage all by himself in bump and run,'' he said,
referring to the wide receiver Mark Duper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear Marino calling an audible, because he sees what I see.
I start yelling at our defense, `Get back, get back.' I look over
at the coach, `Call a timeout.' But it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The long touchdown pass, one of a record 420 Marino threw in 17
NFL seasons, gave the Dolphins one of the 37 fourth-quarter
comebacks they achieved during No. 13's career.
</P>
<P>
   Marino retired after a largely acrimonious 1999 season with
then-Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson. Yet his impact on the franchise
was so pervasive that the Dolphins organized Wednesday night's
tribute to give fans a chance to honor him. Never mind the possible
threat of tropical storm Debby or Wednesday night's conclusion of
the highly successful television show ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player Stadium, reduced to about 55,000 to accommodate a
concert featuring Hootie and the Blowfish and large video screens,
sold out in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Marino, the other five quarterbacks comprising the
distinguished class of 1983 _ the Hall of Famer John Elway, Jim
Kelly, Todd Blackledge, Tony Eason and O'Brien _ all were here. So
were the Hall of Fame quarterbacks Joe Namath and Terry Bradshaw,
the Hall of Fame Coach Don Shula and some 50 former Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   A local radio station encouraged fans to write their personal
thoughts about Marino on a giant card outside the stadium. It was
filled well before sundown, mostly with an outpouring of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for 17 glorious years,'' wrote Greg Gully of New York
City. ``See you in Canton in 2005.'' Canton, Ohio, of course, is
the site of the Football Hall of Fame. Marino, who passed for a
record 61,361 yards, will be eligible for admission in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Danny came in and sort of set the world on
fire as a rookie,'' said Elway, the former Denver Broncos star.
``That set the bar awful high for the rest of us in the class. When
Danny's around now, we don't even talk about stats. We change the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, formerly of the Buffalo Bills, noted that Marino was so
explosive and competitive that he represented a fear factor for
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''You realized that you had to play error-free football to
win,'' Kelly said. ``You never could relax when you were playing
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shula, the winningest coach in NFL history, said he is proud
that Marino was able to break all of the passing records in 13
seasons under him that it took Fran Tarkenton 18 seasons to set.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked in his first practice that he was going to be
something special,'' Shula said. ``You could see the great arm and
quick release.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just felt that no matter what the defense was that he could
somehow fit it in there,'' Shula said. ``He felt there was no
defense for the perfect pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino now has eased into some television work, with more free
time than he is accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I've had second thoughts,'' Marino said about his
decision to retire. ``I've played football for more than 30 years.
It's a tough thing to face, but I believe in my heart that I made
the right decision.''

DOVE HUNTERS READY FOR SEASON OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Monrovia's Tom Loy and thousands of fellow dove
hunting enthusiasts know the numbers: eight days and counting, 34
percent more birds have been forecast from the previous year and 48
percent more than the average for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all California shooters need is more cooperation from the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting is fast and furious,'' said Loy, who will make
his traditional trip to the Imperial Valley next week. ``There's
nothing like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The state-wide season, which is the traditional bird-hunting
opener, begins Friday, Sept. 1 and will continue until Sept. 15. A
second 45-day season begins Nov. 11. The bag limit is 10 doves per
day in the aggregate, including mourning and white-winged dove,
with a total possession limit of 20 birds following two or more
days of hunting. Spotted and ringed turtle doves are also allowed,
but common ground, ruddy ground and Inca dove are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The weather, Department of Fish and Game biologists in Imperial,
Riverside and San Bernardino counties say, has been nearly ideal.
There have been no monsoons, a weather condition with a lot of
lightning, high winds and sideways rain, and Imperial County
biologist Nancy Andrews says the southeastern corner of the state
has had only a few windstorms, but doves have remained in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting a good opener,'' Andrews said. ``In some
spots, you might get 200 people standing around a field, but there
should be plenty of opportunities. It should be the best we've had
in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The biologists credit excellent spring conditions for the upturn
in doves. This year's numbers are the best in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one of our best spring dove counts,'' Andrews said.
``We had quite a few white-wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Doves feed primarily on seeds and grain. They roost in trees or
shrub thickets and feed in open scrub areas, usually in the morning
and the evening. They are a game bird that needs water every day,
too. But when the temperature goes below 70 degrees they usually
flee to warmer climes in Mexico or Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And with the lack of rain and monsoons, dove will likely be
found only in irrigated areas this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck looking in the desert,'' Andrews said. ``There's
nothing to eat. There's no quail, either. It will be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouting for dove generally can only be done a day or two before
the start of the season, Riverside County biologist Gerald Mulcahy
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers are pretty cooperative, but you won't know where
to hunt until those who do not want hunters post no hunting signs a
day or two before the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters are losing places to shoot, he says, because of the
failure to pick up their shells.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to pick up their holes,'' he said. ``If they don't,
the farmer's balers pick them up, the farmers sell the bales for
feed and the cows eat it and become diseased.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's where biologists expect hunters to have their best shots
in Southern California:
</P>
<P>
   IMPERIAL COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   Andrews expects the best spots to be in the Valley, where there
is wheat fields and its stubble. She says areas along the All
American, East Highline and Coachella canals are all excellent. So
is the east side of the Salton Sea, especially in the Imperial
Wildlife Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, anywhere with seeds is excellent,'' she said.
``You just have to find fields with not too many hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   The area is large and has a lot of farming fields. The All
American Canal runs from the Colorado River near Winterhaven 60
miles to the west in El Centro. The East Highline Canal shoots off
the All American Canal northeast of Calapatria, and brush zones
along the East Mesa, which runs parallel to th canal, about a 50
mile distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go there every year,'' Loy said. ``There is always a good
influx of doves in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   There are generally two hot dove areas, Palo Verdes, just south
of Blythe, and the Coachella Valley, between Indio and the Salton
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The melon and wheat fields that have been plowed under are where
doves currently are, Mulcahy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the farmers have been cooperative, but some do post
their fields,'' he said. ``But there are still a lot of areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulcahy said hunters new to the area will have to scout fields
on the Wednesday or Thursday before the opener, and not to expect a
hotel room; everything's been booked for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   To the west, Andrews says the fields of the Coachella Valley
between Indio and Mecca are also very good. Areas between Desert
Hot Springs and Indio; the Orocopia Mountains; Dillon Road in the
Coachella Valley; Dawson Canyon, south of Lake Mathews; French
Valley, south of Winchester; San Jacinto Valley; and the Hemet
area, have all yielded dove in the past, DFG biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   Dove are not as plentiful as in the other counties, but they're
still there, says DFG biologist Andy Pauli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its not the hot spots like down south, but there are good
numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best spot may be along the Mojave River, just north of
Victorville, but Pauli says most of the fields have posted no
hunting signs. Otherwise, Pauli suggests hunters try the fields
near Yermo, which is just east of Barstow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see a lot of doves, but they're just hard to get
at,'' he says.

DOVE HUNTERS: DON'T FORGET GOOD MANNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NEVIN BARICH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With dove season only a week away, it's a good
time to review good hunting etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   --Make a concerted effort to find any bird you shoot. Failure to
do so could result in a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when you shoot a bird, it will travel for as much
as 100 yards,'' said Bruce Kenyon, the state chairman for Quail
Unlimited and Doves Unlimited, two organizations geared toward
restoring the habitat of its respective birds. ``It's the hunter's
responsibility to find a bird that he or she shoots. Otherwise,
that person may end up shooting up to 15 or 20 birds.''
</P>
<P>
   --It is generally agreed that a distance of 70-80 yards between
hunters is accepted protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to a spot where you know birds are working,
there's a reasonable chance that there'll be 100 guys there,'' said
Kenyon, whose Santa Clarita Chapter of his organizations pays to
put 150 kids through hunter safety training every year. ``And since
you're using guns, distance is important.''
</P>
<P>
   But the safety distance is not a rule in the National Fish and
Game Code. Both Kenyon and Dick Haldeman, the regional director for
Quail Unlimited and Doves Unlimited, think it should stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those ethical decisions,'' Haldeman said. ``Guys
are usually pretty good about it. It's really a safety factor. I
don't know that it needs to be set into law.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on updated dove hunting rules and laws, ask
for a rulebook at your local sporting goods store.

REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE CANCELS A COMMERCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee has canceled plans to use a
television commercial showing Vice President Al Gore saying in a
1994 interview with NBC that neither he nor President Clinton had
lied in their political careers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was pulled, Republican officials said, because it
did not make clear the date of the interview, nor did it explain
that Gore was responding to questions about the U.S. Senate
campaign of Oliver North in Virginia. There was also fear, they
said, that swing voters would see the commercial as an unfair
effort to saddle Gore with responsibility for Clinton's deceptive
remarks about his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was confusion about when the interview was made that
would be a reason not to run the ad,'' a spokesman for the
Republican National Committee, Clifford May, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee declined to release a tape or
transcript of the advertisement or to say how many copies had been
sent to television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, who would speak only if they were not
identified, said the commercial produced by National Media showed a
television set on a kitchen table. The television is on, and the
screen shows an excerpt from the 1994 interview by Lisa Meyers, who
was asking Gore about his description of North as a ``pathological
liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you say that neither you nor President Clinton has told a
lie in your political career?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, none spring to mind, I'll tell you that,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``And President Clinton has not uttered a single untruth in the
last two years?'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I have heard. Absolutely not,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   At Gore's campaign headquarters in Nashville Wednesday, some
advisers professed disappointment that the advertisement was not
shown as scheduled. They said they were certain that the
advertisement would have backfired on the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   May said there had never been a decision to use the commercial,
adding, ``If the Democrats want to make a big thing about an ad
that didn't run, they can do so.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Bruce Kenyon knows how popular dove hunting is.
</P>
<P>
   Having pursued the sport for almost 50 years, Kenyon has been
one of thousands across the country who get out their shotguns at
the beginning of every September for the opening of dove hunting
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more people that dove hunt on the opening of dove
season than probably all of the other hunting put together,''
Kenyon said. ``There are more shotgun shells (on opening weekend)
expended than all other hunting shotgun shells put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the popularity of the sport, Kenyon wanted to make
sure doves would still be around to hunt in the years to come. With
that in mind, he started Doves Unlimited, a nonprofit organization
striving to preserve the dove population by putting in water
devices and growing food for areas with high dove populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to preserve doves, but I want to do my darnedest
to make sure they're around,'' Kenyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Doves Unlimited is actually an extension of Quail Unlimited,
which helps preserve the natural habitat of quails. Kenyon is the
state chairman for the Southern California chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Quail Unlimited, which has been in existence for 18 years, has
about 60,000 members nationwide, including 1,500 in Southern
California. Kenyon hopes to eventually attract the same amount of
interest for doves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Doves Unlimited will be an outreach program to dove
hunters to give them the feeling of belonging to something that
they have in common,'' Kenyon said. ``We're going to start having
articles on habitat and management in our organization's magazine.
As the membership grows, we'll be publishing dual magazines every
two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Haldeman, the regional director for Quail Unlimited, thinks
the new organization will be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of sheer participation, I think it will,'' Haldeman
said. ``I think that, just from the people I know, a good 35
percent of them don't hunt anything but dove. There's potential for
a lot of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   For current and future members of Quail Unlimited, three
different types of memberships are offered: A quail membership, a
dove membership or a dual membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically the same type of work,'' said Kenyon of the
restoration work of the two organizations. ``Everything goes hand
in hand. We'll be putting in watering devices and working in food
plots.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on either organization, call Bruce Kenyon
at (805) 526-2073.

   THE DEMOCRATS

   CLINTON INCHES FROM LIMELIGHT: President Clinton is working hard
to leave the limelight to Vice President Gore, aides say. He
scrapped plans to travel to Atlanta Wednesday to celebrate the
fourth anniversary of the welfare reform law. It seems the Gore
campaign preferred that he not go, a message that William M. Daley,
the campaign chairman, passed along to John D. Podesta, the
president's chief of staff. Clinton did travel Wednesday to New
Jersey for two low-key political fund-raisers. But he kept the
focus on Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, saying that the most important thing was for the two
``to go out and spread the message, engage in the debate and make
sure the American people know what the choices are before them.''

   THE INTEREST GROUPS
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY JOB OFFER: The job offer generated publicity all right,
but probably not the kind that the nonprofit organization wanted.
American Women Presidents, a new group based in Sacramento, Calif.,
that advocates election of a woman president and vice president,
offered Monica Lewinsky a job on Tuesday as its corporate vice
president. But hours later, the group rescinded the offer after
protests from women's groups and others. In its job offer, faxed to
Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, the group said that it was
disturbed that Lewinsky's career had been sidetracked since her
relationship with President Clinton and hoped that she could use
her name recognition to promote the election of women. But the
group's founder, Mosemarie Boyd, said she later decided against
risking her organization's credibility by offering a job to
Lewinsky and issued a statement apologizing for any inconvenience
and wishing Lewinsky well.

</P>
<P>
   RUNOFF IN SELMA: For the first time in 36 years, Mayor Joe
Smitherman of Selma, Ala., was forced on Tuesday into a runoff
election, raising the serious possibility that the predominately
black city, infamous in the 1960s for its bitter civil rights
struggles, will be led next by a black mayor. Smitherman, 70, was
first elected mayor in 1964 and has since always managed to win
re-election the first time around, usually with the help of some
black voters. He has long maintained that no other white candidate
will ever be able to match that achievement and therefore he will
be the last white mayor of Selma. He was challenged on Tuesday, for
the third time, by James Perkins, a black businessman who got 43
percent of the vote, compared to Smitherman's 46 percent. Two other
black candidates got the remainder of the vote. Smitherman, who
will face Perkins in a Sept. 12 runoff, said he was disappointed
that he received fewer black votes on Tuesday than in the past.

<P>
   THE GREEN PARTY
</P>
<P>
   MAKING POWER AN ISSUE: Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate turned
Green Party presidential candidate, has been hammering hard on the
theme that corporations have far too much power. So when he got to
California this week, he saw major political opportunity in the
skyrocketing cost of electricity, which has recently doubled and
even quadrupled in some places following price deregulation by the
state. In San Diego, the first city to feel the effects of free
market prices, he charged that big corporations had dominated the
deregulation process and called on Californians to sieze back
regulatory control of the electricity industry and demand their
money back. The state legislature and Gov. Gray Davis, he said,
should push through a rate rollback law that does not include a
provision to compensate utilities for any money that might cost
them. ``Electricity deregulation really brings about a collision of
interests,'' Nader said. ``It pits the interests of consumers, who
are often unorganized and lack power, against the interests of
suppliers, who are usually very organized, powerful and have a lot
of money behind them.'' George W. Bush and Al Gore, he said, are
beholden to corporate influence.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY IN CALIFORNIA: Dick Cheney also was in California
Wednesday, but the issues he hit hardest had nothing to do with
either corporate or electric power. Rather he emphasized three
themes that have become central to the Bush-Cheney campaign in
recent days _ bolstering education, the military and the nation's
sense of honor and integrity, the latter almost always a
none-too-subtle reference to President Clinton's conduct in the
White House. In Bakersfield, Cheney told a group of high school
students in the Junior Reserved Officers Training Corps that
``nothing is more essential to education than teaching character,''
and he suggested that permitting prayer in public schools would
help accomplish the job. ``We want our children to learn to read
and write, but we also want them to know right from wrong,'' Cheney
said. ``Certainly my time as secretary of defense taught me the
enormous importance, if you will, of character in terms of the
functioning of the U.S. military. No military organization can
survive without honor and integrity.''

PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNS FOR NEW JERSEY   DEMOCRATS 
BY DAVID M. HALBFINGER  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPEWELL, N.J. _ President Clinton flew through the New Jersey
suburbs on Wednesday, shuttling from a horse farm here to a horse
track in Cherry Hill _ with a stop in Princeton that paralyzed the
borough's streets at rush hour _ all to help a pair of Democrats
facing uphill contests for the House of Representatives in two
closely watched races.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is eager for Democrats to retake control of Congress,
and he spent much of the day with Rep. Rush Holt, widely seen as
one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House, before attending
a fund-raiser in Cherry Hill for Susan Bass Levin, that town's
mayor, who is challenging Rep. James H. Saxton, a 16-year
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception for Holt on Wednesday night, Clinton said the
freshman congressman, a plasma physicist, was uniquely prepared to
deal with issues of genetics, computer science and other emerging
technologies. ``Even Republicans who may not agree with every vote
he cast ought to think long and hard before they replace him,''
Clinton said. ``You need someone who really understands all these
big, future issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who represents the wealthy, fast-growing 12th
Congressional District in New Jersey's midsection, is in an unusual
matchup: his opponent is Richard Zimmer, who held the seat for
three terms until he gave it up to run for the Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer lost the Senate race to Robert Torricelli, but their
acrimonious contest gave Zimmer a statewide profile, and he remains
more familiar to residents in the district than Holt. According to
one survey by the Holt campaign, nearly 70 percent of voters did
not know who represented them, and a sizable number thought Zimmer
still did.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer now leads Holt by 6 to 12 percentage points, depending on
which candidate's internal polls are to be believed. Holt said he
believed the gap was no reflection on his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won in 1998, the other party just couldn't believe it,
and they still can't accept it,'' he said. ``They are determined
that this seat belonged to them, and that they are going to take it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holt said his constituents had a rare opportunity to compare
his record with Zimmer's. He pointed to accomplishments such as
securing $40 million in federal money for open-space preservation
efforts, pushing to ban large trucks from two-lane roads, and
lobbying for money to build schools and hire new teachers. ``I
think I'm a good fit for this district,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared with Holt at a jazz and Champagne reception for
about 350 people in Hopewell, where Holt was introduced by Jon S.
Corzine, the Democratic nominee for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The reception was held on a 75-acre horse farm owned by Robert
Stockman, a venture capitalist, and his wife, Lisa, who is involved
in the Delaware and Raritan Canal Greenway, a land-preservation and
water-quality advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's finance director, Neil Upmeyer, said the event would
produce more than $250,000 for the campaign, in addition to $1.8
million raised previously.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Holt is seen by both parties as one of the two most
endangered Democratic incumbents in November, along with Michael
Forbes of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's campaign against Saxton in the Third Congressional
District, meanwhile, is still seen as something of a long shot,
even by New Jersey Democratic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton has never faced a challenger with more than $1 million to
spend, and Levin, a prominent fund-raiser for New Jersey Democrats,
had raised more than $1.2 million for herself before Wednesday's
event. The reception at the Garden State Park racetrack _ a reprise
of a campaign stop Clinton made before his own election in 1992 _
was expected to draw 500 people and produce $200,000 for Levin,
said Sallie Stohler, her campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of Levin's strength as a candidate came in June,
when the New Jersey AFL-CIO endorsed her after some debate, despite
its predilection for backing incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   But David P. White, Saxton's campaign manager, said Saxton had
received more in campaign contributions from union members than
Levin had. And Saxton has also received the endorsements of the
Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, which give him
high marks for his record on water-quality issues. Moreover,
Levin's campaign was shaken by a wholesale staff turnover a few
weeks ago, in which her hard-driving personality was said to have
played a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levin's an incredible fund-raiser, and she's certainly proved
her mettle, but Saxton's not inherently vulnerable,'' said Amy
Walter, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report.
``He's been there a long time, and he hasn't done anything wrong.
Incumbents have to help you. The district's trending Democratic,
and if it were an open seat it'd be very competitive, but
incumbents who lose to insurgent candidates are usually incumbents
who don't take them seriously. And he's taking this one very
seriously.''

 &HT;    Accolades rain on superb Hokies quarterback
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ For nearly a half-hour, the conversation
zigzagged like a Michael Vick scramble, covering a range of topics:
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy. Vick's beloved pit bull, Champagne, who is
in heat and about to breed. FSU and the Sugar Bowl. Fishing.
Turning pro. Throwing left-handed and doing everything else as a
righty. His personal Web site. Improvising afield. The art of the
self-interview.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the lure of the nightlife in this college town.
Specifically, the perils of late-night shopping at the 24-hour
Wal-Mart, where autograph hounds sniff out Vick at any time of the
day or night. He can't go anywhere, not even the snack-food aisle
near midnight, without drawing a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the allotted 25 interview minutes up, Vick stood, shook
hands and left the tiny office in the Virginia Tech sports
information department. But not before glancing once more at the
computer screen on the desk. As the Heisman front-runner, the kid
who might redefine the quarterback position, walked out the door, a
visitor sneaked a peek at the screen saver that had periodically
distracted Vick.
</P>
<P>
   It was the cover of ESPN The Magazine's college football
preview, with cover boy Vick in full uniform, holding his helmet
and a football and standing beside the headline, ``Human
Highlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. As breathtaking and captivating a player as Vick is,
one whose talent and possibilities demand everyone's full attention
on every play, sometimes Michael Vick can't take his eyes off
Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
   Let the hyperbole begin:
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to come out of Virginia since baked ham. ... A
new kind of quarterback, the next step in football's evolutionary
ladder. ... The most precocious dazzler to stroll a college campus
since Brooke Shields graced Princeton. ... I've never seen anyone
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just a sampling of the gushing going on everywhere. That
last gush came from John Madden, who has seen _ and telestrated _ a
QB or two. ''Michael Vick is probably the best quarterback in
America,'' Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni said. ''There's not a
team at any level that's got an answer to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Pasqualoni's Orangemen last October, when Vick,
then a freshman, led Virginia Tech to its most resounding victory
in 77 years, a 62-0 humiliation of Syracuse. Sunday night, it's
George O'Leary and Georgia Tech's turn. The Jackets open the 2000
season here against the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they have, I don't know what the word is, a magical
quarterback there,'' O'Leary said. In Vick, they have one singular
sensation who merely led Virginia Tech to an 11-0 regular season.
It was the first in school history, prompting the production of
''Hokie Toasties'' cereal that can still be found on grocery
shelves throughout town. The kid nearly led the Hokies to the
national championship, rallying them from a 28-7 deficit against
mighty Florida State in the Sugar Bowl to a 29-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that FSU won the game, 46-29, and its second national
title. The next day, Hokies coach Frank Beamer was in Houston and
giving a radio interview before accepting yet another
coach-of-the-year award.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy said, 'You know, Florida State won the national
championship last night, and all my callers want to talk about is
Michael Vick,''' said Beamer, who understood the fascination.
''I've said, 'I can't wait to see the next great play.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Beamer saw so many last season, when Vick passed for 1,840
yards, ran for 585 more, accounted for 20 touchdowns and displayed
a combination of speed, cunning, cut-back ability, arm strength and
improvisation rarely, if ever, seen in a quarterback. Any
quarterback, on any level. Despite the loss to FSU, Vick's vapor
runs and his passing enabled the Hokies to finish No. 2 in the
final rankings, their highest finish.
</P>
<P>
   Vick was third in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Wisconsin's
Ron Dayne and Georgia Tech's All-American quarterback, Joe
Hamilton. Vick tied Georgia's Herschel Walker and the late Clint
Castleberry of Georgia Tech for the highest Heisman finish by a
freshman. Vick now is the preseason favorite to become the first
sophomore to win the Heisman. No one here would be surprised if he
did; nor would they begrudge him turning pro after this season,
which Vick probably will do if he wins the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really worried about that right now,'' Vick said. ''I
plan on being here for the next three years. Just leave it at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that. Not from a kid who is 6-foot-1, 214
pounds, can throw the ball 70 yards and, in the spring, lowered his
40-yard time from 4.33 seconds to 4.25. The kid who shredded FSU's
top-rated defense for 323 yards total offense, including 225 yards
passing and 145 rushing despite losing a combined 48 yards on eight
sacks. It's been like that since high school in Newport News, where
Vick fell under the guidance of coach Tommy Reamon at Warwick High.
Reamon not only worked relentlessly with Vick from the 9th grade on
but encouraged him to work on his communication skills. So Vick
sometimes stood in front of a mirror and interviewed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just the reporter, and me,'' Vick said. ''I know it
sounds weird, but it wasn't long. I wasn't just practicing on my
speaking but in case I got into that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick was interviewed constantly last year, from the moment he
flipped head-over-heels in the opener against James Madison for one
of his three first-quarter touchdowns in his 47-0 coming-out party.
Recalling when Vick and Blacksburg flipped for each other,
linebacker Nick Sorensen said, ''You were shocked, and then you
were ticked off. Like, 'Geez, that's unbelievable! But what are you
doing, you idiot?!' ``
</P>
<P>
   Vick kept doing stuff like that all season long. Fans held up,
''VICK 3:16'' signs. Vick became good buddies with Hamilton,
meeting the Jackets' quarterback at the Heisman weekend in New
York, then hanging out with him in Las Vegas, where Vick won an
ESPY as the nation's top college player.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vick begins his second season, after spending the summer
here working out when not making late-night trips to the Wal-Mart.
He was besieged for 60 autographs one night last week while
shopping for some furnishings for his off-campus apartment. ''He
can't go anywhere campus, town, everywhere without someone asking
him for his autograph,'' said cornerback Ronyell Whitaker. ''Even
if they don't ask, you hear whispers: 'That's Michael Vick.' ``

 &HT;    Brunner denied admission
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Kenny Brunner's controversial past _ not his
academic transcripts _ probably prevented him from attending the
University of Georgia this fall.
</P>
<P>
   UGA president Michael Adams announced Wednesday that he would
not admit Brunner for the fall semester. Adams said the school
would consider the former Georgetown point guard's application for
spring semester, but only if the school received his official
academic transcripts and if the player met with a three-member
faculty committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to make a decision on an applicant without the
benefit of a complete academic record and transcript,'' Adams said
in a statement. ``Also, I do not want to decide on something as
important as a student's future on what may or may not have been
reported in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia basketball coach Jim Harrick said the school received
the rest of Brunner's transcripts late Tuesday. The transcripts
were faxed to Georgia from Compton College in California and a
school in Colorado, where Brunner took a mail-correspondence
course. But Georgia's admissions office can consider only official
transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's late-enrollment period ended Tuesday. Brunner would
have needed permission from professors to enroll in classes this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transcripts are here, but they're not official,'' Harrick
said. ``They wanted official transcripts, which would take a day or
so. We got everything, but it was a little late.''
</P>
<P>
   If Brunner is accepted for spring semester, he could still play
for Harrick this season. Georgia's fall semester ends on Dec. 15.
Under NCAA rules, Brunner would be eligible to play the following
day. The Bulldogs' SEC schedule doesn't begin until Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick said Brunner was going to take a few days to consider
his options. He could try to enroll at a school that begins fall
classes at a later date, or he could remain in Athens and try to
enroll in Georgia in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be his choice, as far as what he wants to
do,'' Harrick said. ``I'm going to give him a few days to consider
his options. I'm disappointed for the young man. We made a
commitment to him, his family, his coaches, everybody. He took the
decision very hard. It was a big blow for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunner and his uncle arrived in Athens on Friday after driving
from California. Harrick said he did not start recruiting Brunner
until he received permission from Adams and Georgia athletics
director Vince Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got permission to do everything, but I guess we just didn't
get it done in time,'' Harrick said.
</P>
<P>
   When media outlets reported last week that Brunner intended to
transfer to Georgia, the university inititated a background check
on him. Steve Shewmaker, the school's director of legal affairs,
started the inquiry on Aug. 17. The Bulldogs have been recruiting
Brunner in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``After talking to all of those people, virtually everything I
heard was positive,'' said Shewmaker, who served as a judge in
Kentucky for 16 years. ``I heard nothing alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunner spent four months in 1998 in the Los Angeles City Jail
on attempted-murder and robbery charges that later were dropped. He
also was involved in an incident at Fresno State in which he
allegedly assaulted an acquaintance with a samurai sword. Those
charges also were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' decision not to admit Brunner came only two days after
Georgia basketball recruit John Toombs was arrested in Athens on
misdemeanor charges of underage possession of alcohol and
disorderly conduct. Toombs, from Carver High School in Columbus,
could have enrolled at UGA as a partial qualifier, but he was
denied admission after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick acknowledged that Toombs' arrest ``probably didn't
help'' Brunner's bid to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Brunner was expected to start at point guard for the Bulldogs,
who struggled in Harrick's first season as coach. Without Brunner,
Harrick said freshman Rashad Wright of Statesboro probably would
start at point guard. Junior D.A. Layne and sophomore Ezra Williams
would start on the wings, with seniors Anthony Evans and Shon
Coleman in the frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rashad Wright isn't a bad player,'' Harrick said. ``But you're
talking about Rashad playing in the SEC. The SEC isn't for boys;
it's for men.''

DOG-EAT-DOG REALITY, BUT MUST-SEE TV
</HEADLINE>
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is the standard line about the success of
``Survivor'': It is a reality game show featuring 16 ordinary
people on an island, plus one scheming villain to hiss at, as the
group votes one member off each week. But that conventional wisdom
is entirely backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is as remote from reality as its setting, Pulau
Tiga (likely translation: Island of the Product Placements) and as
meticulously structured as a novel by Agatha Christie (whose ``Ten
Little Indians'' plot it brilliantly mimics). And though its
characters may be genuine to their family and friends, to the
average viewer they are as real as Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   The who-won hype surrounding Wednesday night's two-hour finale
(padded with flashbacks), obscures the reason the show has touched
a chord during its 13-week run on CBS. The fact that Richard Hatch
survived to win a million dollars is less revealing than how he
maneuvered into that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you stay true to yourself and maintain integrity and
still play this game?'' asked Kelly Wiglesworth, who lost out to
Hatch, in an aside to the camera in the final weeks. She answered
her own question: ``You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's television phenomenon, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' is the feel-good game show that says we're a happy
country pulling together. This summer ``Survivor'' sends a
countermessage: Trust no one. The people on the island endured by
voting together but in the end were forced to turn against one
another. The island was a microcosm of dog-eat-dog reality, staged
at a safe distance. Just as murder mysteries transform our fear of
death into a playful entertainment, ``Survivor'' turns the
competitive nightmare of contemporary life (in business, in love,
in friendship) into a benign television game.
</P>
<P>
   That visceral pull wouldn't have materialized if the show didn't
work as pure entertainment. Even the best orchestrated hype (which
CBS had) isn't enough to account for the endless chattering among
viewers. ``Survivor'' drew a gigantic audience with a combination
of sports challenges and the suspense of who gets kicked off the
island: Agatha Christie goes to the Olympics. (The island itself
was as realistic and as hokey as a haunted house.)
</P>
<P>
   And each episode was edited into a swift hour. ``Survivor''
never spent more than a few seconds watching someone eat rice.
``Elapsed time: 4 hours 11 minutes'' flashed on the screen after
the minutes spent in Wednesday night's contest about who could
stand the longest with a hand on a totem pole. Take away ruthless
editing, and you end up watching people feed the chickens, as they
have on CBS's tiresome ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   That totem pole contest, an ``immunity challenge,'' was part of
this game's most wickedly unpredictable feature. In each episode
one person won a contest and could not be voted out in that round;
so-called immunity was the wild card that made every rational
prediction moot. Kelly would have been gone weeks ago, but she won
four immunity challenges in a row to become one of the final two
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But only part of the series' constantly growing ratings came
from the suspense. The show got progressively more gripping as it
became progressively more psychological. What started out as a
sporting challenge (build a hut, eat a rat) turned into a
tantalizing mind game.
</P>
<P>
   The truest voyeurism, after all, is looking into someone else's
thoughts, and that is what truly drove ``Survivor.'' The most
compelling moments were those in which the contestants spoke
directly to the camera, confidentially to us, letting us into the
secrets of their sometimes backbiting strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode Colleen sits in a tree, looks sweetly into the
camera and says she'll vote Richard off the island because he's too
bossy. (What an innocent.) In a later episode Richard, the supposed
villain, looks into the camera and says coolly, ominously of
Gretchen, ``She has to go because she is bright and is strong, and
she is a threat.'' Gretchen is gone that night. The message about
who wins in life is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers selected these contestants shrewdly, to
cover the social spectrum, from Sean, a neurologist, to Susan, a
truck driver so tough her husband boasted in an interview, ``She's
a man in a woman's body.'' It was a dazzling stroke to bring the
contestants videos from home a few weeks ago. Viewers saw Gervase's
little daughter toddling toward the camera and watched Jenna, the
mother of small twin girls, cry when she heard her video had not
arrived. Those humanizing moments were the equivalent of
up-close-and-personal profiles of sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   We do not actually know these people any better than we know the
latest celebrity interviewed on ``Entertainment Tonight,'' of
course. The irony is that the success of ``Survivor'' has made
these real people less real to us, as they have taken on the
flattened images of celebrities. (And their post-``Survivor''
show-business plans are just starting.) Richard has already
achieved a measure of fame. Say ``the naked fat guy,'' and everyone
knows who you mean. And admit it: you secretly like him. That may
be the biggest, most revealing ``Survivor'' secret of all.

LT. GEN. DAVID W. TRAUB, 97; COORDINATED LOGISTICS FOR D-DAY
</HEADLINE>
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. David William Traub, a pivotal Army logistics officer
for D-Day and in the Korean War, who later oversaw the rapid
expansion of the State University of New York system, died on Aug.
16 at a hospital in Lawrence, Mass. A former resident of
Loudonville, N.Y., an suburb of Albany, he had recently moved to
Andover, Mass., to be with family. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Traub was commissioned into the field artillery in 1928 and
retired from the Army 34 years later with three-star rank. He lived
to be one of the oldest graduates of the U.S. Military Academy,
where he had returned in 1932, four years after graduation, to
teach economics and government history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, with U.S. participation in World War II well under way,
the Army named him assistant chief of transportation for planning.
As a colonel based in London, he played a central role before,
during and after the Normandy invasion, planning the movement of
troops, tanks and supplies for the liberation of Europe. He and his
staff charted the port, ship, rail and motor operations that made
it possible for the generals to deploy their forces.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he taught logistics for three years at the
Command and General Staff College, then put theory into practice
again by directing transportation and logistics in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted to brigadier general in 1954 and to major general in
1957, he spent much of the mid-50s as an assistant chief of staff
dealing largely with economic aid for South Korea and the civil
administration of Okinawa, where the United States had maintained
control after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 he was named director of the Army budget in the Army
comptroller's office. He was promoted to lieutenant general in
1960, when he became comptroller of the Army, the post from which
he retired in 1962. As comptroller, he had a hand in a
command-structure overhaul ordered by President John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of Traub's retirement, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller
of New York persuaded him to serve as general manager of the newly
created $700 million State University Construction Fund, whose
purpose was to expand the SUNY system. Traub directed the
construction program into the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, David B., of Delmar, N.Y.; a daughter,
Susan A. Russell of Andover, Mass.; and five grandchildren.

 &HT;    Playing on and off the field
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Kevin Emanuel and Chris Woods, Florida
State's young interior linemen, recently found they share more in
common than the pressure of replacing the strength of last season's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel, a 6-foot-4, 258-pound freshman, and Woods, a 6-3,
276-pound sophomore, could team up off the field, too, if football
does not work out. Both are musicians, something they haven't
advertised since arriving at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel is more skilled, having spent eight years playing the
piano and organ at his father's church in Garland, Texas. But when
you play such a violent sport, some find it hard to picture you
making sweet music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids teased me in high school,'' Emanuel said. ``They
would say, 'Man, I can't imagine you playing the piano. Mostly
girls play the piano.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Woods sang in the Orlando Boys Choir, was a master singer in
concert choir at Jones High School and plays the xylophone. But he
has one desire that Emanuel could help him with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never told Kevin but I really want to learn how to play
the piano,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coaches are worried about Emanuel and Woods
learning how to play the defensive line, where Corey Simon and
Jerry Johnson dominated the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Johnson anchored the Seminoles' defense, standing up
blockers enough to allow the starting linebackers to record 302
tackles last season, and breaking through those blockers for 30
combined tackles for loss. Simon was the sixth overall pick in the
draft, Johnson was taken in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have something to prove to the world,'' Woods said. ``Corey
and Jerry are gone and everyone is expecting the defensive line,
the interior, to be the weak link.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a backup last season with 27 tackles, replaced Simon at
nose guard. Emanuel won the tackle position with a strong spring.
He then increased his weight by 11 pounds, his bench press by 25
(to 435) and ran the 1.5 mile drill in 9:55. Both will debut as
starters in Saturday's Pigskin Classic in Jacksonville against
Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Odell Haggins hopes the strength comes in
numbers this season. Haggins says of the line, ``this is the most
depth, quantity-wise, I've had.'' But he added about the talent.
``Quality-wise, if they keep improving, it could be decent.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Emanuel's and Woods' greatest hits could be off the
field. Gloria Emanuel says her son is ``gifted'' when it comes to
music. ``The toys that were intriguing to him was anything musical.
When he first started crawling his goal was to get on the stool
where he could play the piano,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel boosted himself on that stood and naturally started
playing when he was 2. He played in the orchestra in elementary
school and the cello in middle school. At the age of 9, he began
playing the organ and piano at the St. Luke AME Church where his
father, Rev. Lawrence Emanuel, is the pastor.
</P>
<P>
   But after entering high school, Emanuel, not surprisingly,
drifted toward football. Emanuel's cousin, Bert, is a Dolphins wide
receiver. He was the fifth rated defensive line prospect in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of regretted that,'' Gloria said from the Emanuel's
home in Waco, Texas. ``It was a conflict, but he said, 'I think I
can get a scholarship for my athletics.' When you look at the
music, there is quite a correlation to athletics. ... self
discipline, perseverance, creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel, like Woods, has put aside his music to concentrate on
school and athletics. But both would like to retool their musical
skills, either while at school or after they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go back home I help out my dad,'' Emanuel said. ``My
mom brought me up by telling me it's good to be able to do more
than one thing. I'll always be there for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is trying to convince Emanuel to play at his church in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about it when he started going,'' Woods said. ``I
always tell him I'm going to tell the pastor he plays the piano.''

 `SURVIVOR' EXCEEDED EVERY EXPECTATION CBS HAD _ AND THEN SOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With parties being thrown to celebrate it, news organizations
scheduling special coverage and viewers all over the nation waiting
in near breathless anticipation, a summer television series ended
Wednesday night accompanied by the kind of attention usually
reserved for massive national events, on the scale of the Super
Bowl or the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it to learn that one contestant, Richard Hatch, 39, a
corporate trainer from Newport, R.I., had managed to win $1 million
dollars by enduring a made-for-television survival test on a island
off the coast of Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' the CBS hit that built over a 13-week run to what
was expected to be the biggest single television audience ever
assembled for a summer television series, far eclipsed every
expectation the network had when it acquired the rights to the show
last year. Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television and the
man who decided to put the show on the air, said, ``It has beaten
our expectations by about double.''
</P>
<P>
   One indication of how big the show has been: Even before
Wednesday night's hugely anticipated finale, ``Survivor'' had
already surpassed the ratings for other television events this year
like the World Series, the NBA finals, the NCAA men's basketball
finals and the Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike those events, for which networks pay huge fees _ in
the case of sports usually hundreds of millions of dollars a year _
``Survivor'' was acquired for what amounted to a bargain basement
price. CBS executives did not disclose the cost, but when ABC was
in the running to buy the show, it was priced at $700,000 an
episode.
</P>
<P>
   For such a modest sum CBS acquired a show that has generated
national discussions in homes and offices, endless reports on
television news programs (many on CBS but even more on its
competitors), cover articles in national magazines like Time and
Newsweek and front-page reports in dozens of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time ``Survivor'' all but transformed CBS, long
considered the stodgiest network, into, of all things, a haven for
young-adult viewers. CBS, which was able to charge advertisers up
to $600,000 for every commercial in Wednesday's finale, is expected
to capitalize financially even more spectacularly in January, when
a second edition of ``Survivor'' starts immediately following the
Super Bowl, which will also be broadcast by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more significant, ``Survivor'' has demonstrated to
network executives that they can still be in the business of
reaching a truly mass audience. As they have faced increasingly
dire predictions that the coming onslaught of technological
advances in computers and new recording devices would put them out
of the business, network executives have in recent years pointed
more and more toward what they call ``event programming'' as their
island of survival.
</P>
<P>
   None of them even imagined that perhaps the best example of
event programming any of them could find would come from a show
about surviving on an island.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves pointed out that many of network television's
highest-rated shows are now events of a sort. From the departure of
cast members like George Clooney from ``E.R.'' to the season
finales of shows like ``Friends,'' networks have found themselves
more and more compelled to turn weekly shows into events that
viewers believe they cannot miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this event evolved naturally,'' Moonves said. ``That's
made it even more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he believed the show managed to emerge as a national
phenomenon, Mark Burnett, the executive producer of ``Survivor,''
pointed to how well it worked as ``unscripted drama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed it was going to generate strong water cooler
conversation. Nobody could have predicted the ratings success. But
I knew that the premise _ a group of people marooned on an island,
where they had to survive by working together, and they had to work
against each other to win a million-dollar prize _ I knew that
premise was superior.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise had been put together over several years by a
British production company that had never even sold the idea to
television in Britain. Moonves said Burnett, who acquired the U.S.
rights from the British company, produced the show so skillfully
and cast it so well that it came together perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked because it's an adventure, it's a game show, and
it's a great soap opera,'' Moonves said. ``And it may even have hit
home with people because the good guys did not necessarily win.''
</P>
<P>
   The four remaining contestants in last night's finale had
schemed together to eliminate the other contestants. ``The bad guys
are often the most compelling characters,'' Moonves said. ``And
people at home may have seen that and recognized what happens in
their own lives, in corporate society or whatever. They have been
thinking: `That's why I haven't succeeded. The bad guys are to
blame.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the show's success, of course, has been the buildup
of suspense every week about which contestant would be eliminated.
But the suspense was almost entirely manufactured because the event
itself was long over even before the show went on the air in June.
It was taped in March.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite all the avid interest, with journalists asking
questions and viewers bombarding the Internet with rumors, CBS
managed to keep the big secret about who eventually survived the
test until it was revealed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Partly CBS used a bit of scheming of its own to accomplish that
feat. The network deliberately allowed false clues about the winner
to circulate, most of which were exposed as wrong when suggested
winners were eliminated one by one. That left viewers so confused
they were unwilling to believe any supposed revelation of the true
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sometimes active in the game of deception and sometime
passive,'' Burnett said. ``Sometimes the chips fell our way, and
sometimes we made them fall our way''
</P>
<P>
   None of the participants ever broke the honor code. All of them
_ as well as the show's crew members _ had signed contracts
threatening them with financial penalties if they leaked who had
won. But Burnett said he came to an understanding with the cast
members that he would not turn them into the cast of ``The Jerry
Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``We had a meeting before the shooting started, just me
and them, and I said: `We're treating you with respect. I promise
you I won't put anything unnecessary on TV to cause harm to your
regular life.' I've kept my word completely. There are a number of
things which did actually occur or were said, or things revealed,
which were never on TV because it was unnecessary or would have
been sensationalism. By keeping my word I earned them keeping their
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said he had expected the formation of a voting alliance.
``It just seemed to be a very normal group-dynamic reaction. It
happens every day on your job and my job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the role played by Richard Hatch, as leader of the
alliance who spurred his little group to knock off his main
competitors one by one, Burnett said: ``You can't predict that.
There's no way to cast a person knowing he would do that. But
demographically Richard fit because he was on the wealthy side, he
was highly educated, his job was corporate conflict management,
plus he was a gay single parent. All very interesting. Why he
reacted the way he reacted? Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett is already hard at work planning ``Survivor II,'' which
will be set in the Australian outback. He is currently sorting
through more than 49,000 applicants for that cast.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be tainted by the new contestants' knowing how the first
one was won? Burnett doesn't think so. ``I think it may be even
more intriguing because it won't be a strong group playing an
alliance game versus an unwitting group.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that after one edition he was not yet ready to draw
``meaningful conclusions'' about how ``Survivor'' worked as a
social experiment. ``It is a social experiment, no doubt about
it,'' he said. ``But in order to make meaningful conclusions it's
going to take maybe three sessions.''

NYC BACKS OFF PLAN TO BAN ALCOHOL AT FESTIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than two weeks after the administration of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani announced a ban on alcohol sales along parade
routes, city officials have backed off a police proposal to end
such sales at street festivals. Instead, Wednesday they notified
the Feast of San Gennaro, the 11-day festival held in September in
lower Manhattan's Little Italy, that alcohol sales would be
permitted but that the number of vendors would be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   The city had considered a ban on alcohol sales at all outdoor
events after the sexual assaults following the National Puerto
Rican Day Parade on June 11. The ban on such sales at large parades
came on Aug. 7, part of safety rules adopted in response to three
deaths at last year's West Indian American Carnival Parade in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosemarie O'Keefe, the commissioner of the Mayor's Community
Assistance Unit, which issues festival permits, said the city
agreed to the compromise for all street fairs after discussions
with the producers of San Gennaro, a festival now entering its 74th
year, which starts Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cutting the number of alcohol vending permits to
half the number issued last year, O'Keefe said, the new policy
requires festivals to stop selling alcohol one to two hours before
their nightly closing time, limits sales to two drinks per person,
and restricts drink sizes to 12 ounces for beer and 4 ounces for
wine. In the past, there were no restrictions on the number of
permits, or the number and size of drinks. Alcohol booths shut down
at the same time as other vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy came under immediate attack Wednesday, both from
organizers of parades, who complained of a double standard, and
from San Gennaro organizers, who were unhappy with the restrictions
on their permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like one set of rules go for one group, and another
for the others,'' said Jean Alexander, the marketing director for
the West Indian American Carnival Parade. She said the carnival
will lose money because beer and liquor companies have withdrawn
their sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to have alcohol to have a carnival,'' Alexander
said. ``I could dance and play a flute all day long and never take
a drink.'' But she said the policy had larger implications for
tourism and the carnival parade's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Beer and liquor companies have withdrawn their sponsorships, she
said, and social clubs that participate are having difficulty
getting alcohol permits for fund-raisers for the elaborate costumes
that draw two million spectators to Eastern Parkway every year.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the Feast of San Gennaro were no happier with
the policy, saying the cut in permits would mean less revenue that
could be donated to charity at the end of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation the city has provided is that this is a
`quality of life' decision,'' the festival said in a written
statement released Wednesday. ``We see it as dictating a `control
of life' policy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At first, the city told the festival there would be no alcohol
sales, said Arnold N. Kriss, the lawyer for Figlia di San Gennaro,
the nonprofit group that organizes the festival. But after
discussions, the city agreed to allow 33 permits instead of the 65
the festival had last year, when there were no limits on permits.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two additional permits go to restaurants, which are
already licensed to sell alcohol but set up extra booths during the
festival, Kriss said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated the loss to the festival at $100,000, adding that
San Gennaro had donated $800,000 to charities over the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have argued that they are simply correcting an
inconsistency in the law, which forbids drinking on public streets
but has allowed vendors at parades and festivals to sell alcohol.
O'Keefe said no festival or parade organizers had complained
directly to the city about the policy, and one producer of several
festivals said he would not apply for any alcohol permits.
</P>
<P>
   The change in policy had been requested by the Police
Department, O'Keefe said, but community groups' opinions also
affected the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as many people as love these festivals don't like them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kriss criticized the city for issuing the new policy only three
weeks before the feast begins, leaving his client without enough
time to litigate the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got us between a rock and a hard place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he did not understand why the police could not
simply patrol festivals and parades. ``The New York Police
Department does a fine job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman, said it was a
``quality of life issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take care of the problems,'' Biegel said. ``Wouldn't it
be better not to have problems at all? Why have problems from
alcohol, when we can eliminate the alcohol and get rid of the
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have said privately in the past that the new
policy is a response to the sexual assaults that followed this
year's National Puerto Rican Day Parade, in which women were
attacked and in some cases undressed by aggressive crowds of men.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Keefe did not attribute the change to any one problem.
``We've had a few incidents at a few events, and we just needed to
look at what's happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed crowd spillover, public urination, and destruction of
property. ``And I'm not saying it's because of the drunks,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The city was considering further restrictions on outdoor events,
she said, including reducing the number of city blocks used.

 &HT;    A legend in the making
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The phone rang at 11:15 at night a couple of
months ago and aroused Major Applewhite from a deep sleep.
</P>
<P>
   All manner of emergency must have raced through the Texas
quarterback's head as he groggily lifted the receiver. Someone in a
car wreck? Family member suffer a household accident? Mack Brown
wanting to move him to safety?
</P>
<P>
   His mind wasn't any clearer when the caller failed to identify
himself. Finally, the caller spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you a question,'' the voice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead,'' Applewhite said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a 6 route, if the guy covering me is on my inside hip,''
the caller posed, ``what do I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, by now fully awake, shook his head in bewilderment
and then asked Roy Williams an 11th-hour question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy,'' Major said, ``are you about to go run routes?''
</P>
<P>
   Most special wide receivers are born, some are made, and a
precious few are intent upon meshing the two. Which brings us to
the inquisitive Roy Williams, freshman wide receiver, an actual
Longhorn for all of 11 days, and already a legend in the making.
</P>
<P>
   All Williams did Wednesday was catch two passes for 17 yards and
a touchdown. Here's even more important stuff. Both came on
checkoffs at the line of scrimmage, the first on a fade route for a
5-yard touchdown over Ahmad Brooks, who must have suffered from
Texas A&AMP;M deja vu, and the second on a quick screen off a corner
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty good,'' Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
said. ``The thing that shocked us is his maturity and attention to
detail.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a nice two weeks for the gifted rookie out of Odessa
Permian, meaning it should be a nice four years for Texas fans.
He's caught everything but a summer cold. He can go deep, go short,
go over the middle. He's physical enough to push off without being
flagged for pushing off. He's fast enough in his size 16 shoes to
outrun Texas' fastest cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to strap it on against Roy,'' Longhorn safety Greg
Brown said. ``The seven on seven drills during the summer helped
the freshmen. They went against us all summer, so they're not
scared of us.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes his emergence even more satisfying is Williams isn't
alone. The company he's keeping at Longhorn practices has been
head-turning special. Maybe not Roy Williams-special, but good
enough that head coach Mack Brown has said he might not redshirt a
single one of the freshman wideouts and expects 'em all to
contribute early. Say, like Sept. 9 against Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to tight end Bo Scaife only accelerated the
transition process for Williams &AMP; Co., which includes fellow
freshmen B.J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery.
</P>
<P>
   Their progress was on display Wednesday when Texas dropped just
two passes _ one by Johnson, one by fullback Chad Stevens _ and
moved the ball crisply.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to see more short and intermediate pass
routes, more three-step drops by the quarterbacks. It worked
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson caught a pass on a long crossing route against Greg
``Hit Man'' Brown and then made a nifty sideline grab and kept in
bounds. Rookie Thomas made the first catch of the 75-play scrimmage
on a sharp post pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Even a couple of old-timers like redshirt freshman Artie Ellis
and senior Brandon Healy made plays to wow the crowd of 1,500 at
Royal Memorial Stadium, but inconsistent Montrell Flowers still
needs to hit his stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys are very talented,'' said the 225-pound Ellis,
who showed some power moves and ran over freshman safety Phillip
Geiggar at the end of a 20-yard gain. ``We expect a lot out of
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is to say that Texas has not junked its passing game
even though Kwame Cavil took his 100 catches to the Buffalo Bills.
If you're a hardcore Longhorn fan who's sweating things big and
small, put wide receiver way down your list.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the fact that Texas ran the ball on the first eight
plays of the scrimmage. The pass-happy Davis confirmed that he was,
indeed, conscious at the time although he added, ``I was shaking a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, no Longhorn will catch 100 passes this fall,
but don't lament. Davis said to look for a whole bunch of guys with
30 to 35 catches apiece, which won't make it easy for defenses.
</P>
<P>
   That said, we should also point out that Williams probably will
not be an All-American this season. Probably.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts State Ethics Commission found
Wednesday that Lt. Gov. Jane Swift, who won her office in 1998 less
than three weeks after bearing her first child, violated ethics
rules by having two aides baby-sit away from the State House.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel cleared Swift on several other ethics charges
including improperly using a state helicopter to fly home to her
sick baby and using aides to help her move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made some mistakes and I'm very sorry for those mistakes,
and I have a lot of work ahead of me if, as I hope, I am to regain
the trust of the public,'' Swift said Wednesday night on WBZ radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned from these mistakes,'' she said. ``One of the
things I've learned is that I have difficulty publicly admitting
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would not appeal. The commission has the power to
fine or reprimand her.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's finding &UR;  &LR;  capped months of drubbing that Swift,
a Republican, has been taking here in Democrat-dominated political
circles, in the news and in coffee-counter talk. Her decision to
run for office while pregnant in 1998 made her a heroine to some
working women, a model of how women could do it all. But her
questionable use of the perks of office to help balance motherhood
with work _ and her defensive attitude when challenged _ prompted
anger from many supporters and scorn from opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldman, a Democratic political consultant, even printed
up buttons reading, ``Jane `not so' Swift: It Takes an Entire State
Government to Raise a Child.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Swift have been further energized by widespread
talk that the governor, Paul Cellucci, a Republican, might take a
federal job if the next president is a Republican, in which case
Swift would become governor.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be even more at work in Swift's case, said
Elizabeth A. Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics
and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, we have to say that she is new to this high
level, she made some mistakes and, unfortunately, she suffered a
tremendous amount of vilification in the press and the court of
public opinion for it,'' Sherman said. ``That said, I also feel
that it's just been an extraordinary backlash against her.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift's troubles began in January when local newspapers reported
that she had relied on aides for personal services including caring
for her toddler daughter both in the State House and at home,
helping her move and picking up dry cleaning. They also disclosed
that she had used a state helicopter to avoid Thanksgiving traffic
and fly home to her sick daughter in western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   State ethics rules bar officials from asking employees to attend
to their personal chores, because the workers could feel pressure
to obey. At first, in what many see as her biggest mistake, Swift
defended her actions, saying that she shared many of the dilemmas
of everyday working parents but that her schedule was unusually
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   When she was queried about aides' complaints that they felt
pressured into baby-sitting Elizabeth, she replied, ``I would be
stunned if there was anyone who was feeling pressure to spend time
with her and care for her.'' In fact, she said, staff members were
happy to spend time with the baby: ``She is adorable and engaging
and she's learned to blow kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks alienated many working parents and some pointed out
that Swift has a stay-at-home husband, a flexible job and a
supportive superior in Cellucci _ and yet she still needed to call
on aides to help ``hold it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift, 35, soon apologized, and apologized again, saying she was
still learning about being a mother and a lieutenant governor. She
asked for the ethics commission to examine her actions to see if
they violated state ethics rules. On Monday, and again Wednesday
night, Swift said she was sorry that questions about her ethics had
drawn attention away from her administration's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But her apologies did not stop a precipitous slide in her
popularity: She and Cellucci were elected with 51 percent of the
vote; a poll by The Boston Globe in February found that only 20
percent of respondents viewed Swift favorably, while 36 percent saw
her unfavorably.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the bigger picture, said Sherman of the University of
Massachusetts, Swift's story will serve as a case study of how
women in politics are perceived, and may also have a ``chilling
effect'' on young women who consider entering politics, by showing
them the microscopic examination their behavior, including their
mothering, might endure.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the worst part of the baby scandal may be that it
became a missed opportunity _ Swift could have used it to ask what
resources are needed to help parents mix work and child rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a question that needed to be asked and answered, and
it's just hanging out there,'' Sherman said. She said Swift ``had
the opportunity to move that discussion forward, and she didn't,
because she felt embattled, besieged, defensive.''

 KEVIN McAULIFFE, 50, PRESS AIDE TO 3 NYC MAYORS  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin McAuliffe, a speechwriter for three New York
City mayors and the editor of a collection of comments by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani published this year, died Aug. 20 . He was 50 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe worked as a speechwriter and press aide for Mayors
Edward Koch and David Dinkins. He also worked for a few months for
Giuliani before being dismissed in 1994 as a holdover from
Democratic administrations.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe compiled ``Sayings of Generalissimo Giuliani,''
quotations on subjects including crime and sending garbage to
Virginia, assembled for comic effect.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, McAuliffe ran a communications consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, born in the Bronx, graduated from Fairfield
University in Connecticut and received a master's degree in
journalism from Columbia University. He began his career as a
journalist in New England. He also wrote ``The Great American
Newspaper: The Rise and Fall of the Village Voice'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is survived by his wife, Paulette Theresa, whom he
married in April; his mother, Ethel; a sister, Alice Callahan; two
brothers, Daniel and Paul; and two nieces.

THE QUESTION FOR `THAT FOOTBALL GUY:' CAN YOU BE THAT GUY OF '97? 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When Jason Sehorn is out with his
fiancee, the television actress Angie Harmon, he knows what to
expect when fans recognize the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll run to her and start talking about `Law and Order,'''
Sehorn said this week, referring to the weekly NBC drama in which
Harmon stars. ``And eventually, they'll kind of look over at me and
say: `Oh, and there's that football guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn smiled as he told the story, understanding that there is
almost something droll or paradoxical about such an anecdote, and
not because his wife-to-be's celebrity exceeds his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to take second fiddle to someone, I'm going to
take second fiddle to my wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn met Harmon because his own mother, Nancy, was star-struck
when she came upon Harmon standing outside Giants Stadium after the
Giants' opening game last season. She approached Harmon, her son
the cornerback in tow. Sehorn and Harmon began dating a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to compete with my spouse,'' said Sehorn, who
plans to marry Harmon next June. ``That's not the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   No, there's a more pertinent twist: if only Sehorn could get
more people to think of him as ``that football guy.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the omnipresent Sehorn, who is easily the Giants' most
popular player, has become best known for everything but being a
football player _ particularly since he sat out most of the last
two seasons with three serious leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Telegenic, well-spoken and accessible, Sehorn has been a
broadcaster, endorsed a host of prominent products and charities,
performed cameos on television shows, posed for fashion magazines,
and proposed to Harmon on ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   That football guy, meanwhile, has played 10 games in the last 32
months.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for his first season-opening game in three years,
against Arizona on Sept. 3, Sehorn, who is 29 and in his seventh
NFL season, is approaching a crossroads, and knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a lot of questions about me,'' Sehorn said. ``I
want to help answer them. The facts are that my personal life,
which was unsettled for quite a while, now makes me happier than
I've ever been. I've been here working out with the team all
winter, all spring and all summer. I can run as fast and jump as
high as I used to. There are tests to measure that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fooling myself and saying I'm the same player I was,
because I'm not. I don't have that swagger I used to have. I used
to walk out and say, `You're not catching a pass today.' But
everybody always wants to know if I'm going to be the same. I tell
them, `I hope so.' But what I want to say is, `In time, I will be
the same.' Because I feel it coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Spend time with Sehorn and it becomes obvious how regularly,
hour by hour, day by day, he is confronted by his football past. At
the Giants' training camp in Albany earlier this month, Sehorn
would spend 30 minutes to an hour daily signing autographs for fans
_ many of them wearing his No. 31 jersey _ and every minute or so
he would be asked: Are you going to get back to the way you were?
</P>
<P>
   When he was done with the fans, reporters would ask a similar
question: Can you again be the player you were in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   That year finished a two-season sequence in which Sehorn had 4{
sacks and 11 interceptions, elevating him to the ranks of elite
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the shade outside the Giants' locker room after a
recent practice Sehorn was reminded of his acrobatic interception
and 36-yard return in the Giants' last game of the 1997 season, the
heart-breaking playoff loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The play is still shown often as a highlight on football
broadcasts, a series of graceful yet athletic moves, ballet-like
with a football gridiron for a stage, and it serves as an ensemble
of the gifts Sehorn once displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Turning in midair to intercept the ball, Sehorn landed on one
foot, then reached down to brace himself with one hand, all while
eluding the intended receiver, Cris Carter, to avoid a pass
interference penalty. Sehorn then gathered the ball in and
instantly reversed direction to weave up the field through seven
Vikings before he was finally tackled.
</P>
<P>
   With that play in mind, Sehorn was asked again: Will Giants fans
ever see that Sehorn again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could still do it physically,'' he answered. ``But will I be
in position to leap up and grab it? That's the question. When I did
that, I was coming off four straight NFL seasons with four straight
training camps and hundreds of practices under my belt. I knew
instinctively, without thinking about it, how to put myself in
position to make that play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference. I can still do it. But have I played
enough football, practiced enough football, to be in the right
position? It's getting there. I had something like 28 practices all
of last season. I've gone way past 28 practices already this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea that he has been distracted by his off-the-field
interests and activities, Sehorn called the notion weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the speculation about that?'' he asked. ``Where's the
concern? Are you concerned or are you just bored and want to
criticize someone? It's not like I missed one game or one practice
or one rehab session. I didn't ask for time off, I had
reconstructive knee surgery and a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't play football and I took advantage of every
opportunity. Football is an ability I have that is fleeting. I have
other goals for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this spring, when the Giants convened for a three-day
minicamp, Sehorn occasionally looked indifferent, or heedless in
his coverage of Giants wide receivers. John Fox, the defensive
coordinator, took him aside and reminded Sehorn that practice
mattered, that the team's star cornerback could not set an example
with less than his best at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn agreed and has had a far more impressive preseason,
though he did give up a touchdown pass in a game with the Jets last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another mental lapse,'' Sehorn said of the touchdown.
``Exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about _ I needed to be in
better position to make the right play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he believes Sehorn will make it all the way back to his
1997 form. ``I was just starting to see that when he broke his leg
last December,'' Fox said. ``I was just starting to tell people,
`Jason is back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn broke his leg during a game against the Jets last
December, ending his season. Sixteen months earlier in a preseason
game against the Jets, he tore two knee ligaments returning a
game-opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn's absence has done little to stem his popularity with
Giants fans. At the concession stands at Giants training camp,
there were five uniform numbers for sale, but only one, No. 31,
available in three colors: white, blue and red. The combination of
Sehorn jerseys outsold all others by more than 2-1. Sehorn shrugged
when asked about why he is such a fan favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I just spent 35 or 40 minutes signing autographs and
talking to people,'' he said. ``I talk to people all the time. I'm
in no rush to get to the locker room. Why? There are 30 kids out
there with my jersey on. I can't walk past them. I do the same
thing on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bad guy. I stay clear of the law. I stay clear of
bad things. Do I smile a lot? Yeah, I do. My mom taught me that
being a good person is more important than a career. I remember
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He concedes he is comfortable in the spotlight, and with Harmon
by his side, getting more and more exposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a privileged life,'' Sehorn said. ``But what am I
apologizing for? I am spending time with the person I am most
comfortable with and enjoy more than anyone else. But people should
know that they can count on me when it comes time to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a football player isn't who I am, but it's what I do.
And in practice all week, in meetings and especially on Sunday,
that's all I do.'' &QL;

LPGA NEEDS CHAMPIONSHIP SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All season long the LPGA tour seemed caught in the
shadow of the PGA Tour in general and Tiger Woods in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Woods kept his date with history while the ladies just had
problems with dates.
</P>
<P>
   The situation turned critical this week when LPGA officials
announced that their season-ending tournament, the Arch
Championship, a.k.a. the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour
Championship, formerly known as the PageNet Championship, needs a
new home.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was called the PageNet Championship until Monday,
when Arch Communications, a nation-wide telecommunications company,
slapped its name on the event.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Arch is swallowing up PageNet in a merger
scheduled to close during the fourth quarter so it made sense.
</P>
<P>
   The company seems golf friendly and sponsors players on both the
LPGA and PGA tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the acquirer of PageNet (which) will continue to operate
under the Arch name, it makes sense to continue the sponsorship
under (our) name,'' said Robert W. Lougee Jr., the company's vice
president of investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   While the sponsorship problems is solved, the event has vagabond
status, which is not a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a prestigious event, this is late in the game to be
changing things,'' said a source familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1996 and played at Desert Inn Resort on the Las Vegas
Strip, the tour's championship also provided some season-ending
drama, typically deciding the tour's top awards.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials knew in June that the venerable resort would
close but were under the impression the course would remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the hotel staff bolted for other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So now the tour is rolling the dice in search of another venue.
</P>
<P>
   Other courses in Vegas and some in Florida are in play.
</P>
<P>
   This is the final year of the PageNet-Arch sponsorship deal and
no one on Wednesday could say whether it will be extended.
</P>
<P>
   So the season's final event will probably be called something
like the Arch LPGA Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a course to play it on is also important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern of everybody involved is making sure the
championship that ends our season stays a world-class event,'' said
Leslie King, the tour's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stearns, International Management Group's tournament
director, and LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw are conducting the search.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns likes Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to keep the Arch championship in Las Vegas,'' he
said. ``The Desert Inn Resort and the city ... have provided us
with a great venue to showcase this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Vegas does have lots of golf courses now, including hotel mogul
Steve Wynn's tony and exclusive Shadow Mountain and a new Jack
Nicklaus course, Reflection Bay at Lake Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   A decision should be reached soon, especially since ABC and ESPN
will provide television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this date problem has been an ongoing thing this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring the Players Championship conflicted with the
LPGA's first major, the Nabisco Championship. The men grabbed most
of the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In July, while Woods was having a jolly good time carving up the
Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, winning the British Open, the
U.S. Women's Open was taking place at the Merit Club in
Libertyville, Ill. (A quick quiz. Can you name the winner? See
below.)
</P>
<P>
   Again, Woods was front-page news while the women's tournament,
for the most part, gave up coverage to baseball and football
training camps.
</P>
<P>
   While the British Open got saturation, albeit earlier, TV
coverage, watching two major championships was probably too much
for all but the most serious of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now golf's major business is finished for the year and the LPGA
still struggles with a date problem.
</P>
<P>
   Also high on the policy makers' agenda is deciding which of the
tour's other tournaments is worthy of being called a major.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth major, the du Maurier Classic, experienced its swan
song this year because Canada's tough new anti-tobacco legislation
prevents the title sponsor from participating in the event.
</P>
<P>
   So Votaw and his policy makers have some scrambling to do.
</P>
<P>
   Find another sponsor in Canada or just elevate the status of
another tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's been done before. The du Maurier got the nod in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, they can't make a hasty decision or else they could
be looking for a new major every couple of years since sponsors on
the LPGA tour can sometimes be fickle.
</P>
<P>
   King says lots of tournaments want the title, like the Wegman's
Rochester International and the JAL Big Apple Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The most natural seems to be the Weetabix British Open.
</P>
<P>
   All seem fitting candidates, three of the LPGA majors are named
after corporate sponsors, the exception being the U.S. Women's
Open.
</P>
<P>
   A decision will be made by the end of September and one
possibility is playing just three majors next year, not a good idea
from an historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   So this date problem is not going to go away anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not the kind of spotlight the tour sought, or
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure the decision we make is the right one,
both from the standpoint of longevity and tradition,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of moola: Last summer it was the ``Shootout at Sherwood.''
This time around its billed as ``The Battle of Bighorn,'' or Woods'
personal cash cow. The made-for-television event showcases Tiger
Woods and the challenger of the moment, who this year is Sergio
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a $1.5 million match-play event televised Monday night by
ABC. The winner gets $1.1 million.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: WINSLOW USES TALENTS TO FIGHT HEART DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., N.Y.)   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kellen Winslow is acutely aware of what is happening
in his neighborhood, his town, his country and beyond. He is a Hall
of Fame tight end from the San Diego Chargers who can talk about
world events as deftly as he can about current NFL tight ends who
are fearless across the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow was in Manhattan on Wednesday to lend his name to a new
cause that he knows affects his world and yours.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 5, fans may vote on NFL.com for the player whose
performance from the previous week was the most gritty, the player
who exhibited the most heart. Each Thursday during the season, the
league will count the votes and award the All-Heart Player of the
Week award, part of an effort by the NFL to educate people about
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a member of a high-risk group because I have had
hypertension in my family,'' Winslow said. ``This is something
people should know about and monitor. You can't address a problem
unless you know you have a problem. And especially in the
African-American community, I'm concerned about the tendency to go
for these kind of tests only after you get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslow, 42, who lives in San Diego, is the perfect spokesman
for such a program.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in East St. Louis, Ill., played football at the
University of Missouri and earned a degree in counseling psychology
there, played with the Chargers from 1979 through 1987 and then
earned a law degree from the University of San Diego. He was
inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995. He is
currently commissioner of the 21-team Indoor Football League and is
a college football analyst for Fox Net Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one game, one singular achievement that will always
be Winslow's signature: a 41-38 overtime playoff victory for the
Chargers against Miami in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 2, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Winslow caught 13 passes, a playoff record, for
166 yards, scored on a 25-yard reception and blocked a field goal
attempt. He was seemingly everywhere that night and played in a
soiled uniform, in a jersey that became untucked, and kept playing
despite several stitches in his bloody lip and despite losing 12
pounds of water weight.
</P>
<P>
   When coaches talk about playing football with passion, about
leaving everything on the field, they are talking about Winslow in
the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear about that game every day of my life, every time I
leave my house or even when I stay home _ somebody calls and wants
to talk about it on the phone,'' Winslow said. ``People have sent
me letters saying they named their kid after me, boys and girls,
because they want them to produce that kind of effort in their
lives. A man told me his wife was having a baby during the game and
would not leave for the hospital until he agreed to have a
miniature TV in the car. The funny thing is, I had played better in
other games. But I guess in that game I was pushed to the
mountaintop and passed that test. I could truly say that game I
gave my all.''
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't Winslow running an NFL franchise? He said that after
he gained his law degree he asked the Chargers for a chance in
their front office but was told there was no room for him. He is
bitter about that. ``I think it's something I could be good at,''
Winslow said. But Winslow had too much heart to let bitterness ruin
him. He moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The league will post five players each week as candidates for
the All-Heart award, sponsored by the NFL and Merck, the
pharmaceutical company, to make the public aware of the effect of
cholesterol in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow said he would watch closely, because the nominees and
winners ``should not necessarily be the guy who catches 10 passes
and two for touchdowns.'' Winslow's early favorites for the first
winner?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go with Junior Seau of the Chargers _ every play, every
game, he gives 100 percent,'' Winslow said. ``Jevon Kearse of
Tennessee, he has a nonstop motor and the motor is the heart.
Edgerrin James of the Colts runs, blocks and catches. Peyton
Manning of the Colts leads with discipline and character. Hey, and
I'd pick a coach like Dan Reeves, who has fought back from heart
disease in a manner few have.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslow said to keep an eye this season on four tight ends: Tony
Gonzalez of Kansas City, Bubba Franks of Green Bay, Rickey Dudley
of Oakland and Shannon Sharpe of Baltimore. He will do that, and
also looks at Washington, Tennessee and Tampa Bay as three teams he
believes are ahead in the Super Bowl race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This All-Heart Award will be about effort, performance and
desire,'' Winslow said. ``You know, respect is not about money,
fame or intimidation. It is something you earn.''
</P>
<P>
   As Winslow did. &QL;

OLE C. RISOM, 80, PUBLISHER OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ole C. Risom, one of the most influential publishers of
mass-market books for children, died on Saturday, Aug. 19, in
Manhasset, N.Y. He was 80 and lived in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his son Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   Risom was vice president and art director of Golden Books
Western Press from 1952 to 1972 and then vice president and
associate publisher of the juvenile division of Random House from
1972 to 1990. He remained a consultant after he retired.
</P>
<P>
   He specialized in publishing for preschool children, including
alphabet, counting and Mother Goose books that incorporated the
work of talented artists but were inexpensively produced.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Shulman, vice president and editor at large at Random
House children's books, compared his standards and vision to that
of Ikea in the furniture world.
</P>
<P>
   In his years at Golden Books he worked on many new formats,
including book adaptations of Disney films like ``The Jungle Book''
and ``Cinderella.'' He gave numerous young artists, including Joan
Walsh Anglund, their first book commissions. At Random House he
developed formats including Picturebacks, the first original trade
paperback line; Chunky Books; and Bathtime Books.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he was closely associated with Richard Scarry,
the author and illustrator whose books have sold more than 100
million copies. They worked together on dozens of books, including
``I Am a Bunny,'' which Risom wrote and Scarry illustrated. First
published in 1963, it is still in print. Risom and Walter Retan
wrote an illustrated biography, ``The Busy, Busy World of Richard
Scarry.''
</P>
<P>
   Risom also worked with Dr. Seuss, Jim Henson and Sesame Street
books, Stan and Jan Berenstain, Leo Lionni, Laurent de Brunhoff,
Charles M. Schulz and Marc Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Risom was born in Copenhagen and went to Stockholm to work
for Bonniers, the Swedish publisher, to learn the publishing
business. In 1940 he decided to try to go to the United States,
where his older brother, Jens, was beginning his career as a
furniture designer. He had permission to travel through occupied
Denmark, where he saw his parents, and then went on to Lisbon to
board a freighter. After being detained by the British in Trinidad
for several weeks he finally reached New York.
</P>
<P>
   After Pearl Harbor, Risom joined the U.S. Army and served in the
ski patrol, among other units. When the war ended, he was assigned
to the Arts and Monuments section in Munich as a driver. There he
met Countess Agnes Grafin von Rechberg, a translator for the
section. He stayed on after he was discharged, married her in 1947,
and they moved to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Nicholas, he is survived by his wife;
another son, Christopher; a daughter, Camilla R. Pile; two
brothers, Jens and Niels; and six grandchildren.

ROBERT J. NORTHSHIELD, 78, TV NEWS INNOVATOR, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill.)  By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert J. Northshield, an innovator in television news who
established one of its most enduring programs, died Monday night in
a New York area nursing home. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He had been ill for some time, his former colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Northshield, who was known to colleagues and friends as Shad,
had been a news producer at all three of the major broadcast
networks. But he spent the bulk of his career at CBS and NBC. At
NBC, he produced ``Today'' and ``The Huntley-Brinkley Report'' and
the network's special coverage of the presidential elections and
space launchings, including the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo
missions.
</P>
<P>
   But Northshield made his name in the television news business at
CBS by creating ``CBS News Sunday Morning,'' the 90-minute
newsmagazine program, in 1979. Charles Kuralt was the host of the
program, which covered not only general news but also a blend of
culture and nature. The program's trademark continues to be its
prolonged, closing shots of nature that run for up to two minutes
with no sound other than those of the outdoor scenes themselves.
The program, which is still shown nationwide, has been widely
praised for its subtle style and broad appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Northfield won the Alfred I. du Pont-Columbia
University Award for ``being second to none in style, intelligence,
imagination and humanity,'' according to his CBS biography.
Northshield also won the Emmy and George Foster Peabody awards.
</P>
<P>
   Northshield was born in Oak Park, Ill., and was raised in nearby
Chicago. After serving as an Army lieutenant in World War II _ in
which he won a Purple Heart for being wounded in the foot in combat
in Europe _ he began his career as a journalist, writing for papers
in Chicago, including The Sun-Times, where he was a reporter, photo
editor and columnist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he joined CBS News in New York as an associate producer
of public affairs and news programs. In 1958, after a short time at
ABC News, he moved to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Northshield returned to CBS in 1977, taking a job as an
executive producer in its sports division, though he was later
named executive producer of ``CBS Morning News.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1979, he extended that franchise into the Sunday
morning schedule, which, other than the networks' own political
talk shows, was mostly filled with religious and cultural
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Northshield recruited Kuralt, whose ``On the Road'' segments
were a popular feature on the ``Evening News,'' as host of the new
program. Their partnership was said to have been as productive as
it was combustible.
</P>
<P>
   The program's heavy emphasis on nature and the environment
reflected Northshield's passion for wildlife, friends said. He was
a published ornithologist and an avid bird photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great nature lover and a great bird fancier,'' said
Philip Scheffler, senior producer and executive editor for ``60
Minutes.'' ``He used to go all over the world taking photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Northshield produced ``Sunday Morning'' until 1987, when he went
to work in program development and special events coverage for CBS
News. He left the network in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Northshield is survived by his wife, Jane, and four sons:
Joseph, Samuel, John and Hoang Van Ngoan, whom Northshield adopted
while covering the Vietnam War. &QL;

<P>
   Helen Culver Ewing Breasted, who worked at Hull House in Chicago
with Jane Addams, its founder and a family friend, died Sunday,
Aug. 20, at her home in Tamworth, N.H. She was 90 and also had a
home in Sewickley, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Breasted, a native of Chicago, attended Vassar College. As a
volunteer at Hull House in the 1930s, she helped settle newly
arrived immigrants. Hull House, founded in 1889, was one of the
first settlement houses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935 she married James Henry Breasted Jr., an art historian
who later became chairman of the art and art history department at
the Kent School in Kent, Conn. He died in 1983.

<P>
   Breasted is survived by two sons, James, of Carbondale, Colo.,
and John, of Great Barrington, Mass.; three daughters, Barbara
Whitesides of Newton, Mass., Mary Breasted Smyth of Sewickley, and

 &HT;    Indictment delivered, winner declared
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It came down to the snake vs. the rat, in island
lingo, and the snake ate the rat.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hatch, the scheming corporate consultant who had become
the J.R. Ewing of ``Survivor,'' won the $1 million in a 4-3 vote in
Wednesday's two-hour finale of the pop culture phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote, Susan Hawk, the Wisconsin truck driver
with a tongue like a bullwhip who had made it to the Final Four,
delivered a ripping indictment of the two finalists, Hatch and
river guide Kelly Wiglesworth, both of whom had been her friends
earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This island is full of two things: snakes and rats,'' she
said.`` We have Richard the snake and Kelly, who turned into the
rat. I think we owe it to the island's spirits to let it be the way
Mother Nature intended it to be, to let the snake eat the rat.''
</P>
<P>
   After 13 weeks of ``Survivor,'' Hawk's tirade will be remembered
as the show's big moment.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen observers had expected the finale to be watched by 35
million to 40 million viewers, which would more than cap
``Survivor's'' record run as the most-watched summer TV series in
history. CBS sold 30-second commercials for $600,000, more than
``ER'' or ``Friends'' gets during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen castaways were set ashore on the island of Pulau Tiga,
and voted each other into exile one by one over 13 weeks, turning
the South Seas spot of land into Cutthroat Island rather than Pulau
Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday's finale, it had come down to the Final Four. They
were the original four members of what was called the Tagi Alliance
(for the name of their tribe), which threatened to crumble but
never did, as it picked off the former competing Pagongs one by
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're finished with the Alliance,'' Boesch said early in
the show. ``You're on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's first Immunity Challenge was called ``Fallen
Comrades,'' with host Jeff Probst asking the four trivia questions
about the players who had been voted out, such as ``What state is
Gervase from?'' and ``Who received only one vote at the first
Tribal Council?''
</P>
<P>
   Wiglesworth and Hawk tied at the end of 10 questions, but Kelly
won the tie-breaker and earned her fourth consecutive Immunity
necklace. Once again, the scheming of the other three, who had
agreed to vote out Wiglesworth, was foiled.
</P>
<P>
   The first vote was tied, two each for Hawk and Hatch. A
tie-breaker was held, with Hawk and Hatch not allowed to vote. Hawk
got both votes and smiled as her torch was extinguished. ``See you
guys later,'' she said to the three who remained, knowing something
that none of the others ejected could be sure about: exactly who
voted her off.
</P>
<P>
   The final immunity challenge was ``Hands On the Immunity Idol,''
as the trio, smeared with mud and starting at dawn, had to stand on
stumps and keep one hand on the carved totem for as long as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch took a calculated gamble and pulled his hand away after
only a couple of hours, losing the challenge deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is about a lot of things, and one of them is mental
strategy,'' Hatch explained. ``It doesn't mean I'm giving up $1
million necessarily. Whoever is immune has to pick. ...For the
first time, it's out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   After four hours, Boesch accidentally removed his hand from the
idol while changing positions. Wiglesworth had won her fifth
straight challenge. ``That was a dumb move on my part,'' Boesch
said. ``I gave away a million bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Boesch and Hatch would just cancel each other out, only
Wiglesworth voted. ``Tonight you are the queen of the island,''
Probst told her.
</P>
<P>
   The queen cast her vote against Boesch.
</P>
<P>
   As the two awaited the final decision, they stayed in character.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some moral low points for me playing this game.
I've had some not-so-proud moments,'' said Wiglesworth, who was
always the most ambivalent member of the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, meanwhile, said he would be proud to get the $100,000
runner-up money. ``But I want the million. I really want the
million!''
</P>
<P>
   The jury of the last seven voted off consisted of: Hawk, Boesch,
Colleen Haskell, Gervase Peterson, Sean Kenaf, Jenna Lewis and Greg
Buis. The final vote: 4 for Hatch, 3 for Wiglesworth.
</P>
<P>
   Product placement has been prominent during the show's run:
Target, Pizza Hut, the U.S. Army and Bud Light all made it to the
island. On Wednesday, after months of touting just the $1 million
grand prize, suddenly it became $1 million plus a new Pontiac Aztek
SUV. ``See the Survivor winner drive one home tonight,'' a
promotional announcement said _ a pretty neat trick from an island,
which was never pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost some weight, lost some muscle, lost some sanity,''
Wiglesworth said during Wednesday's finale, and millions of viewers
could relate to the loss of sanity, as ``Survivor'' spawned a fan
obsessiveness that permeated the Internet, the media and private
conversations all summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some summers are marked by a particular movie, beach book or pop
song on the radio that dominates the culture. This was the summer
of ``Survivor.''

DEVELOPERS SHOW LITTLE INTEREST IN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPLEX
</HEADLINE>
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City officials are finding that the road to
building a trading complex for the New York Stock Exchange can be
long and bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   In response to solicitations by the Giuliani administration,
only two developers told the city on Friday that they were
interested in building the proposed $727 million,
1.9-million-square-foot trading complex and office tower on a block
bounded by Wall, Broad and William Streets and Exchange Place.
</P>
<P>
   Two other developers approached by the city's Economic
Development Corp. decided that the project was too complicated and
risky, according to real estate executives.
</P>
<P>
   And 20 months after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced plans for
the heavily subsidized project in the financial district, the New
York Stock Exchange has still not signed an agreement with the
Giuliani administration, although city officials say a deal is
imminent, as they have been saying for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting close,'' said Michael Carey, president
of the Economic Development Corp. ``I continue to be optimistic
that the project will go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey said he was close to concluding a deal to buy the site
from the property owners, J.P. Morgan and the Rockrose Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The state would condemn one other parcel on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman Speyer Properties and Brookfield Financial Properties
both indicated interest in the project, but the Rudin real estate
family and Boston Properties took a pass.
</P>
<P>
   The city has told the applicants that it wanted to select a
developer by Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the American International Group, one of the
world's largest insurance companies, has expressed interest in
occupying a part of the office tower over the trading complex, real
estate executives and a city official said. But the company has
made no commitments and says it is unsure yet how much space it
needs.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are hoping that the sale of development rights
for the office tower will more than offset the projected $350
million cost of acquiring the block across the street from the
stock exchange's historic Wall Street home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to get a tenant,'' said one real estate executive
working with AIG. ``But this is not even close to being done. It's
very murky.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed project has been clouded by rapid changes in the
financial industry _ toward electronic trading _ as well as by the
complicated nature of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the stock exchange threatened to move to New
Jersey if the city could not help it expand beyond its cramped,
97-year-old quarters on Wall Street. Many urban planners and real
estate executives doubted that the exchange would relocate,
especially since most of the large investment banks that trade at
the exchange had invested in Manhattan real estate and received tax
breaks in exchange for promising to remain in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said the city could not risk losing the stock
exchange, and in December 1998, city and state officials agreed to
build a trading complex and provide $160 million in tax breaks. The
cost for the trading complex itself has since grown to $482
million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some securities analysts have questioned the
need for expanded trading floors, given the rapid growth of
electronic trading. Electronic networks now account for 37 percent
of the trades on the Nasdaq and about 3 percent of the volume on
the New York Stock Exchange, according to the Tower Group, a
research firm.

DEADLY PIPELINE BLAST WAS NOT COMPANY'S FIRST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By NEIL STRASSMAN 
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ El Paso Natural Gas Co. has experienced two deadly
pipeline accidents since 1970 caused by corrosion, according to a
review of federal records after last weekend's explosion in New
Mexico, which claimed 11 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The records show that the company has had 30 accidents caused by
corrosion since 1970. Two accidents involved fatalities in West
Texas, leaving three dead in one explosion and one in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators discovered corrosion in the pipeline that
exploded early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico, killing members
of three generations of one family.
</P>
<P>
   In some locations, the pipe wall had been reduced to less than
half of its original thickness, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Office of Pipeline Safety ordered the company
yesterday to close its pipelines near the Pecos River, about 30
miles south of Carlsbad, N.M., until the company tests the lines to
make sure they are safe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the previous deaths occurred in 1985 in Glasscock County
in West Texas. Ten years earlier, three employees were killed and
two others injured when a 12-inch gas line ruptured in Ector
County, also in West Texas, according to Office of Pipeline Safety
records that date from 1970, the earliest year such records are
available.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, National Transportation Safety Board investigators
said that they ``visually observed a significant amount of
corrosion'' at the bottom of the pipe in New Mexico, where the
rupture occurred and where it had been exposed by the explosion,
which blasted a crater 85 feet long, 45 feet wide and 25 feet deep
into the desert, 300 feet west of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some internal corrosion on the pipe,'' said John
Somerhalder, president of the El Paso Energy Pipeline Group. The
pipe wall, originally slightly thicker than 5/16 of an inch, had
been corroded to less than half its original thickness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline group is a subsidiary of Houston-based El Paso
Energy Co., owner of the biggest U.S. network of interstate gas
pipelines. The group oversees all of the parent company's
pipelines, including the 10,000 miles of lines owned by the El Paso
Natural Gas Co.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators said it was too early to say that corrosion
caused the leak that led to Saturday's pre-dawn explosion in Eddy
County, N.M. The pipe was one of four 30-inch El Paso Natural Gas
pipelines in the area. Three of the 50-year-old lines were in
service.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of the damaged pipe is being sent to Washington for
metallurgical tests, the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline company officials have said that the line was last
inspected Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Smith, 25, remained in critical condition at a Lubbock
hospital yesterday, making her the explosion's sole survivor. Her
husband, two children and parents were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The New Mexico explosion comes as concerns grow about the safety
of the nation's 2.2 million miles of natural gas and petroleum
pipelines. Major accidents _ those involving a fatality, an injury
or more than $50,000 in property damage _ have increased as the
system of aging pipelines has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pipelines are rotting in the ground. They need to be
replaced,'' said Bob Rackleff, a county commissioner in Florida and
the president of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition, a new
watchdog group pushing for safer pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The rules governing pipelines do not require the replacement of
aging lines and ``are terribly weak,'' Rackleff said.
</P>
<P>
   Office of Pipeline Safety records show that since 1970, El Paso
Natural Gas has had 205 pipeline ruptures: 55.2 percent of them
were caused by construction or material defects in the pipe, 21.5
by outside damage, 14.6 percent by corrosion and 8.7 percent
attributed to other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The records show that corrosion has caused ruptures in at least
three large pipes, ranging from 26 inches to 30 inches and made
between 1947 and 1953, pipes of the same size and age as the one
that ruptured last weekend, killing the campers and fishers on the
Pecos.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials did not respond to several questions about its
safety record regarding its 30-inch pipe and the corrosion-related
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   The three 30-inch pipelines that cross the Pecos on two bridges
transported about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day from
the West Texas oilfields of the Permian Basin to New Mexico,
Colorado, Arizona and California, said Norma Dunn, company
spokeswoman. The gas is used to run electric power generating
plants and by regional natural gas companies that distribute it
locally.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to improve pipeline safety and protect heavily
populated regions and the environment is now stalled in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a sponsor of one bill and a strong
proponent of pipeline reform since three people were killed in
Bellingham, Wash., in 1999, called the New Mexcico explosion ``a
deadly reminder that Congress needs to improve pipeline safety this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the pipeline bills seek greater enforcement authority
for the Office of Pipeline Safety, tougher inspections, better
operator training and more investment in research to prevent
accidents. The bills would also require pipeline companies to
release accident data to the public under strong community
right-to-know provisions. &QL;

 &HT;    Intel is developing new chip for wireless phones, devices
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Intel Corp. is developing a new type of
communications chip designed specifically to conserve battery power
and operate at fast speeds _ two keys to the fast-growing future of
devices such as Internet-ready wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's new semiconductor design - called XScale
microarchitecture - is based on its StrongARM technology used to
make chips for cell phones and other wireless communications
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The design was developed by Intel's operation in Chandler,
Ariz., but will be used extensively by Intel engineers in Austin,
said Ron Smith, vice president of Intel's Wireless Computing and
Communications Group. Intel's handheld computing division is based
in Austin, and the 1,500-person design center it's planning for
downtown Austin is expected to focus largely on wireless chip
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of very lower power and high performance makes
(the new design) well-suited for Internet access devices, such as
handheld and portable applications where battery life is
essential,'' Smith said in announcing the new design at Intel's
annual developer forum in San Jose on Wednesday. He said chips
based on the design would probably be available by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Just as importantly, chips based on the new design are expected
to have the ability to operate on a wide range of power levels and
at various speeds. Chips could run on as little as one
ten-thousandth of a watt, for instance _ key for products such as
wireless phones and personal digital assistants _ and as fast as 1
gigahertz, making them viable for big-computers like Internet
servers. Typical cell phones today need about 1 watt of power when
they're being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got the magic with this,'' said David Wu, an analyst
with investment banking and consulting firm ABN Amro Inc. ``Right
now you have lower power chips and you have high performance chips,
but you don't have both. This is going to be very good for Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chip design is Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel's latest
move aimed at increasing its share of the growing wireless market
as its PC chip business continues to slow along with sales of
personal computers in general.
</P>
<P>
   This year, consumers and businesses are expected to buy an
estimated 400 million wireless phones _ nearly double the number
purchased a year ago, according to figures from researcher
Dataquest Inc. By 2004, Dataquest predicts, sales will surpass 1
billion units.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is the world's biggest producer of computer chips but is a
mere bit player in the wireless chip business. Along with designing
new products centered on StrongARM technology, it
uncharacteristically has tried to buy its way into the wireless
market, making more than 20 communications-related acquisitions
over the past two years alone.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Christensen, vice president of Intel's Network
Communications Group, said the company plans to make even more
acquisitions to get new technology and engineers and is targeting
primarily smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general we don't look at mega-acquisitions,'' Christensen
said. ``We look primarily at small acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel acquired the licensing rights to StrongARM, in fact, when
it purchased most of Digital Equipment Corp.'s chip business in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Intel's stock closed at $74.62, up $2.50.

KNICKS STILL TALKING WITH SEATTLE ABOUT EWING
</HEADLINE>
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ General Manager Scott Layden continued to work the
phones on Wednesday as the Knicks sought to put together a deal
that would bring Glen Rice to New York and end Patrick Ewing's
increasingly ugly relationship with the franchise, its fans and the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   The parties in Seattle _ from Sonics management to Vin Baker to
his agent, Aaron Goodwin _ are frustrated because they believe the
deal would have been consummated on Monday were it not leaked to
the news media last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are frustrated because the fans' and news media's
rush to all but escort Ewing out of town will make it difficult and
uncomfortable if they are forced to welcome him back, something
that is growing more likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, the Sonics and the Los Angeles Lakers scrambled on
Wednesday to resuscitate the four-team, 13-player trade that fell
apart Monday evening when the Detroit Pistons pulled out amid
criticism from fans.
</P>
<P>
   The three clubs tried to sweeten the deal for the Pistons, who
originally were to receive seven marginal players, but Detroit was
not moved.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons General Manager Joe Dumars told the Detroit news media
on Wednesday that he would be open to working with the three teams
if a better deal were made available, but that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Pistons asked the Knicks to include Marcus Camby
in the package, but New York declined.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Detroit is set to send Christian Laettner to Dallas
next week for Cedric Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   With Detroit all but out of the picture, the clubs pressed for
either the Chicago Bulls or the Charlotte Hornets to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, Sonics and Lakers all have interest in the Bulls'
center and power forward Dickey Simpkins and may have been looking
at involving him in the deal with a sign-and-trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and Sonics could work a two-team deal that featured
Ewing and Baker as the principals, but New York is less than
enthralled with Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 38, Ewing is more productive than Seattle's declining
power forward, and the six years and $77 million remaining on
Baker's contract conjure up thoughts of the restrictive 12-year,
$84 million contract that Larry Johnson lugged to New York four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the two teams want to get a deal done, they don't need
three or four teams,'' said Goodwin, who hoped that Baker would
become a Knick on Thursday before leaving for Hawaii to train for
the Olympics. ``If New York wants Vin and if Seattle wants Patrick
Ewing, then do a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks would take Baker if they also landed Rice, but they
are hesitant to make such a move otherwise. The clubs continue to
talk, though.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible two-team deal involves the Knicks and the
Lakers. The clubs are believed to have discussed a trade that would
have brought Rice, the backup center Travis Knight and the reserve
guards John Celestand and Tyronn Lue to New York in exchange for
Chris Dudley, Chris Childs and another player, possibly the rookie
Lavor Postell.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, however, balked at accepting Childs, who got into a
fight with Kobe Bryant in a game last season, and asked the Knicks
to replace him with a more enticing player, possibly Camby. That
forced the Knicks to step back.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' interest in Rice is real, which implies that the
deal they are trying to make may be a prelude to another trade
involving Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are aware that they need a top-flight big man to
compete for a championship, and adding Rice would give them the
flexibility to package Houston and perhaps Camby in such a deal.
The obvious desirables would be Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo and
Sacramento's Chris Webber, both of whom will be free agents after
next season and could pressure their teams to trade them.
</P>
<P>
   While the clubs work the phones, the possibility of Ewing
remaining with the Knicks increases.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is perhaps the only team with which the Knicks can work
a deal that involves their onetime franchise player, and the delay
is making the Sonics bitter. They stand to gain not only Ewing but
Maurice Taylor, who would sign with Seattle for the $2.25 million
midlevel exception if Ewing joins the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the Sonics did not extend Ewing's contract after
next season, which is likely, they could position themselves to be
nearly $20 million beneath the salary cap next summer, when Webber,
Mutombo and Dallas' small forward Michael Finley become free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics want desperately to part ways with Baker, who has
played poorly his last two seasons, and Goodwin has even gone on
record as saying that there is too much acrimony between the
parties for Baker to return to Seattle. Baker, who does not get
along with Sonics Coach Paul Westphal, is looking to play superbly
at the Sydney Olympics in hopes of enhancing his trade value.
</P>
<P>
   As unpleasant as things have become for Ewing in New York, his
situation is not as bad as Baker's and a reconciliation by next
season is not unfathomable. The Knicks will not trade Ewing for
substandard player, and they know that his 15 points and 10
rebounds a night are still of major value.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who seems to let trade talk involving his name bounce
off his back, said he could see Ewing back in the starting lineup
despite the recent turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we haven't been through this before _ trade
rumors and speculation,'' Houston said. ``If and when he comes back
we're going to still make it work and everybody has to be on the
same page. Just because something happens one day in the office
does not mean you come back for the rest of the week and complain
about it.'' &QL;

DODGERS WOULD NEED MIRACLE TO MAKE PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the front offices on the luxury-suite level
down the left-field line, hope lingers.
</P>
<P>
   From nearly every other vantage point, the Los Angeles Dodgers'
2000 season is finished. Limited ability and inconsistency have all
but closed the lid on the season and probably the Dodgers
managerial career of Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (63-61) entered Wednesday night 8 games behind San
Francisco in the National League West. With 38 games to play, even
the `78 Yankees would be hard-pressed to make up that deficit, and
these Dodgers are not the `78 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the organization is clinging to the belief a miracle
is on its way. But privately, many of the players acknowledge the
season has gone awry and the thought of reaching the playoffs is
pure fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, when all is said and done, have a $98 million
payroll and nothing but frustration to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many areas that, at one time, fell apart during the
season,'' Dodgers second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. ``There's
no question we are where we are because of the way we played.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter which aspect of the game is scrutinized, the Dodgers
have looked awesome at times, repulsive at times.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitching has had depressing stretches. The starters
- other than Kevin Brown - went a month without winning a game. And
now Brown is struggling: He entered his Wednesday start against the
Montreal Expos winless since July 24.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's certainly not all bad. The Dodgers' top three
starters - Brown, Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort - form the
second best trio in the National League. They're 32-20 and their
3.62 ERA trails only the New York Mets' threesome of Mike Hampton,
Al Leiter and Rick Reed, who are 32-16 with a 3.61 ERA. Atlanta's
Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood are 38-21 with a 3.80
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and fifth spots in the rotation - occupied by Mike
Judd, Eric Gagne, Carlos Perez, Matt Herges and the retired Orel
Hershiser - are where the Dodgers fall down. That group is a
combined 6-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the key to being a great club, having everyone in the
rotation to where the predictability is pretty good,'' Johnson
said. ``You need that to put together a streak. When you win nine,
10 games in a row, that's less pressure on your offense, less
pressure on your defense. Probably my greatest disappointment since
I've been here is the lack of consistency in the starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Team fielding held up for the first few months. Now, the Dodgers
are second worst in the league with 109 errors. San Diego has
committed 110.
</P>
<P>
   Team hitting was strong early in the season and manages to break
loose now and again. For example, the Dodgers popped six homers and
scored 14 runs against the Expos on Tuesday. However, they rely so
much on the home run and do so little to manufacture runs, they've
had difficulty scoring late in games.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they don't hit in the clutch. As a team, they're
batting .256 with runners in scoring position. Left fielder Gary
Sheffield is hitting .346 in such situations, but Grudzielanek is
batting .217, Shawn Green is at .266 and Eric Karros is .254.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen hasn't fared much better.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jeff Shaw hasn't allowed an earned run since the All-Star
break, but the seven saves he blew before the break (in part
because he was injured) cost the Dodgers dearly during a time they
were struggling. An injury to Mike Fetters that offset the
bullpen's balance for three weeks was another debilitating
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the suspension fiasco that still looms. Sheffield's
hearing for his appeal of a five-game suspension is Monday in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have one part that doesn't work. All our parts work,
and they work well, but not at the same time,'' Dreifort said.
</P>
<P>
   The front office revamped the roster in the offseason and then
made a few moves during the season to upgrade the talent. Alex Cora
is starting much of the time at shortstop, and he's been as solid
as a 24-year-old can be in his first significant role in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trading-deadline deals that brought right-hander
Ismael Valdes and leadoff hitter Tom Goodwin to the team have meant
very little. Valdes couldn't hold a three-run lead in the sixth
inning against the Expos on Tuesday, and he's winless in five
starts since being re-acquired by the Dodgers from the Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin was brought in to play center field and gives the
Dodgers speed atop the order. In his three weeks with the club,
he's been reduced to a platoon player with Devon White. In 18
games, Goodwin has three stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is you can fragment it and break down the
individual aspects of the team, but when you put it all together it
didn't equate to enough wins so far,'' said Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone, the shining example of someone who believes hope
springs eternal. ``It's exactly like a puzzle and having all the
pieces, but they haven't fit together to form the picture. I've
been very frustrated with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have the talent. We have a talented group of
individual players, but we haven't been the consistent team we need
to be for us to be a championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   The lapses are so diverse it's left management and the players
wondering how best to fix it - or whether it can be fixed at all.
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate product of their inconsistency? One six-game
winning streak, one five-game winning streak and no others longer
than three games.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Dodgers maintain faint, perhaps misguided hope they
can catch the Giants before season's end, remember this:
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants, playing some of the best ball in the league, go
18-19 during their final 37 games, the Dodgers would need to go
27-11 just to tie them. And if the Dodgers miraculously pulled out
of their five-month malaise and suddenly found consistency to play
their best 38-game stretch of the season, it doesn't guarantee
they'll get past second-place Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   So, see you next year.

BODIES OF TWO TEEN-AGE BOYS STILL MISSING 
</HEADLINE>
  By AL BAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ As helicopters and rescue boats
searched the Hudson River for two teen-age boys from a state
psychiatric center who were swept away on Tuesday, investigators
said that a counselor who had been warned to keep them out of the
water had led them down a steep, treacherous path to the river's
edge.
</P>
<P>
   There, at a rocky outcropping where the Hudson and Croton Rivers
converge _ a spot that local residents said had been the site of
many drownings over the years _ three of the six teen-agers in the
counselor's care suddenly leapt fully dressed into the treacherous
crosscurrents, the police said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One boy managed to fight his way to shore right away, and the
counselor, Lenox Gabriel, who had yelled for the boys to get out
and then jumped in after them, was rescued by police officers. But
as of late Wednesday, the two other boys, Arimendi Lajara, 15, and
Cedric Florence, 17, had still not been found. Gabriel told the
police that they appeared to swim away from shore. Dozens of their
relatives gathered at the desolate site waiting for news. The
Westchester County police said the boys' survival seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the incident, in Croton Point Park, 35 miles
north of New York, was being treated as an accident, although they
wanted to speak again with Gabriel, 47, who was listed in stable
condition at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow.
Officials there said he would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point they are not anticipating any criminal
charges,'' Sgt. Donald F. McArthur said of detectives investigating
the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, McArthur said, where the other counselors were
when the boys jumped into the river. He said Gabriel told
investigators that he was the only adult with the six children at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   One of the counselors called the park headquarters to report the
emergency, and two police officers who had been in the park jumped
in to rescue Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   The State Office of Mental Health, which operates the Brooklyn
psychiatric center and the group home on its grounds where the boys
are temporarily living, is also investigating, said Roger Klingman,
a spokesman for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel told a detective late Tuesday that he had walked the
boys down the near-vertical hill called Teller's Point at the
southernmost tip of the park to take them on a hike, not to go
swimming, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The pathway is marked by rocks and tree roots that can be used
as footholds. It is thickly wooded and takes some skill to
navigate. ``No swimming'' signs are posted, officials said, but the
police said they were often removed by vandals. None were visible
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The counselors asked park officials if swimming was allowed,
McArthur said, and were told twice _ at check-in on Monday and
earlier Tuesday _ that the water was off limits. Walking on the
cliff is not prohibited, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, helicopters buzzed overhead and boats scoured the
waterway, until their blinking emergency lights were barely
discernible through the gathering mist.
</P>
<P>
   The six boys on the outing are residents of an outpatient group
home on the grounds of the psychiatric center, in
Bedford-Stuvesant. The five-year-old home is a short-term or
transitional center for emotionally troubled teen-agers who require
round-the-clock supervision rather than hospitalization, Klingman
said.

VERIZON SETTLES WITH OTHER UNION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., Pa., Del., Md., W. Va., Va.)  (Eds: SUBS with new lede, updating throughout to reflect settlement
) 
BY SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Verizon Communications and a union representing more
than 35,000 employees in several mid-Atlantic states settled an
18-day strike Wednesday night after the company agreed to reduce
requirements for mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after nearly all significant differences
between Verizon and two unions were resolved and a majority of
strikers returned to work earlier this week in New York and New
England.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,
West Virginia, Virginia and Washington was held up over the
overtime issue, in addition to local concerns like what type of
work cable splicers and service technicians can do in Pennsylvania,
people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement reached Wednesday night between between
Verizon, which was formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE,
and the Communications Workers of America, customer service
representatives in these states will be required to work as much as
7.5 hours of overtime a week, down from as much as 15 hours. Other
union employees' overtime will be capped at 10 hours a week after
the contract is ratified, and eight hours in January.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the overtime concession, Verizon agreed to a
bilingual salary differential, in which workers who do jobs that
require more than one language will receive 3.5 percent more pay,
people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the communications workers' union and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which together represented more
than 86,000 employees in the walkout, secured a number of
concessions from Verizon, including wage and benefit increases,
stock options, greater job security and more flexibility to
organize in the company's fast-growing wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   While union negotiators in New York and New England considered
these concessions a pivotal victory in their effort to gain a
foothold in high-technology industries, their counterparts in the
mid-Atlantic region wrangled over local issues like cable splicers.
Verizon apparently wanted to deploy cable splicers with greater
flexibility. A definitive agreement on this issue was not reached,
people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable splicers generally install and repair telephone cables and
are considered more skilled than service technicians, who connect
and repair telephone service on the outside of homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to put this strike in the past,'' said Eric Rabe,
a spokesman for Verizon.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: CHENEY'S OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney became wealthy at the helm of Halliburton Co. over
the past five years. At Wednesday's stock price, the value of his
shares, restricted shares and vested stock options granted him
during his tenure adds up to more than $30 million. That is
compensation awarded to Cheney for his past service, and is
perfectly appropriate, provided he sells these assets if elected
vice president and puts the proceeds in a blind trust to eliminate
any potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans should wonder why the Dallas-based oil services
company went further and allowed Cheney to keep 400,000 more stock
options that he would ordinarily have had to work additional years
to acquire. Under the terms of his employment contract, Cheney
could have retired at age 62 and by that time would have earned
these additional options. But as part of his retirement package,
Halliburton's board of directors allowed Cheney to retire at age 59
and still keep these options. The board also accelerated the
vesting of some restricted shares. That special favor, worth at
least $6 million at today's prices and potentially a lot more,
would tie Cheney's financial fortunes to those of the company _ and
therefore to the price of oil _ well into a potential Bush-Cheney
administration. Cheney should have turned the favor down, and taken
only the substantial stake he had already earned.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton is being generous to a fault. The purpose of an
employment contract and of stock options with staggered vesting
periods is to retain valued employees. There is no legitimate
reason for Halliburton shareholders to compensate Cheney for
leaving early to seek the vice presidency. Nor should they be asked
to supplement his government salary. Clearly, the company would not
be allowing Cheney to keep the additional options if he were going
to work for a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton maintains that it is not treating Cheney any
differently than it would other highly valued employees who opt to
retire early. But the vice-presidential candidate is not just
another retiree. And while the company may be excused for wanting
to ingratiate itself with a man who could be the next president's
chief lieutenant, if not president himself someday, Cheney should
know better than to find himself in this situation. It is true that
there are no laws barring the arrangement, but it is a matter of
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the situation especially troubling is the nature of
the industry itself. Oil touches on everything from relations with
Venezuela to wildlife preservation in Alaska, from Middle East
politics to the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said he will do whatever is needed to avoid any
conflict of interest. He is reportedly conferring with lawyers
about how best to handle the thorny ethical issue posed by the
400,000 options, which are scheduled to vest late this year, in
2001 and in 2002. To his credit, Cheney has indicated he will place
his assets in a blind trust if elected vice president. But these
options cannot be transferred, not even to a trust. It is baffling
that a man of Cheney's supposed sophistication would not have
avoided this ethical minefield in negotiating his retirement
package.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's lawyers and financial advisers may yet find a way to
prevent him from having a stake in future swings in the price of
oil. A Wall Street firm could sign a contract on his options,
locking in his proceeds from the sale of that stock now. But this
would not address the unseemly fact that Halliburton has been
unduly generous to a man who stands a good chance of becoming vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lawyers and bankers, Cheney needs to summon all of
his gravitas and do the right thing. That means he should just say
no to any options that would vest after he is in office.

EDITORIAL: A NEW APPROACH TO FOREST FIRES  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will soon unveil a revised approach
to forest fires. Preliminary reports suggest that the policy will
be smarter than past federal strategies, and much smarter than the
recommendations flowing from President Clinton's opportunistic
Republican critics.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of nonsense has been spoken about the fires now
raging across the Western United States. Emotional responses are
inevitable when nearly 5 million acres are burning. But there is no
cause for the political posturing in which some public figures have
engaged.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the governor of Montana, the House speaker and the
Republican candidate for president have all suggested that the
administration's efforts to reduce logging on public lands have
made the forests more vulnerable to fire. They have also urged that
Clinton's plan to ban road building in virtually all of the
unprotected roadless areas of the national forests, about 43
million acres, be put on hold. Both arguments serve the timber
industry and ignore reality. Some of the biggest fires are burning
not in wilderness areas but on land that has been developed or
logged.
</P>
<P>
   From what is known of the administration's deliberations, its
revised strategy will concede past mistakes, though not those
identified by its critics. It will recommend continuing the policy
of prescribed fires, or deliberate burns. It will sound some
cautionary notes about building subdivisions too close to nature.
Finally, it will offer something new and expensive _ a plan to thin
out the most fire-prone forests, maybe 40 million acres altogether,
by removing underbrush and small trees while allowing mature,
fire-resistant trees to remain.
</P>
<P>
   In general the policy makes sense, especially when set against
the errors of the past. The main culprit for the present disaster
is the Forest Service's policy of snuffing out fires on public
lands as quickly as possible. This policy took root in 1910, after
the so-called Big Burn in Idaho and Montana wiped out about 3
million acres, and in 1947 actually acquired a popular mascot,
Smokey Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The policy's great flaw was that it disturbed the natural cycle
in which fires periodically swept thorough forests, nourishing the
soil and clearing out underbrush and small trees while sparing
bigger trees. Suppressing these purgative blazes left forests
choked with excess vegetation that provided vast amounts of fuel
for future fires. Excessive logging had the same effect, removing
the biggest and most fire-resistant trees and leaving crowded,
fire-prone stands of young trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Smokey Bear approach was already losing credibility when a
huge fire, fueled partly by dense underbrush, tore through almost
half of Yellowstone National Park in 1988. Thereafter, and
especially under the present Interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, the
government actually began setting fires in a pre-emptive effort to
prevent bigger fires. Earlier this summer one planned fire, in Los
Alamos, N.M., roared out of control. But the administration
attributes the Los Alamos fire to poor execution, not the policy
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes that in time a combination of the new
thinning-out strategy and the older prescribed-burn techniques will
restore the nation's forests to less combustible levels of density.
Thinning out the forests will require a lot of machinery, manpower
and money. But it deserves reasoned debate, as far removed as
possible from partisan sniping.

EDITORIAL: VISAS FOR MEXICAN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, has some provocative if
premature ideas about cross-border immigration. His ultimate goal
is free movement of labor across an open border. But that is not
practical anytime soon. With the more than tenfold gap between U.S.
and Mexican wages, the migration would be all one way, as low-wage
Mexican workers competed with the poorest, least skilled Americans.
So for now, Fox would like to see Washington significantly increase
the number of temporary visas available to Mexican workers. In
exchange, Mexico would strengthen policies to discourage illegal
emigration to the United States. That is an experiment worth
discussing.
</P>
<P>
   America's current border enforcement policies are not working
well. The nearly $1 billion a year Washington spends to police its
southern border has not measurably reduced the flow of illegal
immigrants from Mexico. Around 340,000 Mexicans enter the United
States every year, well over half of them illegally. Traditionally,
illegal immigration has provided a safety valve for Mexican
governments and low-wage labor for U.S. employers. But it has also
been a source of diplomatic tension, particularly when would-be
immigrants are killed by border agents or unscrupulous smugglers or
die from the effects of heat and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Fox proceeds from the realistic assumption that the number of
Mexicans entering the United States each year, either legally or
illegally, will not fall below 340,000. But he would like to see a
significantly larger proportion of that total given legal status,
through the issuance of tens of thousands of additional work visas
annually. He would also like legal status granted to many Mexicans
who entered the United States illegally in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Mexico could crack down on Central Americans who
cross its territory to enter the United States illegally, and
enforce racketeering laws against smuggling syndicates. Any
increases in the number of U.S. visas should be linked to evidence
of improved Mexican border enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans fear that adding temporary visas for Mexicans
will drive down wages of low-income Americans, and that any amnesty
for those here illegally will only invite future illegal crossings.
But the border is already highly porous. Some experts believe that
a well-conceived program along the lines Fox suggests could produce
a long-term drop in illegal crossings. Legalized immigrants also
have greater ability to unionize and demand decent conditions,
making them less likely to undermine the status of low-wage
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush will both meet
the new Mexican leader during his current visit to the United
States. Both candidates should use the opportunity to learn more
about his immigration ideas.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Boeing's design of the 747, as well as its overall
philosophy for fuel tank safety, contributed to the likely cause of
an explosion that destroyed TWA Flight 800 in 1996, the National
Transportation Safety Board ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up the most expensive investigation of any plane crash,
the board said Boeing erred in the initial design of the 747 when
it placed air conditioning units directly under the plane's center
fuel tank without providing a way to reduce the heat they may
transfer to the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Paris-bound TWA jet took off, it sat on the ground at
Kennedy International Airport for about three hours with its air
conditioning units running, which heated fuel vapors in the nearly
empty tank to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the board said the probable cause of the crash was
an explosion of those flammable vapors from a short circuit in the
aging wiring on the 25-year-old jumbo jet, though the exact
ignition source could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, in closing remarks after the board
adopted the staff's 25 findings and four recommendations to the
Federal Aviation Administration, said the accident has its roots in
decisions made years earlier by Boeing and the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' Hall said, `` ... the 230 men, women
and children on board TWA Flight 800 lost their lives, not as the
result of a bomb or missile or some other nefarious act, but as the
result of a tragic accident _ an accident triggered by an ill-fated
sequence of events in the center wing tank of an aging aircraft
that was set in motion years before by the manufacturer's and the
FAA's design and certification philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion is controversial. Many people still believe a
missile shot down the plane. The board went to great lengths at the
two-day meeting to lay out what it said was overwhelming evidence
Flight 800 was not brought down by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the likely cause of the explosion was a short circuit
outside the center fuel tank that allowed explosive voltage to
enter the tank through electrical wiring associated with the fuel
quantity indication system, the board ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Breistroff from Paris, whose son Michel, 24, had been
about to join the French Olympic hockey team, he is not convinced
the plane was brought down by a mechanical problem. He said he had
lingering doubts about a missile or some other nonmechanical means.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been explaining to me but inside my head I don't
fully believe what they are saying. I wish I could be convinced so
I could be free,'' said Breistroff, one of about 70 family members
of crash victims who attended Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The plane exploded about 11 minutes after take off from Kennedy
the evening of July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife, Pam, a former TWA
flight attendant, and his two young daughters, Shannon and Katie,
found little comfort at the hearing and the board's conclusion
about the likely cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presentation by the NTSB has been excellent but there have
been no surprises,'' he was quoted as saying in an Associated Press
story. ``The center fuel tank blew up and killed my family and the
loved ones of the other family members. That is not supposed to
happen, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it might not have happened had Boeing and the aviation
industry focused not only on possible fuel tank ignition sources,
but the potential for fuel vapors to explode, said Bernard Loeb,
the safety board's longtime director of its office of aviation
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident would not have occurred, but for the flammable
vapor in the center wing tank,'' he said. ``We believe that perhaps
the most valuable lesson that can be learned from this accident _
and our best hope for preventing similar accidents in the future _
lies in recognizing this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hinderberger, director of airplane safety for Boeing who
attended the meeting with two other Boeing commercial airplane
executives, said he did not disagree with the board's findings of
probable cause, though he believes the industry's fuel tank design
philosophy has proved sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel as we have stated from the beginning that the most
appropriate way to ensure fuel tank safety is to eliminate all
possible ignition sources,'' he told reporters after the board
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have also said an additional level of protection can be
obtained by reducing the exposure to flammable fuel vapors. So
seeing a probable cause or finding or recommendation that goes
along the lines of eliminating ignition sources and reducing
flammable fuel vapors would appear to me to be consistent with our
submission (Boeing's report to the safety board) and our stance all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Boeing's planes other than the 717, formerly the
McDonnell Douglas MD-95, have air conditioning units, known as
packs, located directly below the center wing tank.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas jets have air conditioning units in the front
or rear of the plane. Airbus jets have air conditioning packs under
the center wing tank, but the design incorporates a ventilation
system that cools the heated air given off by the units as the
plane climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Boeing design, Hinderberger said, ``I hate to
stand here in front of you after all the hard work that has been
done over the last four years and wind the clock back 30 years and
say a mistake was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all learned a lot in last four years that was outlined
over the last two days and we all have opportunities to move
forward in fuel system safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is looking at tank ventilation as well as a ground-based
system that would pump inert gas into the fuel tanks, which would
greatly lessen the chance the fuel vapors could become flammable.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of 11 recommendations previously made by the board
to the FAA based on early information from the TWA crash
investigation. Only one of those recommendations remains classified
as open, the board said Wednesday. That is a recommendation to
require temperature probes in the fuel tanks so pilots can monitor
the temperature of the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says that would not be necessary if the ground inerting
system proves workable, or if the center wing tanks can be cooled
by direct ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Wednesday's board meeting focused on wiring problems
found on airplanes, including the TWA jet, and the board's four new
recommendations to the FAA reflected its concern about wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The board called on the federal agency to review aircraft wiring
systems on all U.S. certified aircraft and determine which ones are
critical to safety and then require whatever safety revisions are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA and the aviation industry have launched aging-aircraft
programs to better understand the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swaim of the board's aviation engineering division
presented an alarming report at Wednesday's meeting on problems
found with wiring recovered from the TWA jet. That included exposed
wiring where the insulation was broken or worn away, which can
result in a short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators then looked at wiring on more than a half dozen
other jets and found similar problems, especially on older planes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swaim said investigators found a number of foreign objects in
the wiring of the jets inspected. The objects included a dinner
knife that likely slipped through a gap in the passenger cabin
wall. Objects also inclued screwdrivers and coat hangers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found metal drill shavings in both old and
new planes, he said. These shavings can cut through a wire and
cause a short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Shavings were even found on the fuel quantity indicator in the
fuel tank of a new 747-400 that had not yet been delivered, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall asked Dr. Vernon Ellingstad, director of science labs at
the board, to look at aircraft accidents over the past 20 years to
determine if there is any correlation between the accidents and
older airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman said he wanted to know if there is any ``safety
benefit'' to providing the public with information about the age of
the planes on which they fly. He asked for the report by Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen that the industry is paying the type of
attention it needs to pay to older aircraft,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   John Goglia, one of the board's five members, complained there
is no system in place for reporting airplane wiring problems.
</P>
<P>
   Before he joined the board, Goglia spent about 30 years as an
airline mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia's voice was choked with emotion as he told the audience
of bringing other mechanics to view a 93-foot section of the TWA
jet that was reconstructed in a hangar from the hundreds of
thousands of pieces of wreckage pulled from the bottom of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing remarks, Hall recalled the 1963 crash of a Boeing
707 in a Maryland cornfield. The fuel tank on the jet exploded
after the plane was struck by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently came across the following quotation: `It is
recommended that every effort be expended to arrive at a practical
means by which flammable air/vapor mixtures are eliminated from
fuel tanks.' This was presented to the FAA by our predecessor
agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board, on December 17, 1963,
following the crash of Pan American Flight 214 near Elkton,
Maryland,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 40 years later, it is imperative that at long last, the
aviation community move with dispatch to remove flammable fuel/air
mixtures from the fuel tanks of transport category aircraft.''

PACIFIC CLASSIC HAS HAD ITS SHARE OF THRILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Now it can be told: Right up until post time
in 1991, it was no sure thing that the inaugural Pacific Classic
would even be run.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar Thoroughbred Club chairman John Mabee and his wife Betty
owned local favorite Best Pal. They also owned San Diego County's
largest grocery-store chain. The Big Bear markets were being
picketed by political activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they would disrupt the race if we didn't stop
selling Folgers coffee,'' Betty Mabee said Wednesday. ``We were
afraid they'd try to harm Best Pal.''
</P>
<P>
   A beefed-up presence by Del Mar security and sheriff's officers
in the saddling paddock was credited with discouraging the
protesters. The race went off without incident and Best Pal scored
a popular victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If security hadn't been on the ball, it's hard to know what
would have happened,'' Betty Mabee said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Classic will have its 10th running here Saturday.
Since those anxious hours before its debut, most of the excitement
has been confined to the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   From Best Pal's breakthrough win in 1991, to trainer Bobby
Frankel's four consecutive victories in 1992-95, to Cigar's
historic loss in front of 44,000 fans in 1996, to the humbling
defeats of a succession of stars from out of state, the Pacific
Classic has squeezed a lot into its short history. For Del Mar, the
$1 million race has delivered national attention, and for the
Southern California thoroughbred circuit, it has filled a yawning
gap (or gaping yawn) in the stakes schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, 20 years ago Del Mar was just a little country
track,'' said Joe Harper, the track's president, CEO and general
manager, overstating it just a bit. ``It had no national status
other than the fact it was the place where Seabiscuit ran once (in
1938) and where Bing Crosby sings a song (`Where the Turf Meets the
Surf'). We needed a signature race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Del Mar was doing well at the gate,'' said marketing and
publicity director Dan Smith. ``It had a lot of good races, like
the Eddie Read (Handicap, a turf race) and the Del Mar Futurity
(for 2-year-olds), but it didn't have a big purse.''
</P>
<P>
   A million-dollar purse has bought plenty of status.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-mile race for 3-year-olds and up - modeled on the Santa
Anita Handicap and the Hollywood Gold Cup - has drawn its share of
thin fields. This year's seven-horse lineup, headed again by
General Challenge, might be the most-glaring example. That's the
drawback of being isolated on the geographical fringe: Unless
there's a national series and purse bonus to entice out-of-towners,
any California stakes can wind up a locals-only affair.
</P>
<P>
   Another knock on the Pacific Classic: None of its winners has
gone on to confirm his quality by winning the Breeders' Cup Classic
in the fall (although 1993 winner Bertrando did finish second to
Arcangues at the Breeders' Cup). That's a logical result of having
eight out of the nine runnings won by non-favorites.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the Pacific Classic has done better than its
counterparts at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park at attracting
top-quality horses. Its deepest fields were those in 1991, when
Best Pal defeated Twilight Agenda, Unbridled, Festin, Farma Way and
Itsallgreektome, and 1994, when Tinners Way beat Best Pal, Dramatic
Gold, Slew of Damascus, Stuka and Bertrando.
</P>
<P>
   The star of all Pacific Classic runners is Cigar. The two-time
Horse of the Year's attempt at a 17th consecutive victory, which
would have broken a tie with the great Citation for the recognized
North American record, made the 1996 Pacific Classic the West
Coast's racing event of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Owner Allen) Paulson said he wanted to bring Cigar home for
the big one,'' Harper remembered. ``I kept thinking, `He has so
many homes - I hope he means the one in Del Mar!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cigar arrived from New York on the Thursday before the race with
the panache of a thoroughbred Beatle. A San Diego news helicopter
followed his van from the airport to the barn. His appearance
seemed to transcend the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 44,181, a Del Mar record by nearly 10,000, filled
the parking lots by 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most excitement I've seen at this racetrack,'' said
William Murray, the novelist (``Tip on a Dead Crab,'' ``I'm Getting
Killed Right Here'') and New Yorker magazine correspondent who has
been coming to Del Mar since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar, bet down to 1-10, didn't provide exactly the history the
fans came to witness. He and jockey Jerry Bailey chased a fast pace
and were outfinished by 39-1 Dare and Go and jockey Alex Solis.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Richard Mandella-trained Dare and Go became the
longest shot to win, Mandella's Gentlemen became the only favorite
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar's second-place finish epitomized the Pacific Classic's
reputation as a slayer of visiting giants. Among the notable
invaders to lose have been 1990 Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled
(third in 1991), Jolie's Halo (who slipped and dumped his rider at
the start in 1992), Concern (fifth in 1995) and Touch Gold (fifth
in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Their poor record no doubt has put off some Eastern horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   But the dominance of local horses has been a delight for the
denizens of Del Mar. Particularly Frankel, the Hall of Fame trainer
whose exploits with a procession of upsetters made him the only man
to win the same million-dollar race four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (given) Del Mar a race people pay attention to,'' Frankel
said.``I don't think it's got the charm of a Whitney (the major
summer handicap at Saratoga), but it is a big race.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel-trained Tinners Way is the only horse to win the Pacific
Classic twice (1994-95), but he didn't win another major race.
Going for three in 1996, he was pulled up with an injury and
promptly retired. Frankel horses finished first and second in 1992
(Missionary Ridge, Defensive Play) and first, second and fourth in
1993 (Bertrando, Missionary Ridge, Marquetry).
</P>
<P>
   If Frankel has been the Pacific Classic's greatest trainer so
far, then Hall of Famer Eddie Delahoussaye (rider of Tinners Way
and three other in-the-money finishers) is its greatest jockey, and
Tinners Way and Best Pal (also third in 1993 and second in 1994)
are its greatest winners.
</P>
<P>
   And to think: Best Pal might never have made it to the starting
gate.
</P>
<P>
   After those inaugural jitters, when a dispute over coffee nearly
intruded on the race, the Pacific Classic has amounted to much more
than a hill of beans.

`SURVIVOR': DOG-EAT-DOG REALITY, BUT MUST-SEE TV
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for rewriting thruout)  
 By CARYN JAMES  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Last summer's television phenomenon, ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire,'' is the feel-good game show that says we're a happy
country pulling together. This summer ``Survivor'' sends a
countermessage: Trust no one. The people on the island endured by
voting together but in the end were forced to turn against one
another. The island was a microcosm of dog-eat-dog reality, staged
at a safe distance. Just as murder mysteries transform our fear of
death into a playful entertainment, ``Survivor'' turns the
competitive nightmare of contemporary life into a benign game.
</P>
<P>
   The hype has generally glossed over the deeper reasons for the
show's success, but the fact that Richard Hatch survived to win the
million dollars at the end of Wednesday night's (flashback-padded)
finale speaks directly to why the show has touched a chord. His
triumph might as well have been a chant: Machiavelli lives. It's no
accident that Rich was always identified as a corporate trainer.
</P>
<P>
   As two finalists faced a jury of those they had cast off, one
said he was not so much for Richard as against against Kelly
Wiglesworth, the runner-up and a former ally who had turned against
her. ``Richard was a snake,'' she said, ``but Kelly was a rat.'' As
Kelly asked in an aside to the camera in the final weeks, ``How do
you stay true to yourself and maintain integrity and still play
this game?'' She answered her own question: ``You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the standard line about the success of ``Survivor'': It
is a reality game show featuring 16 ordinary people on an island,
plus one scheming villain to hiss at, as the group votes one member
off each week. But that conventional wisdom is entirely backward.
``Survivor'' is as remote from reality as its setting, Pulau Tiga
(likely translation: Island of the Product Placements) and as
meticulously structured as a novel by Agatha Christie (whose ``Ten
Little Indians'' plot it brilliantly mimics). And though its
characters may be genuine to their family and friends, to the
average viewer they are as real as Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   That visceral pull wouldn't have materialized if the show didn't
work as pure entertainment. Even the best orchestrated hype (which
CBS had) isn't enough to account for the endless chattering among
viewers. ``Survivor'' drew a gigantic audience with a combination
of sports challenges and the suspense of who gets kicked off the
island: Agatha Christie goes to the Olympics. (The island itself
was as realistic and as hokey as a haunted house.)
</P>
<P>
   And each episode was edited into a swift hour. ``Survivor''
never spent more than a few seconds watching someone eat rice.
``Elapsed time: 4 hours 11 minutes'' flashed on the screen after
the minutes spent in Wednesday night's contest about who could
stand the longest with a hand on a totem pole. Take away ruthless
editing, and you end up watching people feed the chickens, as they
have on CBS's tiresome ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   That totem pole contest, an ``immunity challenge,'' was part of
this game's most wickedly unpredictable feature. In each episode
one person won a contest and could not be voted out in that round;
so-called immunity was the wild card that made every rational
prediction moot. Kelly would have been gone weeks ago, but she won
four immunity challenges in a row to become one of the final two
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But only part of the series' constantly growing ratings came
from the suspense. The show got progressively more gripping as it
became progressively more psychological. What started out as a
sporting challenge (build a hut, eat a rat) turned into a
tantalizing mind game, driven largely by Rich.
</P>
<P>
   The truest voyeurism, after all, is looking into someone else's
thoughts, and that is what truly drove ``Survivor.'' The most
compelling moments were those in which the contestants spoke
directly to the camera, confidentially to us, letting us into the
secrets of their sometimes backbiting strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode Colleen sits in a tree, looks sweetly into the
camera and says she'll vote Richard off the island because he's too
bossy. (What an innocent.) In a later episode Richard, the supposed
villain, looks into the camera and says coolly, ominously of
Gretchen, ``She has to go because she is bright and is strong, and
she is a threat.'' Gretchen is gone that night. The message about
who wins in life is unmistakable. Of course the editors knew the
winner in advance: They clearly edited to focus on Rich and make
him the audience-drawing villain.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers selected these contestants shrewdly, to
cover the social spectrum, from Sean, a neurologist, to Susan, a
truck driver so tough her husband boasted in an interview, ``She's
a man in a woman's body.'' It was a dazzling stroke to bring the
contestants videos from home a few weeks ago. Viewers saw Gervase's
daughter toddling toward the camera and watched Jenna, the mother
of twin girls, cry when she heard her video had not arrived. Those
humanizing moments were the equivalent of up-close-and-personal
profiles of sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   We do not actually know these people any better than we know the
latest celebrity interviewed on ``Entertainment Tonight,'' of
course. The irony is that the success of ``Survivor'' has made
these real people less real to us, as they have taken on the
flattened images of celebrities. (And their post-``Survivor''
show-business plans are just starting.) Richard had already
achieved a measure of fame. Say ``the naked fat guy,'' and everyone
knows who you mean. And admit it: You secretly like him. That may
be the biggest, most revealing ``Survivor'' secret of all.

NTSB SAYS 747 DESIGN CONTRIBUTED TO FLIGHT 800 CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Boeing's design of the 747, as well as its overall
philosophy for fuel tank safety, contributed to the likely cause of
an explosion that destroyed TWA Flight 800 in 1996, the National
Transportation Safety Board ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up the most expensive investigation of any plane crash,
the board said Boeing erred in the initial design of the 747 when
it placed air conditioning units directly under the plane's center
fuel tank without providing a way to reduce the heat they may
transfer to the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Paris-bound TWA jet took off, it sat on the ground at
Kennedy International Airport for about three hours with its air
conditioning units running, which heated fuel vapors in the nearly
empty tank to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the board said the probable cause of the crash was
an explosion of those flammable vapors from a short circuit in the
aging wiring on the 25-year-old jumbo jet, though the exact
ignition source could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, in closing remarks after the board
adopted the staff's 25 findings and four recommendations to the
Federal Aviation Administration, said the accident has its roots in
decisions made years earlier by Boeing and the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' Hall said, `` ... the 230 men, women
and children on board TWA Flight 800 lost their lives, not as the
result of a bomb or missile or some other nefarious act, but as the
result of a tragic accident _ an accident triggered by an ill-fated
sequence of events in the center wing tank of an aging aircraft
that was set in motion years before by the manufacturer's and the
FAA's design and certification philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion is controversial. Many people still believe a
missile shot down the plane. The board went to great lengths at the
two-day meeting to lay out what it said was overwhelming evidence
Flight 800 was not brought down by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the likely cause of the explosion was a short circuit
outside the center fuel tank that allowed explosive voltage to
enter the tank through electrical wiring associated with the fuel
quantity indication system, the board ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Breistroff from Paris, whose son Michel, 24, had been
about to join the French Olympic hockey team, he is not convinced
the plane was brought down by a mechanical problem. He said he had
lingering doubts about a missile or some other nonmechanical means.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been explaining to me but inside my head I don't
fully believe what they are saying. I wish I could be convinced so
I could be free,'' said Breistroff, one of about 70 family members
of crash victims who attended Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The plane exploded about 11 minutes after take off from Kennedy
the evening of July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife, Pam, a former TWA
flight attendant, and his two young daughters, Shannon and Katie,
found little comfort at the hearing and the board's conclusion
about the likely cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presentation by the NTSB has been excellent but there have
been no surprises,'' he was quoted as saying in an Associated Press
story. ``The center fuel tank blew up and killed my family and the
loved ones of the other family members. That is not supposed to
happen, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it might not have happened had Boeing and the aviation
industry focused not only on possible fuel tank ignition sources,
but the potential for fuel vapors to explode, said Bernard Loeb,
the safety board's longtime director of its office of aviation
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident would not have occurred, but for the flammable
vapor in the center wing tank,'' he said. ``We believe that perhaps
the most valuable lesson that can be learned from this accident _
and our best hope for preventing similar accidents in the future _
lies in recognizing this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hinderberger, director of airplane safety for Boeing who
attended the meeting with two other Boeing commercial airplane
executives, said he did not disagree with the board's findings of
probable cause, though he believes the industry's fuel tank design
philosophy has proved sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel as we have stated from the beginning that the most
appropriate way to ensure fuel tank safety is to eliminate all
possible ignition sources,'' he told reporters after the board
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have also said an additional level of protection can be
obtained by reducing the exposure to flammable fuel vapors. So
seeing a probable cause or finding or recommendation that goes
along the lines of eliminating ignition sources and reducing
flammable fuel vapors would appear to me to be consistent with our
submission (Boeing's report to the safety board) and our stance all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Boeing's planes other than the 717, formerly the
McDonnell Douglas MD-95, have air conditioning units, known as
packs, located directly below the center wing tank.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas jets have air conditioning units in the front
or rear of the plane. Airbus jets have air conditioning packs under
the center wing tank, but the design incorporates a ventilation
system that cools the heated air given off by the units as the
plane climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Boeing design, Hinderberger said, ``I hate to
stand here in front of you after all the hard work that has been
done over the last four years and wind the clock back 30 years and
say a mistake was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all learned a lot in last four years that was outlined
over the last two days and we all have opportunities to move
forward in fuel system safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is looking at tank ventilation as well as a ground-based
system that would pump inert gas into the fuel tanks, which would
greatly lessen the chance the fuel vapors could become flammable.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of 11 recommendations previously made by the board
to the FAA based on early information from the TWA crash
investigation. Only one of those recommendations remains classified
as open, the board said Wednesday. That is a recommendation to
require temperature probes in the fuel tanks so pilots can monitor
the temperature of the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says that would not be necessary if the ground inerting
system proves workable, or if the center wing tanks can be cooled
by direct ventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Wednesday's board meeting focused on wiring problems
found on airplanes, including the TWA jet, and the board's four new
recommendations to the FAA reflected its concern about wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The board called on the federal agency to review aircraft wiring
systems on all U.S. certified aircraft and determine which ones are
critical to safety and then require whatever safety revisions are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA and the aviation industry have launched aging-aircraft
programs to better understand the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swaim of the board's aviation engineering division
presented an alarming report at Wednesday's meeting on problems
found with wiring recovered from the TWA jet. That included exposed
wiring where the insulation was broken or worn away, which can
result in a short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators then looked at wiring on more than a half dozen
other jets and found similar problems, especially on older planes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swaim said investigators found a number of foreign objects in
the wiring of the jets inspected. The objects included a dinner
knife that likely slipped through a gap in the passenger cabin
wall. Objects also inclued screwdrivers and coat hangers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found metal drill shavings in both old and
new planes, he said. These shavings can cut through a wire and
cause a short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Shavings were even found on the fuel quantity indicator in the
fuel tank of a new 747-400 that had not yet been delivered, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall asked Dr. Vernon Ellingstad, director of science labs at
the board, to look at aircraft accidents over the past 20 years to
determine if there is any correlation between the accidents and
older airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman said he wanted to know if there is any ``safety
benefit'' to providing the public with information about the age of
the planes on which they fly. He asked for the report by Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen that the industry is paying the type of
attention it needs to pay to older aircraft,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   John Goglia, one of the board's five members, complained there
is no system in place for reporting airplane wiring problems.
</P>
<P>
   Before he joined the board, Goglia spent about 30 years as an
airline mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia's voice was choked with emotion as he told the audience
of bringing other mechanics to view a 93-foot section of the TWA
jet that was reconstructed in a hangar from the hundreds of
thousands of pieces of wreckage pulled from the bottom of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing remarks, Hall recalled the 1963 crash of a Boeing
707 in a Maryland cornfield. The fuel tank on the jet exploded
after the plane was struck by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently came across the following quotation: `It is
recommended that every effort be expended to arrive at a practical
means by which flammable air/vapor mixtures are eliminated from
fuel tanks.' This was presented to the FAA by our predecessor
agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board, on December 17, 1963,
following the crash of Pan American Flight 214 near Elkton,
Maryland,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 40 years later, it is imperative that at long last, the
aviation community move with dispatch to remove flammable fuel/air
mixtures from the fuel tanks of transport category aircraft.''
