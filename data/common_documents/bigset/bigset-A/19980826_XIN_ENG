<HEADLINE> Jiang Instructs Troops on Fighting New Flood Crest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- State President and Chairman of
the Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin has urged
flood-fighting troops and civilians to be highly vigilant and
fully prepared for combating the upcoming new flood crest, the
seventh of the year, on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also General Secretary of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, gave a do-or-die order for the troops to
safeguard the dikes, mainly in the Honghu Lake area, in central
China's Hubei Province, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin made the instruction on Tuesday in a phone-call to
General Zhang Wannian, Vice Chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
It is reported to be the latest instruction by the top Chinese
leader on the ongoing anti-flood efforts in the Yangtze River
Basin.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Balks at Early Chernomyrdin Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Russia's three major
opposition parties said Tuesday they will not meet with acting
premier Viktor Chernomyrdin before two key documents are drafted.
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in such a meeting until the trilateral
commission drafts a concept of Russia's economic development,
changing the political course, and a joint political statement on
the branches of power," said Nilolai Ryzhkov, leader of the
People's Power group in the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov told the Interfax news agency that Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov also did not plan to meet Chernomyrdin, who was
reinstated by President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday after the abrupt
dismissal of the Sergei Kiriyenko's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin has agreed to the composition of a broadly based
"government of accord" that would include representatives of
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
However, Ryzhkov said it would make no sense to discuss the
composition of the cabinet, in particular the participation of
leftist opposition members in the government, until the two
documents were drafted by a tripartite commission grouping the two
houses of the parliament and the government.
</P>
<P>
Work on the first document, an outline of measures to address
the current economic crisis, had already started, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The second one, which the opposition parties attach more
importance to, will be like an agreement between the executive
and the legislature, under which the president would pledge not
to meddle in the government's work and the prime minister would
have a freehand in naming ministers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ryzhkov said, when the two documents were ready,
Chernomyrdin should meet with the leaders of three parliamentary
groups -- the Communists, the People's Power, and the Agrarians --
at the same time rather than separately.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed doubt that Yeltsin would sign the
second document under which the new Cabinet would take over some
presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
If the president does not sign, he said, confirmation of
Chernomyrdin's nomination for prime minister by the Duma will be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Communist deputy Viktor Ilyukhin
said Tuesday that at least 10 ministerial posts should be
allocated to the united left opposition, which includes the
Communists, People's Power and the Agrarians.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they would block Chernomyrdin's nomination even
under the threat having the assembly dissolved, Ilyukhin said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the nomination is rejected
three times by the Duma, the president would have to either name a
new prime minister or dissolve the Duma.

<HEADLINE> Blair Recalls Parliament Over Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced an early recall of Parliament on Tuesday in Northern
Irish town Omagh to strengthen the law against terrorist bombers
and gunners in the wake of last week's bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who flew into Omagh directly from France at the end of
his Summer holidays, outlined a number of measures aimed at
defeating the terrorists who were responsible for the Omagh blast
that claimed 28 lives and injured more than 200 people 10 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
House of Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd has agreed to Blair's
formal request for a recall, and visited the Commons on Tuesday
morning with officials to inspect construction work being carried
out during the Summer recess.
</P>
<P>
It will be only the fourteenth time since World War Two that
members of parliament have been brought back for an emergency
session.
</P>
<P>
The decision of recall would allow MPs to rush through new laws
intended to make it easier for police to catch the Omagh bombers.
</P>
<P>
It appears virtually certain the House of Commons and the House
of Lords will now reconvene on Wednesday and Thursday next week.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's parliament has already confirmed they will meet over
the same days next week as the UK parliament is expected to be
recalled.

<HEADLINE> Three Big Russian Banks Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia's three large banks --
Uneximbank, Most Bank and MENATEP -- announced a merger on
Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The banks will initially form a bank holding, contributing 51
percent of the shares, each of them controlling one-third of the
holding stock, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The holding will be headed by Chairman of the Uneximbank
management, Mikhail Prokhorov.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the holding's board of directors will be
appointed on a coordinated proposal of MENATEP and Most Bank.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors will consist of nine members -- three
representatives from each bank .
</P>
<P>
The banks will ask leading Western investment banks and audit
companies for consultations about the merger and the best
structure of the new company.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three banks are confident that the unified
financial basis and the adherence to high international standards
will restore the confidence of depositors and investors in the
holding.
</P>
<P>
They believe "their merging move will result in the formation
of a Russian leading financial organization to be a model of
international standards in Russia."
</P>
<P>
Uneximbank is Russia's third bank and specializes in work with
corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
Most Bank is an institution which leads in the market of retail
services, while MENATEP successfully works with both corporate
and individual clients.
</P>
<P>
The merger will result in the formation of the largest joint
stock bank in Russia, to be competitive in work with corporate and
individual clients at the highest international standards.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Tamil rebel suspects shot at and
wounded an army officer in Colombo Tuesday evening, the official
radio here reported in its evening news program.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at the traffic light junction of the

<P>
Captain Wickramaratne of the artillery regiment was wounded in
his face, neck and chest.
</P>
<P>
One suspect was arrested by police Tuesday night, the radio
said.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientist Receives First Chip Implant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A silicon computer chip has been
successfully implanted into the upper arm of Kevin Warwick, a
British scientist from the University of Reading.
</P>
<P>
The experiment, believed to be the first of its kind worldwide,
means a computer can keep track of the device and its carrier, the
BBC said Tuesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
A digital reader can pick up a unique code for the device, a
glass capsule about 23 millimeters long and 3 millimeters wide
containing an electromagnetic coil and a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
The device, inserted into Professor Kevin Warwick's arm Monday
and to be removed after a week, carries 64 pieces of information.
</P>
<P>
Sensors can be set up to pinpoint Warwick's location and even
switch on lights automatically when he enters a room on campus.
</P>
<P>
It could also be used to carry personal information such as
bank details or credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
However, Warwick said that the real reason of the experiment
was to highlight some of the dangers of this kind of technology.
</P>
<P>
Warwick said that if the technology became widespread people
would never enjoy any privacy and could be followed and identified
wherever they went.

<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
arrived in the Northern Irish town Omagh Tuesday afternoon to
inspect the site of last week's bomb blast which claimed 28 lives.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who flew directly from France at the end of Summer
holidays, held talks with civic leaders and medical staff who
treated the victims, according to BBC report from Omagh.
</P>
<P>
While in Omagh, 80 km west of the provincial capital Belfast,
Blair is expected to announce an early recall of parliament to
strengthen the law against bombers and gunners in the wake of the
bombing attack which also injured more than 200 people in a
shopping center.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, a splinter guerrilla group of the Irish
Republican Army, has claimed responsibility for the blast, the
deadliest atrocity in 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The decision of recall would allow MPs to rush through new laws
intended to make it easier for police to catch the Omagh bombers.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Speaker Underlines Tranquillity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq Nouri Tuesday stressed that the issue of
Nagorno-Karabakh should be settled through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan
Oskanyan, Nouri said animosity or war is not a favorable way to
solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed enclave located inside Muslim
Azerbaijan but populated mainly by Christian Armenians.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said tranquillity in the region is in the interests of
all nations while disputes and conflicts block progress and
development of regional countries.
</P>
<P>
He called for all-out expansion of Iran-Armenia relations in
view of the existence of high potential in both countries,
expressing the hope that heads of Iran-Armenia joint economic
commissions would try to implement the reached agreements between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted Nouri as expressing
satisfaction with favorable political and commercial relations
between Tehran and Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
Terming as "significant" the role of the Iranian and Armenian
parliaments, Nouri said that promotion of parliamentary
cooperation would undoubtedly play a key role in broadening
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he said, the Iranian Parliament has always tried
to prepare the legal and judicial ground for upgrading of
bilateral ties by verifying the concluded agreements.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Oskanyan said the Armenians like to solve the
Karabakh issue through negotiations because conflicts in the
region would hamper economic progress of regional countries.
</P>
<P>
He also described as "positive" the political and economic
relations between Tehran and Yerevan and said that his country is
interested in expanding political and economic ties with Iran at
bilateral and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that his talks with Iranian officials
would bear favorable outcome in helping the two countries take
important steps towards realizing their common goals.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests to U.N. Over Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Tuesday
made strong representations to the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP) over the incident that Turkish forces opened fire
at two Greek Cypriot fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said at his daily
press briefing that in such circumstances, "there will be strong
protests to UNFICYP and relevant bodies abroad regarding the
violation of specific rules of international law."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government is investigating the incident, he added.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which was confirmed by UNFICYP spokesman
Waldemar Rokoszweski, occurred in the early hours Tuesday when
four Greek Cypriot fishermen were out at sea to collect their
fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
The nets were placed far off the buoys the Turkish forces
placed at sea to mark an area under their control.
</P>
<P>
The four fishermen, all from the island's eastern town of
Paralimni, noticed the Turkish patrol boat as they were gathering
their nets.
</P>
<P>
Three Turkish soldiers fired shots indiscriminately against the
four men. One of the boats was hit by eight bullets, but nobody
was reportedly hurt in the incident. Then the Turkish boat sped
away.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said that police and the
National Guard are also investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained around 35,000-strong forces in
the northern side of the island, claiming to protect the Turkish
Cypriot minorities, who unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only
by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong UNFICYP was deployed in 1964, four years after
Cyprus gained independence from Britain, when inter-communal
clashes broke out between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Committed to Civilian Rule: Abubakar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Nigerian leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar said Tuesday his country was
committed to returning to civilian rule and he would not stand
for next year's election.
</P>
<P>
After a visit to Robben Island off Cape Town, where South
African President Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison,
Abubakar said so far as he knew, all political prisoners in his
country had been released, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he intended to stand in the polls scheduled for
February 27 next year, he replied: "Certainly not."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Abubakar addressed the South African
National Assembly and met Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament that the program to return Nigeria to
civilian and democratic rule would be successfully completed by
May 29 next year.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Nigerians want a country where fairness,
justice and equity are not mere slogans, but principles put into
timely and indiscriminate practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his parliament address, Abubakar said South Africa and
Nigeria needed to build relations that would contribute to
Africa's redemption, and that a challenge facing them was to
encourage strategic engagement and halt conflict on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"It demands that we foster conditions that would prevent the
incidence of debilitating conflicts on our continent, to enable
the countries of the region to remain focused on the urgent task
of socio-economic development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian head of state said South Africa and Nigeria
should support the Organization of African Unity's conflict
prevention mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar encountered a small group of protesters when his
convoy arrived at parliament.

<HEADLINE> New Dutch Cabinet Announces Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The second coalition government
of the Netherlands announced on Tuesday its policy during a
special session at the lower house of the Dutch parliament.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis was given to tax reform, employment and environment,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch lawmakers immediately started a debate on the 36-page
policy document read out to them by Prime Minister Wim Kok, who is
serving a second term of four years.
</P>
<P>
The coalition cabinet, made up of the Labor Party, the People's
Party for Freedom and Democracy and the Democrats 66, won the
general election on May 6 by taking 97 of the 150 seats in the
lower house.
</P>
<P>
The new government was determined to tackle an ambitious
tax-reform program that aims to lower income taxes and raise
indirect taxes in a bid to reduce the financial burden on
employment and boost job creation.
</P>
<P>
Kok's cabinet promised to provide during its four-year tenure
60,000 additional long-term jobs, 20,000 more than originally
pledged.
</P>
<P>
Employment centers will be set up throughout the country to
help job seekers.
</P>
<P>
Kok promised legislators that the country's tax system would be
radically modernized and adapted to suit changed social attitudes
and new requirements.
</P>
<P>
"The government intends to overhaul the tax system so that
employment receives a forceful boost and the economic structure is
reinforced further," said the prime miniter.
</P>
<P>
The new government sworn in earlier this month believed that
environmental technologies could further improve the international
competitiveness of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Netherlands can play an exemplary international role,"
said Kok whose cabinet promised to help central and eastern
European countries in environmental protection and improvement
during the process of their accession to the European Union.

The United States last week launched cruise missiles against
the El Shifa pharmaceutical factory, alleging it produced
components for chemical weapons. The United States has accused
Iraq of helping Sudan to produce chemical products.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 28 people were
killed and many others injured in three bus explosions in Uganda
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Third Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Disaster
and Preparedness and Refugees Paul Etiang strongly condemned the
incident, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Two explosions are reported to have occurred on the highway
linking Kampala and the southwestern district of Mbarara.

on the minibus and four people on the bus. Both vehicles caught
fire after the accident, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The second bus explosion occurred at a place called Nyakahita
on the same route, killing one woman and injuring six others.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Welcome Any Israel-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Information
Nasir Judeh said Tuesday that his country will welcome any
agreement between the palestinians and Israel so long as it is
constructive.
</P>
<P>
He was making response at a press conference here to Monday's
media reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began
to consider accepting a peace proposal put forward by the United
States that calls for Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank in the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
As there are some other reports that denied Netanyahu's
consideration, the Jordanian government at present could only
express its general welcome to "any agreement" between the two
sides, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government wants to be sure about this issue
before jumping to any conclusion, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. made its proposal months ago. The Palestinian National
Authority accepted it, but Israel rejected it on security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been keeping a close watch on the developments of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Jordan supports the
Palestinians to establish an independent state with its capital in
Jerusalem, while it pursues normalization of ties with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is now Israel's closest ally in the Arab world. It is
one of the two Arab countries that have reached peace treaty with
Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Begins Partial Staff Relocation in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has authorized "the partial relocation of so-called
non-essential U.N. personnel" from Tajikistan to Tashkent, capital
of neighboring Uzbekstan, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The temporary relocation is precautionary," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The relocation began on Monday, which affected internationally
recruited workers, including 33 military observers from the U.N.
Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT), he said, adding that
the other 38 military observers will remain in Dushanbe, capital
of Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The new U.N. move came after four of its workers were killed in
a July 20 ambush, which Annan said in a mid-August report has led
UNMOT operations in the country to "a major setback."
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's partial relocation, about 70 U.N. observers
were stationed to monitor a peace deal reached last year that
ended five years of civil war in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive as there
are sporadic clashes between the warring parties in the country.

Speaking to reporters, Hamdoon said Iraq has had

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on West to Stop Rebels' Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday called on the
U.S. and the European countries to take measures to stop the
activities of the Iranian outlawed Mujahedeen Khalq Organization
(MKO) within their borders.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the call after
the MKO claimed Sunday responsibility for the killing of former
head of Iran's Prisons Organization Assadollah Lajevardi, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, two men shot Lajevardi, his brother and an
elderly man in the prosecutor's office at Tehran's grand bazaar.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Tehran regrets that the U.S. and some of the
European states have allowed the MKO to set up representative
offices, raise funds to finance terrorist operations and launch
political activities under different names in their countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said the "conciliatory treatment" has encouraged the
group to venture into conducting terrorist acts with no fear of
punitive measures from these countries against them.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Tehran expects the U.S. and the European
countries to show their goodwill and seriousness in campaign
against terrorism by stopping the MKO from capitalizing on
loopholes in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran welcomes any cooperation with Europe and the
U.S. in fighting terrorism, adding that cooperation will be
possible when these countries display their seriousness in dealing
with the outlawed MKO and their terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was founded in 1965, with about 20,000 to 50,000
members. It was one of the main forces against the former Iranian
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi before the Islamic Revolution in 1979,
but was outlawed in 1980 after it had some differences with the
ruling Mula government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO has frequently launched attacks inside Iran, in the
border areas, or even on Iranian diplomatic mission abroad.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Parties Bargain for Posts as Ruble Dives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia's key parties were vying
for more posts in a coalition government as the country's
financial scenario worsened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The national currency fell an alarming 10 percent in a single
day to 7.84 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin spent his second day
in office trying to rally support for what he called a "government
of accord", but major opposition parties were pressing for key
documents that would lessen the president's power and strengthen
the parliament's hand in future running of the country.
</P>
<P>
The leaders insisted that they would not meet with Chernomyrdin
before the documents were drafted.
</P>
<P>
Work on the first document, an outline of measures to address
the current economic crisis, has already started Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The second one, to which the opposition parties attach more
importance, will be something like an agreement between the
executive and the legislature, under which the president would
pledge not to interfere in the government's work and give the
prime minister a freehand in appointing ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is unanimous in the opinion that a formula banning
the president from dismissing the cabinet or changing its
composition without parliamentary approval should be worked," said
Oleg Morozov, head of the commission in charge of drafting the
second document.
</P>
<P>
As Chernomyrdin scrambled to put together a government, the
country's national currency continued spiraling down.
</P>
<P>
The ruble slumped to 8.7-9 against the dollar in trading on the
electronic lot on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX),
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In regular MICEX trading Tuesday, the ruble's exchange rate
dropped an alarming 10 percent, to 7.86 rubles against the U.S.
dollar, the steepest daily drop since October 11, 1994, the
so-called Black Tuesday, when the dollar moved up 27.43 percent,
from 3,081 old rubles to 3,926 old rubles.
</P>
<P>
However, Chernomyrdin appeared optimistic when meeting Duma
deputies of the Our Home is Russia faction and the Russian
Region's group.
</P>
<P>
"Not everything has been lost. There are still measures to be
taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Already, the parties were talking about numbers of posts in the
new government.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Shokhin, leader of the Our Home is Russia faction in
the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, said the faction
"has no less than two dozens of high-class specialists capable to
join the government".
</P>
<P>
Shokhin, a deputy speaker of the Duma, said five to seven was
"the minimum necessary number of key posts to enable us speaking
of an influence on the governmental decisions."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Communist deputy Viktor Ilyukhin said that at least
10 ministerial posts should be allocated to the united left
opposition, which includes the Communists, the People's Power and
the Agrarians.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they would block Chernomyrdin's nomination even
under the threat of being dissolved, Ilyukhin said.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian constitution, if the nomination is rejected three
times by the Duma, the president would have to either name a new
prime minister or dissolve the Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party and the Our Home is Russia movement are the
two largest factions in the 445-member State Duma, with 133 and 67
seats respectively.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Proposes U.S.-Jordan Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Thursday proposed a dialog
between the United States and Sudan to settle their disputes over
the recent U.S. missile attack against a plant in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Information Nasir Judeh announced the
idea at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that Jordan rejected all forms of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Judeh made the remarks when the U.S. missile attack on Thursday
has incurred strong criticism all over the world, particularly in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. alleged that the sites it attacked in Sudan along with
Afghanistan with missiles were terrorist-related. The attacks were
a retaliation against the terrorist explosions of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said that what was attacked was only a pharmaceutical
plant only producing medicines, not chemical weapons agents as
alleged by the U.S.. Sudan has decided to invite the world media
to visit the site in order to make the truth known by all.
</P>
<P>
Jordan maintains good relations with both Sudan and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. declared Jordan as its' third para-allied
country in the Middle East after Israel and Egypt. Its economic
and military aid for Jordan reached 225 million U.S. dollars in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Consults with Duma Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin had consultations Tuesday with members of the
State Duma faction Our Home is Russia and the parliamentary group
Russian Regions on ways to overcome the current financial crisis
in the country, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputies shared a viewpoint that for the efficient settlement
of the crisis it is necessary to discuss and confirm the candidacy
of a chairman of the government at a State Duma session as soon as
possible so that a new cabinet of ministers could be formed and
begin to work at the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed that the country needs coordinated
actions of all branches of power, especially the executive and
legislative ones.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that Russia had all prerequisites for
resolving the crisis. He said "not everything has been lost and
there are measures to be taken."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the formation of the new cabinet, Chernomyrdin
noted that this must be a "government of accord" on a broad basis
to which people would be chosen exclusively according to their
practical qualities.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Our Home is Russia faction Alexander Shokhin told
reporters after the consultation that his faction "has no less
than two dozens of high-class specialists, capable to join the
government on various posts of various spheres."
</P>
<P>
According to Shokhin, five-seven people from the faction to key
posts is the critical mass, which would enable Chernomyrdin to
have a point of support in the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is the minimum necessary number of key posts to enable us
speaking of an influence on the governmental decisions," Shokhin
said.
</P>
<P>
The faction suggests abrogating the government decrees on
raising dues to the pension insurance, on the payment of the
value-added tax upon dispatching goods, as well as the
presidential decree on indexing the land tax.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the parliamentary faction Russian Regions Oleg
Morozov said following the meeting with Chernomyrdin that many key
ministers from the former government will not retain their posts
in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In Morozov's opinion, neither former First Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov, who has resigned his office, nor Acting
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev, nor Anatoly Chubais will be in
the new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Morozov said Chernomyrdin's cabinet is unlikely to include "any
of the 'first wave' reformists who shaped the 1992 government."

<HEADLINE> Cuban Americans Indicted on Plot to Kill Castro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven Cuban Americans were
indicted in Puerto Rico on Tuesday for allegedly plotting to
murder Cuban leader Fidel Castro, the U.S. Justice Department
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said the indictment,
returned by a federal grand jury in San Juan, charged the
defendants with participating in a four-year conspiracy to kill
Castro outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
The defendants allegedly plotted to murder Castro when he would
have been outside Cuba, mainly in Isla Margarita, Venezuela, in
November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The defendants face up to life in prison if convicted on the
charges.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were charged with obtaining semi-automatic
rifles, a 46-foot boat, night-vision goggles and other equipment
to assist in the alleged assassination plot.
</P>
<P>
An investigation began in October last year when the U.S. Coast
Guard stopped the 46-foot vessel La Esperanza off Puerto Rico and
found weapons, ammunition and military supplies.
</P>
<P>
One of the four Cuban exiles aboard the boat allegedly blurted
out that the men were on their way to Margarita to assassinate
Castro, who was to participate in a summit meeting in Venezuela.

ADDIS ABABA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Tuesday called on
non-governmental organizations to intensify their role in the
implementation of the country's health policy and strategy.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Lamisso Haiso, Vice-Minister of Health
when he was opening a meeting on health policy here.
</P>
<P>
Lamisso said Ethiopia needs the support of non-governmental

</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Executive-Director of the Christian

health is one of the major focus of his association here since
"Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world where
about half of its population do not have access to health
services."
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has plans to increase its health
services coverage to 55 percent of its population from 40 percent
in its five-year (1996-2000) plan.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Democrat Cautions against Prejudging Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Dick Gephardt, minority
leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tuesday cautioned
against prejudging President Bill Clinton before the House
receives the results of the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's really important for us not be out there saying
he's guilty of... (impeachable offenses) or he's not -- as if we
know," he told The Associated Press in an interview in Scranton,
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt made the comment as he began a three-day campaign
swing through competitive congressional districts. Democrats are
hoping to take back the House from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"It was wrong," Gephardt said of Clinton's relationship with
the former White House intern. "It was reprehensible."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of impeachment or a lesser action
by Congress, such as censure, Gephardt said any judgment would
have to wait until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr submits his
report to Congress and lawmakers are able to carefully review it.
"I really think the subject of punishment is premature and putting
the cart before the horse," Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
Impeachment hearings might not be called for, according to
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, unless Starr submits evidence that
Clinton committed crimes, such as perjury or obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt said "It's important that we not jump to conclusions,
that we not prejudge, and we not announce our conclusions before
we get a report from Starr," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes U.K.-U.S. Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) said Tuesday
that it welcomes the proposal by London and Washington over the
trial of two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing case.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the British-American response and I have informed
Omar el-Montasser, Libya's foreign minister, of the new
development," a beaming AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid
told a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
British and U.S. officials announced on Monday their proposal
to set up a Scottish court in the Hague to try two Libyans accused
of blowing up a U.S. airline over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid was handed a message on
that decision from British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook through
British Ambassador in Cairo David Blatherwick, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is in line with the one set forth by the AL, the
Organization of African Unity, the Organization of Islamic
Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement, on the trial of the two
Libyan suspects in a third and neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid said more consultation is needed among the
Cairo-based AL, Libya and the United Nations secretary general on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief acknowledged that the families of the Lockerbie
victims played an important role in bringing about the positive
development.
</P>
<P>
He received in Cairo in June a delegation from the relatives of
the victims, who signaled flexibility, voicing willingness to have
the two Libyan suspects tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
"The coming period requires hard work to guarantee a fair trial
for the two Libyan suspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Britain had set a deadline for handing over the
two suspects but adding there must be an end to this long-standing
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"All details pertaining to implementing the decision must be
discussed by the parties concerned in good will while certain
measures need also be undertaken by the Netherlands, Britain and
the U.S.," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday that
Libya should take or leave the proposal made by both Britain and
the U.S.. London and Washington stand firm against negotiations on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed a tough embargo on Libya in 1992 for
its failure to extradite the two nationals suspected of
involvement in Lockerbie bombing, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has refused to hand them over to be tried in the U.S. or
Britain, saying this will compromise their chance for a fair trial.

with the MKO members Monday afternoon in Abadan in Khuzestan
province when the militants infiltrated in from Iraq, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was one of the main forces which fought against and
eventually toppled the former U.S.-backed Shah regime in 1979, but
it was outlawed in 1981 following a series of sharp differences
with the then Mula government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO fled to Iraq later and set up several military bases
there. Militants of the MKO have frequently launched attacks
inside Iran, in Iranian-Iraqi border areas, or even on Iranian
diplomatic mission abroad.
</P>
<P>
The MKO has claimed responsibility for the killing of former
head of the Prisons Organization Assadollah Lajevardi, his brother
and a passerby at Tehran's grand bazaar Sunday morning.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief Vows to Defend Secular System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi reiterated on Tuesday that Turkish army will
always be a force to defend the republic's secular system.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi, who will officially retire on August 30, made the
remark during a farewell visit to the Defense Ministry, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi said that the Turkish armed forces is determined to
continue the struggle against the fundamentalist activities and
is the guard of Turkey's democracy and secularism.
</P>
<P>
The commanders may change but the path will remain the same, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi has taken a hard line on all sorts of religious
radicals and is well-known for his tough attitude towards the
closed pro-Islamic Welfare Party led by Necmettin Erbakan, the
ex-prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Erbakan-headed coalition was forced to step down in June
last year and the Welfare Party was closed under strong pressure
from the secular military led by Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
This decision led to criticism from some parliamentarians who
accused the military of interfering in party politics.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Land Forces Huseyin Kiyrikoghu, who is to succeed
Karadayi as new chief of general staff, has also made it clear
that he will follow the same policy in fighting fundamentalism as
Karadayi did.
</P>
<P>
However, some moderate politicians hold that the military
should not go too far on the issue of anti-fundamentalism, saying
that extreme measures might widen gap between liberal and
conservative groups.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Syria's Proposal Over Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey rejected a Syrian
proposal Tuesday to resume the meeting of the tripartite technical
committee on sharing river water late this year, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with Turkish Foreign Ministry, whose name was
not given, confirmed that Turkey had received such a proposal, but
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to revive the (water committee) process. This
does not appear to be possible in the near future. First, Syria
should take steps on a number of disputed issues, including
terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite committee was established in 1980 in a bid to
solve the long-standing dispute over the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, which originate in Turkey and flow down to Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under a protocol signed between Ankara and Damascus in 1987,
Turkey releases at least 500 cubic meters of Euphrates water per
second to Syria prior to the completion of Turkey's Ataturk Dam
over the river.
</P>
<P>
The protocol also stipulated that the two countries should
hammer out a new agreement on a higher Syrian share once the dam
was completed.
</P>
<P>
The dam was erected in 1991, but no new agreement has been
worked out because of their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) militants, who have been fighting
since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Damascus have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syria and Iraq have been lobbying the Arab world to
pressure Turkey to release more water to them.
</P>
<P>
But Ankara has insisted that the water dispute should be
discussed only after the Syrian government halts its support to
the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The committee held its last meeting in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Launch Export Processing Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's first export processing
zone (EPZ) in Calabar, Cross River State in the southeast will be
inaugurated soon, an official source said in Abuja Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Ndanusa, managing director of the Nigeria Export
Process Zone Authority (NEPZA) told the official News Agency of
Nigeria that 95 percent of the work on the site had been
completed, while 13 of the over 80 manufacturers expected were
already on the ground.
</P>
<P>
He said the NEPZA had written to the Head of State, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar, requesting a date for the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
"It will definitely be this year, in fact very, very soon," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ndanusa, the permanent secretary to the Ministry
of Commerce and Tourism, Adamu Fika has recently inspected the
EPZ and expressed satisfaction over what was on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Calabar EPZ was established according to a decree in 1992.
It was estimated that the construction of road, electricity and
other infrastructure facilities had gulped about 600 million U.S.
Dollars in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
While the official inauguration of the EPZ has been delayed
time and again, it was reported earlier that many facilities in
the EPZ were now decaying quickly, with some of the plant roofs
blown away in rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
An official of the EPZ was quoted as saying that investors had
dumped their factories because of the unfavorable political
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ndanusa admitted that "unstable political atmosphere" had
delayed the take-off of the EPZ in the last few years, but said
"things have taken shape with the current stability in the polity
under the leadership of General Abubakar".
</P>
<P>
He said NEPZA officials had been holding meetings with
prospective investors from Japan, America and Europe, which he
described as "very fruitful."
</P>
<P>
He identified some of the untapped raw materials in the
country such as wood, palm oil, groundnuts, among others, saying
that the Nigeria Export-Import Bank was supporting local
developers to attain large scale production.

<HEADLINE> UK Govt to Toughen up Anti-Terrorism laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Tuesday Parliament would be recalled next week to
strengthen laws to defeat terrorists in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair announced the plan on a visit to Omagh, the Northern
Ireland town where a bomb explosion 10 days ago killed 28 people
and injured 220.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament Speaker has agreed to the emergency recall and
the Parliament will consider the new measures next Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the proposed legislation would make it possible to
convict someone of belonging to a banned Northern Ireland
organization on the word of a senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
The plans also include a tightening of laws convicting people
for membership of a proscribed organization.
</P>
<P>
A suspect's refusal to answer questions posed by the police
could be taken as a sign of guilt.
</P>
<P>
Blair insisted the measures outlined were "draconian and
fundamental."
</P>
<P>
"This is a timely and right move to underscore our total
commitment to defeating terrorism wherever it is plotted or
executed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister planned to travel to Belfast later in the
day with the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties
and will travel to County Mayo in the Irish Republic on Wednesday
for further consultations with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Under existing laws for fighting guerrilla violence in Northern
Ireland, police have the power to stop and search on suspicion and
special courts can try suspects without a jury.
</P>
<P>
Police throughout Britain have specific powers of arrest if
they have grounds to suspect someone of being involved in
terrorism and a suspect can be held for up to a week without being
charged.

<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA), the biggest
airline in Europe, will buy 59 Airbus A320 aircraft and has
options to buy a further 129 in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that BA has ordered planes from the
European consortium rather than its traditional supplier, American
plane-maker Boeing. The deal is part of BA's largest ever order of
planes, comprising 220 aircraft - the majority of them Airbus.
</P>
<P>
The order is considered to safeguard jobs across Europe, as
parts of the Airbus planes are assembled in Britain, Germany,
France and Spain.
</P>
<P>
However, the deal represents a blow for Boeing, the arch-rival
of Airbus. BA's current fleet is mainly made up of aircraft made
by Boeing. Out of a fleet of 256 airliners, it includes 212
Boeings of various types.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year BA said that it was calling on both Boeing
and Airbus to put forward proposals to supply short-haul jets.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Tuesday that the
country is continuing its leadership role in the global movement
to eliminate anti-personnel (AP) mines with the creation of a
Centre for Mine-Action Technologies.
</P>
<P>
The Centre will be established at the Defense Research
Establishment in Suffield, the west of Canada, through a
commitment of 17 million Canadian dollars (11 million U.S.
dollars) over five years from Canada's 100-million-Canadian-dollar
Landmines Fund announced last December at the international
signing conference for the Ottawa Convention.
</P>
<P>
The sum of 17 million Canadian dollars will be invested in
technology research to make humanitarian mine-clearance faster,
safer and more effective, and to investigate alternatives to
anti-personnel mines, according to a release issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Potential projects may include the development of AP mine
neutralization equipment and protective equipment for demining
personnel and vehicles, as well as work on a range of victim
assistance technologies, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Overall Egyptian exports to the U.S. market in the
past six months stood at 333.7 million U.S. dollars, up by 15.2
percent compared to that of the same period last year, Egyptian
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmad Gowaili said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil exports amounted to 90.6 percent of the total exports,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit went down by 29 percent as a result of the
increase in exports and the decease of imports by 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili attributed the increase of export to successful
marketing of Egyptian products in the U.S. and incentives and
encouragements offered to exporters to the American market by the
ministry, as well as the diversification in exported goods.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he cited an increase of 144 percent in exports of
finished iron and steel products, 53 percent in carpets and rugs,
82 percent in handicraft and other manual products, 300 percent in
glassware products, and 82 percent in cotton textiles.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Cairo Chamber of Commerce said the production of the
private sector accounted for 90 percent of the 850,000 tonnes of
ceramic tiles produced in Egypt in 1997, the Middle East Times
newspaper reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The increase in production since 1991 is causing a serious glut
in the market. Prices dropped to between 17 Egyptian pounds (5
U.S. dollars) and 35 pounds (10.3 dollars) per square meter, said
the English weekly.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Sales of air conditioners, fans and water coolers
leapt during the unusually long heat wave in this summer, the
Middle East Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates put sales figures for the 5-week-long
heat wave at 970 million Egyptian pounds (285.3 million
U.S. dollars), compared to 200 million pounds (58.8 million
dollars) for the 1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, water cooler sales shot up by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The air conditioner maintenance bill for the period was 25
million pounds (7.35 million dollars), while fan maintenance work
for 20 million pounds (5.88 million dollars) was done.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Contrary to the official assessment, economic experts
were quoted Tuesday as saying that the Russian financial turmoil
will have considerably adverse impact on the thriving
Turkish-Russian trade.
</P>
<P>
As result of the shrinking domestic consumer demand in Russia
due to the crisis, Turkey's export losses are expected to reach
700 million U.S. dollars by the end of this year, the Daily News
newspaper quoted these experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The experts also pointed out that Turkey' overseas borrowings
would increase due to the decline of the Turkish-Russian bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that the annual trading volume
between Turkey and Russia now stands at 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkish business circles and financial markets were rattled by
Russia's announcement on August 17 that it would sharply devalue
its currency ruble, halt payment on government treasury bonds
and impose a 90-day moratorium on payment of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish State Minister for economic affairs Gunes
Taner last week brushed aside the worry about the negative impact
of the Russia crisis on the Turkish-Russian booming trade.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peace in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday called on Angola's rebel UNITA movement to stop its
"delaying tactics" and cooperate with the Government for a
political solution in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in an oral statement to the press here
by the president of the 15-member Security Council, Danilo Turk of
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council demand that UNITA stop
its delaying tactics and fulfill its commitments under the Lusaka
Protocol," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also called on the Angolan Government and
UNITA to take advantage of the reaffirmed interest on the part of
the international community to assist in the rebuilding of the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expresses grave concern over the situation
in Angola due to the lack of progress in peaceful settlement and
outbreaks of renewed fighting in the African nation, he said,
adding that "the primary responsibility for this state of affairs
lies with UNITA."
</P>
<P>
Turk said, "The members of the Security Council no longer find
it acceptable further setbacks or procrastination in the peace
process under any pretext."
</P>
<P>
But the president voiced a strong belief that "the desired
peace and national reconciliation can be achieved only by
political means."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also appealed to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, currently in Africa, for his personal engagement in the
four-year-old Angolan peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president's oral statement came after the Security Council
was briefed Tuesday morning on the situation of Angola by Lakhdar
Brahimi, special envoy of the secretary-general in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Turk, in his oral statement, also called on all concerned to
cooperate with the United Nations observer mission in Angola and
to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
UNITA declared on Monday that it would have nothing more to do
with the troika of nations which contributed to the observer
mission in Angola. The three nations, namely Russia, Portugal and
the United States, were accused by UNITA of siding with the
Angolan Government.
</P>
<P>
However, The United Nations Joint Commission on Angola said on
Tuesday in the Angolan capital of Luanda that the African nation's
peace process would go ahead despite the rebel movement's decision
to sever ties with foreign observers.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Continue Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
rallied strongly Tuesday, boosted by a positive opening on Wall
Street, which provided confirmation that a technical rebound has
set in.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 finished just short of its session high, up
100.7 points at 5,654.4 after another late surge. The broader
indices all closed in positive territory, while Liffe's September
footsie contract climbed 88 to 5,678, with fair value estimated at
23 points.
</P>
<P>
However, the last two days' bullish performance, when the FTSE
100 has rallied 177.4 points, was accompanied by disappointing
turnover again. Market volume amounted to a low 655m shares.
</P>
<P>
London-based traders had been waiting for the Wall Street
opening, nervous about whether FTSE gains were sustainable. But
the Dow Jones followed the tone of European stock markets and
posted a strong advance right from the start.
</P>
<P>
Although the bearish global economic backdrop remains, concern
appears to have eased due to a lack of headline news, brokers
said. However, the possibility of a worsening of the Russian
economic crisis, and a spreading of the problems in South America,
remain, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's market surged 2.61 percent with the Dax index
ending the official session up 136.88 at 5,371.76 points, helped
by a strong Wall Street. The Xetra Dax closed at 5,407.03 up
153.65 points.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that for the moment, the market seemed more or
less to have digested worries resulting from the Russian crisis.
But operators warned against any excessive optimism.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices rose sharply, too, gaining 2.33 percent
on the day on the back of a rise on Wall Street overnight and good
economic news at home.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index of leading shares opened at 3,994.28 points,
up 1.44 percent or 56.85 points from Monday's close, and closed at
4,029.32 points. The index had lost 6.25 points Monday to end the
day at 3,937.43.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) Tuesday called on the U.N. Security Council to
discuss the situation in the West Bank city of Hebron, said a PLC
statement.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing of Rabbi Shlomo Ra'anan Thursday night
in Hebron, Israel Defense Forces imposed a curfew around the
Jewish areas of the city and a closure to Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The daily life of the Palestinians has been badly effected due
to the curfew and the closure, which entered the fifth day
Tuesday. The curfew has been lifted for three hours Tuesday to
allow residents to buy food and water.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the PLC also called on the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to declare Hebron a disaster area and
call for urgent international aid.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Israeli measures a violation of the signed
agreement, the PLC called on the co-sponsors of the Middle East
peace process, namely the United States and Russia, to force the
Israeli government to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The PLC regarded the curfew and closure as total vilations of
human rights, therefore it called on the signatory nations of the
Fourth Geneva Convention to intervene in Israel's violation of the
rights of Hebron residents, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
While urging the PNA to reinforce diplomatic efforts to obtain
humanitarian aid for the Palestinian residents in the city, the
PLC also called for the formation of an international committee to
study the sutiation in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The PLC also criticized Israel's decision to build new housing
units in Hebron for Jewish settlers and asked the PNA to raise
this issue before the International Criminal Court because
settlements are a war crime.
</P>
<P>
It also decided to hold its session on Wednesday in Hebron to
show solidarity to the local Palestinian residents.

<HEADLINE> U.S: Soil Samples Link Sudan Factory to VX Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. intelligence said
Tuesday that soil samples from the area of a Sudan pharmaceutical
factory, hit by cruise missiles last week by the U.S. force,
showed traces of an ingredient for making deadly VX gas.
</P>
<P>
"It is a substance that has no commercial applications. It
doesn't occur naturally in the environment. It's not a byproduct
of any other chemical process. The only thing you can use it for,
that we know of, is to make VX," a senior U.S. intelligence
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the chemical found in the soil samples was EMPTA, or
o-ethylmethylphosphonothioic acid.
</P>
<P>
The soil samples were taken clandestinely in the last few
months, the senior official said. He declined to say who took them
but said the United States was confident there was no tampering.
"We know where we got it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese officials, however, dismissed the remarks as lies.
</P>
<P>
"How can we believe that they have taken the soil from here?
They can take it from anywhere in the world and say that this is
the sand taken from the factory in Shifa," said Mohammed al-Hassan
al-Amin, political secretary of Sudan's National Congress.
</P>
<P>
"They still have not produced any concrete evidence," Sudan's
Information Minister Ghazi Salahuddin said.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot prove it by claiming to have contaminated soil,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The El Shifa factory in Khartoum was largely destroyed in the
attack by U.S. cruise missiles with 10 people wounded.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. senior intelligence official also said that the
Sudanese owners of the El Shifa factory had met with Iraqis close
to Iraq's chemical weapons program. And he named one of the Iraqis
as Imad al-Ani, whom he described as a senior official with the
Iraqi company Samarra Drug Industries.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq strongly denied any contact with the Shifa factory
beyond pharmaceutical supplies approved by the U.N. Security
Council's sanctions committee, which monitors goods imported to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is part of the U.S. effort to try to muddle the
whole situation in order to cover up the problem that they have
had with the bombing of Sudan," Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon said in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said that the United Nations approved in January a
contract for the Shifa factory to manufacture a product for export
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was listed in U.N. documents as "Shifzole 2.5 percent
(Albndazole 2.5 percent for Levamisole)." One of the sources said
it was a deworming drug for animals.
</P>
<P>
Sudan made details of the contract public last week in
rejecting Washington's claim that the Shifa factory had produced
ingredients used to manufacture the deadly VX gas.
</P>
<P>
While defending its bombing of the pharmaceutical factory, the
Clinton administration nevertheless conceded that the facility
probably also manufactured medicines.
</P>
<P>
"That facility very well may have been producing
pharmaceuticals," State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"But that in no way alters the fact that the factory also was
producing precursor elements" of nerve gas, he said.

During the 30-minute conversation, President Yeltsin stressed
that a clear decisive strategy for tackling Russia's economic
crisis will be "the top priority of the new Russian government,"
White House spokesman Barry Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
The call, which was the first between the two since Sunday's
shake-up of the Russian government, was placed by Clinton and
lasted about 30 minutes, Toiv told reporters.
</P>
<P>
They touched on Russian dissatisfaction with U.S. attacks on
suspected terrorist sites last week.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about other issues on the agenda for the
summit between Clinton and Yeltsin on September 1-2 in Moscow,
including nuclear proliferation and Iraq's vows of non-compliance
with United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also explained to Yeltsin developments leading up to
last Thursday's cruise missile attack on targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan in retaliation of the embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The president reviewed the events leading up to U.S. actions
last week and the dangerous threat posed by Osama Bin Laden to the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the leaders agreed they would discuss at the summit
Moscow's expressions of unhappiness with the attacks, which
were condemned by Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes "Balanced" Deal Over Israeli Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has urged a balanced and
fair agreement over Israel's redeployment in the West Bank,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was quoted as making the
call after Israel and the Palestinians continued their direct
talks Tuesday in Norwegian capital Oslo over the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's stand on current Israeli proposals vis-a-vis
withdrawal from Palestinian territory hinges on what the
Palestinian Authority accepts or approves," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the settlement to the Israeli
troops pullback from the West Bank, Moussa said Egypt hopes a
"balanced and fair" pact comes.
</P>
<P>
"What counts is that the agreement would take into
consideration the rights and obligations of the two sides in a
balanced way. This is the option supported by Egypt," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the minister also noted that in case such an agreement
proves unattainable, other alternatives have to be considered.
</P>
<P>
"The issue depends on the scope of the Israeli formula and the
extent of the Palestinian acceptance of the gamut of conditions
and other related matters," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel resumed direct talks on July 19
after a lapse of 16 months.
</P>
<P>
There are some signals of icebreaking over the pullback issue
after the two sides finished their latest round of talks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we will come to points that could really make a
breakthrough," said Meir Sheetrit, one of the Israeli negotiators
and a top member of the ruling Likud coalition.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also said new Israeli ideas
submitted in recent days were a "beginning."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to see if there is a possibility of reaching an
agreement," the top Palestinian representative Ahmed Qureia
said.

JERUSALEM -- During a condolence call to the family of a slain
settler in Hebron, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed
Tuesday to build more housing for the settlers in this flashpoint
West Bank city.

late Rabbi Shlomo Ra'anan was previously unannounced.

Ra'anan was stabbed to death by a Palestinian perpetrator at
his home in the Tel Rumeida neighborhood Thursday night, prompting
setter leaders' call on the government to expand the existing
settlements in retaliation.

"The new housing construction plan will be finalized soon," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Wins Major Battle in Congo: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean troops won a major
battle Sunday when a five-km long Congolese rebel column was
destroyed with heavy casualties for the rebels, a Zimbabwean army
spokesman said in Harare Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Defense Forces (SDF) spokesman Col. Chancellor Diye
said Congolese, Zimbabwe and Namibian forces defending the
capital Kinshasa had destroyed a large number of rebel armored
cars, tanks and 20 trucks in fighting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Southern African Development Community (SADC) allied
forces have made tremendous progress since deployment and we
anticipate the western front to be cleared shortly," reports
quoted Diye as saying at a briefing in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Diye noted that with Angolan forces advancing from behind
rebel lines from the air force base of Kitona in the west, the
rebels had only two options: "to surrender or receive heavy
casualties."
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean troops had suffered no casualties so far, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe sent some
600 troops under the name of the SADC's security organ to help
defend Congolese President Laurent Kabila from Tutsi-led rebels
allegedly backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Although Namibia denies it has troops in Congo, Diye insisted
that Namibian soldiers were fighting alongside Zimbabwean and
Congolese troops.
</P>
<P>
Another officer of the ZDF, Brigadier Sibusiso Moyo, said the
rebel force on the western front numbered at over 1,000 men. He
claimed that quite a number of them including Rwandans and
Ugandans were wounded and being treated in Luanda, the Angolan
capital.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda deny having sent troops to fight along with
soldiers of the ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge community which staged
a mutiny in the east on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Angolan troops will reach Madimba and the Inga plant, which
supplies power to Kinshasa, within days, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Denying Zimbabwean planes were bombing positions in Kisangani
in the northeast, Diye said, "the current military effort is
directed toward opening and securing the Congo lifeline, that is
its only route to the sea."

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Vow to Continue Peace Effort in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Russian ambassadors
to Angola said here Tuesday that they would continue their effort
to bring the warring sides in Angola to implement the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the rebel National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) Monday announced a halt of cooperation with the
observer nations, ambassadors of the U.S. and Russia, both
observers of the peace process in Angola, expressed their
determination to achieve peace in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Donal Steinberg, U.S. ambassador to Angola, said the U.S.
would continue to bear the responsibility it has in the peace
process as an observer nation, while Vlardmir Raviesk, the
Russian ambassador, said what UNITA did cannot change the
time-table of peace talks in the country.
</P>
<P>
Horacio Cesar, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Portugal,
said it is necessary that UNITA and the observer nations
Cooperate with each other and that the U.N. mediates in Angola
and what UNITA is doing is sheerly unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
Portugal is also an observer nation in the Angolan peace
process.
</P>
<P>
UNITA announced Monday to stop its cooperation with the
observer nations in the peace process on the excuse that the
observers have failed to keep an impartial stance and thus are
disqualified to be "judges" of the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has been blamed for the current crisis in the peace
process after it refused to disarm its forces in accordance with
the Lusaka peace deal, and refused to hand over the four major
cities in central Angola to the government, and UNITA Chairman
Jonas Savimbi refused to move his headquarters to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The government has issued an ultimatum, saying that if UNITA
fails to accomplish all its obligations to the Lusaka peace deal
by the end of this month, it will expel UNITA members out of the
national assembly and the national unity and reconciliation
government.

<HEADLINE> Intel's New Chip to Force PC Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Intel's new Pentium chip,
the 450 MHz Pentium II introduced Monday, will further send PC
prices lower.
</P>
<P>
At least one U.S. retailer, CompUSA, is selling a system with
the new chip for under 2,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When the Pentium II 400 appeared in April, it was sold at 824
dollars, still far below the nearly 1,000 dollars the company
commanded for the first Pentiums five years ago. Now Intel is
selling the new Pentium II 450 to computer makers for 669 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that PCs with 266 MHz chips -- now
considered the low end -- could soon be available for less than
750 dollars from some dealers. And 300 MHz systems, which now sell
for 1,000 dollars, should move down below 900 dollars. By the end
of the year, the 300 MHz will be the entry level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Intel's two Celeron processors for low-end system
introduced along with Pentium II 450 cost 192 dollars and 149
dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The analysts say that the new Celeron could cause problems for
Intel by cannibalizing sales of more expensive Pentium IIs --
which are said to be just 10 percent faster than new Celerons.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African consumers
may have to tighten their belt as the interest rates will remain
high for a time, South African television reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Central Statistics Service (CSS) figures showed that inflation
rate jumped by 2.5 percentage points in July to 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly due to a sharp rise in commercial banks'
mortgage rates after the Reserve Bank's interest rates soared
following the tumbles of the South African currency in June and
July.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Rand has shed over a
quarter its value against the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said Tuesday the high
interest rates will stay in their place in the light of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
His words would enhance pessimism that South Africa is now
exposed to a real danger of recession. On Monday the CSS released
figures of South Africa's economic growth in the second quarter
of this year, which showed a drop in gross domestic product (GDP)
growth to 0.3 percent from 0.5 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The weak economic data have prompted analysts to cut their
predictions for this year's economic growth from one percent to
0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stals Tuesday reinforced the bank's monitoring stance, saying
the policy would not be relaxed prematurely.
</P>
<P>
He said financial stability was the key word when it comes to
cutting interest rate, and the Reserve Bank will stay committed
to bringing inflation down.
</P>
<P>
Stals said that despite the dramatic change in South Africa's
economic situation this year due to the Asian crisis, the bank
was not guided by economic growth or the lack of it.
</P>
<P>
The CSS figures showed that South Africa's 6.6 percent
inflation in July is higher than world average inflation. This
was the first time it happened in many years.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that there would be another sharp rise in
inflation in August. The average inflation for the year is seen
at around seven percent.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Bissau Govt, Rebels Hold Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Guinea Bissau
government and rebels Tuesday began their face-to-face talks in
the Atlantic Archipelago of Cape Verde, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the talks were jointly sponsored by the
Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) and the
Economic Community of West African Countries (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both sides expressed some optimism over
the two-day meeting which is the first contact between the
government and rebels since they signed a cease-fire agreement on
July 26.
</P>
<P>
Before today's meeting, ECOWAS put forward a peace plan to
both sides to hold parliamentary elections in February next year
with a national unity government until then.
</P>
<P>
The plan also suggested sending 100 ECOWAS observers to
monitor the cease-fire agreed on one month ago and envisaged
scaling down the number of intervention troops from Senegal and
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The rebels led by former armed forces commander Ansumane Mane
had initially rejected any mediation role for ECOWAS because both
Senegal and Guinea were militarily involved in the civil crisis
in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The civil crisis broke out after Guinea Bissau President Joao
Bernardo Viera sacked former armed forces commander Brigadier
Ansumane Mane over accusations of arms smuggling to rebels in
neighboring Senegal.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Third Annual ESAF Loan for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced here Tuesday the approval of the third annual
loan for Mozambique under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF) in an amount of 33 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support the Mozambican government's
economic program for 1998/99. The loan will be disbursed in two
equal semiannual installments, the first of which is available on
September 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
The program for 1998/99 aims at a real GDP growth (excluding
large projects) of about 7 percent in 1998 and 1999, an end-period
inflation of 6-8 percent in 1998 and 199, and the maintenance of
ent international reserves at about three to four months of
projected imports.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting its
member countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique joined the IMF in September 1984. Its quota is about
111 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals 190 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Libya Not Rejecting Lockerbie Trial Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A Scottish lawyer representing
the two Libyans accused of undertaking the Lockerbie bombing said
Tuesday the Libyan government had not rejected an Anglo-American
proposal of staging the Lockerbie trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Alistair Duff was quoted by Reuters as saying Tuesday after a
telephone conversation with one of his Libyan counterparts, "This
(the proposal) is certainly not being rejected."
</P>
<P>
"I got the impression that this matter was being treated with
urgency (in Libya) and had to be sorted out quickly," Duff said.
"We need to meet them (the two suspects) to see if further
security guarantees are required."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and Britain early Tuesday
introduced a U.N. Security Council resolution that would suspend
international sanctions against Libya once the two Libyan suspects
are handed over to the special court in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
The BBC Television also reported Tuesday that the Libyan
government is expected to make a formal response to this proposal
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 270 people were killed when a Pan AM airliner exploded
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 and the
U.N. imposed international sanctions against Libya in 1992 after
Libya refused to hand over the alleged bombers.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Ahern Hold Talks over N. Irish Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Ministers Tony
Blair said on Wednesday draconian measures will be introduced in
Britain and Ireland and the extremists would not be allowed to
wreck the peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
After meeting his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern in the western
Ireland village of Cong, Blair told reporters the British and
Irish governments were "marching in steps" over anti-terrorism
laws, according to BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
The measures are aimed largely at the Real IRA guerrillas who
have claimed responsibility for the bomb which killed 28 people
and injured more than 200 others 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that anybody who has been in Northern Ireland in the
past few days can feel the almost tangible sense of urgency which
there is across all parts of the community that we cannot allow
this process now to founder," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He also said both he and Ahern were confident that the Northern
Ireland peace process could make progress despite the setback of
the Omagh bombing.
</P>
<P>
At the joint press briefing, Ahern urged the Real IRA, which
declared a truce after Omagh bombing, to call a permanent
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we will shortly hear from them that there will be
a complete cessation of all their evil acts," he said.
</P>
<P>
To coordinate their efforts in crack down on terrorism, the
governments of Britain and Ireland have recalled their parliaments
to have emergency sessions next week to pass tough new security
laws in the wake of the Omagh bombing.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Wind Touches U.S. East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tropical storm-force wind and
rain lashed the East Coast of the United States Wednesday morning
as the edge of Hurricane Bonnie reached the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Gusts reached 160 kph on coastal areas near Wilmington,
southeastern town of North Carolina, blowing rain horizontally and
sending traffic signals creaking back and forth above deserted
streets. More than a half-million people in North Carolina and
South Carolina had been ordered to flee.
</P>
<P>
As of 10 a.m. Wednesday, Bonnie's center was about 130
kilometers south of Wilmington, and was moving at 22 kph. The
storm had turned from moving northwest to the north-northwest, and
forecasters said a gradual turn to the north was expected.
</P>
<P>
The eye of the 650-kilometer-wide storm, with sustained winds
of 180 kph, could reach the coastal area by early afternoon, said
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
More than 330,000 people were ordered to evacuate North
Carolina's coastal islands. About 200,000 more, including 120,000
tourists, were urged to leave South Carolina's two northernmost
coastal counties.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency was declared in Virginia and hurricane
warnings were in effect across a 800-kilometer stretch of
coastline, from Chincoteague, Virginia, to Edisto Beach, South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the Wilmington area,
causing 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in damage and 24 deaths.

<HEADLINE> 18 on Board Crashed Plane in Nepal Feared Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The passenger plane found
crashed in western Nepal Tuesday morning apparently collided
head-on with the mountains and all the 18 people on board are
feared dead, state-run Radio Nepal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers still have not reached the site after the
passenger plane missing since last Friday was found crashed into
pieces at an altitude of 12,000 feet (some 4,000 meters) about 13
kilometers southwest of Mt. Annapurna I, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts were hampered by continuing bad weather like
rain and thick fog in the area.
</P>
<P>
Nepal Television said that 12 persons including 10 armymen and
two policemen were dropped Wednesday very close to the crash site
after a helipad was built near the site.
</P>
<P>
Radio Nepal said that it would still take one-and-half an hours
to reach the crash site from the helipad.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated twin Otter aircraft lost contact five minutes
after it took off Friday morning in Jomsom, western Nepal. It was
scheduled to arrive 20 minutes later in Pokhara, 80 kilometers
away.
</P>
<P>
Those on board includes three crew members and three Indians.
</P>
<P>
The government formed Wednesday a five-member team to
investigate into the accident, the television said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Wanted Terrorist Not Here </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Wednesday categorically denied the reports that Sabri
el-Banna, the most wanted Palestinian terrorist, is somewhere in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was telling reporters here in response to some media
reports in the last couple of weeks that the 61-year-old man, who
is known by his nom de guerre as Abu Nidal, is in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party organ Wafd, quoting Palestinian sources,
reported on Monday that Abu Nidal, a Palestinian born in Jaffa in
1937, is suffering from terminal leukaemia and receiving treatment
in an Egyptian hospital.
</P>
<P>
About 10 days ago, a German news agency said the former
Palestinian guerilla was arrested by the police when he was
crossing into Egypt from Libya.
</P>
<P>
Similar reports have circulated in Cairo, but Egyptian security
officials denied there was such an arrest.
</P>
<P>
Abu Nidal, operating from Iraq, Syria and Libya, was blamed for
masterminding the bombing of two American airliners: a Pan Am on
the ground in Rome in 1973 and a TWA plane in the air over the
Aegean sea in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He was also held responsible for attacking Israel's El Al
airliner company offices in Rome and Vienna in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department lists his group as "the most
dangerous terrorist organization in existence," blamed for killing
300 people and wounding 650 in 20 countries since 1973.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Economists Back Currency Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong economists said
Wednesday that the linked exchange rate system is the anchor for
the market stability in such an open and small economy as Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of local economists, academic researchers, and policy
markers Wednesday attended a public policy forum to review the
pros and cons of maintaining the linked exchange rate one year
after the Asia financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kwok Kwok-Chuen, chief economist of Standard Chartered Bank,
made a presentation at the forum and pointed out: "Confidence is
the pillar for any financial market. Letting go the link is a
recipe for disaster."
</P>
<P>
The linked exchange rate regime, which pegged the Hong Kong
dollar to the greenback at one to 7.8 in October, 1983, has served
Hong Kong well, a small and open economy which highly depends on
external trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the economist, Hong Kong's trade in goods was 229
percent of its GDP in 1997, and trade in service was 35.1 percent
of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility that the break of the peg and a
depreciation of the currency can boost Hong Kong's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Telling from what happened in other Asian economies over the
past year, Kwok said that the depreciation of currency led to the
collapse of a financial system and company bankruptcy, and not
necessarily more exports.
</P>
<P>
Another keynote speaker Richard Wong, director of School of
Business of the University of Hong Kong, voiced his support for
the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government's resolve to
preserve the peg.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong has to undergo a long period of adjustment,
which, though painful, is the price it has to pay for a stable
exchange rate, said Wong.
</P>
<P>
The public policy forum, jointly organized by the Faculty of
Social Science and the Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific
Studies, is aimed to create a channel of communication between
policy makers and academia.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A fresh wave of panic swept through Russia's financial
institutions as the currency plunged, three banks announced a
merger and the government unveiled a plan to stretch out the
repayment of its debt. The developments came as the newly
designated prime minister, Viktor S. Chenomyrdin, was negotiating
with the parliament over the makeup of his new government.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration said that despite an unfavorable
federal court ruling it would go ahead and press Congress for
money to plan for sampling to supplement the 2000 census, and that
it would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Hurricane Bonnie bore down on the Carolina's coast
Wednesday, forcing authorities to order the evacuation of nearly a
half-million people from North Carolina's Outer Banks and South
Carolina's northernmost coastal counties, and intensifying fears
that there will be no escaping the big, dangerous storm.
</P>
<P>
-- A federal grand jury indicted a leader of a prominent Miami
Cuban exile group and six other Cuban Americans Tuesday on charges
of conspiring to assassinate President Fidel Castro.
</P>

neutrality toward the Bill Clinton sex scandal, urging Congress to
"wait for the facts" before deciding whether to impeach the

SHANGHAI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Mayor Xu Kuangdi
told an international seminar on choices and challenges for future
development today that Shanghai will try hard to implement its
sustainable development strategy, even though the city has immense
population pressures and resource and environment problems during
its modernization drive.

To reach its goal, the city will use integrated development to
save resources, reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency,
and protect the environment, he said.

<P>
It will optimize the layout of urban districts and accelerate
the restructuring of industries to move the manufacturing sector
to suburban areas, develop the service sector in the downtown
area, and increase environment-friendly agriculture in rural
areas.

LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Wednesday defended his newly announced measures against
terrorism in Northern Ireland and insisted the peace process must
be pushed forward.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we carry forward the process of political
development and dialogue, too," Blair said in Northern Irish
capital Belfast.
</P>
<P>
While touring Omagh on Tuesday, Blair announced a series of
"draconian and fundamental" measures which will be passed by the
parliament next Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A terrorist attack in Omagh 11 days ago claimed 28 lives and
injured more than 200.
</P>
<P>
"We have very carefully targeted these measures against the
renegade groups that are determined to try and wreck the peace
agreement and the process of peace," Blair was quoted as saying by
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"When the bill is published people will see that it is firm, it
is tough, but it is measured. If we do that we stay in step with
the feelings of the community here," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ireland has already announced sweeping measures to tighten its
own anti-guerrilla laws, and members of parliament will also be
called back to Dublin next week to approve the changes.
</P>
<P>
Blair will meet with his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern
Wednesday in Irish town of Cong for further talks on security
measures being adopted by both governments.

</P>
<P>
Li told the meeting of officials that a special effort needs to
be made to prevent the outbreak of epidemic diseases and to see to
it that schools open on time in September in those areas.
</P>
<P>
After listening to public health and education reports from the
flooded areas, Li said that President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu
Rongji, and other central government leaders are very concerned
about disease prevention and schooling in the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
The State Council will allocate more funds to see to it that
middle and primary schools in these areas open on time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials report that steps have been taken to speed up
medicine production and distribution.

The government reports that the floods have affected 44,850
schools and 8.47 million students, and have destroyed 3 million
sq.m. of schoolrooms, left cracks on 7.47 million sq.m. of
buildings, and destroyed a large number of books and a large
amount of teaching equipment.
</P>
<P>
Of the 7.6 billion yuan in flood-related losses to education
facilities, about 85 percent is to primary and middle schools, or
compulsory education.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels Stopped West of Kinshasa, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean military has said
the Tutsi-led rebel forces fighting to topple President Laurent
Kabila of the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) were stopped by a
cordon of Zimbabwean troops about 80 kilometers west of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
In its first official military briefing since Angolan,
Zimbabwean and some Namibian troops were reportedly deployed last
Thursday to the DRC to help Kabila, the Zimbabwean army also said
Tuesday night that Ugandan and Rwandan troops were among large
numbers of the rebels captured in the west of the country,
according to a report dispatched by Deutsche Presse-Agentur DPA
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
DPA quoted Brigadier General Sibusiso Moyo as saying that the
rebels had been unable to obtain supplies since last Sunday, when
Angolan forces captured the air base at Kitona for supplies flown
in from Goma in the east of the DRC since their offensive began
on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The briefing confirmed reports from within the DRC that the
rebel forces have encountered their first serious obstacles since
they launched their headlong drive for the capital city of
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
But observers warned that the direct conflict of Ugandan and
Rwandan troops against the Angolan and Zimbabwean armies sharply
raises the chances of the conflict spreading beyond the road
between Kinshasa to the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"We have made tremendous progress," Moyo said, "We anticipate
the western front to be cleared shortly. Now Kitona has been
taken, we anticipate the rebels' supplies are going to diminish
within a couple of days."
</P>
<P>
He added that the rebel advance party suffered a major blow
last Sunday when some Congolese jets destroyed a five-kilometer
column of armoured cars, tanks and trucks at Madimba, about 90
kilometers west of Kinshasa. The main fighting was between the
rebel advance group trying to break through a defensive line of
the Zimbabwean, Namibian and Congolese troops outside Madimba.
</P>
<P>
Moyo also disclosed that many rebels, including the Rwandans
and the Ugandans, were wounded and captured by the Angolans when
they seized Kitona. He added that the Ugandans and the Rwandans
had been fighting in the western front from the outset of their
offensive.

The president also proposed the State Duma (lower house) and
Federation Council (upper house) to "debate federal bills as a top
priority matter" on this topic.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government adopted a resolution signed by
Chernomyrdin on Tuesday night on transforming T-bills and OFZ
bonds into new ruble securities.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution the new ruble securities will mature in
three to five years, while GKO and OFZ shall be redeemed ahead of
time with the re-investment of the proceeds in the new state
securities from August 26 to September 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the related government resolution and rules
the holders of GKO and OFZ will get five percent of the bonds'
face value in cash and buy new stock with the rest on the day of
the repayment.

<HEADLINE> Population Increase Responsible for Poverty in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official said
Wednesday that the rapid increase in the population of Lusaka was
responsible for the high levels of poverty being experienced in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Bennie Mwiinga, Minister of Local Government and Housing, made
the remarks in Lusaka when he opened a two-day workshop on
poverty reduction and good governance convened by the Lusaka City
Council, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga said the population of Lusaka which is amounting to
about two million was increasing at the rate of six percent per
annum, twice the rate that other similar cities in the country
were experiencing.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the huge urban migration, said the minister,
there was a strain on the social services that the local
authority was able to provide to the city residents.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid urbanization has overwhelmed the facilities that
exist in the city, causing most people to stay in deteriorated
environments such as shanty compounds," Mwiinga said.
</P>
<P>
He added that resultant poverty in the city had led to
increased crimes, prostitution, alcoholism and drug abuse among
the residents.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga called on the participants drawn from some regional
countries such as Zimbabwe and Kenya to work hand in hand in
efforts to conquer poverty.

<HEADLINE> MQM Resigns from Federal, Provincial Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Muttaheda Qaumi Movement (MQM)
Wednesday resigned from all government posts and submitted
resignations of its ministers in Sindh Cabinet to the Sindh
governor.
</P>
<P>
The MQM's lone Minister in the central government Khalid
Maqbool Siddiqi tendered his resignation to the prime minister
early this month.
</P>
<P>
The MQM members who had the chairmanship of various standing
committees in the Senate and National Assembly and Parliamentary
Committees also resigned from their respective posts.
</P>
<P>
The MQM's departure from the coalition government led by the
Pakistan Muslim League was announced by Senator Aftab Ahmed
Shaikh, while addressing a crowded press conference at Karachi
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Aftab Shaikh told the media that what prompted the MQM to leave
the government were the "breach of promises" by the government,
deviation from written agreements, continued killings of MQM's
innocent workers, rising terrorism by Haqiqi terrorists and
continuing negative and mischievous propaganda against MQM,
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to leave the government has also been
endorsed by MQM leader Altaf Hussain.
</P>
<P>
Aftab Shaikh said that after separation from the government,
the Haq Parast members of the Senate, National and Provincial
Assemblies will now play the role of opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, instead of becoming the part of the existing
opposition, they will request the concerned speakers and Senate
chairman for separate allocation of opposition seats.

He said that on the afternoon on July 31, the local governments
were busy moving 50,000 local people out when the threat on the
dyke was discovered. Three helicopters were used to drop life
jackets, and when the dike broke, the PLA sent 2,000 soldiers and
other people to keep people from drowning.
</P>
<P>
Post-flood disease control work has also helped. The Health
Ministry has sent 22,000 medical teams and approximately 120,000
health workers to the flooded areas to help prevent epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Colds, intestinal diseases, and dermatitis are common in the
flood-stricken areas now but there is no prevalence of major
epidemic diseases, according to Yin Dakui, Vice-minister of
Health. He said that the incidence of infectious diseases in the
flooded areas has stayed at the same level as last year. In 1954,
however, a large number of the people died as a result of epidemic
diseases.

<HEADLINE> No Shortcuts to Applying for Olympics Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Sports fans who want to watch
the top-level performances at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney
will have no shortcut to go when they apply for the tickets, the
games' organizing committee SOCOG said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All applicants will have to include full payment for all
events they wish to attend along with their order forms, with
those who are unsuccessful being fully reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to get a ticket on the basis of who they know
or what they know," SOCOG President and New South Wales State
Olympics Minister Michael Knight said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It won't be a first come, first served situation and it won't
be tickets for mates or friends of the organizing committee."
</P>
<P>
According to the ticketing program released by SOCOG on
Wednesday, three and a half million of the total 9.6 million
tickets will be offered to Australians in July-August 1999, with
a random draw being used to choose the successful applicants when
demand exceeds supply for any particular event.
</P>
<P>
However, SOCOG will have a special program to help Australian
students and the disadvantaged to have a chance to get a feel of
the biggest sports event.
</P>
<P>
Later next year, a further 1.5 million Olympic Opportunity
Program tickets costing between 10 Australian dollars and 19
Australian dollars will be offered especially to Australian
schools and the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
Any remaining tickets will go on sale in year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The other 4.6 million tickets are for Gold Pass/Stadium Gold
holders (650,000), Olympic Club members (72,000), Australian
sponsors (1.1 million), global sponsors (400,000), national
Olympic committees (750,000 athletes, officials, the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) and international
federations (430,000) and the media (1.2 million, with part of
that taken up with space for equipment).
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of all tickets are expected to go to
Australians and all include free public transport on the Olympic
network.
</P>
<P>
The SOCOG has budgeted to make 600 million Australian dollars
(360 million U.S. dollars) from ticket sales, but admits it will
not sell all of the tickets to the less popular events.
</P>
<P>
Australians will be able to request up to six tickets per
session (or four for the opening and closing ceremonies) at one
of four different price ranges, but must pay for all of them in
advance.
</P>
<P>
It will be illegal to resell any tickets but they can be given
to friends or relatives, according to the policy.

China's floods have claimed the lives of 3,004 people,
Vice-premier Wen Jiabao told the 4th meeting of the Ninth
National People's Congress Standing Committee this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The floods have caused 166.6 billion yuan (about 21 billion
U.S. dollars) in losses, he said. Preliminary reports show 29
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities affected by the
flooding to varying degrees this year, and 21 million hectares of
land.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that more than 223 million people have been affected,
and the floods have destroyed nearly 5 million houses.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has asked the soldiers and civilians
fighting the floods to be prepared for the 7th flood crest on the
Yangtze, and said that guarding the dikes is a do-or-die matter,
especially around Honghu Lake in Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Hu Jintao has taken a look at the situation on
the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers, and expressed his thanks to
people fighting the floods there and asked them to keep the effort

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The 7th flood peak on the
Yangtze River passed Shashi in Hubei Province today and the 3rd on
the Songhua River passed Tonghe in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The peak at Shashi was 44.39 meters at 01:00 a.m. today, 0.83
meter lower than during the 6th peak. It was down to 44.36 meters
at 2:00 p.m., according to the State Flood Control Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters on the Shishou-Jianli section of the Yangtze went
up 0.05 to 0.08 meter, while the water downstream at Lianhuatang
fell 0.05 meter.
</P>
<P>
The flood crest is expected to pass Jianli at 8:00 p.m. today
and Honghu 10 hours later, according to China Central Television

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Better Services Add New Hopes to Disabled Persons in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Rehabuses, tactile paths,
traffic lights specially equipped with sound devices as well as
better rehabilitation services have added new hopes to the life of
the disabled in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 378,000 Hong Kong people with
disabilities requiring rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) has spared no efforts to improve the rehabilitation services
and pledged to spend about 12.35 billion HK dollars (1.6 billion
U.S. dollars) on rehabilitation this year, of which 59 percent is
for subvention to over 70 Non-government Organizations (NGOs) for
medical, education and welfare services.
</P>
<P>
As what Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa summarized at the opening
ceremony of the 11th Rehabilitation International Asia and the
Pacific Regional Conference Sunday that Hong Kong is "making
significant progress, both in terms of quantity and quality, in
providing government-subvented rehabilitation services to the
disabled."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that since the beginning of the Asian
and Pacific Decade for Disabled persons in 1993, Hong Kong has
doubled the number of residential places and increased the number
of day places by about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now has a total of some 8,800 residential places and
over 24,000 day places for different types of services including
special education and skills training.
</P>
<P>
Funded by government subvention, the Vocational Training
Council operates three skills centers for people with disabilities
and gives guidance and advice on the operation of two other
subvented centers run by two NGOs.
</P>
<P>
These centers have over 1,000 full-time training places. By
1999-2000, the number of such kind of places will reach 1,200.
</P>
<P>
As of March, 1998, 2,553 disabled people and industrial
accident victims had attended the tailor-made retraining courses
while 608 retrainees had attended courses offered to able-bodied
workers.
</P>
<P>
The government also attaches great importance to assisting
people with disabilities in finding jobs. Last year more than
1,470 disabled people achieved placements.
</P>
<P>
About 50 sheltered workshops with more than 6,000 places have
been provided for those people with disabilities who can not or
who are not yet ready to return to open employment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government pays special attention to
prevention and early identification of disability.
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Observation scheme of the Department of
health provides screening for all children up to the age of five.
Observation of children aged six or above is conducted in primary
schools by the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Disability Discrimination Ordinance has been
enacted to give people with disabilities legal reasons to fight
against discrimination and harassment.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government is committed to fostering a physical
and social environment conducive to the full participation and
equal opportunities of the disabled while the disabled have
received full respect and care from the society and their
confidence in life have boosted.
</P>
<P>
Most of them vow to overcome difficulties, saying with
certainty: "We must have faith in ourselves when faced with
adversity. We are the one who can turn things around."
</P>
<P>
The significant achievements in SAR's rehabilitation work for
the disabled are rewarded by a Life Patron Membership that the
Rehabilitation International has presented.
</P>
<P>
Tung attributed the success to the joint efforts of government
departments, statutory bodies and some 70 NGOs including self-help
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Now the government is reviewing the 1994 Rehabilitation program
Plan (RPP) and scheduled for completion in mid 1999. It is
determined to continue its efforts to implement the policies as
set out in its White Paper on Rehabilitation and improve the
quality and standards of existing services as and when resources
permit.

<HEADLINE> HK Residential Mortgage Lending Falls Slightly in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residential mortgage
lending continued to fall in July, reflecting the gloomy sentiment
prevailing on the property market, the government statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The amount of gross new loans dropped slightly by 0.7 percent
in July on a month-to-month basis to 9.31 billion HK dollars (1.2
billion U.S. dollars), according to the latest residential
mortgage survey released here Wednesday by the Hong Kong Monetary
authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
In June, the amount of gross new loans declined by 1.5 percent
from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The average size of new loans decreased to 1.6 million HK
dollars (205,000 U.S. dollars) in July compared with 1.68 million
(215,000 U.S. dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
New loans approved in the month dropped by 9.1 percent to 10.5
billion HK dollars (1.35 billion U.S. dollars), and 99.3 percent
of these loans are related to owner-occupied properties.
</P>
<P>
Loans approved but not yet drawn rose by 6.3 percent in July
to 7.83 billion HK dollars (one billion U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
The loan delinquency ratio, which is measured by the ratio of
mortgage loans overdue for more than three months to total
outstanding mortgage loans, edged up slightly to 0.34 percent as
at July, 1998.
</P>
<P>
David Carse, deputy chief executive of the HKMA said
Wednesday: "The latest delinquency ratio shows continuing high
quality of residential mortgage loans."

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has delayed
a decision to ban flights by Yugoslav carriers to the airports of
its members, European Commission officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delay is caused by Britain that opposed the plan in that
the ban would have required the British government to break an
earlier air services agreement with Yugoslavia in violation of
international law.
</P>
<P>
Greece also opposed the plan and both countries have indicated
that they would delay a decision of the ban until September when
EU ambassadors meet again to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers agreed in June to ban flights by Yugoslav
airlines to airports of EU member states in an effort to press
Yugoslavia to withdraw security forces from its crisis-hit
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Britain insisted that the 15-nation union needed to find a way
to deal with the contracted relations between the Yugoslav
carriers and EU carriers.

<HEADLINE> Levels of Dangerous Parasites High in Sydney's Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Levels of dangerous parasites
in Sydney's water supply are at higher levels than during the last
contamination alert three weeks ago, the New South Wales Health
Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Health Department Director-General Mick Reid said test results
showed a higher concentration of the parasite cryptosporidium.
</P>
<P>
"The levels of cryptosporidium were higher than the previous
levels," Reid said over ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department late Tuesday night advised all Sydney
residents with the exception of Sutherland shire, the Blue
Mountains and some other far suburb areas to boil water before
drinking for the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Sydney water test results supplied to the department indicated
the micro-organisms giardia and cryptosporidium had been
identified at levels of concern to microbiologists.
</P>
<P>
Reid said he did not know when Sydney's water is likely to be
cleared for drinking. "We have to wait for tests to further come
from Sydney Water Ltd. to the department to be examined and we
will certainly keep Sydney residents informed as those tests come
in," Reid said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rainfall in the Sydney catchment area in recent weeks may
be responsible for the contamination, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
Householders have been advised to boil water for one minute
before using it for drinking, cleaning teeth, gargling, washing
uncooked foods such as salads and making ice.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. water experts are due to arrive Sydney Thursday to
advise on the city's water contamination, the New South Wales
government said.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa's Net Profit Surges 134 Percent in Semester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- German airline Lufthansa Wednesday
announced a larger-than-expected net profit of 928 million marks
(516 million U.S. dollars) for the first half of 1998, up 134
percent from the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa attributed the profit surge mainly to the decline of
fuel prices on the world market as well as successful cost-saving
measures.
</P>
<P>
The company's sales in the period were 10.6 billion marks (5.9
billion dollars), up 7.6 percent from the same period of last
year. Most of the increase was achieved by its passenger services,
which grew by 7.6 percent to 7.4 billion marks (4.1 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its cargo services rose by 2.7 percent to 1.8
billion marks (1.0 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> India Accuses Roslin Institute of Pirating Cattle Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- India Wednesday accused
Edinburg-based Roslin Institute of pirating its special cattle
genes for a new genetic engineering technology.
</P>
<P>
A controversy has erupted in India's Kerala State over the
extinction and piracy of its "Vechur" breed, a short draught
cattle that is the smallest cattle variety in the world, the
Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology (RFSTE)
said in a release here.
</P>
<P>
"Vechur" cattle breed of Kerala State is famous for the high
fat content in its milk that exceeds that of European cattle.
</P>
<P>
The name "Vechur" has been repeatedly coming up in the context
of research and patent application by Roslin Institute, but it has
been denying the use of genetic material from Indian cattle and
applying for a patent based on such research, the RFSTE said.
</P>
<P>
A patent search by the RFSTE in collaboration with public
interest groups in Europe has confirmed that Roslin Institute and
its commercial partners have 14 patent applications with the
European Patent Office, of which one clearly refers to an Indian
cattle breed, the RFSTE further said.

LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Guinea Bissau government and
representatives of the armed rebels have signed an accord
reaffirming a ceasefire agreement reached in July, after a
meeting in the Cape Verde capital Praia.
</P>
<P>
The accord allows for the re-opening of the airport in the

<HEADLINE> How China Is Holding The Death Toll Down During The Flooding (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Even though this year's floods
in China have affected 220 million people, the government reported
today that 3,004 people had died, significantly lower than the
33,000 death toll in 1954's flooding.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Wenzhi, a State Flood Control Headquarters senior
official, said that China put a lot of effort into keeping the
death toll down, especially since June, with the Yangtze River
having its worst floods since 1954 and the Nen and Songhuajiang
rivers having some of the worst in history.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the low death toll can be attributed primarily
to the fact that the three rivers' embankments kept
standing. China has built a number of flood-control facilities
over the past decade, he pointed out, increasing their flood
resistance.
</P>
<P>
But, the country has also sent a large number of people to
fight the floods this year. The People's Liberation Army and armed
police have sent some 270,000 soldiers so far and more than 8
million civilians and soldiers are still working day and night to
keep the embankments safe.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the collapse of some dykes did not mean great loss
of life because people had been moved in time and the foremost
thing was to move people out whenever possible.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Enhance Fishing Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government is setting up
a monitoring system on fishing activities to protect the
country's marine eco-environment.
</P>
<P>
Maria Nelumba, a senior official in the Ministry of Fisheries,
told a science symposium here Wednesday that the system is to
locate the precise position of the fishing ship through a
geographical position system (GPS).
</P>
<P>
The government has ruled that industrialized fishing within
13 nautical miles of its territorial waters is prohibited in
order to protect the small fishes and the spawns in the inshore
areas#,she said.
</P>
<P>
If every ship is installed with the GPS, the monitor center
on land could send message through satellite to know precisely
the current location of the ship. Therefore, difficulties in
protecting marine resources and monitoring fishing activities
could be easily solved.
</P>
<P>
Angola has a 1,650-kilometer long coastline, with the richest
fishing farms in Africa. Statistics from the Ministry of
Fisheries show that currently there are about 850,000 tons of
fish resources in the country with commercial values.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country's fishing production reached 241,800
tons, in which 141,300 tons were caught by the national fleet,
while the rest is harvested by foreign fleets fishing in the
Angolan waters.
</P>
<P>
Foreign fishing fleets have to hand over part of their gains
to the Angolan government by unloading the fishes in various
ports in Angola. The new monitoring system will also inspect the
foreign ships to see if they sail to local ports to unload the
due catch, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1997, Angola got 199,600 tons of fishing products, 77
percent of which is for domestic consumption or freezing whereas
another 14 percent is for making dried fish and salty fish, and
the rest for processing canned fish, fish powder as well as for
export.

<HEADLINE> State Planning Minister Says 8 Percent GDP Growth Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Eight percent growth in the GDP
is important to China's economy, which is now at a crucial stage,
according to Zeng Peiyan, the Minister in charge of the State
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Zeng told the 4th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 9th
National People's Congress (NPC) that this will ensure economic
development and employment opportunities and help to strengthen
the confidence of Chinese and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Although China is faced with a difficult economic situation, it
has carried out various reforms and had good economic growth since
the beginning of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country does have some problems however, he said, with the
Asian financial crisis making it more difficult to export, to
utilize foreign capital, or maintain economic development.
</P>
<P>
The unfavorable performance of state enterprises, the sluggish
consumer market, and the floods have affected a fourth of China's
people and had a direct impact on the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China's half-year GDP stood at 3.47 trillion yuan, up 7 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Zeng spoke about 9 ways to have 8 percent growth with faster
infrastructure construction, improving state enterprises'
performance, stopping smugglers, and providing more training and
employment opportunities for unemployed workers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't to Borrow Money From Local Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Finance is planning to borrow around 600 million U.S. dollars from
local or private banks as an option to raise funds for the
government, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that a loan syndication, preferably composed of local
banks but also open to foreign banks, would be tapped to lend the
foreign currency deposit unit loan to the government for a term of
one year at a yield of 8-9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu explained that borrowing short-term from local or
foreign banks may be a temporary option to finance the government
budgetary requirement as it may not be prudent at the moment to
proceed with the planned international bond offering in view of
the widening spreads of Philippine bonds.
</P>
<P>
The current spreads on Philippine bonds have widened to 750
basis points over the corresponding U.S. treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu added that in addition, resorting to local or foreign
banks would cost less as doing a bond offering would result in a
yield of at least 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the loan could be arranged within one week so
that the national government could disburse the funds by September
to pump-prime the economy battered by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he clarified that the finance department would still
proceed with preparations and the roadshow for its international
bond offering so that when the spreads narrow and an opportunity
arises, the government could still do ahead with the flotation.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar At 12-Year Lows for Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The embattled Australian dollar
hit fresh lows Wednesday, marking the second day in a row that the
currency reached levels not seen in more than 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The local currency fell victim to negative sentiment about
Japan and Russia's economic woes, which has further pressured
commodity prices, and the chances of a federal election being just
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
After trading to a high of 57.80 U.S. cents Wednesday morning
the ailing currency closed here at 57.30.
</P>
<P>
Offshore events continued to weigh on the Australian currency
as the Russian ruble lost almost 10 percent of its value
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Fears for commodity prices in relation to the Russian crisis
stem from market concern that Russia might begin offloading
certain commodities at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
Such activity in turn could lessen demand for Australian
commodities and undermine the Australian dollar, traditionally a
commodity-driven currency.
</P>
<P>
Local political uncertainty has also invaded the Australian
foreign exchange market, as speculation intensified that the
federal government may announce a date for the federal election as
soon as the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
A few Saturdays in October have been mooted as possible polling
days.
</P>
<P>
St. George Bank manager of foreign exchange trading Stuart
Moore said it was only a matter of time before the domestic
currency tested its record post-float low of 57.10 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
On July 28, 1986, the Australian dollar tumbled to 57.10 U.S.
cents, the lowest level since it was floated on December 13, 1983.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that is going to save it now is intervention
(by the Reserve Bank of Australia)," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
As the currency has fallen this week speculation of
intervention to support the local dollar by the RBA has increased,
yet analysts largely agree that the central bank is unlikely to
jump into the market unless the drop in the currency is
disorderly.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed trading here at 82.90 yen from
83.72 and 1.0318 German marks from 1.0426.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue Extra 100 Billion Yuan In Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council submitted
a bill to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
today on issuing an additional 100 billion yuan worth of (about 12
billion US dollars) long-term treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, ninister of Finance, says that this will
increase this year's expected deficit to 96 billion yuan and will
be used to pay for infrastructure construction that is urgently
needed for economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The government will allocate 18 billion yuan from this year's
budget for scientific, technological and educational development,
pension insurance, disaster relief, and social security for people
laid off by state-run enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP grew 7 percent in the first half of this
year, he said, adding that China is facing an increasingly severe
international economic and financial situation as a result of the
intensification of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
To reach the GDP growth target at eight percent for all of
1998, "we must strengthen our macro-economic control and
regulation," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, a GDP growth of 8 percent is very important for economic
development and the ability to deal with the Asian financial
crisis, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction needs a large amount of money, he
said, and the treasury bonds will be used for environmental
protection, water conservation, flood control facilities, and
roads, railways, telecommunications, and airports.

(NFA) has named 57-year-old Dutch Thijs Libregts as the new head
coach for the Super Eagles.
</P>
<P>
The appointment, which will be subject to approval by the
Ministry of Youth and Sports, was announced Tuesday in Nigeria
capital Abuja by NFA Secretary General Sani Toro.
</P>
<P>
Libregts is to become the 20th foreign coach of the Super
Eagles. He is also the third Dutch to manage the Nigerian team.
</P>
<P>
Libregts' appointment came after the Super Eagles' failure at
the France World Cup this summer to meet the high expectations
pinned on it under Serb coach Bora Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
The team shot into the second round with very impressive
performance but was unexpectedly stopped by Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Libregts was recommended to the NFA along with five others by
a three-man team who traveled to Europe to search for a new coach
shortly after the end of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The NFA did not disclose the details of the contract, but
media reports said a four-year contract was recommended, which
means Libregts will lead the Nigerian team to the 2002 World Cup
to be jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that in reviewing the Super Eagles'
failure in France, the NFA has concluded future coaches will be
contracted for longer terms, contrary to the old practice in
which foreign coaches were usually contracted before big matches.
</P>
<P>
Libregts will have an annual salary of about 30,000 U.S.
dollars, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch has coached many club sides both in and outside the
Netherlands. He was the coach of the Dutch team that qualified
for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and also a professor of physical
education at the Amsterdam University.
</P>
<P>
Libregts will arrive in Nigeria next week for the new job, a
report said.

<HEADLINE> Government Confident About Flood Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, who has
been directing the ongoing national battle against the floods, has
pledged continuous efforts to bring the surging flood waters under
control, and said the Chinese government is confident of final
success.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon Wen briefed the fourth meeting of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature,
on the most recent developments in the flood-fighting operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that by August 22 the floods which have swept through
29 provinces and regions across China had killed 3,004 people,
1,320 of them in the Yangtze River Basin.
</P>
<P>
The floods have affected 21.2 million hectares of farmland and
destroyed 13.16 million hectares of crops. They have also washed
away nearly 5 million houses and affected 223 million people. The
economic losses are estimated at some 166 billion yuan (about
20.8 billion U.S. dollars), Wen said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier spoke highly of the people and soldiers who
have courageously fought the floods and successfully
protected people's lives, major dikes, cities and the main
lines of transportation.
</P>
<P>
At present, over eight million civilians and soldiers are
working at dikes along the Yangtze River and the Nengjiang and
Songhua rivers in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Wen cautioned that the flood situation is still severe and
coastal areas are expected to be hit by typhoons. "We have entered
the most crucial stage, one that will decide whether we can win
ultimate victory."
</P>
<P>
He outlined the tasks ahead and stressed that people in the
disaster areas should be guaranteed food, clothes, medicine and
shelter to see them through the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also called for renewed efforts to protect the
environment, the neglect of which is believed partly to blame for
the rampant flood waters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Major General Do Hung, deputy
director of the General Bureau of People's Police under the
Vietnamese Police Ministry, highly praised Yunnan Province's
achievements in battling against drugs during his recent visit to
the region.
</P>
<P>
After hearing a report on Yunnan's anti-drug efforts, Do Hung,
head of the Vietnamese drug-fighting delegation, said
that Yunnan has scored admirable achievements and accumulated rich
experience in its decisive anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
He approved a suggestion by Yunnan to strengthen its
cooperation with Vietnam in the fight against drugs. Vietnam and
Yunnan share a common 1,300-kilometer border.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is the main corridor through which drugs steal its
way into China due to its proximity to one of the world's largest
drug-growing areas -- the Golden Triangle. Yunnan began cracking
down on drug-related crimes in 1982, and has since prosecuted over
50,000 drug cases and confiscated more than 70 tons of drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday ordered his cabinet to go full-blast in the
implementation of key programs aimed at generating jobs and
reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued following a dialogue with church and
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the order, Estrada directed cabinet members and the heads of
government agencies to coordinate with the church and business
leaders in helping realize the government's pro-poor programs
which cover education, social services, agriculture, the
environment and labor and employment.
</P>
<P>
Estrada required all cabinet secretaries and heads of concerned
government agencies to submit a monthly report starting September
15 on their compliance with the president's directive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also ordered the cabinet to submit a progress
report on the status of these pro-poor programs every quarter
starting January next year to determine what still needs to be
done.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to be recognized as a true democracy where all
persons are equal, our poor people should be free from hunger,
disease, homelessness, unemployment and illiteracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also told the church and business leaders that his
administration has presented to Congress a 579.5-billion-peso
(13.5 billion U.S. dollars) pro-poor national budget that would

and provide the poor with adequate food, clothing and shelter.

<HEADLINE> Women's Role Enhanced in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 1997, the number
of female officials in China had exceeded 13.8 million, 34.4
percent of all officials. Among them, some 69,000 were ranked at
and above the county level, accounting for 14.4 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released here today by the All-China Women's
Federation, a non-governmental organization for women's and
children's rights and benefits in China, show that the country's
600 million women, nearly half the country's population, are
assuming an increasingly important role in political and economic
life.
</P>
<P>
The Federation said that all 31 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities in China now have at least one woman in the
paramount local leadership. This is also true in more than 90
percent of the prefectures, cities and counties across the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Federation said, in the new State Council elected
earlier this year, there is one woman among the five State
Councillors and two among the 29 ministers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that at present enterprises nationwide
now employ 57.45 million female workers, 38.7 percent of their
total employees, and that more than 60 percent of rural laborers
in the countryside are women.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the workers in township enterprises, which
are playing a vital role in the rural economy, are women, 50
million in all.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federation, by 1995 China had 9.88 million
women scientists and technicians, accounting for some 37
percent of the country's entire force in these fields. There were
also 62 women scientists and engineers who made their way into the
prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of
Engineering.

<HEADLINE> Eighth National Women's Congress to Open in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth National Congress of
Chinese Women will be held from August 31 to September 5 in
Beijing, the All-China Women's Federation announced today.
</P>
<P>
About 1,320 deputies from all over the country, including the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macao and Taiwan, are
expected to attend the congress. There will be representatives
from all 56 ethnic groups in China.
</P>
<P>
The main agenda of the congress includes hearing and examining
a work report by the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China
Women's Federation, revising the Federation's constitution, and
electing a new Federation leadership, the Eighth Executive
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hua Fuzhou, a member of the Federation's Secretariat, noted
that a major task of the upcoming congress is to establish Deng
Xiaoping Theory as a guiding ideology for the women's movement in
China.
</P>
<P>
She added that the past five years was one of the best periods
since the founding of New China in 1949 for the development of
work related to women's and children's issues in China.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Communist Party of China and government have
always shown great concern over the country's women and children,
and that the Fourth World Conference on Women, to which Beijing
played host in 1995, also helped draw wider attention to women's
issues.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1949, the All-China Women's Federation is a
non-governmental organization under the CPC leadership. With
headquarters in Beijing, the Federation defines its main functions
as promoting the self-improvement of Chinese women and protecting
the legitimate rights and interests of all women and children.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Women's National Congress, which is held once every
five years, is the highest organ of the Federation.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 600 million women, nearly half of the
total population. By the end of 1995, the All-China Women's
Federation had set up sub-organizations in 30 provinces, over 370
cities and more than 2,800 counties, while the number of its
sub-organizations at the township level had exceeded 52,000.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Coalition Expected to Bring Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The new coalition government
formed Wednesday by the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Communist
Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) is expected to bring
political stability to the country though it is not without
challenges, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The new coalition government enjoys a comfortable majority of
at least 128 seats in the 205-member Lower House of Parliament,
strong enough to fend off any outside attack if infighting does
not occur.
</P>
<P>
Infighting between the two partners seems unlikely or will not
be serious enough to break the partnership because they were
driven together by the general elections due before November 1999,
the observers said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who came to power in
mid-April, has expressed confidence on several occasions that his
NC party would win a majority in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated clearly in late June that another party would
have to be accommodated soon "since it has become difficult to run
a minority government."
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-term polls in November 1994 produced a hung
parliament where no single party held a majority, Nepal has seen
five different governments.
</P>
<P>
The first minority government of the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), formed after the mid-term
polls, survived barely 10 months.
</P>
<P>
As political struggle is sure to heat up in the country in the
run-up to the next elections, it is safe to say that Koirala would
try his best first to maintain the current coalition because
partnership with CPN-UML may not be a boon.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition CPN-UML, which supported the NC minority
government at the beginning from outside, backpedaled in July,
alleging that the government had failed to solve the national
problems as promised. NC said in a resolution that CPN-UML cannot
be trusted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, CPN-UML prefers early elections while the majority of
NC MPs are said to be opposing it.
</P>
<P>
For CPN-ML, which broke away from CPN-UML in early March, early
elections are most undesirable as it is in the course of
reorganizing itself and has yet to win the recognition of the
Election Commission as a national party.
</P>
<P>
As the party does not want to see the government fall for early
elections, it lent a hand in passing in parliament the programs
and policies and the budget tabled by the government for the
1998/99 fiscal year which began in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
"This coalition between NC and CPN-ML is a coalition between
two opposite political parties which have different principles.
There is compulsion to last the government until the elections,"
said Dr. Jaya Raj Acharya, Nepal's former ambassador to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
However, the new coalition is not free from troubles.
</P>
<P>
"There are many challenges before the nation which the new
coalition government has to face, including the deteriorating law
and order situation and unemployment in the country and the
Mahakali and Kalapani issues with neighboring India," Dr. Acharya
noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two partners are strange bedfellows with
different principles. Before July, CPN-ML had attacked vigorously
the NC government on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
There is no consensus within NC over the inclusion of CPN-ML
into the government, informed sources said. The coalition might
exacerbate the existing rift in the party, the single largest in
parliament, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the new equation gave rise to power struggles
among MPs of both parties. Unhappiness and disappointment over
loss of cabinet portfolios or failure to get portfolios and
targeted portfolios might turn into anti-government sentiment,
especially when the elections are approaching.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Raps EU's Ban on Egyptian Potatoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and
Supply Ahmed Goweili accused the European Union (EU) Wednesday of
damaging the reputation of Egyptian products by deciding to ban
imports of Egyptian potatoes.
</P>
<P>
Goweili criticized the EU's decision as "unjustified and
intransigent," denying Egyptian potatoes have infectious disease
as claimed by France, Denmark, Finland, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is harmful to the reputation of Egyptian exports
in general. This is an unacceptable provocative action coming from
countries which enjoy particularly good relationship with Egypt,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Only 0.4 percent of the Egyptian potatoes exported to the EU
have been rejected due to the infection with the brown mold, he
said, adding that this is "the lowest ratio of infection" in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU's decision was taken for "merely protective
reasons."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been applying political and economic pressures to
persuade European countries to reverse their decision to impose
anti-dumping duties and bans on Egyptian exports, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
A EU committee is due in Cairo next month to discuss the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The EU demands its importers import potatoes only from
plantations pronounced clear of the brown plant disease under the
inspection of a joint committee. It also calls for a total ban on
the import of Egyptian potatoes if the mold in the products
exceeds a certain percentage.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has rejected the conditions set by the EU on Egypt's
potato exports next season. Egypt's annual imports from the EU
average 5 billion U.S. dollars as against 1.7 billion dollars in
its exports to the EU.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thailand's Policy Switched to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved the latest quarterly economic review, better known as the
fifth letter of intent, agreed with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). The letter shows that the Thai government has switched
its focus from macroeconomic framework to microeconomic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Experts said as the country's macroeconomic framework has
achieved a degree of stability, focus has turned to efforts to
streamline regulations to make the system transparent and
accountable.
</P>
<P>
The first year of the Thailand economic program under the IMF's
17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar rescue package witnessed changes in
fiscal and monetary policy, exchange rate, net international
reserves, interest rates, economic growth rate, external accounts
and balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the criticism of the bitter pills prescribed by the
IMF in the previous four letters of intent, Thailand has come
through its worst nightmares to achieve a relatively stable
economic framework.
</P>
<P>
The baht has been stable at 41 to 42 baht against the U.S.
dollar with net international reserves expected to hit 26-28
billion U.S. dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago, Thailand's net reserves were depleted by the
baht defense, falling to 800 million dollars and triggering a
shock wave throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates, which hit 24 percent in December
1997, have fallen to 10-12 percent.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, IMF and Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda changed their stance at the fiscal-tightening
policy, allowing fiscal deficit spending to act as an economic
stimulus.
</P>
<P>
With all these achievements, experts say that Thailand now
enters into the reconstruction phase, where microeconomic
framework will come into full play.
</P>
<P>
In the latest letter of intent, Thailand and IMF laid great
emphasis on financial reforms, corporate debt restructuring,
social security and market opening.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the economic recovery will not be seen if
Thailand does not follow up with implementation of the financial
and economic reform as outlined in the IMF program.
</P>
<P>
Halting the economic decline and the rising non-performing
loans in the banking system requires a strong microeconomic
framework to put the banks back in business and clean up their
balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive financial reform package announced by the
government on August 14 is aimed at addressing the problems
through government intervention and mergers, privatization of
state-controlled banks, raising public funds for banks'
recapitalization and developing private asset management
companies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government is eliminating impediments and
strengthening the broader incentive framework for restructuring.
This will include the elimination of tax disincentives for debt
restructuring, and the revision of Bank of Thailand regulations
for loan classification and collateral appraisal.
</P>
<P>
The government has further taken on the banking reform by
creating a Financial Sector Restructuring Advisory Committee to
ensure the successful implementation of the banking reform
package.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the government's macro- and micro-economic efforts
to bring the country's economy back on foot, Thailand's economic
recovery also hinges on external factors, particularly Japan's and
the region's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth letter of intent, the government forecast that the
country's economy will bottom out early next year after a
7-percent contraction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai hinted that IMF and his government
expect the economy possibly expanding at a flat zero percent or a
slight 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, this forecast will mean nothing, as forecast in the
previous four letters of intent, if the currency and banking
crisis continues in Japan and other emerging markets.

<HEADLINE> Assassin of Iran's Former Chief Prosecutor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- One of the assassins of former
Iranian chief prosecutor Assadollah Lajevardi died here of wounds
Wednesday, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Ali Akbar Akbar Dehbalaie, member of Iran's outlawed Mujaheddin
Khalq Organization (MKO), died despite doctors' efforts to save
him, a source of the Information Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Dehbalaie, who shot dead Lajevardi in Tehran on Sunday with a
suspected accomplice, was arrested by the police after being
wounded at the scene. His fellow MKO member managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
The police are continuing efforts to capture the fugitive, the
IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Lajevardi, former head of Iran's Prisons Organization, was a
key member in the Iranian politics before the 1979 Islamic
Revolution. He was a supporter of the conservative Iranian Majlis
(Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri in last year's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was one of the main political groups which toppled the
shah in the Islamic Revolution. But it was outlawed in 1981 due to
sharp differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the MKO carried out a series of attacks
on Iranian targets inside and outside the country. In retaliation,
the Iranian air force has launched strikes against MKO's bases in
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> India Calls For New Agenda for NAM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee Wednesday called upon all members of the
non-aligned movement (NAM) to develop a new agenda for the South
behind which all members should unite.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to newsmen here on the eve of the forthcoming
NAM summit to be held in Durban, South Africa from August 29 to
September 4, Vajpayee said that there was a pressing need for the
NAM members to have a new developing agenda for the South.
</P>
<P>
The first and second oil crises in 1973 and 1979 and the debt
crisis of the 1980s had severely weakened many NAM countries and
provided the developed states the opportunity to effectively stall
progress in the North-South dialogue, he said.
</P>
<P>
The priorities of NAM continue to be the core issues of peace,
disarmament and development, he said, adding that these could be
achieved only through solidarity, collectivism, tolerance and
popularism.
</P>
<P>
"Intolerance and conflict can lead us nowhere. Instead of
frittering away energies in disputes, NAM countries should work
together so that the common agenda of promoting and achieving
peace, disarmament and development could be carried forward with
full vigor," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee called for a unified response from NAM countries on
issues like nuclear disarmament, combating terrorism, negotiations
in the World Trade Organization and the environment problem, etc.
</P>
<P>
Referring to India's nuclear tests in May this year, he said
that the May nuclear tests in no way detracted India from its long
standing commitment to the goal of global nuclear disarmament and
elimination of nuclear weapons.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing offices of 27
foreign and Hong Kong law firms have donated a total of 94,000
U.S. dollars (655,000 yuan, 15,000 US dollars, and 20,000 HK
dollars) to Chinese flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Gao Changli expressed his appreciation for
their magnanimity at a donation ceremony held here today.
</P>
<P>
Handel C.H. Lee, an attorney with the U.S. law firm of Winson
&AMP; Elkins, who donated 100,000 yuan and 10,000 U.S. dollars, said
that he practices law and lives in China under the protection of
the society and its legal system, has a lot of Chinese friends,
and has deep affection for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"I will do what I can to help the victims," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth D.C. Chan, a partner of the British law office of Allen
&AMP; Overy, said his law firm has been growing rapidly since entering
China in 1988 and he felt he should do something to aid those in
difficulty.
</P>

According the minister of justice, lawyers across China have
donated 80.02 million yuan so far to aid the flooded areas.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Group Claims Responsibility for Cape Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A tiny, radical group
calling itself Muslims Against Global Oppression has claimed
responsibility for Cape Town bombing in a telephone call to a
Cape Town radio station.
</P>
<P>
The caller said that the blast was in retaliation for United
States attacks on suspected terrorists' bases in Sudan and
Afghanistan. He declared that the "Jihad", or "holy war", had
begun.
</P>
<P>
The same group had staged protests and burnt American flags
during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to South Africa in
March.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make all Muslims aware of the global onslaught
against Islam by the Zionists and their allies in the west,
especially America," the group's chairman, Abdulatief Abrahams,
said during the protest against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A devastating bomb ripped through a busy restaurant in Cape
Town Tuesday night, killing a woman and injuring at least 25
others, local media said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, an explosive device was left in the
bar part of the U.S.-franchise cafe, which is in the heart of the
harbor complex. It exploded at 7.20 p.m. local time when the
restaurant was packed with tourists and after-work revelers.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. embassy official said the U.S. government had been
informed of the attack but added: "At this point we don't have
enough information to offer any reaction."
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. official was quoted as saying the Muslim group
had no known links to suspected terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"From earlier accounts, it sounded like a fairly low-tech pipe
bomb, which is not the normal (modus operandi) of groups like Bin
Laden's," he said, adding it might be a group acting
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the group was known to the U.S. authorities
and "believed to be violent."
</P>
<P>
The United States have accused Bin Laden, an exile Saudi
millionaire, of masterminding the embassy bombs.
</P>
<P>
It launched missile strikes last week after more than 250
people were killed in the August 7 bombings near its embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Djibouti Railway Increases Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ethio-Djibouti Railway
transported 21,000 tons of goods in July compared to 14,000 tons
in April, General Manager of the railway Ali Abdallah Gadid has
announced here.
</P>
<P>
It has also increased its fuel transport capacity by 4,600
tons during the same period, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the import/export of Ethiopia has turned to Djibouti,
we have almost 45 percent of the goods transported to or out of
Ethiopia by the railway," Gadid told the Reporter weekly
newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In the near future, we are looking forward to increasing this
percentage into 60 percent since we are using more locomotives
and we are getting a financial support from the European
Commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best to bring it to a stage where we can
bring at least 60 percent of the goods from Djibouti," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Gadid disclosed that the European Commission has
asked the railway to reduce its staff from 2,500 to 1,300 as the
railway's reorganization move.
</P>
<P>
The 781-kilometer rail track from Ethiopian capital Addis
Ababa to Djibouti Port was built in 1897.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has turned to the port of Djibouti from Assab Port of
Eritrea since the outbreak of the border dispute between Ethiopia
and Eritrea in late May this year.
</P>
<P>
Assab Port transported 80 percent of Ethiopia's import and
export goods while only 20 percent was going through the port of
Djibouti in the past. The Ethio-Djibouti railway handled only 16
percent share of the transport in the past.

<HEADLINE> S. African Central Bank Warns Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's central
bank will encourage its currency Rand to strengthen from time to
time, the bank governor announced.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an annual general meeting of the Reserve Bank
Tuesday, Chris Stals said that the bank would adopt a more
flexible exchange rate policy to shift the Rand from its one-way
street of depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The currency has lost about 20 percent of its value against a
basket of currencies in the past months due to speculative
attacks from abroad, Business Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To protect the Rand, the central bank has raised its
repurchase rate, at which it lends money to commercial banks,
from below 15 percent to 24 percent at its highest.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that if there was a surplus on the balance
of payments, the Rand should be allowed to strengthen, creating
some uncertainty in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Reserve Bank was quick to absorb any
oversupply of foreign exchange in times of balance of payments
surplus but reluctant to sell foreign exchange in times of
deficit.
</P>
<P>
This allowed speculators who believe the Rand is a sitting
duck to bet against its appreciation, said Stals.
</P>
<P>
"Under current conditions of financial globalization, this
policy obviously provides an open invitation to currency
speculators who are offered a one-way bet in the South African
market," said the governor.
</P>
<P>
The policy was changed because of the improved foreign
reserves situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the country's gross reserves had risen to
58.3 billion Rand (9.3 billion U.S. Dollars), the highest ever
and equivalent to four months' worth of imports.
</P>
<P>
It was no longer the Reserve Bank's first priority to
accumulate foreign exchange reserves when there were capital
inflows, Stals said, adding that exchange controls had to be
scrapped to allow the private sector to hold more liquid foreign
assets.
</P>
<P>
"Such assets can serve as a useful buffer between external
market disturbances and the Reserve Bank," allowing the bank to
reduce its role in the spot and forward markets, said the central
bank governor.

<HEADLINE> Over 900 Congolese Refugees Flee into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 900 refugees
from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have fled into
Tanzania to escape the fierce battles between the rebels and the
government troops, a United Nations official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Parker, senior external relations officer of the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) official said that more
Congolese refugees would escape the battles and come to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
By last Sunday, 927 refugees from the DRC had arrived in the
Kigoma region in west Tanzania, Parker told Xinhua in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
Parker said that 684 Congolese citizens have been transported
to the Nyarugusu refugee camp in the Kasulu district of the
region for shelters, and the remainder will also be sent there
gradually. The camp can accommodate 50,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian media reports said that some of the refugees from
the DRC arrived in Kigoma with serious physical injuries and are
under medical treatment in hospitals and refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR, Tanzania's Ministry of Home Affairs, the World Food
Program (WFP) and some non-governmental organizations, are
jointly carrying out contingent plans to rehabilitate more
Congolese refugees in Kigoma, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels and the government of DRC President Laurent Kabila
have forced UNHCR to suspend the repatriation exercise, UNHCR
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Before the war erupted in early August, more than 530,000
refugees from the DRC had returned home with the help of the
UNHCR and 40,000 others were waiting for repatriation, Parker
said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, some 600 Tanzanian soldiers who were
training the DRC army were flown back home on Sunday night by two
South African Air Force planes following Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa's order to avoid becoming embroiled in the civil
war of the central African country.

<HEADLINE> New Java Campus Opened in Hong Kong University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The University of Hong Kong
(HKU) opened Wednesday a center for the Authorized Academic Java
Campus (AAJC), to deliver Java training to university students and
those in the community who want to update their skills.
</P>
<P>
"HKU is the only university in Asia to have been awarded, by
Sun Microsystems (which developed the Java language), the status
of official Java campus," HKU Vice-Chancellor Y.C. Cheng told the
launching ceremony of the campus.
</P>
<P>
Java technology is now well established as the most popular
computing platform for networks and the Internet. It has opened up
a wealth of opportunities for interactive information exchanges
and training on demand, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The primary role of the AAJC is to deliver certified training
to university students, thus making them more competitive in the
workplace. The training will be conducted by AAJC staff using
Sun's Java technology course materials as the base.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said, "As we move into the new millennium and the
'knowledge era', the university is well aware of the increasing
importance of telecommunications and information technology (IT)."
</P>
<P>
As one of the leading education institutions in Hong Kong, the
university is moving full steam ahead toward a "digitized campus"
and an IT enriched environment, to produce graduates with the
leadership qualities and contemporary skills required to compete
successfully in the workplace, said the Vice-Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
The center will also offer consultancy services to the local
business community in the use of the technology.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting K C Kwong
also addressed the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated HKU for winning the award. "This is a clear
recognition, not just of the university's ability to use advanced
technologies in its work, but also of Hong Kong's efforts in
keeping itself in the forefront of world IT development," said the
official.

<HEADLINE> Trade Fair Success Despite Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Though flooding has prevented
many people from participating in the '98 Gansu-Lanzhou Trade
Fair, which opened here today, the fair will prove to be another
important bridge linking China's western and eastern regions
together, and a window introducing them to the outside world,
organizers of the event said here today.
</P>
<P>
The fifth of its kind, the fair is expected to attract about
8,000 participants, including 491 from over 40 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Because of the ongoing flooding on the Yangtze River, a number
of representatives were unable to come from the east and central
regions. Hubei Province, for example, hit seriously by the floods,
was able to send only two companies compared with over 20
companies last year.
</P>
<P>
However, organizers still expect that transactions at this
year's fair may even exceed those of last year, since the present
event focuses on investment projects and the trading of property
rights, which involve greater funding than commodity trading.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 investment projects and more than 500 property right items
concerning infrastructure, water conservancy, power,
telecommunications, and reclamation of waste land will be traded
during the five-day event.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Economic Growth Down to Minus Five Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's economic growth
declined to minus five percent in the first half of this year
based on measured gross domestic product (GDP), the lowest growth
rate since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the Bank of Korea
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the bank Chon Chol-whan told a press conference
that South Korea will continue a negative economic growth in the
second half of this year due to reduction in domestic consumption
and sluggish exports.
</P>
<P>
The nation's GDP fell by 3.8 percent in the first quarter of
this year from that of the same period of 1997, Chon added.
</P>
<P>
In the second six months of this year, the decrease in
investment and consumption will likely result in a further
economic downturn and a higher unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to plunging imports, the nation is expected to sustain a
current account surplus in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"However, the current account surplus will likely drop in the
second half of the year as exports are forecast to remain sluggish
due to a weaker Japanese yen and the downing imports of South
Korea from Japan and Southeast Asian nations," said the governor.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that South Korea could enjoy stable
consumer prices in the second half of this year but he can not
rule out the possibility that consumer prices may rise.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the top banker predicted that the nation will have a
tighter employment market in the second half of 1998 as
corporations will further structural reforms and lay off workers.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea will push harder to lower local interest
rates in the coming months of this year as domestic currency
market is stabilized, the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Lethal Brew Toll Hits 80 in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the deadly
"power alcohol" brew has mounted up to 80 in Rift Valley Province
</P>
<P>
The Rift Valley police boss, Jarma Warsame, confirmed Tuesday
that 42 people had died in Narok District and 38 in Maai Mahiu,
Naivasha, since the first case of the brew death was reported a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the death toll was based on "the reports conveyed
to the police by relatives of the victims who had since buried
them in their homes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, dozens of the brew victims are still undergoing
treatment at hospital, some of them partially blind, the Daily
Nation said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Warsame said that the police have arrested 14 suspects
involved in the sale and distribution of the brew, confiscating
more than 100 liters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he warned the public against taking any illicit
drink and urged them to report anyone they suspected of being
involved in the sale of the brew.
</P>
<P>
Nakuru Medical Officer of Health Kipruto Chesang' said Tuesday
that initial analysis indicates the brew, commonly known as power
alcohol, contained ethanol and methanol, the substance normally
used for industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
However, truck drivers plying the old Nairobi-Nakuru road
reportedly siphoned it off while in transit and sold it to local
illicit brewers.
</P>
<P>
Half a glass of the brew is sold at 10 Shillings (0.16 U.S.
Dollars) locally. Victims said the beverage, smelling like
methylated spirit, make them suffering from abdominal pains,
drowsiness and blurred vision.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, 24 Kenyans died and six others went blind
after taking a similar drink.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Admits Military Presence in DR Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan soldiers are now in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a senior government
official has admitted.
</P>
<P>
These troops had been deployed in the war-torn central African
country to protect Uganda's legitimate interests, Ugandan First
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya
Kategaya told Parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But for security reasons, he did not mention the location of
the Ugandan troops in the area, the New Vision daily said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has for sometime now "maintained an appropriate
military presence" in DRC to contain and eventually remove the
rebels who have been using their bases in the area to destabilize
Uganda, said Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating situation in Congo makes it more necessary
than ever for Uganda to maintain this military presence there, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The minister described Uganda's interests as including need to
ensure security in all parts of the country and protection of the
lives and properties of all Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has desire to ensure maximum security in the Great
Lakes region because instability in any neighboring country would
directly impinge on Uganda's security and economic resources, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also denied Uganda's involvement in DRC's current crisis,
saying that Uganda still recognizes President Laurent Kabila's
government in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will continue to work toward a peaceful solution to the
conflict in the DRC, a stance which is not in conflict with that
of Angola and Zimbabwe, he said.

<P>
TOKYO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell sharply in Tokyo
Wednesday as opposition parties' boycott to debate on a set of
financial sector reform bills sparked the possibility of more
delays in putting an end to the country's bad loan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The shares of Japan's 19 biggest banks all fell and a fistful
of them plummeted to new lows for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 206.90 points, or 1.37
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 14,866.03.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 15.37 points or 1.32 percent to
1,147.21.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 400
million shares from Tuesday's 360.54 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the day's most
heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Investors fled from bank shares on news that risky assets held
by the troubled LTCB totaled 2.82 trillion yen (about 19.5 billion
U.S. dollars) as of March 31, far greater than the 1.37 trillion
yen (about 9.5 billion dollars) in problem and non-performing
loans, the ailing bank reported earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Other banking issues also plummeted after the Democratic Party
of Japan and other opposition parties boycotted a Diet
(parliament) committee meeting to discuss six financial
revitalization bills put forth by the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced gainers 937 to 217, with 123 issues remaining unchanged.

MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
adopted a resolution on transforming the state short-term bonds
and federal loan bonds with fixed income maturing by the end of
1999 into new ruble securities maturing in three to five years,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The resolution signed by Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin says that the state short-term couponless bonds (GKO)
and the federal bonds with a fixed and variable coupon income
(OFZ) shall be redeemed ahead of time with the re-investment of
the proceeds in the new state securities.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, the pre-term redemption of the GKO and
the OFZ shall be done from August 26 to September 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Securities holders may reinvest the money in equal amounts in
three new issues of state securities: maturing in three years with
a yield of 30 percent a year; maturing in four years with a yield
of 30 percent in the first three years and 25 percent in the
fourth year; and maturing in five years with a coupon yield of 30
percent in the first three years, 25 percent in the fourth year
and 20 percent in the fifth year.
</P>
<P>
Bonds owned by individual Russian residents and by the Central
Bank are not covered by the ordinance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's internal debts have reached 70 billion U.S. dollars
since the Russian government issued the state short-term bonds for
the first time in the spring of 1993.
</P>
<P>
To ease the monetary crisis, the government decided on August
17 to suspend the circulation of the GKO and transform it into
long-term bonds with lower interest.
</P>
<P>
The government decision to restructure its short-term debt,
announced on Tuesday, means that western investors may expect a
return of at least 30 cents on each dollar invested in Russian
securities, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Losses suffered by foreign holders of Russian papers, who
account for one-fourth of all Russian paper holders, will amount
to more than 70 percent, an expert from the Federal Investors Fund
estimated.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Welcomes India's Acceptance Over Property Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Kamil Idris has welcomed
India's decision to adhere to the Paris Convention for the
Protection of Industrial Property and the Patent Cooperation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Both treaties will become binding on India three months after
the two instruments of accession have been received at WIPO, said
WIPO in a press release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Such a step will benefit the country's technological and
economic development and enhance the international intellectual
property cooperation which WIPO promotes so actively," said Idris.
</P>
<P>
He said he was looking forward to receiving very soon the two
instruments of accession, which are expected to be handed over by
India's representative in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
India will become the 151st country to be bound by the Paris
Convention, which is one of the two basic intellectual property
treaties administered by WIPO. The other is the Berne Convention
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works of which India
has been a member for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Convention lays down basic principles primarily
governing the protection of patents, trademarks and industrial
designs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, India will become the 98th country to be bound by
the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- In an escalation of violence in
south Lebanon, a member of the Israeli allied South Lebanese Army
(SLA) was killed Wednesday by Lebanese guerrillas, the Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The militiaman was killed during fierce fightings with the
anti-Israeli Muslim group Amal Movement in the central sector of
the Israeli self-declared South Lebanon Security Zone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Amal Movement said its units launched
assaults on "enemy's positions" in the western and central sector
of the zone, wounding two SLA members, one seriously.
</P>
<P>
The SLA soldier was killed hours after its ally Israel
suffered the most fierce attack in two years by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which fired 60 rounds of Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 Israelis were wounded in the northern Israeli town
of Kiryat Shimona and Western Galilee area, and hundreds of
Israeli residents had to spend the night in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah attack was in retaliation against the killing of
the Amal's southern commander Hossam Amin by an Israeli missile
earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah and Amal have been waging a guerrilla war in south
Lebanon in a bid to oust the Israeli occupying forces and its
allied SLA from the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out an 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But heavy casualties inflicted on the Israeli troops and the
SLA have prompted a strong domestic call in Israel for a
unilateral departure from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israeli Cabinet endorsed the 20-year-old
United Nations Resolution 425 for a unilateral withdrawal from
south Lebanon, provided the Lebanese government negotiates
arrangments to ensure the safety of its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, saying the U.N. resolution
demands Israel leave its south without any preconditions.

<HEADLINE> New Computer System Developed to Test Animal Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have recently
developed an advanced computer system to test animal memory. This
technique is expected to play an important role in China's animal
experiments for medical use and for future manned space flight
research.
</P>
<P>
"Weightlessness in space may cause disorder in astronauts'
nervous systems. In order to find medications helpful to their
brains, we must experiment on animals first," said Chen
Shanguang, deputy director of the Institute of Space-Medicine
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
"By studying animals, we can determine whether the medicine is
effective for improving their memories," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
"In one of our experiments, we put a mouse on an
electrified platform. If the mouse is clever it will jump onto
the safe platform. The more clever the mouse, the longer it
stays on the safe platform," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In such experiments, the activities of the animals are usually
observed and recorded by researchers. But it is very difficult for
them, because the mice jump repeatedly and rapidly. Human
recording has many errors and the efficiency is low," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Institute of Space-Medicine Engineering have
introduced image analysis and processing technologies in their new
computer detection system which can obtain and process large
amounts of data about the animals' activities.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts have appraised the new computer system and
say it can scientifically test animal memory.
</P>
<P>
The new system will have many uses in the
development of drugs for the treatment of diseases such as senility
and learning disorders, according to Chen.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Still Searching for Missing Airliner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities are still
searching for a missing airliner of the state-run Myanma Airways
which was lost on Monday over Tachilek, eastern Shan state
bordering Laos, according to an information official of the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The official said on Wednesday afternoon that the missing
aircraft has reached the territory of Laos, Myanmar's neighboring
country in the east, but he did not disclose whether the aircraft
landed safely or crashed.
</P>
<P>
On a domestic flight (UB-635) from Yangon to Tachilek Monday
morning, the Fokker XY-AEN, with more than 20 local Myanmar
passengers on board, lost contact with the airport traffic
control tower when it could not land due to bad weather condition
as it was raining in the area and turned back to a nearby airport,
the Heho.
</P>
<P>
The Myanma Airways is operating its internal flight services
with a fleet of seven Fokker-27 and three Fokker-28 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on January 27 this year, a Myanma Airways' passenger
plane Fokker-27 with 41 passengers and four crew members aboard
crashed at Thandwe, Southwestern Rakhine state of the country,
killing 14 persons including two French men and an Italian and
injuring 20 others.

<HEADLINE> Australian Unions, Church, Business Unite Against Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unions, big
businesses, church and welfare groups Wednesday formed a rare
united front to condemn Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party as a
threat to Australia's economy, social cohesion and international
reputation.
</P>
<P>
At a media conference in Melbourne Wednesday, Australian
Council of Trade Union (ACTU) President Jennie George sat
alongside community leaders, including Business Council of
Australia (BCA) President Stan Wallis, to attack One Nation Party
policies.
</P>
<P>
Others included Melbourne Catholic Archbishop George Pell,
Anglican Archbishop Keith Raynor and a representative of the
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
George said despite differences between the ACTU and BCA on
issues like tax reform, the two organizations were firmly united
in combating One Nation Party's racist policies.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned about growing intolerance and racism in our
community and the effect that has on migrant workers I represent,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The new alliance, formed at the initiative of former prime
minister Bob Hawke, issued a joint statement rejecting One Nation'
Party's stand on immigration and Aboriginal issues.
</P>
<P>
"(One Nation Party policies) threaten both our internal
cohesion and our international reputation. They should be
decisively repudiated by all Australians," it said.
</P>
<P>
About four out of every 10 Australians are post-World-World-II
immigrants, or the children of such immigrants, and half of them
came from non-English speaking backgrounds, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Asia, in particular, has become and will remain fundamentally
important to the economic welfare of this and succeeding
generations of Australians, especially in terms of the exports of
our primary and mineral products, manufactured goods and services,
our tourist industry and the growing education sector, which
currently caters for some 130,000 students from Asia."
</P>
<P>
Wallis said One Nation Party posed a serious threat to jobs
and Australia's international standing in trying to put up walls
between Australians.
</P>
<P>
The One Nation Party, founded by Australian federal MP Pauline
Hanson a year ago, has shocked the nation by becoming the third
largest party in the state of Queensland during the state's
election earlier this year, winning 11 seats in the state
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Economic Review: China's Financial Market Remains Stable (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xinhua Writer Xu Xingtang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis that
erupted last July has forced the devaluation of most Asian
currencies, but not the Chinese RMB yuan, which has remained
stable at a level lower than one U.S. dollar per 8.28 RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about a yuan depreciation continue in the overseas
media, but every time concerns are erased by the exchange rates
published by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central
bank. Speculators on the black market have found it hard to profit
from betting on a devalued yuan.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the stability of the yuan is a reflection of China's
overall financial market.
</P>
<P>
As the financial markets of Southeast Asian countries and Japan
and South Korea melt down, China is busy implementing its
scheduled financial reforms, with its financial market in good
order; when the financial storm sweeps across Russia, China
becomes a safe island in the center of the storm, playing a
significant role in stabilizing Asian and even global economies.
</P>
<P>
Some observers claim that the major reason for the stable
financial market is the Chinese government's good record in
handling financial issues, and this in turn has cultivated
confidence in its people.

<HEADLINE> Economic Review: China's Financial Market Remains Stable (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
As early as 1993, Chinese leaders noticed the bubbles in its
economy and the risks to the financial sector, and subsequently,
adopted stringent measures to cool down a pressured economy. As a
result, China's economy had a soft landing in 1997 while many
other Asian countries were trapped in deep crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This sharp contrast raised the image of the government in the
heart of the populace," said Jin Pei, a noted economist with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that so far this year all of China's
financial indicators are healthy: a stable yuan RMB rate, a
balance of international payments, strong foreign exchange
reserves of 140.5 billion yuan, orderly banking operations, and
securities markets that are being readjusted toward a healthy
track.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese leaders have time and again pledged that the
yuan will not be devalued. Vice-Governor of the PBOC, Liu
Mingkang, recently warned speculators not to bet against the yuan,
"China is a big player," he said with confidence.
</P>
<P>
Although the speed of China's economic growth has been
declining, its seven percent growth in the first half of this year
is still the world's highest. The first half also saw a trade
surplus of 22.6 billion U.S. dollars and contracted foreign
direct investment of 24.2 billion U.S. dollars.

</P>
<P>
To reach this year's economic growth target of eight percent,
China has used both financial and fiscal measures to expand
investment and stimulate domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
When China issued 125 billion yuan in treasury bonds earlier
this year, it met with enthusiastic buying from the public,
largely attributable to the government's credit record in the
timely redemption of mature bonds.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China severely punished a
number of banks and securities firms for breaking regulations,
forcing a considerable amount of illegal capital to leave the
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that this move has largely cut down the
bubbles in the securities market, providing a better regulated
and healthier environment in which the markets can develop.
</P>
<P>
As part of the financial reforms, China pushed its commercial
banks into the market by revoking the ceiling on bank loans in
January. Commercial banks have been given the right to run
themselves in accordance with the asset to liability ratio.
</P>
<P>
While reforming the financial system and rectifying the
financial order, China has not slowed the pace of opening up its
financial market.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC announced this month that it has decided to allow more
overseas banks to do RMB yuan-based business, and authorized
Shenzhen to become the second locality for experimentation with
RMB yuan-based business by overseas banks. A few overseas
insurance companies have also been allowed to enter the China
market.
</P>
<P>
With the central government's stimulation measures gradually
taking effect in the second half of this year, the country's
economy is expected to recover month by month, and the financial
market will be able to maintain its stable momentum, according to
some experts.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province Striving to Fulfill Foreign Trade Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 26 (Xinhua) --North China's Hebei Province
will try by all means possible to fulfill this year's goals of a
ten percent growth in exports and a five percent increase in the
volume of paid-in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that from January to June, the province
conducted 1.96 billion U.S. dollars of foreign trade, up 1.1 percent
over the same period last year, and received an inflow of 830
million U.S. dollars, down by 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though the province maintained export growth during the first
six months of the year, the growth rate became smaller month by month.
On the other hand, imports, as well as overseas-financed businesses,
were increasing slowly during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Cai Limin, deputy governor of Hebei, pledged that his province
would try harder to see that existing overseas-backed enterprises
in the province operate successfully.
</P>
<P>
The province will help overseas-financed enterprises solve
production problems such as capital shortages, and continue to
improve the investment environment, reduce the burdens on
enterprises, and work out effective measures to encourage exports,
the deputy governor said.
</P>
<P>
The competitiveness of local products on overseas market will
be improved by fostering a group of high-quality commodities for
export and expanding the overseas market by solidifying existing
overseas market and maintaining the priority of opening up markets
in Latin America, eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The province will also speed up the reform of state-owned
foreign trade companies and aid successful companies to
become listed on various stock exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Taliban's Offer to Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has rejected an offer by the
Afghan Taliban militia to hold talks on the hostage issue, the
Iran News daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Taliban denies kidnaping 11 Iranian diplomats
and a journalist, Tehran will not enter into talks with the
group, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks after a Taliban official voiced the
group's readiness to hold talks with Iran to solve the issue of
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Tehran accuses the Taliban of detaining 11 Iranian diplomats at
its Mazari Sharif Consulate in northern Afghanistan and a reporter
of the official news agency IRNA on August 8 when the group
conquered the city.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Islamic group, however, has rejected Iran's claim,
saying that it has no information about the whereabouts of the
Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iran is believed to support Taliban's rival the Northern
Alliance led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was kicked out
of the capital Kabul by the Taliban forces in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran would hold Pakistan, Taliban's strong
supporter, responsible for the fate of the detained Iranian
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan supports the Taliban militia, which is controlling
most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Iran and Pakistan have been holding contacts over
the hostage issue.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Tehran early the week, Pakistani Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Sidique Khan Kanju promised that his
country would spare no efforts to help release the Iranian
diplomats.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Revises Firearms Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- All 700,000 firearms in New
Zealand
will have to be registered within two years under a revised
firearms
legislation, a local newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, individual guns will be
registered
at a cost of 7.5 NZ dollars each and owners' license fees will be
increased from 57 NZ dollars to 110 NZ dollars.
</P>
<P>
Penalties for possessing unlicensed firearms are toughened and

widened.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion said that the revised firearms legislation
requires the
police to keep an auditing program to identify "high risk" gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted New Zealand Police Minister Jack Elder as
saying that
he does not ban military-style semi-automatics because he wants to
keep
gun owners "on board", rather than "waving a big stick" by
threatening to
seize their guns.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 military-style semi-automatic guns are still
"missing",
after the 1992 Arms Amendment Act required owners to register
them,
according to gun policy researcher Philip Alpers.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Exports Increase in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's exports
registered a
7.7 percent increase in July, compared with the same month of last
year.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement issued here Wednesday, NZ Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith said that the increase is of
"tremendous credit" to New Zealand exporters.
</P>
<P>
"With many exporters hit by the Asian economic crisis, this
effort is
outstanding," Smith said. "Our exporters have responded
magnificently and
deserve every New Zealander's congratulations."
</P>
<P>
According to the media statement, the provisional figures
suggest
merchandise exports in July were 1.9 billion NZ dollars (nearly
one
billion U.S. dollars), compared with 1.8 billion NZ dollars (about
0.9
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The result would mean New Zealand has enjoyed its best July
trade
balance since 1992, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The media statement said that on an annual basis, New Zealand's

exports increased to 21.7 billion NZ dollars (about 10.85 billion
U.S.
dollars) in the year to July 31, 1998, compared with 21 billion NZ

dollars (about 10.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the previous year,
registering a 3.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that New Zealand has an economy that allows its
exporters
to "respond quickly to changing market conditions" and "weather
external
events".

<HEADLINE> Australia Cotton Output Hits Record High </HEADLINE>

<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia's cotton industry
Wednesday announced it had made agricultural history by
outproducing the wool industry with its crop harvested during the
fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Cotton Industry Council (ACIC) Wednesday
announced 3.037 million bales of cotton, a record high, had been
produced in the 1997-1998 fiscal year, with raw cotton production
at 681,000 tons outstripping greasy wool production at 636,000
tons for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"Australia can now proudly claim it produces two of the world's
greatest natural fibers," ACIC chairman Peter Corish said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Reaching the three million mark and another record production
level is a major milestone for the cotton industry, which now
generates 1.5 billion Australian dollars (900 million U.S.
dollars) worth of exports for the nation," Corish said.
</P>
<P>
He said the production record, up from 2.7 million bales last
year, was largely due to improved availability of irrigation
water, which led to an expansion in cotton areas to 428,000
hectares.

BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Qi Qi, the world's only
white-flag dolphin raised in captivity, has lived in Wuhan,
capital of central China's Hubei Province, for eighteen years.
</P>
<P>
Qi Qi, found at the age of three near Dongting Lake on the
Yangtze River in 1980, now shares with two finless black porpoises
a spacious tank in a modern aquarium jointly built by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Japanese scientists.
</P>
<P>
White-flag dolphin, the most endangered dolphin species, are
found only in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Experts note the population of white-flag dolphin has shrunk to
less than 100 and thus the species is even more endangered than the
giant panda. The decline in the number of dolphin has been
attributed to the rapid development of fishing, shipping, water
conservancy and environmental pollution along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to protect the endangered dolphin have attracted
attention worldwide. For example, the Japanese government donated
cash and equipment totalling 10 million yuan (1.2 million US
dollars) to help the CAS build the world's only modern aquarium
for white-flag dolphin.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Japanese scientists have achieved great progress in
raising white-flag dolphin and have published two books and over 20
academic papers on the endangered species.

the United States to lift sanctions on his country so as to
stablize the situation in southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, who made the remark during a meeting in Belgrade
with Christopher Hill, a U.S. presidential envoy and ambassador to
Macedonia, said that if the U.S. really wants to maintain
stability in the region, it should first lift its sanctions on
Belgrade, because the long-standing sanctions have brought serious
difficulties to Yugoslavia's economy, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- India's pepper exports of the
past five months this year registered the lowest in the past six
years, said a Spices Board report here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During January-May this year, India's global pepper exports
slipped nearly 40 percent to 10,878 tons against 17,655 tons
during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the sharp rise in prices, pepper exports during
the first quarter from India dipped to 10,000 tons from 14,382
tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Lack of containers, increase in freight rates and financial
problems -- all added to the woes of pepper exporters during the

<HEADLINE> Israelis in North Spend Night in Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the northern
Israeli town of Kiryat Shimona spent Tuesday night in bomb
shelters after Lebanese guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets to the
north.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were lightly injured or suffered from shock
as a result of the Katyusha rocket attack Tuesday night on Kiryat
Shimona and the Western Galilee area in northern Israel, Israeli
army said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah fired about 60
rockets to avenge the killing of Hossam Amin, southern commander
of another Muslim guerrilla group Amal.
</P>
<P>
Amin was killed near the port city of Tyre when his car was hit
by the air-to-surface missiles fired by an Israeli helicopter
gunship.
</P>
<P>
The latest Katyusha attack was the heaviest in two years after
Israel and the Hezbollah signed a ceasefire pact in April 1996
after the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
The rockets landed in Kiryat Shimona at around 10:00 PM (1900
GMT), when people were still walking in the streets in towns,
sitting in coffee shops or attending wedding parties.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the past, there was no prior warning for the Tuesday
attack, which caused widespread panic among the Israeli residents,
knocked out power lines and inflicted property damages.
</P>
<P>
After the attacks, hundreds of northern residents spent the
night in bomb shelters. In reaction, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai held emergency consultations with senior army commanders
on how to protect the safety of northern towns.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was expected to pay a visit to the north, while
Israel's Inner Cabinet will meet Wednesday morning to discuss its
response.
</P>
<P>
It was feared that the latest Katyusha attack could escalate
the fighting between Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas in
south Lebanon, where Israel has established a
1200-square-kilometer security zone to protect its north since
1985.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Muslim guerrillas, spearheaded by Hezbollah, have
been fighting a tenacious war to oust Israeli troops from south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Congress Holds Key Posts in Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress (NC) still
holds key posts after the cabinet reshuffle Wednesday though it
vacated some to its new partner the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
Radio Nepal said Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala holds
concurrently the portfolios of royal palace affairs, defense and
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Shailaja Acharya, Govinda Raj Joshi and
Ram Saran Mahat from NC still lead the ministries of water
resources, home and finance respectively, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
After the reshuffle, NC has 13 ministers in 16 ministries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CPN-ML has eight ministers and two state ministers
and three assistant ministers at 10 ministries including
information and communications, law and justice, agriculture,
local development and tourism and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government has a total of 32 members including 21
ministers, four state ministers and seven assistant ministers.
</P>
<P>
Radha Krishna Mainali, member of the politburo of CPN-ML and
minister of information and communications, will lead his party in
the government.
</P>
<P>
Before the minority government led by Koirala came to power in
mid-April, NC and CPN-ML discussed the formation of a coalition
government but failed due to a dispute over the allocation of some
key posts.
</P>
<P>
CPN-ML began to throw its weight behind the government in July
after the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML, from whom it broke away in early March, withdrew its
support.
</P>
<P>
CPN-ML had helped get passed in the parliament the policies and
programs and budget tabled by the government for the 1998/99
fiscal year which began in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
It does not want the government to fall for early polls as it
is in the course of reorganizing itself for the fresh general
elections due before November 1999, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The new coalition government now has a comfortable majority of
at least 128 seats in the 205-member Lower House of the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> NBA's Guaranteed Contracts Hearing to Resume Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The NBA guaranteed contracts
arbitration hearing will have to take a longer time than
expected,it was announced in New York today.
</P>
<P>
A nine-day adjournment was announced on Tuesday, meaning a
verdict might not come until October when training camps are
scheduled to open.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was supposed to have been the final day of the two-day
hearing, but instead, three additional days have been added on
September 3, 4 and 8.
</P>
<P>
Arbitrator John Feerick will have 30 days to render his
decision. The two sides would have had to work out a new
collective bargaining agreement and possibly start the season on
time November 4.
</P>
<P>
The league said September 3 was the next mutually agreeable
date for the owners, players and arbitrator, although the union
claimed commissioner David Stern's vacation plans and the start
of the semester at Fordham University, where Feerick is a law
school dean,necessitated the nine-day adjournment.
</P>
<P>
The hearing lasted more than six hours Tuesday, for a total of
14 hours over two days. On Day 2, lawyers for each sides spent
time arguing the admissibility of certain documents - including a
contract containing unique lockout language signed by Sacramento
Kings center Olden Polynice in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Our position hasn't changed. We want to litigate and resolve
this issue as soon as possible on behalf of our players. We're
looking forward to resuming the hearing," union director Billy
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
This hearing concerns the union's claim that owners should be
liable to pay some 800 million worth of salaries due to 220
players who have guaranteed contracts for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the league contend employees never get paid during
lockouts.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fires Katyusha Rockets to Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's anti-Israeli Shiite
Muslim group Hezbollah late Tuesday night fired a large barrage of
Katyusha rockets to northern Israel to avenge the killing of a
Lebanese guerrilla chief.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 Katyusha rounds, fired in two batches, fell on the
western Galilee district and the northern Israeli border town
Kiryat Shimona, wounding at least 12 Israelis, including two
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Katyusha shelling caused widespread panic among Israeli
residents in Kiryat Shimona, because, unlike in the past, there
was no prior warning for the attack.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Hezbollah (Party of God) told the local
newspaper Daily Star that the Katyushas were response to the
Tuesday killing of Hussam Amin, southern commander of another
anti-Israeli Muslim group Amal, and the wounding of several
Lebanese civilians in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Amin was killed near the port city of Tyre when his car was hit
by the air-to-surface missiles fired by an Israeli helicopter
gunship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes also shelled villages in north of
the Israeli occupied south Lebanon, wounding at least six Lebanese
civilians, including a child.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Hezbollah had run out of patience
with Israel's "relentless assaults, destruction, terrorism and
systematic killing of our citizens."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Amal movement are waging
a guerrilla war trying to oust Israeli occupying forces from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Economy Not Affected by Russian Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Minister of Economy
Chikan Attila said Tuesday that "the economic crisis in Russia has
no direct effect on Hungarian economy."
</P>
<P>
Attila made the statement after an emergency cabinet meeting
chaired by Prime Minister Orban Viktor to discuss the current
economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with former French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Viktor said Hungary does
not have close economic relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Jarai Zsigmond said after the meeting that
the recent stock and currency market turbulence in Budapest had
nothing to do with domestic economic problems. He said it was
caused by external factors.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent past, Hungarian stock indices went down
steadily. One U.S. dollar bought 221.33 Hungary forint on Monday,
up from less than 190 forint in early July.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Bank of Hungary Surany Gyorgy said
however that the forint devaluation does not exceed a reasonable
limit of a floating market.
</P>
<P>
To stablize the currency, the Hungarian government has adjusted
down the devaluation range in a week of forint from 1.2 percent to
0.8 percent.

PRAGUE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales dropped by 6.7
percent in Czech Republic in the first six months of this year
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
An official of the National Statistics Bureau told reporters
Tuesday the decline was 2.4 percent in January, 6.7 percent in
March, 11 percent in May and 7.4 in June compared with the
respective months last year.

<P>
A shop manager in downtown Prague said that not a hi-fi set in

before.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in the catering sector dropped by 11 percent in
June compared with the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Business people attributed this situation to economic
sluggishness in the country. The state's wage growth control has
led to the reduction of actual earnings of the employees and hence
their declining purchasing power.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Faces Difficulties in Rubber Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's attempt to produce
rubber blocks to replace conventional rubber sheets may face
difficulties due to its high production costs when compared with
competitors Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is encouraging the industry to manufacture
more rubber blocks for exports to meet high demand from
international markets, especially Europe and the United States,
the newspaper The Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The markets in Europe and the United States are now dominated
by Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Preecha Petchmala, head of the rubber
auction center at the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund, as saying
conventional smoked rubber sheets account for 60 percent of local
rubber production, rubber blocks 25 percent and rubber concentrate
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Indonesia and Malaysia, rubber blocks account for
90 percent of their production, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the depreciation of the Indonesian currency, the
rupiah, has given the country a price advantage over Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's rubber and rubber-related industries generate more
than 100 billion baht (2.5 billion U.S. dollars) annually, of
which 50 billion to 60 billion baht (1.25 billion-1.5 billion
dollars) comes from natural rubber products.
</P>
<P>
The industry employs about 4 million people.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar health authorities
are modifying and improving the strategy for the integrated
management of maternal and infant diseases in an effort to reduce
deaths among children under five.
</P>
<P>
The strategy includes maternal health care in addition to the
improvement of children's health, Deputy Minister of Health Dr.
Mya Oo was quoted by Wednesday's newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Plans have also been drawn up in combination with water and
sanitation activities and measures taken to prevent water-borne
diseases affecting children, Mya Oo told officials of the Health
Ministry and non-governmental organizations here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar adopted the strategy and adapted it to local conditions
and situation and a pilot project for the implementation of the
activities was carried out in three districts.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister called for urgent extension of the
activities to significantly reduce the mortality of children under
five by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar began conducting maternal and child health care
services across the country in the 1950s, various programs and
projects have been implemented for prevention and control of
infectious diseases, reducing infant and maternal mortality rates
by half in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the infant and maternal mortality rates were 48.6 and
1.7 per 1,000 births respectively, according the latest official
statistics.

<HEADLINE> Committee to Oversee Thailand's Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A 10-member committee will be
established to oversee financial reforms announced by the Thai
government on August 14, a government press release available
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Restructuring Advisory Committee would be chaired
by Panas Simasathien, a former finance minister, with
representatives from the Finance Ministry and Bank of Thailand
being appointed committee members.
</P>
<P>
The committee will screen financial institutions applying for
capital assistance from the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the August 14 reform plan, financial institutions can
raise capital funds by exchanging preferred shares or subordinated
debt for government bonds.
</P>
<P>
Applicants for the preferred share scheme must draft a
restructuring plan, set up full provision for bad debts and have
shareholders accept any losses first.
</P>
<P>
The subordinated debt scheme is tied to the level of debt
restructuring and new lending made by financial institutions. The
level of state capital reduces with time, an incentive for firms
to move quickly with restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The new committee will also oversee the implementation of
reform plans for state banks.
</P>
<P>
The committee's mandate runs until March 31, 2001.

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cenapred said the highest intensity eruption occurred at 16:13
local time (GMT 21:13) and lasted for 29 minutes on Monday. The
volcano produced vapors, gases and a smoke and ash column reaching

Several hours later, the eruptions generated low intensity ash
rain on the towns of Ozumba and Atlautla in the State of Mexico.

COLOMBO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite proclaimed high security
and numerous road blocks in Sri Lanka's capital city Colombo, to
prevent Tamil rebel attacks, blatant violence has gone unabated.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening Tamil rebel suspects shot at and seriously
injured an army captain when his vehicle stopped at a traffic
light intersection in the heart of the city at Bambalapitiya.
</P>

nearby checkpoint, police said.
</P>
<P>
The captain is in critical condition at the Colombo National
Hospital. His driver is suffering from shock.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that this is the work of the pistol gang of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
</P>
<P>
On the previous night a millionaire businessman, Niroshan
Sellamuttu, who went downtown to keep a business appointment was
attacked by a gang and hacked to death.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Build Faster Internet Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Tuesday that it
is going to build the world's first national optical network,
which is poised to change the way of high-speed research and
information exchange.
</P>
<P>
The network, nicknamed CA*net 3, will deliver unparalleled
network capability to Canadian research institutions and
universities faster than any existing commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
Though the initial use of the network will be in support of
Canada's high technology and research communities, it will
eventually have tremendous impact on all Canadians, according to
Industry Department of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The network will be fully active as early as this October. It
is expected to filter down to the average Canadians in about two
years.
</P>
<P>
Unlike existing networks, which have been built primarily to
support voice communications, CA*net 3 is being built specifically
as an Internet network with voice traffic treated as just another
form of data.
</P>
<P>
With its vast capacity to carry multi-media traffic, the third
generation network will enable numerous eduation, health and
research applications not possible on today's networks.
</P>
<P>
The new network is a joint project between the Canadian
government and a private sector consortium, which is made up of
Bell Canada, Nortel, Newbridge and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost about 120 million Canadian dollars (77
million U.S. dollars), the government said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Urges U.S. to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic urged the United States on Tuesday to lift sanctions on
his country so as to stablize the situation in southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the remark during a meeting in Belgrade with
Christopher Hill, a U.S. presidential envoy and ambassador to
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged views on the current situation in southeast
Europe, according to Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that if the U.S. really wants to maintain
stability in the region, it should first lift its sanctions on
Belgrade, because the long-standing sanctions have brought serious
difficulties to Yugoslavia's economy.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo issue, Milosevic reiterated that the matter can
only be resolved through peaceful political
discussions. Meanwhile, he said efforts should be made to restore
the economy, create jobs and raise the living standards of Kosovo
residents.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also said that to curb terrorism in Kosovo is a
pre-condition for stablizing the situation and enabling residents
to lead a peaceful life.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) ended the third day
of nuclear talks Tuesday, with both sides remaining tight-lipped
on the subject and outcome of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks, again at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations
in New York, started at 10:30 a.m. and ended at 7:10 p.m.. The DPRK
delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye-kwan, left the
meeting venue without saying anything.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, made only
a one-sentence statement: "the U.S. delegation is going back to
Washington for consultations." He refused to make any further
comment on either the atmosphere or agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both sides met on Friday and Monday. The U.S. delegation was
led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had disclosed that the implementation of the
1994 Agreed Framework is among the topics of discussions.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Pyongyang will freeze a graphite reactor
program in exchange for the construction of two light-water
reactors with the capacity of 1,000 megawatts each.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Japan and South Korea have been committed to the
project called the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Four years have passed, and there are still problems
to be solved for the smooth implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has been complaining about the delay in annual
delivery of 500,000 tons of fuel oil by the U.S. when Congress
is blocking the funds for the delivery.

<P>
TOKYO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Two jet fighters from Japan's Air
Self-Defense Force (ASDF) disappeared off the coast of Aomori
Prefecture in northeastern Japan on Tuesday, a leading Japanese
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a routine night-flying exercise over the Pacific Ocean,
the two F-1 fighters lost radio contact and disappeared from radar
screens at about 6:59 p.m. (local time), about half an hour after
taking off from the Misawa Air Base, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from a third jet and patrol planes in the area about a
red flash of light over the waters raised the possibility of a
midair collision, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The ASDF dispatched patrol and rescue helicopters to the area
120 kilometers southeast of the Misawa Air Base to search for the
two jets where they reportedly vanished from radar screens.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Expects Preferential Treatment From Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican exporters are
expecting the European Commission to extend the generalized
preference system (GPS) to the industrial sector which will enable
Central American countries to compete in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Exporters Chamber Antonio Burges said here
Tuesday the GPS has placed Central American countries in a
privileged position to compete in the European market.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is our second most important commercial partner. It
gives the best prices for our products," Burges noted.
</P>
<P>
The Exporters Chamber said it expected the enlargement of the
GPS would increase Central America's exports to the European
market.
</P>
<P>
A study by the chamber showed that 17,000 jobs could be
generated by the growth of industrial exports to Europe, which
make up 40 percent of the labor force in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission was reported to decide whether to
include the industrial sector in the generalized preference system
by September or October.

<HEADLINE> Thai State Bank's Bad Loans to Soar After Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's state-owned Krung
Thai Bank (KTB) said its non-performing loans could soar to 360
billion baht (9 billion U.S. dollars) after a planned merge with
First Bangkok City Bank (FBCB) under a recent financial reform
package.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper The Nation Wednesday quoted Executive
Vice-President of KTB Pairoj Varopas as saying the takeover deal
with FBCB will cause such loans to rise substantially.
</P>
<P>
KTB's non-performing loans now stand at 32 percent, or about
200 billion baht (5 billion dollars), of total loans while those
of FBCB amount to 160 billion baht (4 billion dollars), or 68
percent of its total loans.
</P>
<P>
To put all bad loans under control, Pairoj said, an asset
management company will be established, which will be an internal
organization of the bank.
</P>
<P>
He also predicts that the merger deal with FBCB will be
finished within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform package announced by the government on August
14, both good and bad assets of FBCB and only good assets of
Bangkok Bank of Commerce will be transferred to Krung Thai Bank,
making it the country's largest bank with a total asset of 1.3
trillion baht (32.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government is planning to privatize Krung Thai Bank in two
years and lower its stake in the bank to below half after the
privatization.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Postpone Mexico Meeting on Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Energy ministers from Saudi
Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela decided on Tuesday to postpone their
meeting on oil prices and wait for more information on August
prices.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, previously scheduled for this week, would discuss
measures to stop falling oil prices and evaluate results of the
Ryad, Amsterdam and Vienna agreements, a release from the Mexican
Energy Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The release said that energy ministers wanted more information
about August prices to form a more comprehensive view of the
international markets before they could meet again.
</P>
<P>
Though not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), Mexico and Venezuela, along with OPEC members,
have agreed to cut oil production in an effort to boost slipping
prices.
</P>
<P>
As part of the international effort, the three countries
reached an agreement in June to reduce oil exports to 450,000
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices started to fall drastically since the beginning of
the year. With an aim to prop up prices, oil producers have twice
agreed to cut oil production in the first half of 1998. The total
reduction has amounted to 3.1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
But these efforts have not achieved any positive results. The
price for crude oil stood at 12.60 U.S. dollars a barrel in July,
a record low.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay will launch a massive
campaign to vaccinate children on August 31 in an effort to
prevent the possibility of a measles epidemic in the southern
regions of South America.
</P>
<P>
Public Health Ministry said immunization will be free and
mandatory for every Uruguayan child between the ages of 5-14.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has acquired 300,000 doses of the serum in
addition to the doses provided by the Pan-American Health
Organization (PHO) in an effort to eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
The PHO recently raised an alert on a dangerous measles
outbreak in the Southern Cone region, which includes Argentina,
Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the PHO, 1,860 measles cases have
been detected in Argentina. Non-official reports however put the
figure around 3,000 and said 11 children have died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has already spread to Bolivia, where 111 cases
have been reported since May in regions bordering Argentina.
</P>
<P>
PHO experts warn that Paraguay and Uruguay, both neighbors of
Argentina, are under great risk from the epidemic. Experts say
conditions require immediate preventive actions.

<HEADLINE> Half Million Ordered to Evacuate Before Hurricane Bonnie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- About 500,000 people were
ordered to evacuate the Carolina coast on Tuesday as Hurricane
Bonnie roared toward the U.S. east coast in full fury, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency officials urged residents to move off of the Outer
Banks, where there are more than 250,000 people at the height of
the summer vacation season. Officials said it could take more than
30 hours to move them off the islands.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina's New Hanover County, which had been devastated
by Hurricane Fran in 1996, ordered 50,000 people to leave.
</P>
<P>
South Carolina Governor David Beasley ordered the evacuation of
200,000 people, including 120,000 tourists, from coastal areas of
Horry and Georgetown counties.
</P>
<P>
State tourism officials said that one million to two million
people could be affected if mainland beaches along the North
Carolina coast were not evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters extended a hurricane warning southward to Cape
Romain, South Carolina, putting an 800-kilometer stretch of the
U.S. eastern seaboard from Cape Romain to Chincoteague, Virginia,
under alert for imminent hurricane conditions.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), the storm was centered about 460
kilometers south of Cape Lookout, North Carolina, at latitude 30.5
north, longitude 76.2 west. It was moving north-northwest at about
25 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The eye of the hurricane was expected to pass over the Outer
Banks at midday Wednesday, with about half of the storm passing
over land and the more dangerous eastern half staying over sea.
</P>
<P>
Although the storm was still hundreds of kilometers away, three
meters waves were already reported on the North Carolina beach.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane watches extended south to Savannah, Georgia, and
north to Cape Henlopen, Delaware.
</P>
<P>
Before the hurricane warnings were posted for North Carolina,
South Carolina Governor David Beasley had already told 1,000 of
his state's national guardsmen to get ready for the storm.
</P>
<P>
People along the East Coast have been buying emergency
supplies. Plywood, batteries and gas cans were popular items at
hardware stores in North Carolina.

BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- In response to growing
international environmental concerns, the Thai Agriculture
Ministry has announced it would apply ISO 14000 environmental
standard series to all farm products, The Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rubberwood, as one of Thailand's top five exports, will be the
first to have the new standard applied to its plantations and
processing, Suthiporn Chirapanda, deputy permanent secretary of
the ministry, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Once implemented, all rubber trees must be planted outside
protected forests. The slope of the orchard will also be
considered to prevent landslides. Chemical usage, whether in
orchard or processing plant, must also be minimized to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Parawood Association welcomed the news, saying this
would boost the competitiveness of Thai rubber.
</P>
<P>
However, the announcement raised concerns that the new standard
could increase the cost of rubber.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
excavated the largest noble's tomb of ancient Changsha State of
the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), and found nothing but
several strands of hair and a jade fragment.
</P>
<P>
The 5.5-by-3.8-meter tomb, though located ten meters
underground, had been robbed thoroughly before the excavation.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists, not certain when the tomb was robbed, said
it was a great loss because the tomb was at the same level as the
famous Western Han tomb unearthed at Mawangdui in Changsha.
</P>
<P>
The Mawangdui tomb is noted for containing exquisite lacquer,
silk and a jade suite stitched with gold thread.

<HEADLINE> Move to Safer Places: Deer Swim, Tigers Caged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Serious flooding in the Yangtze
and Songhua rivers have driven David's deer and Siberian tigers,
two of the most endangered animals in the world, out of their
homes in central and northeast China; but fortunately, they have
all been evacuated safely.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 David's deer have found a Noah's Ark in the
flooded area, and 52 Siberian tigers have also moved to new homes
in cages away from the flood water, the Shanghai-based Wenhui
Daily reported recently.
</P>
<P>
The deer used to stay in the Shishou Pere David's Nature
Reserve in Hubei Province, located in one of the Yangtze River's
flood diversion areas. When the water level rose sharply early
last month, the deer swam to a 500-meter-long dike in the
afternoon of July 4 under the guidance of herdsmen. The dike area
was designated by the local government as a safe haven for the
deer.
</P>
<P>
"The area has become a Noah's Ark for both the more than 100
David's deer and us," said one herdsman.
</P>
<P>
"Plenty of water plants will grow after the flood recedes, and
a proper living environment for the deer will be restored," said
another.
</P>
<P>
David's deer originated in China where the last wild group
disappeared in 1900. All the deer here are descendants of 18 deer
raised by a British duke early this century.
</P>
<P>
China imported 20 David's deer from Britain in 1985 and has
established three habitats for them, in Beijing and Hubei and
Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
"The reserve in Hubei is the most perfect one for this rare
species, and this deer group is believed to be living in closest
proximity to their natural environment," said Yang Ruosheng, an
expert who studies the deer's ecological environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
Transporting Siberian tigers to a safer place was much more
difficult than evacuating tame deer.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is one of the top ten most endangered
species in the world with only about 300 left in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Some 52 Siberian tigers are living in a breeding center in
Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province. But the largest Siberian
tiger breeding center in the world is located only 400 meters
from the northern bank of the Songhua River.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xinchen, head of the center, made the decision to evacuate
them to another breeding center 253 kilometers from Harbin after
learning that the water level of the Songhua River had risen to
119.46 meters in the early morning of August 15.
</P>
<P>
When evening came, 22 tigers living in tiger sheds were put
into prepared cages and loaded onto trucks.
</P>
<P>
The breeders faced a difficult task when they tried to get the
14 adult tigers from the wildness into cages. But fortunately they
had been fully prepared for this tough job.
</P>
<P>
They had reduced the tigers' food supply for two weeks, and if
the tigers got a bull or a sheep given by visitors, the breeders
pulled it out before they could finish eating it. So when the
hungry tigers found fresh beef hanging in the cages, they stepped
in without hesitation. As soon as they went in, the hidden
breeders closed the cages, heedless of the tigers' angry roars in
the cages. The last tiger was trapped in at 8 a.m. the following
morning.
</P>
<P>
Two trucks, covered with thick waterproof cloth, set out from
the breeding center and passed crowds of flood-fighters without
being noticed.
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 p.m. in the evening of August 16, the 52 Siberian
tigers arrived at their new home and left the flood waters
hundreds of kilometers away.

OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pilots at Canada's largest
airline set on Tuesday a strike deadline of midnight September 1
after talks failed to resolve their dispute over wages and working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the deadline, the Montreal-based Air Canada and Air
Canada Pilot Association have agreed to begin a last-minute talk
on Thursday to try to avert the strike.
</P>

"We have always stated we would prefer a negotiated solution,"
Capt. Jean-Marc Belanger, chairman of the 2,100-member
association, was quoted as saying by local media reports.
</P>

"Yet we feel the company is forcing our hand. We have been
working hard to get a deal since March, but we feel the company
still has not made us an acceptable offer," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The pilots, whose last contract expired on April 21, said they
felt over-worked and earned 30 to 50 percent less than pilots who
fly the same routes for other major North American carriers.

WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
condemned a bomb attack on a U.S.-franchise Planet Hollywood
restaurant in Cape Town, South Africa, saying it was "outrageous

"We are condemning in the strongest terms what appears to be an
outrageous and despicable attack on innocent people, and we are
working closely with the South African authorities to develop
information about the attack," an administration spokeswoman said.

"We will cooperate closely with them to ensure that those
responsible are brought to justice," she said.

<P>
The bomb attack took place at 1720 GMT, which killed a woman
and injured 25 people, according to police in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
A Muslim group, called Muslims Against Global Oppression,
claimed responsible for the blast.

The Muslim group told a South African radio that the attack was
in retaliation for U.S. bombings in Sudan and Afghanistan. "We're
going to fight fire with fire," the group said.
</P>

But the spokeswoman said Washington could not confirm the
attack was made in retaliation for last week's U.S. strikes on

"We don't have information to confirm that this attack was in
fact politically motivated," she said.

<HEADLINE> FAO Reports Famine in Sudan, Other African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 25 (Xinhua) -- There are over 1.2 million people
threatened with famine in Sudan and 17 other African countries who
face "an exceptionally severe food crisis," according to a report
issued Tuesday by the Rome-based United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Besides Sudan, the countries at risk are Angola, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Liberia,
Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Uganda
and Zambia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The food crisis was caused by forced population relocation, bad
weather and bad harvests and lack of local food reserves, it
specified.
</P>
<P>
In southern Sudan, the lack of food and cases of insufficient
nourishment have risen despite the distribution of foodstuffs, to
the point that, in some regions, malnutrition affects 78 percents
of children.
</P>
<P>
The total number of people in need of food in Sudan is 2.6
million and the supplies delivered have grown 50 percent, reaching
150,000 tons a day, mostly in the form of legumes and grains.
</P>
<P>
Conditions in Somalia are also threatening to be particularly
severe because the prospects for this year's grain harvest are
poor and could result in a loss of one third of the necessary
food, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
FAO had better news for countries below the horn of Africa
where better harvests are expected. This should ensure a partial
recovery from the effects of recent floods and droughts.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin To Set Up Offshore Ecological Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, north China's largest
seaport city, will build a special offshore ecological protection
reserve on a recently designated 30-square-kilometer stretch of
shallow sea waters by the end of this year, the international year
of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Located to the south of Dashentang, Shuangqiao Township in
the Hangu District, the projected reserve will have a water depth
ranging from three to five meters. These offshore areas are
the habitat of scallops, oysters, and red spiral shells.
</P>
<P>
The ecological environment of these offshore areas has been
deteriorating since the beginning of this decade because of over
fishing, and the output of scallops, oysters and red spiral shells
has continued to drop.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the shallow seawater reserve is expected to
restore healthy living conditions for scallops and other marine
organisms and ensure sustainable development in these areas.

<HEADLINE> California Governor Urges for More Skilled Foreign Worker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 25 (Xinhua) -- California Governor Pete Wilson
Tuesday urged President Bill Clinton not to veto a bill that would
allow more highly skilled foreign workers to come work for U.S.
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the President, Wilson warned that failure to
increase the cap on the number of skilled workers admitted to the
United States would be detrimental to California, where the high
technology industry has become a cornerstone of economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Republican leaders in the House of
Representatives abandoned plans for a quick vote on a bill that would
have increased the cap on the H-1B temporary visa program after the
Clinton administration threatened to veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that bill, which would have raised the
annual H-1B visa allotment to more than 100,000 by the year of
2000 from the current 65,000, did not contain enough provisions to
keep foreign workers from displacing Americans and to train
U.S. workers to take some of those high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that a temporary increase in the cap is needed to
ensure high-tech companies can hire the specialized personnel they
need to continue to help fuel California's economic growth," Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Valley officials say that their industry's growth is
threatened if they cannot fill thousands of open jobs with foreign
workers.

<P>
WUHAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The floodwaters on the Yangtze
River have caused concern among overseas-funded firms over whether
they could maintain normal production.
</P>
<P>
The biggest producer of Coca-Cola in the country in Wuhan,
capital of central Hubei province, has kept production up for the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
The city's development zone, where most overseas-funded
businesses are located, had an industrial output of 1.12 billion
yuan in July during the most serious flooding, and that was up 7
percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The city government has said that the purpose of flood control
is for development, so normal production should be maintained
while fighting the floods.
</P>
<P>
The Aeolus-Citroen Automobile Company, one of the biggest
enterprises in the zone, has kept automobile production up.

LOS ANGELES -- Intel's new Pentium chip, the 450 MHz Pentium II
introduced Monday, will further send PC prices lower.
</P>
<P>
At least one U.S. retailer, CompUSA, is selling a system with
the new chip for under 2,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When the Pentium II 400 appeared in April, it was sold at 824
dollars, still far below the nearly 1,000 dollars the company
commanded for the first Pentiums five years ago. Now Intel is
selling the new Pentium II 450 to computer makers for 669
dollars. (US-Intel-New Chip)

<HEADLINE> Intel Unveils New Celeron Chips for Low-Priced PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest
maker of microprocessors, said Tuesday that it had priced its new
Celeron chip at 149 U.S. dollar for a 300 megahertz version and 192
U.S. dollar for a 333 megahertz chip, according to reports from the
companies.
</P>
<P>
The new Celeron chips, code-named Mendocino, contain 128 kilobytes
of secondary cache memory that improves how low-priced computers
process video and 3-D graphics, a feature lacking on the original
Celeron.
</P>
<P>
In April, Intel launched its first chip in the new Celeron family
for what it calls the basic PC market, amid reports that it was slower
than competitive chips at slower speeds, because the chip lacked level
two cache, hurting performance.
</P>
<P>
Intel's microprocessors are used in 90 percent of the world's
personal computers. But until now the company has lacked a credible
response to the popular inexpensive chips made by rivals Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp.
</P>
<P>
"Intel was surprised by two things: the rate at which low-cost PCs
grew in importance in the market and the rate at which Intel's
competitors turned out low-cost chips to add to that market," said
Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts on Wall Street agree that, With the new chips, Intel
makes its biggest assault yet on the booming sub-1,000 U.S. dollar PC
market and hits out at its rivals.
</P>
<P>
Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, also introduced a new 450
megahertz Pentium II processor for mainstream performance PCs,
entry-level servers and workstation computers. The 450 Pentium II
processor, priced at 669 U.S. dollar, should outperform the 400
Pentium II version -- the previous top speed -- by up to 10 percent,
Intel said.

LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle
said on Tuesday that Paul Gascoigne could return to the national
team only if he is prepared to fight his way to full fitness.

At a book signing to mark the publication of his controversial

"If he can get himself 100% fit then the door is still open.
He has got the talent it is a matter of whether he can get his

"Paul needs to be ultra fit and he is not that yet. But if he

England need him."

Hoddle was also unrepentant about his decision to reveal
private discussions with Gascoigne and other players, insisting
that none of the England squad had confronted him about his
revelations in his book.
</P>
<P>
"Dressing room situations will always remain private. It has
not been a problem," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- European football governing
body UEFA confirmed on Tuesday that it is planning to merge the
UEFA and Cup Winner's Cup in an attempt to challenge a breakaway
Super League.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the heads of the European leagues, UEFA said
it had discussed changes to its three domestic competitions and
may increase the number of clubs in the Champions League to 32.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said it opposed the formation of a new league composed of
Europe's most elite clubs and has organised a further meeting for
Saturday to discuss other changes to its competitions.
</P>
<P>
UEFA vice president, Antonio Matarrese, said: "This committee
rejects this private project."
</P>
<P>
"The committee does not feel it deserves our attention."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by UEFA general secretary Gerhard
Aigner and the heads of European leagues, including Peter Leaver
of England's Premier League and Franco Carraro of Italy's Serie A.
</P>
<P>
Also attending were leaders of the leagues in Portugal,
Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Matarrese said there were "moments of antagonism" among
members but by the end of the meeting all were in agreement in
opposing the super league plan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came one day after Media Partners discussed their
proposals for a new league with leading European clubs in London.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners hopes to form a Super League by 2000 involving
the biggest names in European soccer, including Bayern Munich,
Ajax,Inter and AC Milan, Manchester United and Arsenal.

<HEADLINE> AEK Athens Survives UEFA Cup Qualifying Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- AEK Athens survived from the
UEFA qualifying round with a 4-0 victory over Ferencvaros on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Demis Nikolaidis had brilliant performance in the game,
scoring a hat-trick in the first half.
</P>
<P>
After a header at the 8th minute into the game, Nikolaidis
added two through two penalties, at 13th and 26th minute
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The only other goal was scored by George Donis at the 63rd
minute in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 4-2 defeat in the first leg, AEK Athens managed to
go through with an aggregate score of 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Former UEFA Cup winner Gothenburg lost out on the away goals
rule to Turkey's Fenerbahce after a 64th minute goal from Elvir
Balic in the second leg of their second qualifying round game.
</P>
<P>
That strike cancelled out Gothenburg's 2-1 lead from the first
leg and guaranteed Fenerbahce's place in Friday's draw in Monaco
for the first round proper of the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Another former winner, Anderlecht, needed a goal five minutes
from time to beat Croatia's Osijek.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian side were hard-pressed by a spirited Osijek team
and looked to be heading for an embarrassing defeat in a
competition they won in 1983 until Romanian midfielder Alin
Stoica slotted home in the 85th minute.
</P>
<P>
Anderlecht's late show gave them a 2-0 win on the night and a
passage through thanks to the away goal they scored in a 3-1
first leg defeat.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians steadied their early nerves with an opening goal
after just four minutes when Norwegian striker Ole Martin Aarst
latched on to a loose ball in the Osijek area.
</P>

But their defensive frailties and profligate finishing always
gave hope to their unfancied visitors who went close half a dozen

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne Divorced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- English football star Paul
Gascoigne's two-year marriage ended in a divorce over his
unreasonable behaviour on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A judge in the London divorce courts granted Gascoigne's wife,
Sheryl, 33, an uncontested divorce after she alleged that the
soccer player's behaviour was so bad she could no longer be
expected to live with him.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, 31, married Sheryl in July 1996. But four months
later she appeared in public bruised and with a black
eye.Gascoigne admitted to losing his temper and hitting her
during a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
Divorce papers were first filed a year ago but the couple
appeared to be trying for a reconciliation in June when the
distraught Gascoigne was sensationally thrown out of the England
squad on the eve of the World Cup soccer tournament in France.
</P>
<P>
They then spent a holiday in Florida with their two-year-old
son, Regan, but friends later said the attempt to save the
marriage had failed.
</P>
<P>
Flamboyant and outspoken, Gascoigne was once regarded as
England's most talented soccer player. But widely-publicised
bouts of drinking and partying as well as injury have taken their
toll on his health and popularity.
</P>
<P>
England manager Glenn Hoddle recounted earlier this month how
the midfielder, nicknamed Gazza, smashed a bedside lamp in a rage
when he was told he had been left out of the World Cup squad
because of doubts over his fitness.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, who now plays for English Premier League side
Middlesborough, later admitted he had been drunk the night before
he was axed.
</P>
<P>
Neither Gascoigne nor his wife were in court for Tuesday's
hearing when their marriage was ended with a rubber stamp along
with a batch of 33 others.
</P>
<P>
The couple still have to agree to a financial settlement and
child custody arrangements -- a process which could take months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence of the
United States fell for the second straight month in August,
affected by turmoil in the world's financial markets and also the
U.S. embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Conference Board reported Tuesday that its
index of consumer confidence fell 4.1 points to 133.1 in August.
The drop was bigger than what Wall Street analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
But is was indicated from a separate report Tuesday that
consumers were not discouraged from making big investments early
this summer.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing single-family homes jumped 4 percent in July to 4.93
million units, surpassing the previous record set in March of 4.89
million.
</P>
<P>
And stocks, which have lost steams since hitting record heights
in July, are regaining some points.
</P>
<P>
According to the Conference Board, more Americans in August
worried that business conditions will worsen in the coming months,
and jobs will be tougher to find. Fewer consumers said they planned
to buy a car, home or major appliance, like a refrigerator,
television or air conditioner, in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
However, even with the two-month drop, consumer confidence is
still the highest it has been since 1969. The index hit a 29-year
high in June.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is based on
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The
index compares results to its base year, 1985, when it stood at
100.

<HEADLINE> Germany Presents First Sino-German Joint Stamp Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUERZBURG, Germany, August 25 (Xinhua) -- German Finance
Minister Theo Waigel presented here Tuesday the first set of
special stamps jointly issued by Germany and China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a presentation ceremony Tuesday in the southern
German city of Wuerzburg, Waigel said the stamps, though only
small art works, would make important contribution to
strengthening the communication between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The set of two special stamps, designed by Chinese painter Xiao
Yutian, dipicts two cultural heritage sites, the Puning Temple in
Chengde, a former imperial summer resort some 250 northeast of
Beijing, and the Wuerzburg Residence in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Puning Temple was built in 1755 with a combination of Han and
Tibetan architecture and has the country's largest wood-carved
Buddha. The Wuerzburg Residence was built in 1719 in the style of
Paris' Versailles Palace. Both were imperial buildings and have
been put on UNESCO's world heritage list.
