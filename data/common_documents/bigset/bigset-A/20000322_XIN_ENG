<P>
At a banquet held in honour of the visiting president, Indian
President Kocheril Raman Narayanan sited as reasons for India's
bid its immense size, population, economic and technological
status, and its "great services" to the cause of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that among the developing nations, India has every
right to be represented on a reformed and expanded Security
Council," Narayanan told Clinton, who began his five-day state
visit to the South Asian country on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president dwelt at length on Kashmir and nuclear
issues, asserting that New Delhi would maintain a "minimum
credible nuclear deterrent -- no more no less -- for her own
security."
</P>
<P>
During his talk with Clinton earlier today, Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee explained reasons that "compel" New
Delhi to maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent but promised not to
conduct further nuclear tests, not to engage in a nuclear arm race
and not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against any country.
</P>
<P>
On Clinton's comment before his departure for his seven-day
South Asian tour that the Indian Sub-continent was the most
dangerous place in the world today and Kashmir a nuclear
flashpoint, Narayanan said "these alarmist descriptions" would
only encourage those who want to break the peace and indulge in
terrorism and violence.
</P>
<P>
He urged Clinton to join him in an appeal to the world to take
concrete and substantial steps towards nuclear disarmament along
with non-proliferation.

<HEADLINE> Militants Attack Army Camp in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The militants, suspected to be a suicide squad, opened heavy
fire and exploded grenades while forcing their way into a small
industrial corporation building housing Border Security Force (BSF)
troops, the PTI quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at around 6 p.m. and intense firing and
explosions were going on, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Troops from nearby camps have been rushed to reinforce the camp
under attack, while the building was cordoned from the outside,
leaving the casualties unknown, the PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, a militant outfit named Lashker-e-Toiba
has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the outfit said that the two attackers were a
suicidal squad and had inflicted heavy casualties on the security
forces after entering the camp, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman even identified the two militants as Abu Imran
and Abu Haris, who he said were still engaged in fierce encounter
with security forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Under the agreement, U.S. exporters to India will now face
lower tariffs by upto one half on items such as almonds, orange
juice, citrus and other fresh fruits," according to a White House
statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was negotiated under the auspices of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), it said, adding that in exchange for its
tariffs cuts in the agricultural items of interest to the U.S.,
India would adjust its tariffs on other agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The United States is not only the largest investor in India but
also India's largest trading partner with two-way trade increased
to 12.79 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, official figures showed.
</P>
<P>

since 1992 at an average rate of 13.7 percent in dollar terms
annually while imports from the United States have been
fluctuating.

dollars in 1998 and grew by 4.6 percent to 3.707 billion dollars

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Regulation on Technological Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The State Council departments
concerned have adopted a new regulation on the registration and
administration of technological contracts, in a bid to promote the
country's high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Science and Technology told a
press conference here today that the new regulation will help
implement the country's contract law adopted by the National
People's Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was jointly drawn up by the Ministry of Science
and Technology, Ministry of Finance and State Administration of
Taxation.
</P>
<P>
He said the regulation is expected to help build a brisk
technological market, as the regulation contains details on how to
financially encourage scientists and technicians who wish to apply
their discoveries to industry.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also contains rules on the administration of the
country's technology market.
</P>
<P>
Over 264,000 domestic technological contracts were signed in
China last year, with a total contracted value of 52.3 billion
yuan (about 6.2 billion U.S. dollars), of which technological
development contracts took the biggest share.

HARBIN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition of foreign
nudities titled "Russia Tour" opened here today, and caused no
fuss among the viewers.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for northeastern Heilongjiang Province to

photographers from the province in Russia are on show.
</P>
<P>
Li Qian, a member of the organizing committee, said, "We didn't
expect people to view this exhibition as an ordinary one. It is so
different from 10 years ago, when people would swarm into the
exhibition hall and gossip about such an exhibition for months."
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to imagine that people today take time to appreciate
this kind of art. Their values have experienced great changes over
the last decade," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last for one month, and is then expected to
tour the province, according to Li.

<HEADLINE> "One China" Principle Must Be Upheld: Non-Communist Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of two non-Communist
parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (
ACFIC) stressed here today their resolute support for the position
of the Chinese government on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jialu, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Association for the Promotion of Democracy (CAPD), said that
peaceful negotiations are the best way to solve the Taiwan issue,
but the prerequisite for a peaceful solution to the issue is the
one China principle, as pointed out by President Jiang Zemin on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting President Denis Sassau-
nguesso of the Republic of the Congo on Monday, Jiang said
dialogues and negotiations across the Taiwan Straits should have a
basis, namely, the one China principle must first be recognized,
and under this prerequisite, every thing can be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Luo Haocai, chairman of Central Committee of the China Zhi
Gong Party (Public Interest Party), said Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China, and the "One China" principle must be upheld at all
times and under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the Chinese people, including the compatriots in
Taiwan and overseas Chinese, will never allow the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the motherland to be damaged even by
a tiny bit.
</P>
<P>
The China Zhi Gong Party unswervingly supports all the measures
taken by the Chinese Government to solve the Taiwan issue and
promote the reunification of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, chairman of the ACFIC, said the change of
leadership in the Taiwan region cannot change the fact that Taiwan
is part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the new leader of the Taiwan region, "we should
listen to his words and watch his actions," Jing said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that those who are bent on seeking "Taiwan
independence" will get nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"Those who play with fire will get burnt," he said.

Minister Suleiman Franjieh.
</P>
<P>
Franjieh thanked FAO for its support to Lebanon in the field of
tree planting and construction in Baalbek and Hermul regions. He
expressed hope that the cooperation between the sides will continue
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Diouf stressed that the organization would sustain its aid to
Lebanon while urging the Lebanese government to increase
agriculture share in the budgets, pointing out that 40 percent of
the Lebanese people live in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"There is a crying need for Lebanon to reconstruct irrigation
system as the rate of irrigated land dropped from 60 percent to 10
percent now," Diouf added.
</P>
<P>
Diouf was here to attend FAO's 25th Regional Conference for the
Near East on March 20-25. Twenty-nine countries from the region are
participating the meeting, which is the biggest in FAO's history.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Cairo for Talks on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in Cairo Wednesday for talks on the
latest development of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During his short visit, Arafat will confer with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the peace process, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit came one day after the resumption of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in the United States and days
before Mubarak's trip to the U.S. on Saturday. He is expected to
coordinate with the Egyptian leader on the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader frequently visits Egypt for advice from
and coordination with Mubarak on talks with Israel, who as
president of the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the
Jewish state plays an active role in mediating the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks between the Palestinians and Israel focus
on final status issues, including the fate of Jerusalem, claimed by
both sides as their capital, future of Jewish settlements and final
borders of future Palestinian state and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The talks aim to lead to the conclusion of a permanent peace
deal by September 13 this year.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Clinton-Assad Summit, Landmark on Road of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The summit due next Sunday
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Syrian counterpart
Hafez al-Assad is likely to revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks
that have been frozen since January 10, 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the summit Clinton is expected to convey to Assad
specific proposals from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the
full withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the Golan Heights,
political observers here said.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Clinton will get Syrian assurances on issues of water,
security arrangements and normalization of Syrian-Israeli
relations, which are the basic demands for Barak to convince the
Israeli public of peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Resumed in December, 1999 after a four-year freeze, the Syrian-
Israeli peace talks were deadlocked as Syria demanded Israel
withdraw to the border lines of June 4, 1967 while Israel insisted
on discussing the security and water issues first.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reduced their differences in the last weeks
thanks to the U.S. mediation efforts, the Israeli daily Yodiot
Ahronot quoted on Tuesday a senior Israeli official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Syria has recently responded positively to Israel's concerns on
three major issues, namely the border lines near Tiberias Lake, an
early-warning station on al-Sheikh Mount overlooking the Golan
Heights, and the normalization of bilateral relations, the daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Syria gave up its demands for restoring territories overlooking
the lake that constituted the water reservoir for Israel and
accepted that the border line would be 10 meters far from the
eastern bank of the lake, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Israel will return al-Hemma district that used to be
unarmed until early the 1950s, ruled by Syria until June 4, 1967,
then captured along with the Golan Heights by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war, it added.
</P>
<P>
Last week Israel said it would not retain its soldiers at the
proposed early-warning station on the Golan Heights forever.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Syrian official daily Teshrin reported on
Wednesday that Syria would be encouraged to establish the desired
peace if Israel withdrew to the border lines of June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syria capital said Barak's admission
that his predecessors pledged to pull out from the Golan Heights
and his hint to return to the borders of June 4, were positive
indicators of Israel's readiness to meet Syria's basic demands.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Israel might not carry out a unilateral
pullout from south Lebanon without signing peace accords with Syria
and Lebanon, while Syria pledged to prevent cross-border attacks on
northern Israel after Israeli troops withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
If the Geneva summit led to the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks in the United States in the coming days, Israel might
reach peace accords with Syria and Lebanon that could be offered to
the Israeli public through a referendum late next May, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have hailed the summit and expressed hope that
it will lead to the revival of their bilateral talks and create
promising prospects of peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> West African Gas Pipeline Rejected by Environmentalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Three environmental
non-governmental organizations and some communities in Ghana,
Nigeria and Togo have rejected the West African Gas Pipeline
project (WAGP).
</P>
<P>
The groups are the Environmental Rights Action (ERA), Nigeria,
Oilwatch Africa Network and Friends of the Earth Network of Ghana,
Nigeria and Togo.
</P>
<P>
The groups said the absence of an environmental impact
assessment about the WAGP is an indication that environmental
considerations are not on the agenda of the WAGP consortium.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a release signed by Pastor Niimmo Bassey,
Chairman of Oilwatch and convener of the just ended information
and consultation meeting on WAGP held in Warri, Nigeria, and made
available to the Ghana News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We reject the WAGP because the fears of local communities have
not been addressed," the release said citing grave environmental
devastation that will result from the project like deforestation,
explosions, breaking up of habitats and wildlife corridors.
</P>
<P>
They further threatened to petition the World Bank not to
support or promote the WAGP in any way unless the legitimate fears
of the local communities have been addressed.

NICOSIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Nicos Rolandis on Wednesday called on Russia
to support its efforts to promote high technology, Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day seminar, entitled "Cooperation Between
Cyprus and Russia in the Context of the New Industrial Policy of
Cyprus for the Development of High Technology Industries" that
started Wednesday in Moscow, Rolandis said the Cyprus government
attaches great importance to the cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cyprus' new industrial policy provides, among
other things, for the establishment of "incubators" and the
creation of a center for carrying out research and technological
development in high technology fields.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus has experience in market economy and Russia has a
developed research infrastructure as well as world class scientific
and technological expertise, "cooperation between the two countries
in the promotion of new technology industries can be of mutual
benefits."
</P>
<P>
Rolandis called on the Russian government, the Russian Academy

<HEADLINE> Saudi Medicine Arrives in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 trucks carrying
medicine and medical reagents from Saudi Arabia have arrived in
Iraqi capital of Baghdad, reported the weekly Al-Elam (The Media)
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shipment is part of a contract between the two countries to
import 300 trucks of medicine and medical reagents from Saudi
Arabia, with a load of each truck at 18 tons, according to Kheethar
Ramzi Al-Luhaiby, director of the Saudi Al-Sukair Investment Group.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed within the framework of the U.N. oil-
for-food program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the program that started in 1996, Iraq is allowed to
export a certain amount of crude oil every six months and use part
of the revenues in escrow to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people, who have reeled
from the 10-year-old crippling U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Political relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, the two Gulf
neighbours, have been cool since 1990, when Saudi Arabia, a close
American ally, strongly condemnded Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
took part in the U.S.-led multinational alliance which ended Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been following the U.S. in its Iraqi policy and
is against the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Iraq has repeatedly accused Saudi Arabia of
allowing the U.S. and British warplanes to use its airspace to
enforce the no-fly zone in southern Iraq imposed by the U.S.-led
alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has recently called for
developing relations with other countries, especially with Gulf and
Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade relations have witnessed remarkable progress in
recent years, with the trade volume surpassing 100 million dollars
a year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Turns to South Korea for Arms Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has held preliminary talks
with South Korea to sign a defense industry cooperation agreement
which will pave the way for joint production projects, such as
warship building as well as howitzer and armored vehicle
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of diversification of its weapons suppliers, which are
now mainly European countries and the United States, a Turkish
military delegation was in South Korea in late February for talks
to prepare the draft for the agreement, Turkish Daily News reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has established a considerable infrastructure in areas
such as shipbuilding -- it builds 50 ships every year on average --
and howitzer and armored vehicle production, said a Turkish defense
industry source.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is already able to manufacture 155-millimeter
howitzers weighing 46 tons.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's warship building industry has so far been dominated by
German technology. A possible cooperation with South Korea could
change this dominance and also save some of Turkey's arms projects
from being interrupted by its Western allies due to political
pressure upon it regarding human rights.
</P>
<P>
Another area of cooperation between Ankara and Seoul will be the
production of submarine torpedoes, making Seoul an alternative to
Germany in this field.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been manufacturing armored fighting vehicles
(AFV) similar to the ones that the United States firm FMC and the
local Nurol (FNSS Defense Systems) company have co-produced in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
As part of its attempt to break into the Asian market, Nurol has
also come close to signing a contract with Malaysia for the
production of armored fighting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
If the deal is finalized, this will be the first time that
Nurol, which has been co-producing with FMC four different AFV
models for the Turkish Army, will transfer its AFV technology to a
third country.
</P>
<P>
The deal will involve the co-production of about 300 AFVs in
Malaysia at an estimated project cost of 350 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The initial decision for the co-production of AFVs in Malaysia
was made in 1997, but further negotiations were suspended due to
the Asian economic crisis at the time.

<HEADLINE> Commission Urges Russians to Vote Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Election Commission (
CEC) Wednesday urged Russian voters to cast their ballots in
Sunday's presidential elections to "decide the destiny" of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Although 11 contestants will vie for the presidency Sunday,
Acting President Vladimir Putin remains the runaway favorite.
There are fears that many voters may not turn up Sunday, believing
Putin's victory is a foregone outcome.
</P>
<P>
For the election results to be valid, voter turnout must be
over 50 percent. Otherwise, a new election should be conducted
within four months after the voting, or three months after the day
when the polling is declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
"On this day (Sunday), all of us will be deciding the destiny
of our country, the future of our children and grandchildren," the
CEC said in an address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest opinion poll conducted on March 12, 42
percent of the 1,600 respondents believed that a second round of
voting would be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Putin's approval rating slipped while support for
his rivals grew, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting
results of the poll by the independent Agency for Regional
Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents who will definitely cast their ballots or
will probably do so, 48.4 percent intend to vote for Putin, down
by 14.6 percentage points since the beginning of February.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov is in the second place
with a supporting rate of 28 percent, 6 percentage points higher.
Rating for Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky, 8.9 percent, has
nearly doubled. Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir
Zhirinovsky is in the fourth place with 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's election law, Putin faces a run-off three weeks
later if he could not seize more than 50 percent of votes in the
first round.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Water Service Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn said here Wednesday that the bank supports the launch
of a new global initiative by the World Water Forum to ensure that
everyone has water services for health, food, energy and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of access to water is synonymous with poverty throughout
the developing world," said the World Bank chief. "If we don't
meet this challenge, we will not succeed in out broader mission of
alleviating poverty for the 3 billion people who live on less than
two U.S. dollars a day."
</P>
<P>
The aim of the six-day Second World Water Forum, which closed
here Wednesday, was to formulate a vision of the specific actions
needed to achieve a common set of water-related goals by 2025.
</P>
<P>
"Good intentions are not enough," Wolfensohn said. "We must do
development differently by grounding it in equity, in justice, in
new partnerships as well as solid economics -- in the case of
water, through full-cost pricing matched by carefully targeted
subsidies for the poor," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank chief, some developing countries
have made progress in water management. In Cote d'Ivoire and Benin
more than 70 percent of people have access to safe water. But
elsewhere, access to water is dismal. In Eritrea, only 7 percent
of people have such access, in Cambodia the figure is 13 percent,
in Mozambique 24 percent, and in Paraguay 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn also outlined an approach to water management built
on participatory institutions, and technological and financial
innovation. "We must give stakeholders a real stake in
institutions charged with managing water," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for financial innovations. Investment in water will
have to double over the next 25 years from 70 billion U.S. dollars
today. In this context, the private sector must play a much larger
role in the provision and financing of water services. The World
Bank currently lends about 3 billion U.S. dollars a year in water
and its total portfolio stands at 20 billion U.S. dollars,
according to Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges remain holistic management, inclusive
governance arrangement, and a recognition that water is an
economic resource. We must now move from analysis and vision to
action if we are to meet the twin objectives of poverty reduction
and environmental sustainability," the World Bank president said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Immediate End to Hostilities in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday called on all warring parties to end hostilities
immediately in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), saying that
the new development would affect the on-going deployment of U.N.
peace-keepers in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
A statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Anwarul Chowdhury of Bangladesh, said, "Council
members expressed their dismay at the new offensive launched in
the province of Kasai, which resulted in the seizure of the town
of Idumbe."
</P>
<P>
"Council members were also deeply concerned about the
continued fighting in the provinces of Equator, Katanga and Kivu
and reports of widespread preparations being made for further
military action, including training and significant rearmament,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members demanded that all parties stop immediately
the hostilities, and respect their commitment to the cease-fire
agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on February 24 voted unanimously to
authorize the deployment of 5,537 U.N. peace-keepers for the DRC,
known as the MONUC, including up to 500 military observers, to
monitor the shaky peace process in the Central African country in
what has been seen as Africa's first world war.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of negotiations, the 15-nation body decided to
authorize "phased deployment" of the U.N. peace-keepers "in
conditions of adequate security and with the cooperation of the
parties."
</P>
<P>
The resolution approved the expansion of the U.N. Mission in
the DRC, known as the MONUC, and extend the its mandate until
August 31.
</P>
<P>
"Council members emphasized that the deployment of the MONUC
could not be completed in the midst of hostilities," the statement
said. "They called on all parties to commit to a Joint Military
Commission sitting in permanent session and with representatives
empowered to provide all appropriate assistance to implement the
Lusaka Agreement," signed by all warring parties last summer.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference here
Wednesday, "The Security Council has given a green light to the
deployment of peace-keepers, and the light can change from green
to orange, or red" if the fighting continues in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The statement came shortly after a visit to the DRC by U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for peace-keeping operations Bernard Miyet,
who is expected to return to New York on April 28.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council will receive a first-hand report from Mr.
Miyet upon his arrival, and give an in-depth statement" by that
time, the Security Council president said.
</P>
<P>
The DRC conflict broke out in August 1998 when rebels, backed
by Uganda and Rwanda, launched an offensive to oust President
Laurent Kabila's government. It has soaked up fighting forces from
at least six African countries -- with troops from Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Angola all fighting on Kabila's side.

tons to 440, 000 tons in 2010 will be achieved through the
implementation of sugar industry development strategies and action
plan, the General Manager of the Sugar Development Corporation
Frank Kibonde was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's demand for sugar stands at 300,000 tons per year,
meaning that the deficit of 180,000 tons has to be imported.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, the action plan's objective
was to ensure self-sufficiency, attain competitiveness in
production, bridge the gap between demand and domestic production,
ensure quality imports and fair play among the stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
The strategies include increased production from 120,000 tons
to 273,000 tons by 2004/2005 and to 440,000 tons by 2009/2010,
embark on new investments at the major sugar production areas and
to develop small-scale sugar plants that can produce one to three
tons per day.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the major constraints facing
Tanzania's sugar industry include worn-out plants, lack of
investments, sugar smuggling, dumping of cheap sugar, absence of
regulatory system for the sugar sector, slow privatization
process, poor infrastructure and inadequate technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The National Oil Company of
Zimbabwe and the Kuwaiti Independent Petroleum Group (IPG) will
sign short-term and long- term agreements on oil supply this week
to help ease acute fuel shortage in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
IPG finance manager R. Kesavan on Wednesday told reporters
after meeting Zimbabwean Vice President Simon Muzenda that the
first two ships containing a total of 70 million liters of fuel
were expected to dock at neighboring Beira Port of Mozambique
within the next 10 to 12 days. After this first shipment, there
will be deliveries every 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other international fuel suppliers, IPG is not demanding
cash but is offering 90 to 120 days extended credit, Kesavan said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreements comes about two weeks after
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's visit to Kuwait where the
Zimbabwean delegation met a consortium of Kuwaiti banks and
petroleum fuel suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been suffering serious fuel shortages since last
November, and petrol queues are getting longer as there seems to

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepali New PM Faces Rough Road  by Zhuang Meijie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The revelry of a triumph over
former Prime Minister Bhattarai may not last long for G.P. Koirala,
as the new prime minister is facing tough tasks ahead in realizing
his promises.
</P>
<P>
Soon after he was elected the new prime minister, Koirala
declared that his priorities would be to "eradicate poverty,
maintain law and order and provide good governance."
</P>
<P>
All three are daunting tasks which may prove to be tremendous
challenges for the new government.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has been a long and lingering problem for the Himalayan
kingdom as 42 percent of its population live below the poverty
line. It is the promise by every Nepali government to eradicate
poverty, but it has never been realized up to now.
</P>
<P>
Considering the country's limited resources coupled with the
poor economic performances -- low growth and rising inflation and
unemployment, it is indeed a stupendous task for Koirala to
achieve tangible fruits in poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Violence by the ultra-leftist guerrillas has been a threat to
law and order in the country for four years. The sudden change of
the government seems to have made the prospects of bringing the
guerrillas to the negotiating table even more bleak.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas leader has warned the new government, which is
expected to take a hard-line policy in dealing with the guerrillas
problems, that they would react to any action against them in a
retaliatory manner.
</P>
<P>
As for eradication of corruption, which is the core of the good
governance, it is easy to make for good rhetoric but it is not so
easy to translate the pledge into reality.
</P>
<P>
As an award to his supporters, Koirala has to include some "
unclean hands" in his cabinet. This leaves people to doubt Koirala
's determination to clear corruption out of his government.
</P>
<P>
Former President of Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce
and Industry Mahesh Pradhan said economic development of the
country is not possible without maintaining a corruption-free
society.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts believe that Koirala's biggest challenge
may come within the ruling Nepali Congress. If he fails to
properly manage dissent within his party, he may be caught by the
same fate as former Prime Minister Bhattarai, who was forced to
step down by rebels led by Koirala.
</P>
<P>
"It will be very hard for Girija Koirala to steer the nation
smoothly. Wait and see," said Bhattarai to his supporters after
vacating the post for Koirala.
</P>
<P>
This means that if Bhattarai wants to destabilize the position
of Koirala as the latter did to him, he can do so easily.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Encourage Investment in Water  Resources Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Local Government
Minister Zillur Rahman said Wednesday that private and foreign
investment would be encouraged for a sustainable water resources
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The present government has already established Bangladesh's
right on international river water by signing the historic water
sharing agreement with India and as a result the decades-long
water problem has been resolved," Rahman said while inaugurating a
seminar on "Water for 21st Century and Bangladesh Perspective" to
mark the World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has formulated a time-
befitting water policy on the basis of overall water situation in
the country and effective measures have already been taken in
implementing the new water policy.
</P>
<P>
"In the country, water demand is increasing day by day with the
increase of population," the minister said. On the other hand,
arsenic contamination at ground level, water pollution caused by
chemicals dumped into rivers and water bodies, downward trend of
ground water and excessive salinity in coastal belt water have
created obstacles to safe water availability, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rahman underlined the need for strengthening the combined
efforts of non-government organizations, community-based
organizations and private entrepreneurs along with government for
preventing surface water pollution and for its proper use and
management to ensure availability of people's right to use safe
water.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Day to Be Celebrated with Renewed Zeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will celebrate the
60th Pakistan Day on Thursday with a renewed zeal to turn the
country into a strong state.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first Pakistan Day to be observed after the army
led by General Pervez Musharraf seized the ruling power in a
bloodless coup in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The military government has managed to stabilize, to some
extent, the once-decaying economy of the country and now is
seeking a stronger position on the long-standing Kashmir dispute
with India.
</P>
<P>
The day is believed to be of more significance due to the
upcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled on March
25.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is on his South Asian tour currently when he is
expected to try to persuade both India and Pakistan to halt
exchange of sabre-rattling and assume bilateral dialogue on
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said the
Pakistan Day this year will be celebrated in "a befitting manner
with a renewed pledge to turn Pakistan into a strong, prosperous
and a welfare state."
</P>
<P>
As usual, the parade of the armed forces will be held in
Islamabad, the capital, but this year a greater scale is expected.
</P>
<P>
A special feature of the parade this year will be presentation
of prototype of "Al Zarrar" tank which is newly built by Pakistan
itself, according to APP.

<TEXT>
<P>
New Delhi and Washington must work together to protect
environment, Clinton said following the signing of an agreement on
environment protection between the two countries in Agra, a
ancient city 200 kilometers southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
"India's economic growth has put pressure on environment. More
and more environment problems are no longer national problems.
They are global ones," PTI quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the 250 million dollars, Clinton said, 200 million dollars
would be made available through U.S. Import-Export Bank for clean
energy projects, while another 45 million dollars had been
earmarked by U.S. Agency for International Development for
promoting clean energy production and use in India.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by Indian External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
envisages creation of a joint consultation group on clean energy
and environment to foster greater bilateral cooperation, according
to PTI.
</P>
<P>
The group would ensure an institutional framework between the
two countries to identify, initiate and monitor public and private
collaborative research and development projects and its deployment
in clean energy, renewable energy and power sector reform.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi and Washington have agreed to established focal
points directly between ministries and agencies concerned with
high level involvement, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the group is consequent to the joint
statement on cooperation in energy and related environment aspects
signed last October in New Delhi by U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson and Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
Both countries reaffirmed their strong support for
international efforts to combat global climate changes under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Agra to see the famous Taj Mahal, one
of the seven wonders of the world, Clinton said at the joint
session of the Indian Parliament that Washington would stick its
stand on linking trade with core labor standards and environment.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Banning Single-Hulled Oil Tankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it had outlined plans to ban single-hulled oil
tankers from European Union ports in order to improve maritime
safety.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, said
that the proposed ban would be in effect by 2005, 2010 or 2015 in
accordance with the tonnage of single-hulled oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
The move to ban single-hulled tankers came as a response to the
spill of more than 12,000 tons of heavy oil from the tanker Erika
off the French coast late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Erika, flying the Maltese flag, was a 25-year-old single-
hulled oil tanker. The oil slicks polluted 400 kilometers of
coastline and killed or maimed 300,000 sea birds.
</P>
<P>
The December 12 disaster of Erika sparked widespread calls to
tighten international maritime safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Loyola de Palacio, EU transport commissioner, said that the
European Union could not accept the idea of Erika happening again.
Her plans for the ban were approved by the commission and would be
submitted for approval by the national governments of the 15 EU
member states.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Accurate Understanding of Right to Self-Determination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The international community should
have a full and accurate understanding of the principle of self-
determination and protect it well, Chinese Ambassador Qiao
Zonghuai said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The right of self-determination is elaborated in relevant
articles of the Charter of the United Nations and is reiterated in
many following international decisions and documents, Qiao told
the 56th session of the Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, he said, a small number of individuals with
ulterior motives have openly advocated separatism against
sovereign states under the pretext of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
"These moves are far from promoting and protecting human rights,
but rather, have distorted the principle of self-determination by
carrying out activities in the name of 'human rights'," Qiao
pointed out. "This willful trampling upon the U.N. Charter and the
basic principles of international law are certain to be firmly
opposed by all peoples of the world."
</P>
<P>
The right of self-determination is an important component of
human rights, endowed for people of all countries, especially the
oppressed nations, to resist imperialism and colonial rule, and to
struggle for national independence and people's liberation, Qiao
went on.
</P>
<P>
"No country should be allowed to impose its own ideology and
social system on others," he stressed. "The domineering over the
weak by the strong and the bullying of the small by the big as
well as interfering into others' internal affairs by means of
political pressure, economic sanctions or even armed invasion will
constitute gross violations of the Charter of the United Nations
and the right of self-determination."
</P>
<P>
He said that the right of self-determination entitles all
peoples to choose, on their own, political and social systems,
economic models and paths of development, resist all forms of
foreign aggression, interference and control, safeguard state
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has urged parties concerned to adopt a
flexible and pragmatic approach for the promotion of the continued
progress of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The key to lasting peace and stability in the Middle East lies
in restoring all the rights the Palestinian people are entitled to,
including their right of self-determination, and in achieving a
fair and just solution to the Palestinian issue," said the Chinese
ambassador at the meeting on self-determination.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Protect Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- African countries should
coordinate policies and harmonize programs for protection of
wildlife and forest resources in the continent, said Zambian
Minister for Ministry of Tourism Anoshi Chipawa on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here in Lusaka while officially opening the
13th Session of the African Forestry and Wildlife Commission
Conference, which was jointly organized by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Zambian
government.
</P>
<P>
Coordinated policies and harmonized programs in Africa are
critical to avoid situations detrimental to the sustainable
management of wildlife and forest resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wild animals depend on forests and other vegetation for their
habitat, he said , adding that some forests vegetation also depend
on animals for propagation.
</P>
<P>
"I urge this conference to discuss practical ways to respond to
loss of wildlife and its habitats through agricultural
encroachment and increased hunting for provision of food," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chipawa, the situation of food insecurity,
national economies and conflicts impacts negatively on the
wildlife resources on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Food insecurity and instability result in uncontrolled
exploitation of the wildlife resources by humans, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although forestry and wildlife management systems
are sometimes hosted in different institutions and organizations,
forestry and wildlife resources are interdependently a unit.
</P>
<P>
A broader view to wildlife resources management is therefore
critical and should take into account social, economic and
environmental objectives, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that wildlife management should advocate poverty
alleviation across the African continent through wise use of
wildlife resources.

"A particular vigilance should be exercised on the research of
embryo, banned by our legislation and the Convention of the

Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Wednesday

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- With an 8-2 victory over
Lithuania Wednesday night, China snatched the first place of Group
C to ensure a top three finish at the World Ice Hockey Pool C
Championships here in Beijing and qualified for the next Pool B
championships.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, who had a draw with Lithuania in the tournament
last year, took the lead at 6:24 through a goal by Luo Lei amidst
a scramble in front of the Lithuanian gate. Guan Xiaobo broke in
and beat the Lithuanian goaltender with a brilliant fake at 12:45
before Svedavicius Arturas found the net for Lithuania 15 seconds
later to make it 2-1. Afterwards, Pan Zhiqiang and Pan Yuqiang
scored two consecutive power-play goals as China led at the end of
the first period 4-1.
</P>
<P>
In the second, China and Lithuania conceded one goal apiece and
the deficit remained as three.
</P>
<P>
China, which has been playing in Pool C since its relegation
from Pool B in 1994, sealed the victory through another three
goals, including the second of Guan, in the third period.
</P>
<P>
"I am real excited with the result and Chinese players'
outstanding performance," Wang Jingan, head coach of China, told
reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
"It's a Chinese day. They played better game." The Lithuanian
head coach Senin Viktor said.
</P>
<P>
In the day's action, Hungary outrode six short-handed
situations in the first two periods, including more than 7 minutes
with two-player disadvantage, for a 9-2 victory over South Korea
and topped Group A with four points from two victories.
</P>
<P>
Croatia came from a three-goal deficit to draw with Romania 4-4,
clinching the first place of Group B with three points. Romania
was forced to the second on goals differentials.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Croatia also cruised into top three and booked a
berth in the next Pool B championships. South Korea, Romania and
Lithuania are set to vie for the fourth to sixth places and the
fourth placer will earn the final Pool B berth.

GUIYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- "I'm so happy that I'm back home!
"
</P>
<P>
Ding Mei, a 15-year-old girl, cried as she touched the soil of
her hometown in southwest China's Guizhou Province after a year-
long nightmare. She had been kidnapped and forced into marriage
with a man she had never seen before.
</P>
<P>
Ding Mei was abducted last April by two middle-aged men, and
sold to a farmer living in eastern Jiangsu Province for 7,000 yuan
(about 845 US dollars). She failed in an escape attempt on her
15th birthday, October 16, 1999, and was badly beaten.
</P>
<P>
Ding and 75 other abducted women and children who had had
similar experiences to her, were recently rescued by the police
and been returned to their home province of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
"This was the largest group of the people ever rescued from the
hands of abductors in China," said Yang Guangsheng, deputy
director of the Provincial Public Security Department and head of
the provincial leading group in charge of cracking down on the
trafficking in women and children.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that many more abducted women and children are
awaiting rescue all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Now there is a good news for them.

According to police sources, a special police action will kick
off nationwide on April 1 to deal a heavy blow to women- and
children-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The special police task force will be armed with advanced means
like information networks and DNA technology. The parents of the
abducted kids have had their blood tested. DNA tests will be
conducted on the recovered children to decide their true links
with the claimant parents.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the government and the police," says a weeping Ding
Mei. "I cannot be home without their help."
</P>
<P>
Yang Guangsheng, the deputy police chief of Guizhou, is
thinking about something more, worrying that the rescued women and
children could once again fall into the hands of abductors.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to well handle this lingering issue, we have to
resolve the problem of 'market demand' and 'market supply'," he
said, pointing out that the majority of the abducted are from the
underdeveloped central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
As the central government has initiated a strategy to develop
the poor areas in large scale, local governments in the areas
should take the opportunity to make public awareness about ethics,
law and security among local people, in order to curb the criminal
activities of women- and children-abductors throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Vast Nature Reserve to Purify Big Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province plans to set up a vast nature reserve to curb the
worsening water and soil erosion in areas around the sources of
three major rivers in China during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Mu Dongsheng, vice-governor of the province, announced here
Tuesday a 23.6 million ha nature reserve will be established in
Yushu, Golog and Haixi prefectures in the province, where China's
two largest rivers -- the 6,300-km Yangtze River and the Yellow
River -- and the Lancang River originate.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to control soil erosion and loss of water
on the three rivers, the vice-governor said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of silt carried downstream by the three rivers has
been increasing due to worsening soil erosion and loss of water in
the areas around their sources.
</P>
<P>
Experts blame both natural and man-made factors for the
worsening ecological situation, including overgrazing,
deforestation and excessive harvesting of plants to be used as
herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
Mu said efforts will be made to improve the grassland in the
reserve, protect forests, and plant trees and grass within the
areas.
</P>
<P>
An ecological research and monitoring station will also be set
up within the reserve to better protect it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-governor said the reserve will also play an important
role in protecting wetland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and wild
animals and plants found only on the plateau.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Sandstorm Lashes Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A powerful sandstorm swept over
much of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region from west
to east today, but no casualties have been reported yet.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological workers say other parts of north and northeast
China might also be affected by this phenomena to varying degrees
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
According to satellite images at the Inner Mongolia Weather
Bureau, the sandstorm hit vast areas of the region ranging from
Alexa League in the northwest through to Chifeng City, Tongliao
City, Hinggan League and Xilin Gol League in the east.
</P>
<P>
The intensity of sand particles in the air was so high that
visibility was zero-zero today in much of the Xilin Gol League.
</P>
<P>
Caused by a strong cold air current, the sandstorm moved at a
speed of up to 22 meters per second, or 79.2 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in much of the region dropped by eight to 10
degrees Centigrade, with snowstorms in some parts of the region's
northeast.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological bureau called on farmers and herdsmen to
prepare for further sandstorms and take steps to minimize possible
damage.
</P>
<P>
Much of the region is still under the influence of strong
breezes or moderate gales, and the temperature is still falling,
the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Inner Mongolia Meteorological Center for
Farm and Animal Husbandry said the sandstorm, which originated in
Alxa League, in the northwest of the region, came about half a
month earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
Because of the shortage of vegetation in the region, higher
temperatures in early spring make the sandy soil so dry that it
can be easily swept away by strong winds, resulting in sandstorms
that can reach as far as Beijing in the south.

<HEADLINE> Barak Announced Not to Attend Clinton-Assad Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Wednesday denied reports that he will participate in next
Sunday's summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and his
Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office made the clarification
after media reports claimed that U.S. officials were trying to
convince Syria to allow Barak to attend the summit in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The office also played down the optimistic statement made by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that Israel and Syria are close to
reaching a comprehensive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel is not sure about the possibility that a resumption of
talks would be announced after the Clinton-Assad summit, and if
they do, there are still big differences between the two sides, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Tuesday by the Washington Post daily,
Mubarak said Assad's willingness to make a rare trip from Syria to
meet Clinton is a sign that there is good chance for progress.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that the remaining issues in the Israeli-Syrian
peace track "will be not so complicated" after the two sides agree
to a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
To echo Mubarak's remarks, Israeli President Ezer Weizman said
Wednesday that he believed two leaders like Clinton and Assad will
not meet unless there are clear prospects.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made a surprise announcement in the Bangladesh capital
of Dhaka on Monday that he would meet the Syrian president in
Geneva on March 26, which aims at ending the deadlock in the
Israeli-Syrian peace track.
</P>
<P>
U.S. administration sources have since predicted that the summit
will result in a renewal of talks between the two counties and a
peace agreement will be reached within four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak's office kept being cautious by saying that
Israel hope the summit will lead to the revival of talks with
Syria, but the negotiations will be renewed only if certain
preconditions are ripe.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last December
after a 45-month break, hit a snag again after two rounds due to
differences over Israeli troop withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
Israel captured the plateau from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding a prior Israeli commitment to a full
withdrawal to the June 4, 1967, borders. But Israel insisted on
discussing security arrangements and normalization of bilateral
ties first.

CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's industrial production rose at an annual
rate of four percent in January, statistics released Tuesday by
Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to the trend data, the growth rate in the first month
of the year was similar to that of the fourth quarter in 1999 but
lower than the seven percent annual growth registered in the third
quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
CBS also noted that the number of people employed in industry
increased by an annualized one percent in January. This rate has
been steady since last August.
</P>
<P>
The number of hours worked, however, fell by one percent in
annual terms after having remained flat in the fourth quarter of
1999 and risen three percent in the third quarter.

JERUSALEM -- There were 30 venture capital funds in Israel
managing 4 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, a report published by
research company Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Israel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Star Ventures Capital Management is the largest with total
assets of 590 million dollars, while the Evergreen Canada Israel
Investment led in terms of investments, with 215 million dollars in
placements.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that funds have invested over 1 billion
dollars in local start-up companies, of which some 40 percent was
invested in software and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet also predicted that the sum of money raised by
local venture capital funds are expected to soar this year as
several large venture capital firms have already started raising
money for follow-on funds of more than 100-150 million dollars
each.

AMMAN -- Jordan's foreign debts declined by 2.1 percent to 5.8
billion Jordanian dinars (8.12 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of
January as against the figure at the end of 1999, the central bank
said in its monthly bulletin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's domestic debts stood at 889 million dinars (1.25
billion dollars) at the end of January, almost unchanged compared
with the figure by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and domestic debts are one of the major stumbling blocks
standing in the way of economic development of the kingdom, which
has been under a chronic economic recession since the 1990 Gulf
Crisis.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- More than 40 Kuwaiti industrial companies will
participate in the second Kuwaiti industrial exhibition slated for
May in Amman and co-sponsored by the Jordanian modern company
for exhibitions and the Kuwaiti Jasser company.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the Jordanian company, Suhail Salah, said
that organizing the exhibition confirms the key role played by
Kuwait in boosting the Arab economy and its efforts in supporting
the development in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The first Kuwaiti industrial exhibition was held in Amman in
last September.

<P>
CAIRO -- The volume of trade between Egypt and the United States
dropped to 3.28 billion U.S. dollars in 11 months last year,
compared with the same period of 1998 when the volume reached 3.35
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Egyptian economic daily on Wednesday, the
Egyptian exports declined by 8.5 percent, with the non-oil exports
falling by 10.3 percent and the oil exports by 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the period from January to November 1999
witnessed, for the first time, a decline in the rate of flow of the

Egyptian imports from the U.S, compared with the same period of
1998.

<HEADLINE> Manila Warns Abu Sayyaf not to Harm Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Armed Forces Chief of
Staff Angelo Reyes ignored Wednesday the ultimatum made by the
extremist Abu Sayyaf to kill some 40 hostages and warned the
kidnappers not to harm the victims.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the military to pursue the manhunt for the
Muslim terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
"Rescue operations will continue and we will run after the
kidnappers and try to recover the victims," Reyes told reporters
in Camp Aguinaldo of Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
A 60-man Abu Sayyaf kidnapped at gunpoint 71 people on Monday
in the southern Basilan province. As of Wednesday, about 30 were
released by the extremist group.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 40 people, most of them students, are still
held hostage by the Abu Sayyaf group, Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has demanded 200 sacks of rice from the
government. They also asked to send doctors to tend to their
wounded members.
</P>
<P>
They have threatened to kill the hostages one after the other
if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
But Reyes said that "our policy is that we don't want to
negotiate with terrorists and this is because what the terrorists
want is to terrorize us. And if we agree to be terrorized, then
they would continue to do that."
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is that we are continuing our recovery
efforts and pursuit operations so that we can recover the hostages
of the Abu Sayyaf," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes expressed the hope the Abu Sayyaf will not kill the
hostages" because if they do it, that would reveal the real
character of these people as terrorists."

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A Cambodian tourist boat
robbed and hijacked by seven armed men Wednesday with Ak-47 rifles
and knives, but there were no injuries, according to a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The boat, with 44 foreign and 46 local tourists, was one of
many boats that run daily between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, about
225 kilometers from Phnom Penh which needs about five hours to
arrive there.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking occurred on the Tonle Sap River about 30
kilometers north of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers first tied up the passengers and cut the boat's
communications system, then robbed passengers' mobile phones, cash,
cameras and valuables.
</P>
<P>
After collecting their loot, the hijackers ordered the captain
to pull the boat near a river bank before jumping overboard and
swimming to the shore. So far, the hijackers are still at large.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the foreigners were from about 10 countries,
including the United States, Australia, France, Japan, Italy and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The security situation has improved greatly since the new
coalition government was formed and the collapse of the Khmer
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh Municipal police pledged to have a thorough
investigation to the case and to arrest and bring the criminals to
justice.

<HEADLINE> Oil Pollution in North Angola Sends 700 People into Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 people, nine of them
in critical condition, have been sent to hospitals here for
treatment as a result of serious pollution caused by crude oil in
the northern province of Cabinda, Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Angola Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday that all these
patients, with symptoms including vomiting, abdominal pain, throat
burn and cough, are residents from the Futilla village near the
Malongo Oilfield. Some the them even had a high fever and were
short of breath.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary diagnosis indicated that they may have fallen ill
as a result of poisonous gas and oil-contaminated water and fish.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the local authorities and Cabinda Golf
Oil Company (CABGOC), a subordinate of the U.S. company Chevron,
have formed a joint health group to probe the matter.
</P>
<P>
It is said that oil pollution is a common occurrence in the
area, especially in the Futilla village, where many people have
been found to suffer from diarrhea, vomiting, skin inflammation
and cough.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 barrels of crude oil were leaked from a CABGOC
offshore oil well early this January, throwing the surrounding
waters and coast area into serious pollution. The local
authorities had to close parts of the seabeach and ban the
fishermen from going out for fishing, leading to great economic
loss for the area.
</P>
<P>
Angola, with a production capacity of 750,000 barrels per day,
is the second largest oil producer in Africa, next to Nigeria. The
Cabinda province accounts for more than half of Angola's oil
production.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, oil exploration and production in Angola has
developed quickly due to the inflow of large amount of foreign
capital. However, environmentalists are becoming more and more
concerned over the pollution problem caused by these activities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Slams France for Arresting 10 Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's mission in France Tuesday
filed a protest to French authorities on the arrest, detention and
trial of 10 Nigerians, according to a report by The Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians were arrested by French authorities on January 20
 allegedly for actions against the treatment of a colleague who
was tied to a seat on an Air France flight bound for Lagos in
January, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The charges against the Nigerians were described as "disturbing
the peace and preventing (in terrorist fashion) the scheduled
take-off of the plane."
</P>
<P>
Akinwumi Isola, a renowned scholar and writer, alerted the
nation over the matter on Sunday through a letter to Nigerian
press.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians, according to Isola, had protested the inhuman
treatment meted out to another Nigerian who was at the time being
deported aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
The deportee, groaning with pain, was tied with a strong rope
to his seat in a screened-off area at the back of the plane, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This led to a protest by the Nigerians who were later arrested
and detained.
</P>
<P>
They were later given temporary discharge and billed to appear
in court this month.
</P>
<P>
According to Adagbo Onoja, personal assistant to Nigerian
Foreign Affairs Minister, French authorities were expected, by
tradition, to inform the Nigerian mission of the alleged crime of
the Nigerian who was to be deported and the humiliation protested
by his fellow compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Both the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Nigerian mission in
France have been pursuing the case since the incident occurred,
Onoja said, adding that a meeting was held by Nigerian embassy
officials and French authorities in the wake of new correspondence
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"This matter will be pursued to the logical conclusion. But it
may still be important to assure Nigerians that this government
has a clock work approach in respect of securing the Nigerian and
ensuring for him or her the most dignified treatment wherever it
may be on the globe and at whatever cost," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Run Out of Fresh Water in 30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's fresh water
supply is expected to run out within 30 years, said national
co-ordinator of the Rennies Wetland Project David Lindley on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The severity of the recent flooding is an indication that the
country's water resources are not being properly managed, he was
quoted by South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
He called to take immediate steps to manage the natural water
cycle, stressing that water management is vital to any economy
because all industries should rely on fresh water for production.
</P>
<P>
However, the disastrous floods are becoming more frequent
around the world, he said, adding that the canalization of rivers,
dams and dykes, urbanization, deforestation and wetland drainage
dramatically increased the destructive potential of floods.
</P>
<P>
"If more wetlands along the rivers had been intact, the damage
would have been greatly reduced," Lindley said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the countries upstream should commit
themselves to maintaining the environment on which their neighbors
downstream depend by not polluting or overusing water sources or
depleting resources such as fish.

<HEADLINE> Time Not Ripe to Open NATO Mission in Moscow: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- It is premature to talk about
opening any NATO mission in Moscow, Interfax news agency quoted a
top Russian defense officer as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The time has not yet come to open a NATO military
communications mission and information office in Moscow," said
Colonel General Leonid Ivashov of the Russian Defense Ministry in
charge of international military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military and NATO are only "at the beginning of
the path" toward the full restoration of relations that were
frozen earlier. "Promotion of our relations depends on NATO's
readiness for a dialogue with Russia on equal terms," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of NATO representations in Moscow "is not the key
question in our relations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia froze its contacts with NATO in March 1999 after NATO
began massive air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated in an
interview with BBC television earlier this month that Russia could
join NATO if Moscow were treated as an equal partner. But Moscow
then backtracked by saying that Putin was speaking on hypothetical
basis.
</P>
<P>
The interaction between Russia and NATO exists only within the
framework of the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.

PARIS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The famous Museum d'Orsay of Paris
will display in the coming days two exhibitions and show a
documentary film on the Paris Commune, which was established in
March 1871 and suppressed brutally by government forces two months
later.
</P>
<P>
The film, shot by British film-maker Peter Watkins in
collaboration with the ARTE television channel, is five hours and
45 minutes long and will be shown in the museum and on the ARTE.
</P>
<P>
The film is based on historical research and has some
reflections on the present, according to the Museum d'Orsay.
</P>
<P>
One of the two exhibitions is "Courbet and the Commune", which
focused on the famous French painter Gustave Courbet, who was
engaged in the uprising of the Commune and was jailed by the
government for pulling down the Column of Vendome in central Paris,
which glorifies the wars of Napoleon Bonaparte.
</P>
<P>
Another exhibition is "Commune Photographed", which gives the
images of the conflict including pictures of the ruins of Paris
after the Commune was suppressed.

<HEADLINE> Australian Premier Reaffirms One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Wednesday reaffirmed Australia's One China policy and said
it will not alter the policy.
</P>
<P>
Australia has adhered to its One China policy since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between Australia and China in
1973, Howard told the visiting alternate member of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
Zeng Qinghong.
</P>
<P>
There had been and would be no change in this policy, Howard
stressed, adding that he hoped the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
could resolve their differences through peaceful talks.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and head of the Organization Department of the CPC
Central Committee, said there is only one China and that the
peaceful reunification should take "the one China principle" as
its prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
China will not allow any form of "Taiwan independence", he said,
adding that he hoped Australia will continue to adhere to the One
China policy and oppose to "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
"This will contribute to the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
issue and will be conductive to peace and stability of the Taiwan
Straits, the Asia-Pacific Region, and the world as well," Zeng
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Zeng, who arrived here on Tuesday to begin
his visit, also met Australia's acting Foreign Minister and Trade
Minister Mark Vaile and opposition Labor Party Leader Kim Beazley.

<HEADLINE> Grand Railway to Appear along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A railway trunk line is expected
to run alongside the Yangtze River in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The 2,024-kilometer line will cross the provinces of Sichuan,
Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu, and the municipalities of
Chongqing and Shanghai, according to Wang Qingyun, vice director
of the Primary Industries Department under the State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
It will greatly boost the economic growth of the Yangtze River
Valley, China's most important economic region, promote the
development of the western region and make resettlement at the
Three Gorges go more smoothly, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Four separate railway lines have been built along the Yangtze
River over the past decade, and four more sections will continue
to be built to eventually link them all up.
</P>
<P>
Based on experts' calculations, the new line will shorten the
transportation distance between Shanghai and Wuhan, a traffic hub
in central China, to 500 kilometers, enabling trains to cover the
distance between Chongqing and Shanghai in only one day, a journey
which takes seven days by ship.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that although the Yangtze River is known as a
"golden waterway" for its excellent transportation conditions,
serious erosion of water and soil at its upper reaches and rampant
flooding in 1998 have clogged many of its sections.
</P>
<P>
"What's more, only integrated development of railways,
highways and navigation can effectively promote the economic
growth of the Yangtze River Valley," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Related statistics show that the gross national product (GNP)
and grain output of the valley both share over 30 percent of the
total of the country.
</P>
<P>
Economists here agree that the new railway line will speed up
the transfer of capital and technology from China's coastal areas
and other countries to the western region, as well as help develop
the abundant natural resources there.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia will further
increase border trade and promote trade and economic ties between
regions of the two countries, according to a two-day meeting which
concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by economy and trade delegations from
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Zhang Xiang, the Chinese delegation was comprised of
delegates from the border areas, including Heilongjiang Province,
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region. Delegates from other areas such as Shanghai
City and Sichuan Province were also present.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the two countries now have 17 major ports open
to trade along their 4,300-km peaceful border, and border trade
had been developing rapidly in recent years, particularly in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He added that the trade volume between China's Heilongjiang,
Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Russia amounted to 1.
89 billion U.S. dollars-worth last year, 27.7 percent higher than
in the previous year and accounting for one third of the two
countries' total trade volume for the year.
</P>
<P>
China mainly exports grain, fruit, vegetables, clothing,
articles of everyday use, machinery and electrical appliances to
Russia, while importing chemical fertilizer, steel, timber and
transportation vehicles, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> First Internet Auction Dispute Settled in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The first case of an Internet
auction dispute in China was settled by the Haidian District
People's Court of Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff, 20-year-old Zhang Yan, did not get everything he
demanded in his case against the defendants, the Beijing Jinmao
Internet Auction Electronic Technology Co. Ltd and the Guo'an Five
Dragon International Auction Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Zhang complained that he had purchased three computers for 10,
000 yuan through an Internet auction sponsored by the two auction
companies on October 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
Several days later, he remitted 10,000 yuan to the auction
companies to get the computers. But he then found on the same
website where he bought the computers that someone else has bought
the three computers which should belong to him.
</P>
<P>
Zhang demanded in the bill that the two auction companies
should give him the three computers with an additional 10,000 yuan
to make up for the devaluation of the computers.
</P>
<P>
The two auction companies answered the appeals, saying that
there was no final deal made with Zhang, because the money Zhang
paid did not meet the base price of auction.
</P>
<P>
According to the judgment made by the court, the two auction
companies should return Zhang's remittance together with its
interests and pay the legal costs.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that to standardize the Internet auction market,
relevant departments are trying to issue regulations about the
Internet auction and some will be added to the China Auction Law.

<HEADLINE> Peres Envisions Israeli-Lebanese Neighborly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel has no plan to grab
Lebanon's water and land and the two countries can build good
neighborly ties, said former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want Lebanese water, we don't want Lebanese land and
we don't want to play a role in Lebanese politics," said Peres,
currently the minister of regional cooperation, at an ongoing
international water conference in the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"We are really the country which is seriously interested to see
an independent, integrated Lebanon," Peres was quoted by Lebanon's
Daily Star newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied parts of south Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
self-styled security zone there in 1985 with a claimed aim of
protecting its northern border areas from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Litani River, the longest in Lebanon, runs across the security
zone. Lebanon has repeatedly accused Israel of grabbing water from
the river as well as stealing soil from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's plan to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon by July with
or without a peace agreement with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese and Syrian delegations on Monday boycotted the first
day's session of the international conference on water issues,
saying they would not sit together with the delegates from Israel
which is occupying their land.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Warns of All-out War Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada reiterated Wednesday his warning to secessionist and
leftist rebels that his administration is ready to wage an all-out
war against them to protect the people from their terroristic
rampages.
</P>
<P>
In a series of radio interviews, the president maintained that
while his administration will pursue peace talks with groups
fighting the government, it will not let the rebels exploit the
peace process to violate the law and cause suffering to citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We will adopt a tougher stance against them. If they cannot
fulfill their part of the deal, we're ready for an all-out war.
That's my instruction, run them down if they continue their
terrorist acts," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"This is for real. Past administrations have given them enough
leeway, yet they abused this privilege. It's time to take off the
kid gloves and give them what they deserve," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the president issued a similar warning to rebel
groups after he visited Kauswagan town in the southern Lanao del
Sur province, where government and secessionist troops fought last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which involved the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), left a number of soldiers and rebels dead or wounded, and
displaced many residents.
</P>
<P>
Estrada bewailed that the MILF and the New People's Army have
taken advantage of the lull in peace negotiations to beef up their
ranks or carry out raids or harassment activities.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of
National Defense said the government is ready to implement the
president's directive to come down hard on the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Seizes Biggest Ever Heroin Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka had seized 38.4
kilograms of smuggled heroin, the largest ever haul in the country,
in an operation north of the capital, the Police Narcotics Bureau
(PNB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old Sri Lankan youth, who was transporting the heroin
to Colombo after smuggling in by boat from India, was detained in
the operation on Tuesday at Chilaw, some 75 km north of here, a
spokesman for the PNB said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said they were hunting for two relatives of the
youth who were also involved in the smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The previous biggest heroin haul was in 1990 when three
Nigerians were nabbed at Sri Lanka's international airport while
attempting to smuggle 34 kilograms of heroin out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Interpol has identified Sri Lanka as a major transit point in
international drug smuggling due to its strategic location between
two main drug producing areas -- the Golden Triangle of Myanmar,
Thailand and Laos and the Golden Crescent comprising Pakistan,
Afghanistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drugs that enter Sri Lanka were smuggled out
through commercial flights or container cargo from the port,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's law enforcement officers caught 68.5 kilograms of
heroin in 1999, a 40 percent rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, detection of drugs had risen sharply in 2000. In the
first three months the PNB had recovered 55 kg of heroin.

<HEADLINE> Indian Left Parties Accuse Government of Shifting  Nonalignment Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, the Politburo of the
Communist Party of India (Marxism) said the government "recognizes
that the United States has a significant role to play in regional
security which has implications for Indo-Pakistan relations."
</P>
<P>
The Vision Statement signed here on Tuesday between visiting U.
S. President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee was a confirmation of the government's "pro-U.S. stance
which has serious implications for India's sovereignty and foreign
policy."
</P>
<P>
None of the issues arising out of U.S. policies which adversely
affect India had been addressed during the on-going visit of U.S.
President Bill Clinton but the U.S. concerns had been "
accommodated", said CPI(M), which along with other left parties
did not attend Clinton's address to the Indian Parliament today.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident from the statement that the United States will
continue to exercise pressure on India on the question of nuclear
nonproliferation, further opining up of the Indian economy to
foreign finance capital and drawing India into the U.S. global
strategy," the release said.
</P>
<P>
Around 85 parliamentary members from left parties including the
CPI(M), the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Revolutionary
Socialist Party (RSP), Forward Block and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD,
National People's Party) stayed away from the parliament house
today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, some of them jointed "anti-imperialism day"
demonstrations in the capital which witnessed various protests
against U.S. imperialistic attitude towards the Third World
including India over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
About 200 CPI(M) activists including its general secretary
Dipankar Bhattacharya and its parliament member Jayanta Rongpi
were arrested at the parliament street due to their protest
against the "much-hyped" Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
The activists, who shouted anti-Clinton slogans and carried
placards which read "Clinton Go Back" and "Down with Saffron
Collaborators", broke police barricades before courting arrest.
They were later released.

Aprodicio Laquian as his Chief of Staff, even as he assured the

Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>

He noted that the Office of the Executive Secretary and the
Presidential Management Staff will continue to coordinate and
manage the functions of the Executive Department.
</P>
<P>
Estrada tapped Laquian to serve as Chief of Staff at the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Newspaper Warns Over Ivory Trade Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The debate on ivory trade
threatens to polarize African countries at the 11th Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora to be
held in Nairobi, Kenya, from April 10 to 20, The Herald newspaper
warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean leading newspaper said southern African
countries are set on a collision course with conservationists who
want a total ban on international trade in ivory.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia will press to have their
elephant populations maintained at a certain level. They will
insist that, with the region's elephant population now restored to
over 150,000 and still rising, there is no major reason for
barring them from profiting once more from the ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Zimbabwe is seeking permission to sell
an annual quota of 10 tons from some of its national parks while
Botswana and Namibia want a quota of two tons and 12 tons per
year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will also join them, as it also wants to sell 30
tons of ivory, mainly from the Kruger National Park, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The four countries' cry comes amid reports that the legitimate
 conservation concerns have been hijacked by animal rights
activists. While Kenya, as the host of the convention, is trying
to safeguard the ivory trade ban in order to protect its revenues
from national park tourism.
</P>
<P>
Attention has shifted worldwide to a rush of "park wars",
arising from moves by former inhabitants to reclaim the right to
hunt, farm and occupy customary homelands, fenced off for wildlife
or habitat conservation.
</P>
<P>
Western-style conservation has become increasingly hard to
justify in the face of such disputes, the paper quoted many
practitioners as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Police Wednesday raided 80 homes
and offices across Japan linked to a radical leftist group and
arrested one in preparation for the upcoming Group of Eight (G-8)
summit.
</P>
<P>
In raids in Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa and 10 other prefectures,
police confiscated 230 items, including floppy disks, belonging to
the radical group Chukakuha (Nucleus Faction), the Metropolitan
Police Department (MPD) said.
</P>
<P>
The MPD's Public Security Division apparently carried out the
raids to check on the group ahead of the July 21-23 summit of the
G-8 major nations in the city of Nago, northern Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a senior member of the group in a flat in Nago
on suspicion of registering a false address in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Police believe the flat, which the group has occupied since
December, was to be used as a base for the group's activities
related to the summit.
</P>
<P>
Chukakuha, Japan's left-wing group, is suspected of launching
at least four rockets at the U.S. Army base in Zama, near Tokyo,
at the start of the Group of Seven Tokyo summit in July 1993.

<HEADLINE> Leader of Nagorno-Karabakh Injured in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Arkady Gukasian, president of the
self-proclaimed republic of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, was
shot and seriously injured by gunmen in Stepanokert Tuesday
evening, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gukasian was shot by several unidentified gunmen while he was
returning home from work, and then the gunmen fled, Interfax
reported in a dispatch from Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen shot at Gukasian's Mercedes from two points in
central Stepanokert, a city inside Karabakh. Gukasian suffered leg
wounds, while the bullets pierced his driver's lung and neck bone.
His bodyguard was also injured.
</P>
<P>
Several suspects were arrested shortly after the attack.
</P>
<P>
The government of the self-proclaimed republic Wednesday
described the shooting as a criminal attack on Nagorno-Karabakh's
statehood. The Nagorno-Karabakh Prosecutor's Office has launched
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed ethnic Armenian enclave inside
Azerbaijan. The Armenian government demands that Azerbaijan
recognize Karabakh's independence but Baku insists on its
sovereignty over the territory. The two countries fought a bloody
war in 1988-1994 over the issue.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1995, increasing pressure to end the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict came from Western oil companies eager to
build a pipeline across Armenia to transport Caspian Sea oil to
Turkey. In mid-1996, the Organization on Security and Cooperation
in Europe helped mediate the enclave dispute but relations between
the two former Soviet republics remain tense.

<HEADLINE> Strong Measures Needed to Tackle China's Imminent Water Shortage" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China is now facing mounting
pressure as the nation's huge and growing population and its
limited water resources threaten a severe water shortage which
could endanger its sustained growth, according to the Economic
Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The industrialization and urbanization process will bring China
's gross domestic product(GDP) to ten times the current level in
about 50 years, which, at the same time, will bring about a
substantial increase of water consumption, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's population is expected to reach 1.6 billion
by 2030, bringing down the per capita water resource by one-fifth
to 1,700 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that about 27 million hectares of farm
land are hit by drought each year, and the nation's farmland lacks
30 billion cubic meters of water for irrigation annually, with the
water shortage in urban areas standing at six billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In the face of this staggering shortage and the grave situation
of pollution and waste of water, the government has started to
attach the utmost importance to tackling the issue.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water Resources Wang Shucheng has pledged to put
saving and protecting water resources high on the agenda, and to
streamline water conservancy to ensure the country's sustainable
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In a more detailed plan, the government will improve the
management of water sources and apply economic leverage as well as
advanced technologies to enhance the efficiency of water
consumption, while promulgating new laws and regulations for the
effective protection of water resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China expects to produce more
than 100 million sq.m. of stone materials by the end of this year,
including granite, marble and terrazzo.
</P>
<P>
China's stone materials production has been growing at an
average annual rate of 13 percent over the past 15 years,
according to Zhang Wenbo, vice-chairman of the China Stone
Materials Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
China is among the countries of the world with the largest and
most varied stone reserves, and is well-known internationally for
granite and white marble production.
</P>
<P>
The country now has markets for its stone materials in Japan,
the Republic of Korea, Germany, the United States, Russia,
Thailand, and Indonesia, as well as Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
regions. It expects to export 700 million US dollars worth of
stone materials this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China has made great headway in expanding
cooperation with overseas partners by setting up at least 400
foreign-funded stone materials production ventures, and has also
made progress in improving its stone materials production
technology.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has introduced equipment from Italy,
Germany, and other countries which has helped the development of
this industry.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 100 enterprises manufacturing stone
production equipment, and exports this equipment to Russia,
Pakistan, Indonesia, and Hungary, he said.

He said the administration will take the opportunity to fully
tap the rural market by providing farmers with needed commodities
and services in order to boost rural consumption.
</P>
<P>
To expand sales channels and circulation efficiency, the

</P>
<P>
Big commercial enterprises with modern management systems and
huge sales network in eastern China will be guided by the
administration to channel their management expertise and quality
commodities to the west.
</P>

Meanwhile, to encourage foreigners to invest in western
development, the administration will help local enterprises
establish ties with foreign counterparts, and encourage them to

the general public of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The planned contest, the first of its kind in China to be

Protection Industry in cooperation with several companies, will
focus on designing web pages devoted to environmental protection,
Wang Xinyan, spokesman for the organizing committee of the contest,
said here today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Permanent Residents' Children to Begin Emigration Application on May 6: Ministry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Children of Chinese nationality
who are living in inland areas of China and whose parents are
permanent residents of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR), will be soon able to apply for permanent residence in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have expressed their belief that this matter is
likely to be smoothly processed due to years of experience in
handling applications for settlement in the Hong Kong SAR by
children of Chinese nationality whose parents are permanent
residents of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
An announcement published here today by the Exit and Entry
Administration under the Ministry of Public Security says that
exit and entry administrations at different levels will start
handling the applications from eligible applicants.
</P>
<P>
According to the 24th article of the Macao SAR Basic Law,
children of Chinese nationality who are living in the inland areas
of China and whose parents are Macao permanent residents, began
enjoying the right of residence on December 20, 1999, when China
resumed its exercise of sovereignty over the territory.
</P>
<P>
A special monthly quota of 420 has been set for the number of
these applicants who will be allowed to join their parents as
permanent residents of Macao, according to the announcement.

<P>
The applicants should bring with them legal documents to
certify their own permanent residence, birth, their parents'
marriage, and their father's or mother's identity card as a
permanent resident in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The applicants should first hand over their application and the
certifications to local exit and entry administrations and then
the application and the certifications will be checked by
authorities at county, prefecture (or city) and provincial levels
in a step-by-step fashion.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the application and the certifications will be
transferred to the Macao SAR authorities for further examination.
Those who are approved will be granted the official pass for
entering and exiting Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
In consideration of Macao's capability to accept migrants, the
applications will be handled by quota and in an orderly manner,
according to relevant regulations.
</P>
<P>
Applicants whose parents both live in Macao will be examined by
the order of age, and priority will be given to the younger ones.
</P>
<P>
For those who have one parent living in Macao and the other
living in inland China, their applications will be handled in
accordance with the length of time their parents have lived
separately. Priority will go to those whose parents have lived in
separation for the most years.

<HEADLINE> East Asia's Recovery Gains Momentum: WB Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- East Asia's recovery has gained
momentum, broadened across the region, and is now creating jobs at
a quickening pace, a senior World Bank (WB) official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a remarkable turnaround from the devastating crisis that
began in 1997," Jemal-ud-din Kassum, World Bank Regional Vice
President for East Asia and the Pacific, told a press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the World Bank's latest Quarterly Update of the state
of the region, Kassum said the strong and rapid recovery was the
product of sound policy responses in crisis-affected countries, as
well as basically sound underlying fundamentals which had been in
place before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kassum noted that poverty is no longer rising, exchange rates
are stable, reserves are high, exports are growing, foreign direct
investment is picking up and inflation is low.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the World Bank, the East Asian
economies, including the five crisis-affected countries, the
transition economies of China and Vietnam, the newly
industrialized economies of Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, and the small poorer economies,
grew by an estimated 6.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is outpacing the rest of the five East Asian
economies with a rate that topped 10 percent, while Indonesia is
still faltering with barely positive growth.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the World Bank official said, the update shows
that private consumption is taking over as the main driver of
recovery, replacing net exports and public spending in South Korea,
Thailand, Malaysia and China.
</P>
<P>
Equitable growth is central to long-term recovery, Kassum said.
The World Bank estimates that five percent annual growth until
2008, if equally shared, would cut the number of poor people in
East Asia from 278 million to 72 million.
</P>
<P>
He said that the scope of reform already undertaken in East
Asia is impressive, "but the reforms are by no means complete, and
much of the difficult policy reform and restructuring remains to
be done."

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed, 38 Injured in Mortar Attack in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Four people have been killed and
38 others injured in a mortar attack by Iranian agents against
densely-populated residential areas in the capital Baghdad, said an
Iraqi security spokesman on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the killed in the attack late Tuesday, two were Iraqis and
the other two were from other Arab countries, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The injured, including children, women and the elderly, have
been sent to hospital for emergency treatment, with some of them in
critical conditions, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi security authorities have launched an immediate
investigation into the incident and found a mortar and two mortar
shells at the scene.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian agents fired six mortar shells at those areas which
resulted in such heavy casualties, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad held Iran responsible for the attack, claiming that Iraq
will retaliate against such acts of aggression "at a suitable
time", said the INA.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year bloody war that ended in
1988, and relations between the two countries have remained
strained ever since.
</P>
<P>
More than a decade after the end of the war, Baghdad and Tehran
have yet to settle issues related to prisoners of war, border
demarcation and reparations.
</P>
<P>
For years, the two Gulf neighbors have been trading accusations
against each other for harboring dissidents who are engaged in
terrorist activities, hampering the normalization of bilateral
relations.

BEIRUT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Two pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militiamen were wounded in an explosion detonated by
Hezbollah Wednesday morning in the Israeli-occupied security zone.
</P>
<P>
The People's Sound radio reported Hezbollah detonated an
explosive near a road in the region of Tibannen in central sector
of the "security zone" when a SLA patrol passed by.
</P>
<P>
Heavy exchange of gunfire broke out between resistance, and SLA
and Israeli troops. A Lebanese solider was injured by a stray
bullet in his residence.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border strip in south Lebanon in 1985 as
occupied zone, with a declared aim to protect its northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state
enforce the "security zone".
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet on March 5 approved Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
plan to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon. But Hezbollah vowed
they would not forgive the pro-Israeli militiamen regarded as
traitors.
</P>
<P>
Resistance fighters of Hezbollah, or Party of God, have been
waging a war of attrition to end Israeli occupation of south
Lebanon, the last active Arab-Israeli battlefront.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Rejects Accord on Electoral Commission Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
Tuesday turned its back on the Commonwealth-brokered accord
between the ruling party CCM and the opposition party CUF on
electoral commission reform, the Guardian newspaper reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Just a few months before the general elections to be held in
October this year, the Zanzibar government broke its promise to
the Commonwealth Union and refused to reform the Zanzibar
Electoral Commission, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Zanzibar Revolutionary government, CCM (Chama
Cha Mapinduzi) and CUF (Civic United Front) signed an agreement
brokered by the Commonwealth Union, which among other things,
required it to reform the electoral commission before the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed in the accord that members of the commission
would be appointed after a consensus was reached between the
government, CCM and CUF.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zanzibar State House spokesman Hafidh Ali
announced Tuesday that the Zanzibar President would continue to
appoint the chairman and members of the electoral commission
because the ruling party and Zanzibar's main opposition party
could never reach a compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
This is in direct contrast to the accord which ended more than
three years of a political impasse on the isles.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has faced political deadlock since Salmin Amour was
narrowly elected in October, 1995 for a second term as president
of the islands, which form half of the Tanzanian Union.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the reason why such a decision was made, the
spokesman said that it was reached to avert a political squabble
between the ruling party and Zanzibar's main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar Revolutionary government had the right to reject
the Commonwealth accord because it was not backed by law, Hafidh
said.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks in Right Direction: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Burundi peace
talks are heading in the right direction under the mediation of
the former South African President Nelson Mandela, Tanzanian media
reported here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A special envoy of the United Nations was quoted as saying on
Tuesday that it was encouraging to note that almost all factions
in Burundi were confident with Mandela.
</P>
<P>
It seems things are on the positive directions, said the
special envoy of the U.N. Secretary General on Great Lakes region
Ambassador Dinka Berhanu.
</P>
<P>
After Mandela's address to the talks in Tanzania's north town
of Arusha last month involving various Burundian parties, all
parties are quite happy with him, said the Ethiopia-born envoy.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the retired South African President stated
categorically that the Tutsi domination over the majority Hutus in
Burundi is the source of the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Berhanu said Mandela's sentiment never set a bad precedence to
the talks which are scheduled to continue next month.
</P>
<P>
The move is not only a critical chapter, but also part of the
process in the peace talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy is in Tanzania to discuss with the government on the
proposed international conference on peace, security, democracy
and development in Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Since he took over as mediator of the Burundi's peace talks in
December last year, Mandela has been pushing hard for a quick end
to a six-year ethnic conflict between the Burundian Hutu rebels
and the Tutsi-dominated army which has killed more than 200,000
people and uprooted more than 1.2 million others.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Warns Against Call for Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Presidency Tuesday
described the recent agitation in some states for federation a
"very grave" development and urged Nigerians to protect the
country's unity, reported the Guardian, a leading Nigerian
newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"What we should be doing at this time should be to break the
anti- democratic forces trying to destabilize the nation and the
young democracy under the guise of religion and ethnicity," the
paper quoted the Special Assistant to the President on Media and
Publicity, Doyin Okupe as saying in the West African country's
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Okupe urged Nigerians to unite and protect the fledgling
democracy rather than engage in actions that may lead to its
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there is no better time than now for
Nigerians and other patriots to exhibit patriotism towards their
country.
</P>
<P>
House of Assembly of the country's South-Eastern Imo state
Monday passed a resolution calling for the transformation of the
country into a federation with a weaker central government.
</P>
<P>
Some other states in the South-Eastern area also expressed the
same demand lately, in the aftermath of the crisis over the
introduction of the Islamic Law Sharia in the country's North.
</P>
<P>
Okupe said: "It is quite understandable of people from the East
to feel unnecessarily haunted in the country as they have had to
pay with their blood each time there was a problem. But we should
unite to protect the nation and not to break it."
</P>
<P>
On Monday's disturbances in Kaduna during which four persons
were reportedly killed, Okupe said media reports on the matter
were largely exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the curfew imposed by the state governor
Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi following the skirmish, was aimed at
localizing it.
</P>
<P>
He said the governor Tuesday called the President Olusegun
Obasanjo and assured him that the situation was under control.
</P>
<P>
Okupe also dismissed as rumors reports that the country's
Northern Kano State Government plans to begin implementation of
Sharia rule on March 27.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the governor has in no way indicated that he
had set aside the decision of the National Council of State on the
matter.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Popularizes New-Type Water Taps to Reduce Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital city Beijing
declared on the eighth annual World Water Day today that it will
gradually phase out old-type water taps in order to reduce the
waste of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Several teams of volunteers were organized today to help
popularize the use of a new-type water faucet in households as
part of the activities held to mark World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
Instead of needing to be turned tightly, the new water-saving
tap can be turned on and off easily and instantly.
</P>
<P>
A dripping water faucet can cause the waste of between one and
six tons of water per month, according to the municipal office for
water conservation.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the office said that about half of the households
and institutions in Beijing are still using the old-type taps
today, and these taps start dripping after being used for some
time, causing a great waste of water every year.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage is a prominent problem in Beijing, and the per
capita water resources here amount to only 300 cubic meters, only
about one-eighth of the national average and one-thirtieth of the
world average.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Kills SLA Security Man in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah Tuesday prowled into a
village in the southern occupied zone and executed a security man
of South Lebanon Army (SLA), Daily Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Two Hezbollah squads infiltrated the village of Markaba, two
kilometers from the border in the central sector of the occupation
zone, and shot dead Ahmad Shahla, a member of SLA's security
branch.
</P>
<P>
It is the first operation of its kind staged by resistance and
came a day after Hezbollah withdrew its support for a bill granting
amnesty to SLA militiamen, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah described the attach as a "qualitative breakthrough in
the Zionist security net".
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the shooting, Hezbollah mortar teams outside
the zone provided covering fire for their escaping comrades.
</P>
<P>
Shahla was a member of the SLA's security branch, the General
Security Service (GSS) that is reported to work closely with Israel
in detaining civilians and handling interrogations.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled "security zone" in 1985 in south
Lebanon saying it needed to protect its northern settlements from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish state
patrol the "security zone".
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's plan to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon. But
Hezbollah repeatedly announced they will not forgive the SLA
militiamen that were regarded as traitors.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas are waging a war of attrition to end SLA
and Israeli control over south Lebanon, the last active Arab-
Israeli battlefield.

At 10:30 a.m. (local time), Israeli troops opened fire to
blockade a school in south Lebanon, which caused fear among
students and teachers, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Israeli planes raided the village of
Mansuri in western part of the Israeli-occupied "security zone" in
south Lebanon after Hezbollah guerrillas attacked Israeli positions
in the region.
</P>
<P>
So far, there were no immediate reports about causalities.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985
with a self-claimed aim of protecting settlements along its border
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which was formed
in 1982 after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, has been leading a
guerrilla war to oust the Israeli troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet has approved the plan made by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak for the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from south
Lebanon by July, with or without agreements with Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Japan, DPRK Set Time for First Normalization Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to hold their first round of
negotiations on normalizing diplomatic ties in Pyongyang on April
4-8, Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kono unveiled the agreement on the negotiation timetable at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News quoted a senior government official as saying that
the two countries had been working on the timetable since they
announced on March 7 their agreement to launch normalization talks
sometime before mid-April in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to hold the second round in Tokyo and
the third in Beijing or another country, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Kojiro Takano, ambassador in charge of normalization talks with
the DPRK, will lead the Japanese side, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are unlikely to have substantive discussions at
the first "getting-acquainted" session. Instead, they will try to
set the agenda for following sessions by reviewing the latest
developments involving the two nations and refreshing the four
major issues they took up in the past negotiations, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The four issues include relations between the DPRK and South
Korea, compensation issues related to Japan's 1941-1945 colonial
rule of the Korean Peninsula, international issues such as nuclear
development and other bilateral problems.
</P>
<P>
Previous talks between the two countries on normalizing ties
began in January 1991, but collapsed after eight rounds in
November 1992.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Justice Minister Visits Switzerland Before Mossad Agent Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin began his visit to Switzerland on Wednesday with the
forthcoming trial of an Israeli secret agent reportedly on top of
his agenda.
</P>
<P>
Beilin will be meeting with his Swiss counterpart Ruth Metzler
and Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss for a brief session during what
is officially described as a "courtesy visit."
</P>
<P>
The Swiss authorities say there is no fixed agenda for the
talks, but it is widely expected that the agent's trial will
feature prominently.
</P>
<P>
The Mossad agent, who has only been identified as "Y" in the
Israeli media, was arrested together with four others on February
18, 1998 when they attempted to install a bugging device on the
telephone line of a suspected Islamic militant living near Berne.
He was detained while the other four were released after
questioning.
</P>
<P>
The agent was released on a bail of 3 million Swiss francs (
about 1.8 million U.S. dollars) on April 26, 1998, but is due to
return to Switzerland for his trial on July 3.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Berne last week, Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy declined to comment on the case, saying it was a matter
for the judicial authorities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Yi Labors for Olympics Berth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The diminutive tennis player has
a dull life track: travel- play, then travel-play.
</P>
<P>
She has a single dream -- eligible for the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
To win the eligibility, Yi Jingqian, the top Chinese player,
faces a daunting challenge -- rank among the top 80 in the world
before July 10 to enhance qualifying chance.
</P>
<P>
"Even if you rank among the top 80, Olympic ticket is not
certain. But generally speaking, the top 80 are the most likely to
qualify for the Games," said Sun Wenbin, an official with the
Chinese Tennis Association (CTA).
</P>
<P>
Yi, however, is relying on her natural ability and strong
determination to inch closer to Sydney as in the WTA rankings
released on March 20, she placed 98th with 310.5 points.
</P>
<P>
Before the Australian Open in late January, she ranked only
141st in the world and entered the Grand Slam tournament as a wild
card.
</P>
<P>
The rankings hike, however, came after she unremittingly played
every meet and fought for every match.
</P>
<P>
"My aim this year is just to gain Olympic ticket," said Yi. "To
win more ranking points, I need to give full display in every meet
and fight for every point."
</P>
<P>
Following the Australian Open, she went to the United States
for three 25,000 U.S. dollars event before returning home for two
more events.
</P>
<P>
"I have been playing non-stop, it is really exhausting," said
Yi, who has to deal with the high intensity of tournaments and
contrasting weather conditions from place to place.
</P>
<P>
Yi has been put to the test of the grueling international
competition after the CTA made a bold decision in late 1998 to
join its top women players in the WTA tour for more ranking points
and international exposure.
</P>
<P>
"To play as a professional means you have to play throughout
the year, you have little time to rest or enjoy.
</P>
<P>
"I can only feel happy by winning matches. Only when I win, I
feel the tour is worthwhile. But if I am suffering a losing skid,
it is easy to imagine how I would feel," said Yi. "Life is hard
and dull indeed."
</P>
<P>
The growing pain is hard but proved to be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
Her confidence to rank higher has been boosted since the
Australian Open where she reached a career high by making the
third round.
</P>
<P>
"I had built up morale by playing against world elite. I am
upbeat to win higher ranking and will be more self-confident when
I meet good players," said Yi.

<HEADLINE> Restoration of Ancient Palace Underway in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of restoration of
an imperial palace hall built more than 1,300 years ago in Chang'
an, the capital of China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and now
called Xi'an, is now underway.
</P>
<P>
China, UNESCO, and Japan have successfully completed the first
phase of restoration of Hanyuan Hall, the main part of Daming
Palace, at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Historical records say that state rituals and important
ceremonies including diplomatic exchanges were carried out in
Hanyuan Hall.
</P>
<P>
The Daming Palace in the northeastern district of Xi'an, now
the capital of Shaanxi Province, was the nerve center of Tang
politics when Chang'an was at its peak as a cosmopolitan city,
with residents of many ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
The palace was built in 662 and was destroyed by fire during a
war in 886.
</P>
<P>
Joint action by China, UNESCO and Japan to preserve the ancient
palace was agreed to in 1995, and a total of two million U.S.
dollars is being invested in the project.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak confirmed that Syria and
Israel have pursued unannounced indirect peace negotiations in the
weeks since formal face-to-face talks broke down in January.
</P>
<P>
In an interview carried in Tuesday's Washington Post, Mubarak
said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Faruk Shareh have maintained contact throughout the lull in formal
discussions by using what he called "special envoys", as well as
American and British go-betweens.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak added that if, as is anticipated, talks are renewed
after U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Syrian counterpart Hafez
al-Assad meet in Geneva on Sunday, the remaining substantive
issues "will not be so complicated."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior members of U.S. Congress, Jewish leaders and
Washington lobbyists have reached a consensus that difficulties can
be expected in approving any large aid package requested to support
the peace process between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
U.S. aid is viewed by both Israel and Syria as a needed
condition for signing a peace deal. However, reports that have
reached Jerusalem recently say there is strong congressional
opposition to giving military aid to Syria and to sending U.S.
troops to the Golan Heights, as well as some opposition to economic
aid to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The reports also claim that Israel will have an uphill battle to
get civilian or economic aid after a withdrawal from the Golan, as
well as the 17 billion U.S. dollars military aid package it
requested to pay for the transfer of military bases and for the
comprehensive modernization of the military.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Final-status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians
reopened in Washington with no fanfare Tuesday. The two
delegations, led by Oded Eran and Yasser Abed Rabbo respectively,
launched the talks with lunch at Bolling Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
The teams then spent the rest of the day deciding how to proceed
structurally -- how and in what order to tackle the tough issues of
Jerusalem, settlements, refugees and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Israeli officials say the talks are significant
since they represent a renewal of trust between the sides in recent
weeks, after the talks stalled in early February.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Peace deals among Israel, Syria and Lebanon could be signed
within two months, allowing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
put the agreements to a referendum at the end of May, according to
Patrick Seale, British journalist and close confident to Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Writing in Al-Hayat newspaper Tuesday, Seale said the Sunday
summit in Geneva between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Assad
signals the end-game of a process that started at the October 1991
Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, he wrote, is expected to convey to Assad certain
specific assurances from Barak regarding full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights. In return, he is expected to receive from Assad
equally specific assurances concerning water, security, and
normalization of ties, which Barak needs to "sell" an agreement to
a "skeptical" Israeli public.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Promises To Remove Trade Impediments With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
President Bill Clinton Wednesday promised to remove all "existing
impediments" to trade with India while urging developing countries
to open up their economies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the joint session of both houses of the Indian
Parliament here Wednesday morning, Clinton said only the opening-
up process would help developing countries succeed in speeding up
development and tackling the scourge of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who began his five-day state visit to the South Asian
country on Tuesday, assured to forge new Indo-U.S. partnership in
economic cooperation, promising that Washington would remove all
existing impediments to accelerate trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke highly of India's economic reforms, terming it as
one of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world and
forecasting its economy would grow by as high as 500 percent in
the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Americans have applauded your efforts to open the economy,
your commitment to new economic reforms and your determination to
bring fruits of growth to all your people," Said Clinton, who is
the first U.S. president to visit India in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Washington and New Delhi reached an agreement on Tuesday to
lower tariffs to expand market access of key U.S. agricultural
exports to India which is more than 40 million U.S. dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
"Under the agreement, U.S. exporters to India will now face
lower tariffs by up to one half on items such as almonds, orange
juice, citrus and other fresh fruits," according to a White House
statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was negotiated under the auspices of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), it said, adding that in exchange for its
tariffs cuts in the agricultural items of interest to the U.S.,
India would adjust its tariffs on other agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is not only the largest investor in India but also
India's largest trading partner with two-way trade increased to 12.
79 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, official figures showed.
</P>
<P>
India's exports to the U.S., which have been steadily growing
since 1992 at an average rate of 13.7 percent in dollar terms,
increased to 9.083 billion dollars last year from only 3.781
billion dollars in 1992 and 6.169 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, India's imports from the U.S. declined by 0.6 percent
to 3.318 billion dollars in 1996, increased by 8.9 percent to 3.
616 billion dollars in 1997, declined again by 1.96 percent to 3.
545 billion dollars in 1998 and grew by 4.6 percent to 3.707
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
India's exports to the U.S. have been rising mainly on account
of significant increases in the exports of diamonds, textiles and
ready-made garments, machinery, carpets, footwear and leather
products, dyes, iron and steel products, chemicals, edible fruit
and nuts and spices, coffee and tea.

<HEADLINE> Frenchman Accused of Illegally Removing Antiques in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A Frenchman has been accused of
removing paleontological objects without permission in Kenya, the
East African Standard newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Martin Pickford, a paleontologist and co-author of Master of
Deceit, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday through his lawyer in a
Nairobi court, saying that his arrest was due to "some powerful
forces out to settle personal scores."
</P>
<P>
Pickford was found conducting a surface operation search for
antiques without an exploration licence and removing Kenya's
protected objects without a permit earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The book Master of Deceit is about Kenya's world-renown
paleontologist Richard Leakey when he was director of the National
Museum of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Leakey, highly respected by Kenyans, was appointed as Head of
Civil Service last year by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.

<HEADLINE> Truck Driver Charged With Oscar Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A truck driver was charged
Tuesday with grand theft of 55 Oscar statuettes and another
suspect arrested in the case was expected to be released,
authorities in Los Angeles said.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Ledent, a 38-year-old truck driver for Rodway
Transportation Co., is charged with a single count of grand theft.
If convicted, Ledent could face a maximum of three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Oscars were manufactured by a Chicago company at a cost of
about 18,000 U.S. dollars and were shipped on March 3. They
arrived at Roadway Express' warehouse in Bell, California, on
March 8 and then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two of the 55 missing Oscar prizes were recovered Sunday
night after a junk salvager, rummaging through a garbage container,
found them next to a trash bin in Korean town in downtown Los
Angeles and contacted authorities.
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Attorney Gregson A. Somes said no charges were
filed at this time against a second suspect, Anthony Hart, 38, a
dock worker with Roadway who was arrested in connection with the
case.
</P>
<P>
Somes said there was "insufficient evidence against Hart to
prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt" -- a statement sure to
embarrass Los Angeles police, who trumpeted the arrests of Ledent
and Hart at a news conference packed with reporters from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, police said that the investigation
had "quickly focused on Anthony Hart." Police spokesmen said they
were surprised to learn the latest development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sam Ohta ordered
Ledent held on 20,000 dollars bail and ordered him to appear in
court on April 18 for a preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
Outside court, Ledent's attorney told reporters that his client
was innocent and was being treated unfairly by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ledent did not steal these Oscars," said attorney Jay
Jaffe. "Mr. Ledent is a dupe in this matter. The Oscars were
placed in his truck without his knowledge."
</P>
<P>
Police said the Oscar thieves had planned to sell the famous
statuettes, but abandoned that plan after the theft drew
international attention.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Economy Expected to Keep Rising in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean economy is
expected to continue rising in the second quarter of this year,
due to increasing sales of electronics and semiconductors, the
Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports of electronics, semiconductors and petrochemicals are
expected to rise by 20 to 40 percent because of business recovery
in European and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Strengthened competitiveness and positive economic
restructuring will assure the rising trend in the second quarter
of both domestic sales and exports in most industry sectors,
despite international oil prices hike and the South Korean won's
appreciation against the U.S. dollar, the KCCI said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, domestic demand for machinery and steel
products is expected to soar 20 percent over the same period last
year, because of increased consumption and expansion of new
facility investments.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand for electronics and autos will rise 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Construction sectors, which suffered a depression of minus 10.1
percent growth in 1999 following a fall of 8.6 percent in 1998,
will also recover as reconstruction and redevelopment projects are
being implemented.
</P>
<P>
However, exports of refined oil and steel are expected to
decrease, the chamber said.

<P>
TOKYO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed mixed in Tokyo
Wednesday, with several high-priced information and technology
issues facing selling following their recent gains.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose for the fourth straight
trading day, up 131.23 points, or 0.67 percent from Tuesday's
close to end at 19,733.59.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) which covers

percent to 1,658.32.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 765.17 million
shares from Tuesday's 651.64 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba Corp. was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Banks were generally lower, but brokerage houses drew buying on
expectations that their commissions will increase because of
individual investors' strong demand for stocks, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand-related issues, such as drugmakers, glass
manufacturers and steelmakers, were among gainers, while
construction firms, electric power and gas firms and real estate
companies were included in the losers, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 675 to 593, with 137 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Bayi Record Five-time Title in CBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bayi Rockets kept the title
untouchable this season when the military team, for five straight
times, won the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league, while
the league is calling for a change.
</P>
<P>
Bayi, which surrendered just one game in the 1999-2000 season
to the Beijing Ducks, remained unbeaten in the playoffs after they
crushed the finals newcomers Shanghai Sharks 3-0 in the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
The only CBA team which have no foreign recruit, Bayi keep
their title-winning legend with a squad filled with internationals.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhizhi, Liu Yudong, Zhang Jinsong, Li Nan and Fanbin were
all members of the national team which won the Asian Games in
Bangkok in 1998 and the Asian Championships in Fukuoka of Japan in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Other teams were intimated by the chemistry, defense and
experiences of the powerhouse, which expect no challenge to their
league superiority in a decade.
</P>
<P>
But Shanghai did blow a fresh breeze to the league by storming
into the finals, which, in the last four seasons, was virtually a
derby between arch-rivals Bayi and Liaoning Hunters.
</P>
<P>
With teenage sensation Yao Ming blooming faster than anyone
could imagine, Shanghai edged out old name Guangdong Tigers 3-2 in
the semi-finals to set up a new finals confrontation between Yao
Ming and Wang Zhizhi, the two tallest players of the league.
</P>
<P>
However, Bayi's solid defense dampened Shanghai's confidence
and bravery in the first game in Shanghai. The reigning champions
rolled over to the title with three games down in straight in the
best-of-five series. Bayi had the advantage in every aspect of
basketball and put nothing at stake, just as before.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, which contracted two tall and masculine Americans
before the season, suffered their worst fall in the league when
they slumped to fifth place.
</P>
<P>
While Vanguard Aoshen, a re-union team of former Vanguard and
Aoshen, raised eyebrows at the beginning of the season but failed
to live up to the expectations and was finished before semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
As for the Most Valuable Player award, pivot Wang Zhizhi, who
was picked up by NBA Dallas Mavericks last summer but failed to
make a U.S. trip as the Bayi club turned down the offer, is a hot
favorite to win the award for the first time.
</P>
<P>
But Wang didn't top any statistic lists whereas Jiangsu Dragons
' forward Hu Weidong was in the center of controversy over the MVP
selection.
</P>
<P>
The MVP award, which was won every time by the leading scorer
in last four regular seasons, could only be taken by players from
the top four teams under a new rule adopted by CBA this season.
</P>
<P>
Hu, the MVP in the Asian Championships last September in Japan,
led the league with scoring, three-pointers and steals, and second
in assists. But Jiangsu were out of top four.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed with the decision because I felt so good this
season," Hu, who recovered from injuries this season, told a
popular Chinese Central Television program -- Basketball Park on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang's domination of the key has also been strongly challenged
by Sharks' Yao, 2.23 meters compared to Wang's 2.15.
</P>
<P>
Yao, 19, three years younger than Wang, topped the league in
rebounds, blocks and dunks in the regular season and was selected
in the Nike Summit Championships for his brilliant performance in
CBA.
</P>
<P>
Yao was unstoppable in the finals in the face-off with Wang and
his team, but needed more strength and experiences to top Wang in
the future.
</P>
<P>
And the CBA is welcoming more changes to inspire a national
enthusiasm for the sport.

CHONGQING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the largest
municipality in southwest China, reported total exports of 98.47
million U.S. dollars for January and February this year, up 85
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the two months had a 2.8-fold increase to 145

</P>
<P>
Viet Nam became the city's third-largest export market after
Japan and the United States, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed export growth to the city's efforts to improve

<HEADLINE> 300-Year-Old Tomb Unearthed at U.S. Embassy Compound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Carefully flicking away soft
earth with a brush to expose a corner of the coffin, Wang Qinglin,
archaeologist with the Beijing Culture and Heritage Preservation
Bureau (BCHPB), dealt with a 300-year-old tomb like he was
delivering a baby.
</P>
<P>
"I have unearthed lots of ancient tombs in Beijing, but this is
different," said Wang, who has spent more than ten years working
on and researching tombs and cultural relics, because the location
is the US embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
Notified of the tomb on March 3, Wang and his colleagues came
to the site and removed a skeleton, some coins, and a jar with a
rare green glaze. Some American embassy staffers were very curious
about the find, which is older than their nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
After a careful examine of the skull, archaeologists inferred
that the skeleton was a woman, 35 to 45 years old, buried during
the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) at the time of Emperor Kang Xi
(reigned 1662-1722 ).
</P>
<P>
Sources from the U.S. embassy said the tomb was found by local
Chinese laborers on February 26. All the bones and artifacts now
have been removed and are being conserved by the BCHPB.
</P>
<P>
Wang said such a find could be expected at places such as the
location of the U.S. embassy in eastern Beijing, which was on the
remote outskirts of the city during the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The veteran expert said that with the acceleration of urban
construction in Beijing, more and more ancient tombs and relics
are being found at building sites, and he and his colleagues are
engaged in excavating, cleaning, and protecting this cultural
heritage.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Works out Plans for Industrial, Technological Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has worked out two plans aimed
at promoting the development of industry and technology in the
first 10 years of the 21st century, a pro-government newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a ministerial meeting presided over by President Hosni
Mubarak on Tuesday, Minister of Industry and Technological
Development Moustafa Mohamed Othman el-Refay presented the plans,
said the English-language Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The first plan, which will expire in 2004, proposed the
establishment of a holding company for industrial and technological
development and a national program for improving product quality,
the paper quoted Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif as telling
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The plan called for developing vocational training centers,
paying more attention to small projects and modernizing all
agencies working in the field of industry, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The other plan, which will end in 2010, is aimed at setting up
companies and research centers for industrial and technological
progress, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which Sharif said sought to help achieve a
technological breakthrough in the country's industry, Mubarak
stressed the importance of improving the quality of Egyptian
products and raising the productivity of workers and technicians to
reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
The president also highlighted the importance of developing the
existing industrial projects, making full use of the resources,
introducing hi-tech industries and adopting plans to develop mining
and heavy industries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is short of a strong industrial basis, and industrial
output and export keep at a low level.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Renewed Dialogue on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I have not come to South Asia to mediate... Only India and
Pakistan can work out the problems between them," Clinton told
Indian legislators while addressing both houses of the Indian
parliament here on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first U.S. President to visit India in 22 years.
Before his arrival here on Sunday, India had repeatedly said that
it would not accept any third party's advice or mediation on the
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
As a country with a democratic system, India should pursue
dialogue with Pakistan in a bid to resolve the regional tension in
South Asia, especially the tension between the two neighboring
countries, said Clinton, adding that India should show its
neighbors that democracy is about dialogue and negotiations
between people who differ.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, however, made a subtle suggestion for
involving Washington in resolving the Kashmir problem by making
reference to the solution found to the Kargil conflict in mid last
year.
</P>
<P>
"But if outsiders cannot resolve this problem, I hope you will
create the opportunity to do it yourself...calling on the support
of others who can help where possible as American diplomacy did in
urging the Pakistanis to go back behind the Line of Control in the
Kargil crisis," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would also push the Pakistani leadership for
the early restoration of Indo-Pakistani talks during his brief
stopover in Islamabad on his way home after the five-day visit to
India.
</P>
<P>
"I will say the same thing to General Musharraf in Islamabad,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> TNI Supports Govt's Move for Reconciliation in Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
reaffirmed its support for the government's move to work for
reconciliation process in Aceh province in a bid to put an end to
the conflict there.
</P>
<P>
The support came after the central government last week kicked
off the long-waited talks with the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), an
underground organization which has been fighting for Independence
of the province over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"TNI has for long time not committed repressive actions in
handling the problem of Aceh," TNI chief Adm. Widodo A.S. told
reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Widodo reiterated that the government and the TNI will always
put priority on dialogue measures in handling the problem in Aceh
with minimum violence.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on President Abdurrahman Wahid's remark on Tuesday
that members of the GAM could join the TNI, Widodo said this could
be done,"provided (they) meet the qualifications and pass the (
military) test."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a thousand of the Indonesian Military Marine Unit(
Marinir) personnel at its headquarters here Tuesday, the president
said that the government would allow ex-members of GAM to join
Marinir, "as long as (they) pass the examination."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries to Persuade India on Nuclear Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the "Vision Statement" on India-U.S. relations signed on
Tuesday bluntly stated that "the United States believes India
should forgo nuclear weapons," Clinton, in his address to both
houses of the Indian parliament here Wednesday morning, said that
"only India can determine its own interests."
</P>
<P>
However, he went on to ask the Indian people if they feel safer
today than before the nuclear tests and whether the country will
benefit from expanding its nuclear and missile capabilities if
that spurs its neighbors to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Only India knows if it can afford a sustained investment in
both nuclear and conventional military forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on New Delhi to draw lesson from "America's own
experience" during the cold war, when its nuclear arms race with
the former Soviet Union caused a huge waste of resources and
hindered its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that India should follow the example of the United
States and Russia, which are cutting their nuclear arsenals and
working for non-proliferation across the world.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the current high-level dialogue
on non-proliferation between India and the United States could
continue and achieve some progress.
</P>
<P>
In response to Clinton's persuasion, Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee, who spoke in the parliament after Clinton, noted
that the world today continues to witness proliferation of nuclear
weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
India's decision to maintain a minimum credible nuclear
deterrent is prompted by a "realistic assessment" of its security
compulsions, and New Delhi's defense posture has always been
defensive in nature, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the importance that you attach, Mr. President,
to the subject of non-proliferation," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Urged to Treat Water as Economic Resource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official on
Wednesday urged his countrymen to treat water as an economic
resource because water just like any other resource is a very rare
commodity.
</P>
<P>
In a message for world day for water, which falls on March 22,
Minister of Energy and Water Development David Saviye noted that
most of Zambia's existing infrastructure can not meet the
increased demand by growing population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the situation is particularly grave in rural and
peri-urban areas of his country, where the majority of the people
do not have access to clean water supply.
</P>
<P>
Presently the rural water supply coverage stands at 43 percent
as compared to urban population access to safe water supply
estimated at 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the provision of clean and safe
water is an important factor in prevention of water-borne diseases
such as cholera, which continues to haunt Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Saviye called on the Zambians to support the cost-sharing
policy on water supply facilities, saying: "We must change our
attitude from that of being receivers to being partners in
development in this respect."
</P>
<P>
The world day for water is pivotal to address the bottle necks
relation to drinking water supply and increase awareness about the
importance of conservation, preservation, and protection of water
resources, he said.

<HEADLINE> Famine Alert Declared in Northeastern Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
declared a famine alert in Wajir District in North Eastern
Province and announced the release of 200 million shillings (some
2.6 million U.S. dollars) for relief operation, the government-run
Kenya Times reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The money released would be used to purchase more than 117,000
bags of maize (90 kilograms per bag) for areas severely hit by
famine as a result of persistent drought, the report quoted
Minister Shariff Nassir in the Office of the President as saying
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is in charge of relief and rehabilitation,
said that his government has so far spent over 747.8 million
shillings (around 10.1 million U.S. dollars) for purchase and
distribution of maize as emergency relief supplies in this
financial year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wajir, Mandera District in North Eastern
Province, Turkana District in northern Rift Valley Province and
Moyale District in northern Eastern Province have also been
severely affected by drought and famine, he said.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the United Nations World Food Program
appealed to donors to offer 43.4 million U.S. dollars to over two
million Kenyans who need food aid after the dire effects of
drought in large parts of the country.

HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of Lands and

</P>

Kangai, who has served the government since 1980 in various

Kangai sauntered into a courtroom in Harare Tuesday afternoon,
accompanied by his wife and flanked by Assistant Commissioner
Negion Moyo and Superintendent Nyathi.
</P>
<P>
Harare Provincial Magistrate Remigius Jemwa handed a
seven-point order compelling Kangai to surrender his passport, to
report three times a week to the police and live at his Borrowdale
home until the matter is finalized.
</P>
<P>
Kangai did not say anything in court. But, Kangai later told
reporters outside the court that he would not resign in the face
of the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Q&AMP;A About Russia's Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian voters will go to the
polls on Sunday to elect a new president. Following are some
questions and answers about the elections:
</P>
<P>
Who are the major contenders?
</P>
<P>
-- There are altogether 12 candidates participating in the
elections, but Acting President Vladimir Putin is the undisputed
frontrunner. Although none of the other candidates pose any real
challenge to Putin, major contenders in the race include Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov; Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal
Yabloko party, and ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader
of the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls give Putin an approval rating of about 60 percent
while Zyuganov is put in a far-away second place with about 20
percent. Ratings for Yavlinsky and Zhirinovsky are in single
figures.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 47, was appointed prime minister in August last year and
automatically became acting president after former president Boris
Yeltsin's surprise resignation on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Why is Putin so popular?
</P>
<P>
-- It is generally believed that Putin owes much of his
popularity to the anti-terrorist military campaign he launched in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya. However, his public support
has some other deep-rooted reasons.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Russians have become fed up with economic
shambles, lower living standards and Russia's waning influence in
the international arena. Putin's image as an incorruptible, steel-
willed leader as displayed in Chechnya, and his slogan of a
stronger motherland gave Russians a shimmer of hope that a
strongman would rejuvenate the Russian nation. His seemingly
endless energy and no-nonsense work style also hold a great appeal
to Russians voters.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
How does the election work?
</P>
<P>
-- Under a new law signed into force by Yeltsin shortly before
his resignation, Russia's presidential elections are governed,
among other rules, by the following:
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council (the upper house of parliament) decides
the date of the elections. But if the president steps down ahead
of schedule, as Yeltsin did, a new president must be elected on
the last Sunday of the third month after the former president
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
To be registered, candidates must be nominated by a group of no
fewer than 100 people or by a political party or group registered
with the Justice Ministry no earlier than one year before the vote.
In case of an early election, candidates must collect half a
million signatures.
</P>
<P>
A candidate must win more than 50 percent of the votes cast to
win an outright victory in the first round. A run-off will be held
three weeks later if none of the candidates wins more than 50
percent in the first round. The two leading candidates in the
first round will enter the run-off. If one of the two rivals in
the run-off drops out, the candidate in the third place in the
first round will enter the run-off, and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
In the run-off, a candidate will win the race if he/she gets
more votes than the other does and than the number of votes
against both candidates.
</P>
<P>
An election will be declared invalid and a new election will be
held if the voter turnout is less than 50 percent of the
registered voters, or the number of voters who choose "none of the
above" on the list of candidates surpasses the number of voters
who vote for the leading candidate. A new election should be
conducted within four months after the previous voting, or three
months after the day when the polling is declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
In case of an early election, the newly elected president will
be sworn in on the 30th day after the outcome of the election is
officially announced by the Central Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
What's the importance of the election?
</P>
<P>
-- The outcome of the elections will not only affect the future
path of the largest country on earth, but it could also herald a
new direction in Russia's relations with the rest of the world in
the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Putin's strategy of a "constructive ambiguity" in terms of
policy orientation has attracted many supporters across the
domestic political spectrum under the banner of a stronger Russia.
It also keeps the outside world anxiously guessing Moscow's future
direction.
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, Moscow
tried to look west for solutions of its problems. The West-leaning
strategy turned out to be a failure, and Moscow shifted toward a
more balanced foreign policy. However, Russia's anemic economy and
mounting foreign debts make it inevitably dependent on Western
assistance.

Mladen Naletilic, also known as "Tuta," was charged by the

Mercosur's demand that negotiations on agriculture be put on top

U.S. Forces in South Korea, said in quotes that "North Korea is
developing an inter-continental ballistic missile with a range of
over 5,000 kilometers." The news agency quoted Schwartz as telling
a recent hearing of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that
there is need to set up a new early warning system in South Korea.
The U.S. has mistaken the DPRK's satellite launch as a "missile"
test, the commentary said. (DPRK-US-Condemnation)

HARBIN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A male jaguar recently flew a long
way aboard an Airbus from south China to northeastern Heilongjiang
Province to keep a date with two females there.
</P>
<P>
The male, from Guangzhou, is only six months years old, and
zookeeper Dong Fengyou in Harbin said he can take his time to
first make friends with the two ladies, one six and the other
three and both of cub-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
The two have never given birth as they have not yet meet their
Mr. Right, which has brought great anxiety to them and to their
keepers as well, said Dong.
</P>
<P>
Dong explained that they decided to find a male jaguar in a
faraway province in order to produce a healthy jaguar cub.
</P>
<P>
Harbin introduced the first two jaguars from Japan 15 years ago,
and local residents have fallen in love with the charming and
strong-looking animals.

<HEADLINE> 40 Percent of China's Newspapers Sold Independently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Forty percent of China's
newspapers are sold through market forces instead of the postal
sector, according to a national congress of the China Independent
Newspaper Distributors Association convened recently in the island
province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Distribution of newspapers in China was monopolized by the
postal sector until 1985 when the publisher of Luoyang Daily in
central China's Henan Province took a bold step and decided to do
the distribution on an independent basis.
</P>
<P>
China now publishes more than 2,000 newspapers, 800 of which
are distributed independently by 170,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Practice shows that independent distribution is more efficient,
costs less, and makes it easier for newspaper publishers to make
the money needed to continue publication.

year 2000, which will be examined by the Legislative Council in
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
The total sum of the budget is 12.9 billion patacas (about 1.61
billion U.S. dollars). In comparison, the fiscal budgets made by
the Portuguese Macao government stood at about 16 billion patacas
(2 billion dollars) in 1998 and 1999, respectively.
</P>

According to the budget, government departments shall spend
less money, but the spending in education, health care and the
livelihood of residents will roughly remain unchanged. In addition,
more will spend on anti-corruption.
</P>
<P>
The budget is a rigorous one which takes into consideration the
current economic conditions, so that limited resources can be
appropriately used, legislator Tong Chi Kin said.
</P>
<P>
The budget does not include the 2.4 billion patacas of
accumulated fiscal savings left by the Portuguese Macao government,

<HEADLINE> U.N. Legal Team Leaves Cambodia Without Formal Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. legal team dispatched
here for crucial talks on the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders
left the Cambodian capital Wednesday without any formal agreement
on the issue with the government.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet arrived at an overall agreement. A few issues
still divide us. But we have made great progress, and I am pleased
to confirm that we are much further along the road to success than
we were a week ago," Hans Corell, head of the U.N. team, said in
his press statement.
</P>
<P>
Before their departure, the U.N. team met with Prime Minister
Hun Sen in his Phnom Penh residence. According to Hans Corell,
they have a "very positive" meeting, and his team listened with
interest to the prime minister's explanations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Om Yin Tieng, senior advisor to Hun Sen, told reporters that "
both the prime minister and Hans Corell tried their efforts to
understand each other."
</P>
<P>
"The Royal Government of Cambodia still opens the door for
further discussion," Om Yin Tieng stressed, but adding "it is
impossible to have a clear agreement before the parliament passes
a draft law (on Khmer Rouge trial)."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Om Yin Tieng said Hun Sen will go to Havana on April,
12 to attend the G-77 summit, "so the prime minister will meet the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan there."
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly,
confirmed Wednesday that the assembly will debate the draft law on
April 19.
</P>
<P>
Corell acknowledged that Cambodia is a sovereignty country. "
Naturally, we respect the sovereignty of Cambodia, a U.N. member
state, to solve the remaining issues within its own constitutional
process," said Corell.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Rate Rise Increases Pressure on Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's interest rates could
rise again within weeks following the U.S.'s decision to lift
rates by another quarter of a percentage point, economists said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Wednesday morning a 25-basis-
point hike in the U.S. federal funds rate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rates are now 0.5 percent higher than Australia's, and
with further U.S. rises on the way, economists believe another
increase in Australia's interest rates seems inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is likely to have little
choice but to increase official interest rates," Australia's
Colonial Group chief economist Craig James said.
</P>
<P>
He said the RBA is now likely to move at its next board meeting
on April 4, with the only question now being whether the rise
would be a quarter or half of a percent.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last raised Australia's rates in early February when it
acted to increase them by 0.5 of a percent.
</P>
<P>
That lifted local short term interest rates to 5.5 percent, but
in both the United States and New Zealand, cash rates now are 6.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
While RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane has stressed that Australia
no longer slavishly follows the U.S. and other overseas rates, the
widening gap increases the pressure on the Australian dollar and
local rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar dipped below 61 U.S. cents on Wednesday,
and a further rise in U.S. rates would see the Australian dollar
come under strong pressure.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia economist Michael Blythe said
the only thing preventing a drop in the Australian dollar on
Wednesday was financial market expectation of another rate rise in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I think everything is predicated on the reserve bank moving
again, and we think they will, after the next board meeting," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another key factor will be the March 27 meeting of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss whether to increase oil production to
bring down crude oil prices which have hit an all time high in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Rising oil prices were a major factor in a further rise in
inflationary expectations in Australia, the economists said.
</P>
<P>
"Rising oil prices and the impending introduction of the goods
and services tax are key factors behind this increase," Bill Evans,
the Westpac Bank's general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
He said this would increase the pressure on the RBA to lift
interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, some of the economists believed that
Australia's economic growth is likely to remain strong for the
rest of this year, but to see some slowing in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Govt Plans to Build Third Cross-sea Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, it is just an incipient plan and needs preliminary
studies, the Macao Daily News Wednesday quoted Ao Man Long,
secretary for transportation and public projects of the Macao SAR
government, as saying.
</P>
<P>
And feasibility studies concerning site selection, time of
construction and fund raising have to be made before the project
is actually carried out, Ao Man Long said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao peninsula and Taipa were linked up for the first time
by a two-lane bridge in 1974, which greatly boosted the
development of the island.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the booming local economy made the bridge
difficult to undertake mounting traffic. The pressure of
transportation was alleviated to a great extent in 1994 when the
second cross-sea bridge was completed.
</P>
<P>
Taipa island now accommodates an international airport, a
university, a large stadium, a horse-racing ground, five-star
hotels, three casinos, and many residential quarters, restaurants
and tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Along with growing numbers of residents and vehicles in Taipa,
serious congestion often occurs in rush hours, particularly on the
old Macao-Taipa bridge.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Energy Deficit Likely to Grow:ADB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has expressed its grave concern as Bangladesh is likely to undergo
an ever-increasing energy deficit over the next 20 years, The
Bangladesh Observer reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the figure from the National Energy Policy Statement,
the ADB has termed the overall country's energy situation as "
alarming" as the demand for energy is rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The country's energy deficit is expected to rise 22- to 35-fold
from the initial energy deficit in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The ADB in its draft report also said the overall supply-demand
energy scenario of the country was alarming.
</P>
<P>
The traditional energy sources are now over-exploited, but
adoption of alternative sources of energy is constrained by
unavailability of both cash income and distribution channels, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB blamed the existing thermal power plants for energy
reduction or loss of 69 percent during transformation. To avoid
such circumstances, the bank has placed emphasis on the
introduction of combined cycle power generation facilities to
raise the proportion of energy converted.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft report, natural gas is the largest
source of the country's commercial energy supply. About 90 percent
of the electric power is fueled by gas.

<HEADLINE> WTO Moves to Resolve Australia-U.S. Lamb Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia is a step closer to
resolving its trade dispute with the United States over damaging
lamb tariffs, with the WTO choosing a disputes panel to hear the
case, Trade Minister Mark Vaile said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The panel is likely to produce a final outcome within six
months, Vaile said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Unites States decided on July 7, 1999 to impose a quota of
31,851 metric tons on lamb imports from Australia, New Zealand and
some other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tariff of 9 percent for sales within the quota
was claimed and a punishing rate for sales outside that quota is
up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand took the United States to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) after the imposition of the hefty tariffs
for their lamb exporters.
</P>
<P>
"Australia strongly believes that the United States was
unjustified in imposing import restrictions on lamb as a safeguard
measure," Vaile said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we have taken dispute action and the panel will
have our full cooperation as we now proceed to get to the bottom
of this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement of Australia, New Zealand and the United States
on panelists from Singapore, Germany and India is an important
step in the dispute process and will now allow the work of the
panel to move forward quickly," Vaile said.
</P>
<P>
An initial panel meeting within days is expected to trigger the
formal panel process, including submissions and meetings with the
various parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will
invest more than 6 billion yuan (720 million U.S. dollars) in
combating industrial pollution this year, according to the
provincial environmental protection authorities.
</P>
<P>
Main projects cover smog control, treatment of industrial waste
water and discharge of sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Pan Tiansheng, director of the provincial environmental
protection bureau, said, by implementing the plan, all the
province's industrial enterprises are expected to reach the
standard set by the state for discharging pollutants by the end of
this year. Those enterprises which can not reach the standard will
be closed down.
</P>
<P>
Anhui is one of the provinces in China with the most serious
environmental pollution problem. The Huaihe River, Chaohu Lake and
the acid rain area along the section of the Yangtze River inside
the province are three major pollution control zones designated by
the state.
</P>
<P>
At present, 3,852 of the province's total 6,275 industrial
enterprises discharge pollutants within the set standard. Another
1,390 polluting industrial enterprises have been closed down

<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China will plant 12 million more
hectares of trees for firewood in the future in an effort to ease
the energy shortage in rural areas, according to the State
Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the over-logging of forests for firewood has
accounted for 30 percent of firewood consumption in rural areas,
which lead to deteriorating soil erosion and the destruction of
the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Growing more firewood forests, a clean and renewable energy
source, will help solve the energy problem in rural regions.

for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) here today.
</P>
<P>
Sassau said that as a developing country, his country hopes
that its economy would be as dynamic as that of China's. Congo

from other countries, he said, believing that Chinese companies
would have no problems to find their proper cooperative partners
in Congo.
</P>
<P>
Sassau spoke highly of the achievements China has made since it
initiated the reform and opening-up drive over 20 years ago. He
also attributed China's rapid economic growth to the shrewd
political and economic choice of the Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yue, CCPIT vice president, said that China and Congo have
much to do in economic and trade cooperation and businessmen of
the two countries should enhance exchanges, and give free rein to

BANGKOK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Three Bangkok traffic police
officers helped a pregnant woman stuck in rush-hour traffic give
birth to a healthy baby boy early Tuesday morning, the Nation
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday morning, traffic police were alerted that a taxi
carrying a pregnant woman who was on her way to a local hospital
to give birth was stuck in heavy traffic, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Three police officers were then assigned to the scene to help
the woman, the Nation said.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, the woman gave birth to a baby boy with the
help of the three police officers.
</P>
<P>
Delivering babies is one of the duties of Bangkok traffic
police, the Nation quoted Police Major General Wongkot Maneerin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Since there are cases like this every year in the city, Wongkot
had asked the Red Cross to conduct a training program to teach
traffic police officers how to deliver a baby in an emergency
situation.
</P>
<P>
The success of Tuesday's emergency delivery was largely a
result of the special training program, Wongkot said.
</P>
<P>
The mother and her new-born son made it safely to the hospital
where they remained in good condition, police said.

<HEADLINE> Committee on Agro-based Products Export Formed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A committee to prescribe measures
to increase agricultural production and expand the market of agro-
based products was formed Tuesday during a high-level meeting, The
Financial Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) vice-
chairman A.B. Chowdhury, has been asked to conduct a complete
assessment of the state of the agricultural sector and report to
the commerce minister.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil, directed
the EPB authorities to diversify export basket, reducing
dependence on a few export items. It affirmed the government's all-
out support to the exporters of non-traditional items and called
upon entrepreneurs to produce and market new items.
</P>
<P>
Government officials at the meeting agreed to rationally reduce
the current high airfreight fare for agricultural products which
has increased the export costs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also told that the government has already
extended tariff facilities to the entrepreneurs of this sector and,
if needed, more facilities will be offered to harness full
potential of the sector. Development of the agricultural sector is
the key to success of the government's poverty alleviation efforts,
the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional agricultural products like vegetables, fruits,
flowers and betel leaves contribute insignificantly to the country
's export income. The exporters can contribute much more if
special incentives, including low airfreight fare, are given.

HANOI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
approved a list of 640 groups of products whose tariff lines will
be reduced this year within the framework of the Common Effective

</P>
<P>
The scheme aims to reduce the inter-regional tariffs for goods

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government Borrowings Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi government borrowings
from the banking sector increased by more than 26 percent during
the first seven months of the current fiscal year (1999-2000),
compared with the corresponding period of the last fiscal year,
The New Nation Wednesday quoted banking sector sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of loans taken from the banking sector by the
government during the first seven months of the current fiscal
year stood at about 30 billion taka (580 million U.S. dollars) on
a monthly average of 4.23 billion taka (83 million dollars),
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
They said the government is resorting to an increasing amount
of loans from the banking sector to meet current expenditures due
to the failure in revenue collection which remains below the
target by around 20 billion taka (390 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Huge borrowings from the banking sector by the government have
reduced the capacity of the commercial banks to respond to the
requirements of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Bank loans provided to the private sector only increased by 4.5
percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
The government is now seriously considering reducing the size
of the annual development program as extensively as possible to
check the existing trend of government borrowings from the banking
sector, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Airlines to Resume Flights to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslavia National Airline
(JAT) is going to reopen its air service between Yugoslavia and
European Union countries, the company's general manager Zzika
Petrovich said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Petrovich made the announcement when addressing an anniversary
celebration of a radio station operating under the company, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
He said JAT is ready to resume air service linking Yugoslavia
to Frankfurt and Dusseldorf the next day after the European Union
lifts its ban on Yugoslav flights.
</P>
<P>
He added that flights to other Western European cities such as
Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Rome would follow.
</P>
<P>
Petrovich said that he was confident his company would soon
take back its international market share because JAT had not
closed its offices in some European countries even during the EU
sanction.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of Belgrade Airport, Ljubomir Achimovich,
told Tanjug that more and more European airlines will resume
flights to Belgrade following the EU's lift-off of the ban.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, many airline companies, including those
from Greece, Switzerland, Germany and Austria, will have reopened
flights to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, the European Union banned Yugoslav airplanes
from landing on EU airports as well as flights from EU countries
to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers decided on Monday in Brussels to lift the
ban, which will not take effect until the EU makes an official
statement.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns U.S. General's Remark on Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea has slammed a U.S. commander's allegation that
Pyongyang is developing an inter-continental ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary released Tuesday, the official Korean Central
News Agency (KCNA) refuted what Thomas Schwartz, the commander of
U.S. Forces in South Korea, said in quotes that "North Korea is
developing an inter-continental ballistic missile with a range of
over 5,000 kilometers."
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Schwartz as telling a recent hearing of
the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that there is need to set
up a new early warning system in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has mistaken the DPRK's satellite launch as a "missile
" test, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's remarks "can convince no one as they are intended to
justify the moves to beef up its (U.S.) aggressor forces overseas"
and to "maintain its sphere of influence in the asia-pacific
region, buttressed by its military edge," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It is beyond doubt that these frantic moves of the United
States will escalate the arms race, the tensions and confrontation
and seriously jeopardize peace and stability in Korea and other
regions of Asia and the Pacific," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Our people and armed forces will maintain heightened vigilance
against the arms buildup stepped up by the United States under the
pretext of the DPRK's "missile threat" and take a strong self-
defense measure to torpedo them," it concluded.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Civilians Killed in Kisovo Violence  By Yang Chengming, Huang Qiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 civilians were
killed in Kosovo violence with the presence of the international
peace-keeping troops there during the past nine months, according
to a top Yugoslav official.
</P>
<P>
Some 860 civilians were kidnapped during the period, and 360,
000 non ethnic Albanian residents forced to leave their home
during the period, said Zoran Andjelkovic, president of Kosovo's
governing Interim Executive Council, in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The province has been plagued by ethnic Albanian extremists
since the international peace-keeping troops arrived in June last
year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the tragedy to the failure in implementing the U.
N. Security Council Resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted on June 20 last year to govern the
work of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, stipulates that the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia must be
respected, the illegal "Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)" be disarmed
and all ethic people in the region be protected.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the interim administration mission (UNMIK)
nor the peace-keeping force (KFOR) has acted as requested. They
sided with ethnic Albanian terrorists when the later conducted
ethnic cleansing against Serbs, Andjelkovic said.
</P>
<P>
The key to settle the deteriorating situation in Kosovo is the
implementation of the resolution by all parties concerned, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the conflicts between ethnic Albanian
extremists and the international peace-keeping force that started
in last February, the Yugoslav official said the KLA covets an
independent Kosovo and Resolution 1244 enraged them with articles
talking about sovereignty of Yugoslavia and disarmament of the
illegal army. That is why it vented its anger on the peace-keeping
forces, Andjelkovic said.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of U.S.-led NATO attacked Yugoslavia a
year ago and stationed troops in Kosovo is to seek a sphere of
influence and a military base. Their relations with the Kosovo
Liberation Army is one of making use of each other, he added.
</P>
<P>
Whether the United Nations can fairly handle the Kosovo crisis
will put to test its ability to settle major world issues,
Andjelkovic said.
</P>
<P>
If it takes no resolute action to curb the deteriorating
situation in Kosovo and implement the U.N. resolution, the U.N.
Security Council will be discredited completely, he added.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Shrank Sharply in Poland in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Inflation and lack of safety
turned millions of tourists away from Poland in 1999, where the
number of foreign visitors fell by 2 million and tourism income
was down by 2 billion U.S. dollars from the previous year, the
country's tourism authorities reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Poland received a total of 89.1 million tourists,
about 17.9 million of them overnight visitors, down from the 18.8
million in the year 1998. It ranked fifth on a World Tourism
Organization list of countries suffering the biggest drops in the
number of tourists last year.
</P>
<P>
While in terms of tourism income, the east European country
registered a decline of 23 percent, second only to Turkey, with
each foreign tourist spending on average 160 dollars here last
year, 40 dollars less than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign tourism organizations blamed Poland's
shrunk tourist trade mainly on the country's inflation and poor
safety situation.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Improves Gem Exports to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan gem and jewelry
exporters have got back into the Indonesian market following the
recent Expo 2000 Fair in Jakarta where they received a good
response from buyers, the official Daily News said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A National Gem and Jewelry Authority official was quoted as
saying that they had been able to penetrate the Indonesian market
in a big way having received several orders for gems.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian buyers, known for buying high value stones, usually
purchase from Singapore and China's Hong Kong. With Indonesia
being hit by the currency crisis, Sri Lanka's gem exports were
also affected but it has now begun to recover.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's gem and jewelry exports to Indonesia, which stood
at 90 million rupees (1.5 million U.S. dollars) in 1996, fell to a
mere 18 million rupees (300,000 dollars) during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Following the success at the Jakarta fair on March 1-7, the gem
and jewelry industry in Sri Lanka is looking forward to regain the
lost market.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, known as a gem island, is world-famous for sapphire,
cat's eye, ruby among other precious stones which have been mined
for more than 2,500 years.

<HEADLINE> Stress Tests for Figure Skating Judges at World Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Figure skating judges will be
outfitted with heart rate monitors at next week's world
championships in Nice, France, to determine just how stressed they
are by their work in the sport's hot seats.
</P>
<P>
At the initial judges' meeting in Winnipeg, Manitoba this
Saturday, Canadian physician Jane Moran, an International Skating
Union (ISU) medical advisor who conceived the judges' physiology
study, plans to recruit 15 test subjects from among the 45 judges
who will decide this season's world champions.
</P>
<P>
International judges accept their assignments knowing that
public condemnation looms an unpopular verdict away.
</P>
<P>
In Nice, Moran's volunteers will wear a chest strap device
connected to a wrist watch containing software set to record their
heart rate every five seconds.
</P>
<P>
Each judge will be monitored in the hour before their event and
over the three to four hours it takes to score all the competitors.
</P>
<P>
The ISU medical advisors will analyse the data, comparing heart
rate graphs of three judges on each panel to identify stress
points during the event and determine how well the subjects coped.
</P>
<P>
Moran said that the intent is to teach them stress management
techniques and then retest a year later in hopes of seeing
improvement.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Guilin, a well-known tourist
destination in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has
started construction of a pipeline facility that will stop the
random discharge of sewage water into scenic lakes of the city.
</P>
<P>
The facility is just one of the many projects designed by the
city to treat urban sewage and to improve the quality of the water
in the lakes of the city.
</P>
<P>
According to local environmental protection departments, there
are 49 sewage discharge outlets around Ronghu, Shanhu and Guihu,
three major lakes of the city, and residents living nearby
discharge more than 20,000 tons of untreated sewage water into the
lakes each day, causing a serious pollution in the water of the
lakes.
</P>
<P>
The facility will require installation of pipelines with a
total length of 2,400 meters and construction of two pumping
stations. The sewage collected will be sent into the city's
centralized drainage network via the two pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
The entire project will cost 2.6 million yuan. It is scheduled
to be completed on November 30, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Guilin, with a history of more than 2,000 years, is renowned
for its green mountains, clear water and strangely-shaped stone
formations.

<HEADLINE> Feasibility Study on Kunming-Singapore Railway Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China has completed the
feasibility study for a railway line that will link Kunming,
capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, with Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, two schemes for the proposed railway line
are now under consideration. The first one will run 4,600 km,
including the already completed sections in the Chinese territory
and neighboring Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Only 798 km new line is needed to put through the whole line,
with 631 km in the Chinese territory. The railway will start from
Kunming, run through the cities of Dali, Baoshan, Luxi and Ruili
in western Yunnan and then be connected with railway lines in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In the other scheme, the second line will run south from
Kunming to the city of Yuxi and Xishuangbanna in southern part of
Yunnan and be connected with railway lines in Laos, Thailand, and
finally end in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The proposed railway line has got the support of the Southeast
Asian countries and the Asian Development Bank. It will play an
important role in strengthening material exchanges among southeast
Asian countries and accelerating the development of the Mekong
River valley.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March, 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's trade
commissioner Pascal Lamy said here Tuesday that talks with the
South American Common Market (Mercosur) for a free trade agreement
would be complicated.
</P>
<P>
Lamy, on a seven-day visit to Brazil for closer political and
economic ties between the EU and Brazil, said the two sides will
start their first meetings in early April to tackle technical
principles, trade issues, development and macro-economy
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He refrained from taking a clear position over Mercosur's
demand that negotiations on agriculture be put on top of the
agenda. The bloc groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay
with Chile and Bolivia as associate partners.
</P>
<P>
Lamy said, "trade opening is not a simple thing, because there
are a lot of matters to be considered, such as health regulations,
tariffs, industry and services."
</P>
<P>
"My expectation is that the first stage of talks will finish
before the end of my term," said Lamy, who will finish his mandate
in five years.
</P>
<P>
On deregulation of the automobile sector, Lamy said other
measures are needed since Mercosur lacks of free trade.

ZAGREB, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A Croat war crimes suspect was
extradited Tuesday by a Croatian court to face charges before the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Mladen Naletilic, also known as "Tuta," was charged by the
international tribunal in The Hague in 1998 for war crimes against
Muslims in Bosnia. During the Bosnian civil war in 1993 and 1994,
he allegedly headed a paramilitary unit that had been accused of
anti-Muslim atrocities in Mostar region.
</P>
<P>
Naletilic used to be at the center of a dispute between Croatia
and The Hague. Croatia refused to turn Naletilic over. The
president of the international tribunal in The Hague reported to
the UN Security Council Croatia's lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The United States then stepped in with a threat of economic
sanctions, and the newly-elected government of Croatia finally
yielded to Western pressure and promised full cooperation with The
Hague.

<HEADLINE> Firewall Market to Shift Toward Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Plenty of opportunities still
exist in the worldwide firewall market, with small businesses
holding the most promise, according to a report released Tuesday
by International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S. market research
firm.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide firewall market will at least create 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars in revenues in 2000, and there is a possibility that
total could climb higher than 2.1 billion dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A method for keeping a network secure, a firewall can be
implemented in a single router that filters out unwanted packets,
or it may use a combination of technologies in routers and hosts.
</P>
<P>
Firewalls are widely used to give users access to the Internet
in a secure fashion as well as to separate a company's public Web
server from its internal network.
</P>
<P>
IDC splits the overall firewall market into firewall appliances,
router-based firewalls and software-based firewalls.
</P>
<P>
Firewall appliances are the largest part of the market while
router-based firewalls are the fastest-growing segment.
</P>
<P>
IDC believes that the firewall market won't even approach
saturation until 2004 at the earliest. In the United States, 50
percent of large businesses and 41 percent of medium-sized
businesses will have installed firewalls by the year-end. However,
only 14 percent of small businesses will have them.
</P>
<P>
After 2000, the number of firewalls per company will mostly
likely increase, and as a result, there will still be good growth
potential in all markets, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
However, the firewall market will shift toward the small
business market. The large number of small businesses, combined
with the low saturation rates, represents an untapped market, IDC
added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest market for firewalls. IDC
expects it will account for almost 61 percent of worldwide
revenues in 2000. But by 2003, the U.S. share will decline to
below 48 percent.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Raises Housing Rent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The welfare housing rent in
Beijing will triple to 3.05 yuan per square meter from the current
1.3 yuan for each month as of April 1, according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Reform Office of the Beijing municipal government
announced this on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the monthly rental discount could be made as much as
25 percent off for bungalows or "tongzi buildings," where
residents share public kitchens and restrooms, and buildings that
are without ideal living conditions.
</P>
<P>
To make the rent rise acceptable to people of medium or low
incomes, the office also announced to give employees of the city's
government departments and government-sponsored institutions a per
capita special monthly subsidy of 90 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The specific amount of the monthly subsidy will vary from 60 to
130 yuan according to the individual's ranks and lengths of their
career.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises, financially independent institutions, and social
organizations are allowed to draft the subsidy paying scheme of
their own. But they are forbidden to have the per capita monthly
subsidy exceed 90 yuan.
</P>
<P>
For those people who are really stuck in financial problems,
the housing rents can be partially or completely waived with the
permission of the Housing Reform Office and its branches and their
name list will be renewed once a year.
</P>
<P>
While the rents of welfare housing are to rise on April 1, the
rents of the private housing in urban Beijing will simultaneously
be increased to 3.17 yuan from 1.8 yuan for one square meter per
month.

BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The price of industrial products
gained one percent in February as compared with the corresponding
period of last year, according to a report released by the
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
</P>
<P>
The price hike, continued for the second consecutive month,
follows a 31-month slump since 1997, the report says.
</P>
<P>
NBS analysts said that last month's price growth was lifted
mainly by the petroleum products, which registered a record high
of 39.1 percent price increase.
</P>
<P>
The price of petroleum products has been rising since the
middle of last year, fueled by a price hike of crude oil on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Processing products were also part of the upward trend. The
price of textile products reversed months' decline to gain 0.3
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials staged a 4.6 percent price surge last month due
to an increased demand for iron, steel, cement and other
construction materials.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the price increase suggested a positive
change in the relationship between supply and demand, which is
better balanced than before.

<HEADLINE> China Clamps Down on Fake DVDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese government agencies
have jointed efforts this month to stop digital video disk
pirating in China, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The four agencies are the State Copyright Administration, the
State Press and Publication Administration, the Ministry of Public
Security and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The agencies released a document recently saying that producers
of pirated DVDs will be punished according to the Copyright Law.
</P>
<P>
DVDs, with better sound and pictures than video compact disc or
VCDs, are becoming increasingly popular with urban residents. DVD
player manufacturers are also competing more and more fiercely,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, authorized DVD and VCD makers can't meet the current
demand because of high prices and limited supplies. A legitimate
DVD usually costs 3 or 4 times the price of a pirated one.
</P>
<P>
The document says that the agencies will join hands to act
quickly on clues provided by copyright and commercial
administration departments.

<HEADLINE> Social Scientists Urged to Gear with Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Social scientists in China should
take advantage of the reform and opening-up of the country when
conducting studies, top officials and scholars have stressed.
</P>
<P>
The profound social changes provide good opportunities for
sociologists to develop their studies and theories, said Li
Tieying, president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent question faced by China is its modernization
and its impact. It has brought forward big challenges to
sociologists and other social science researchers," Li was quoted
as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, made the remarks at a CASS
meeting to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Institute of
Sociology.
</P>
<P>
China's sociology studies appeared in the 1920s and 1930s. It
continued to grow after the founding of New China in 1949, but the
"Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976) severely suffocated the research.
</P>
<P>
In 1980s, the institute was set up and sociological studies
have been revived in many key universities to study China's
contemporary societies.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that more studies should be made in some research
areas, and the political dimensions and significance in the social
sciences should be clearly understood by Chinese researchers.
</P>
<P>
Fei Xiaotong, who was among the first generation of China's
sociologists, stressed at the meeting the importance of ethnic
studies in sociology.

Ren Gang, an official with the administration, said that
opening up the trade mark agency business to the whole of society
is an inevitable trend for the development of the sector. "As the
bridge to link applicants and government agencies, trade mark
agents will play an increasingly important role in international
economic exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that China's trade mark agencies handled
125,000 trade mark applications last year, accounting for 73
percent of the total. The registration efficiency of both domestic
and foreign trade marks improved remarkably.
</P>
<P>
According to Ren, the administration will provide training for
new agents while guiding and monitoring their business operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Regulation on Trade Mark Agents, which took
effect January 1 this year, provides the legal backup for trade
mark agency services in China, said Ren.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Four Chinese government agencies
have joined forces this month to stop digital video disk pirating
in the country, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Copyright Administration, the State Press and
Publication Administration, the Ministry of Public Security and
the State Administration of Industry and Commerce will go after
the DVD pirates.
</P>
<P>
The agencies released a document saying the producers of
pirated DVDs will be punished according to the Copyright Law, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
DVD, which feature better sound and pictures than video compact
disks, or VCDs, are becoming increasingly popular with urban
residents. DVD player manufacturers are also competing more and
more fiercely.
</P>
<P>
Pirated DVDs are usually cheaper because the makers have paid
no copyright fee. And they are spreading fast, hurting authorized
dealers and copyright holders.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed that public security departments will
work more with other government agencies and act quickly on clues
provided by copyright and administration departments.

<HEADLINE> More Funds to Encourage Scientific Innovations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China will earmark more funds to
encourage scientific innovations and stimulate breakthroughs in
basic research.
</P>
<P>
Scientists' interests and spirit of innovation will be
appreciated and encouraged, said Chen Jia'er, director of the
State Natural Science Fund Committee (SNSFC), adding that the
committee will build an open and relaxed funding environment for
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),
told a working conference of the committee here today that China
should allow equal competition for different academic ideas and
schools of thought.
</P>
<P>
The committee will appraise the projects funded by the SNSFC,
and will tolerate failure in research, which is inevitable in
scientific study, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
With the increase of China's science funding, scientists will
enjoy more latitude in their research. The SNSFC will improve its
appraisal standards for research projects, and innovative research
projects will enjoy long-term support from the committee.
</P>
<P>
The SNSFC, established in Beijing in 1986, aims to use
research funds effectively, and to coordinate and provide funds
for research in basic science and some fields of applied science
in accordance with State policies.
</P>
<P>
The committee allocated 1.04 billion yuan (about 125 million US
dollars) for natural science research in 1999, compared with 80
million yuan in 1986.

BRUSSELS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Two days after celebrating their
centenary, Ajax Amsterdam of the Netherlands have sacked coach Jan
Wouters after a run of disappointing results in current season.
</P>
<P>
Wouters will leave soon after 15 months at the club. Youth
coach Hans Westerhof will take over training of the first team
until the end of the season when he is set to join Willem II
Tilburg.
</P>
<P>
Ajax general manager Frank Kales said: "The background is that
we started the season with high hopes that Ajax could play well,
but we are disappointed with the results and that has led us to
take this decision."

The team slipped to fifth in the Dutch first division on Sunday
after a 1-0 defeat at home to Twente Enschede. The result ruined
the club's centenary celebrations over the weekend.

Enrolled students will be given certificates for advanced study

BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A monograph titled "Translation:
A New Ology" has been published by the China National Library
Press.
</P>
<P>
The book, believed to be the first of its kind in China, argues
that translation is an independent science, instead of just being
part of linguistics.
</P>
<P>
Peng Zhuowu, author of the book, advocates in his monograph
that a translation-ology should be established and studied so as
to make better translations.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng, China's written translation work can be
traced back 2,500 years, but theories on translation are still
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
He defines translation as a creative activity to shift ideas
and styles in the words of one language into the words of another
language.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Peng is famous in China for his "Profession of
Karl Marx", "Dialogue Between Stalin and Mao Zedong", and

<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) will help China's Tibet Autonomous Region to employ
experts from inland areas and overseas so as to boost local social
and economic development.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect has been signed here between the
China International Center of Economic and Technological Exchanges
(CICETE), the UNDP and the regional government of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The program, titled "Transfer of Knowledge Through the
Recruitment of Expatriate Nationals and Senior Technical Advisors",
will help Tibet recruit 20 domestic professionals and 20 overseas
experts.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the UNDP will provide 168,459 US dollars
for the program, while the regional government of Tibet will
contribute 133,000 US dollars-worth of material and equipment. The
program will be executed by the CICETE.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at helping upgrade the technical and
managerial levels of some local industries, including farming and
animal husbandry, leather processing, power generation and hotel
management, which are regarded as the most crucial sectors for
local development.
</P>

<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- London is likely to be the only
contender when the International Amateur Athletics Federation
meets to decide where the 2005 World Championships will be held.
</P>
<P>
But British hopes are riding on whether or not a suitable
stadium can be built in time.
</P>
<P>
Perth and Berlin both missed deadline for bids ahead of the
IAAF's meeting in Paris on April 2 that will decide the venue.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics spokesman Nicolas Davis said: "At the moment
Britain is the favourite.
</P>
<P>
"Other cities were thinking about bidding, but they missed the
deadline and so are not contenders at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"They will make their presentation at the council meeting and
they will have a strong chance. The main stumbling block is the
stadium and they have to be able to convince the council that they
can build one," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British government has promised 60 million pounds for the
development of an athletics stadium, but a site has yet to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics chief executive David Moorcroft will meet with the
secretary of state for culture, media and sport Chris Smith to
decide which of the four site under consideration will be used.
</P>
<P>
If London's bid is rejected, the bidding process will be
reopened, allowing Berlin and Perth to re-enter the race.
</P>
<P>
IAAF's director of communications Giorgio Reineri said that
London's lack of a stadium now would not be a major factor.
</P>
<P>
"We don't consider that such an important fact because we
already have given Seville in 1997 the organisation of the World
championships in 1999 when Seville did not have the stadium," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It depends upon what type of assurances the British athletics
federation can give to the council that in 2005 they will have a
great and beautiful athletics stadium in London," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Colombia in Post-Earthquake Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Wednesday an emergency loan of 225 million U.S. dollars to support
reconstruction of Colombia's coffee-growing region, which was
struck by an earthquake in January 1999 that left 1,185 dead and
over 150,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
The loan, approved on Tuesday by the bank's board, supplements
the 93.2 million dollars from existing projects reallocated to
reconstruction works last August. It will benefit more than 560,
000 individuals who sustained losses as a result of the earthquake,
particularly the poorest groups.
</P>
<P>
"Our main objective is to help Colombians get their lives back
on track by restoring housing and basic infrastructure," said
Alberto Chueca, the World Bank's resident representative in
Colombia. "As most earthquake victims belong to the poorest
segments of the population, the emergency loan will be channeled
directly to those who are worst off."
</P>
<P>
Colombia's coffee-growing region, an area of 1360 square
kilometers over the departments of Caldas, Quindio, Risaralda,
Tolima, and Valle de Cauca, was hit by a devastating earthquake
measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale on January 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The emergency loan will provide resources for repair or total
reconstruction of approximately 80,000 dwellings through
government subsidies to both owners and renters, reconstruction or
repair of schools, hospitals, and community centers,
rehabilitation of public infrastructure such as water supply,
drainage, and transportation systems, and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Earthquake Recovery Project will support the
establishment of disaster prevention, mitigation, and control
plans, and the economic resurgence of affected communities.

<HEADLINE> US Interest Rates Rise to Affect Brazil's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve increased Tuesday the overnight lending
rate by a quarter point, and the majority of specialists think
necessary one or two further adjustings until the end of this
year. Since June 1999, five increases in U.S. interest rates have
been registered.
</P>
<P>
If Federal Reserve keeps to this tendency to increase interest
rates, Brazil's economy will suffer on the path to economic growth,
local economists said.
</P>
<P>
If U.S. interest rates keep growing, according to economists,
the American dollar will go up relative to the real at a middle
term, which will impact inflation, putting up the price of imports.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Putin Retains Lead Ahead of Presidential Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- With the presidential balloting
just five days away, Russian Acting President Vladimir Putin
remains the runaway favorite among the 11 candidates remaining in
the race.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the final day allowed under the Russian electoral
law to release results of surveys on the presidential election,
and two polls reported by Russian media both showed a Putin
victory.
</P>
<P>
One of the polls, involving 1,500 people and conducted by the
Russian Public Opinion and Market Survey Center (ROMIR) on March
18-19, pointed to a voter turnout of 65 percent and a supporting
rating of 57 percent for Putin, figures that guarantee the
validity of the vote and an outright victory for the acting
president in the first round.
</P>
<P>
ROMIR is a member of the Gallop International company, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In another survey of 1,600 people, taken by the independent
Agency for Regional Political Studies on March 12, Putin also
topped the list of candidates, but his approval rate stood at only
48.4 percent, lower than the 50 percent needed to win the first
round.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov trailed Putin in a
distant second with 25-28 percent in the surveys, followed by
liberal Yabloko party leader Grigory Yavlinsky and ultra-
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that some voters might stay away from the
Sunday vote, seeing Putin's victory as a foregone outcome.
</P>
<P>
This scenario, coupled with a "Nyet campaign" urging voters to
vote against all candidates, has prompted the Central Election
Commission to appeal to the Russians to go to the polls Sunday to
"decide the destiny" of the country.
</P>
<P>
"On this day, all of us will be deciding the destiny of our
country, the future of our children and grandchildren," the CEC
said in an address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Putin continued his tour in the regions Wednesday, reiterating
his promises to protect domestic producers, guarantee ownership
rights and raise people's standards of living to make Russia a "
strong and efficient state."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Putin made a surprise visit to Chechnya
aboard a Su-27 fighter jet on the co-pilot's seat and even piloted
the aircraft for some time. The Russian media gave wide and
positive coverage of the trip and other of his official functions,
further enhancing his chances of victory.
</P>
<P>
Putin's opponents, in contrast, have to resort to the usual
means to woo voter support.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, who got a boost, albeit anemic, from the withdrawal
of Yevgeny Savostyanov a day earlier, called for the creation of a
broad rightist-liberal coalition "that will define Russia's future
in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Savostyanov pulled out of the race late Tuesday and urged his
supporters to back Yavlinsky. The latest ROMIR poll showed the
supporting rates of Yavlinsky and Savostyanov at 6 percent and
less than 1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky said "Putin is dangerous to Russian democracy" and "a
closet communist pursuing his policies by Soviet methods."
</P>
<P>
"His program differs little from the programs of Zhirinovsky or
Zyuganov, although he speaks other words," Yavlinsky said. "
Everything he does looks like what communist leader Zyuganov most
frequently supports and promotes."
</P>
<P>
In another related development Wednesday, the Russian Interior
Ministry condemned the repeated appeals by Gennady Zyuganov to his
supporters to blockade the polling stations if they are refused
copies of all voting records.
</P>
<P>
Such appeals "are nothing other than the instigation of a crime,
for which the law provides a penalty of up to five years'
imprisonment," Deputy Interior Minister Pyotr Latyshev told the
private NTV television station.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Seeks Additional Help of 102 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has launched a new
appeal seeking additional resources from the international
community in the amount of 102 million U.S. dollars, the United
Nations announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be used for ongoing emergency and
rehabilitation activities directed at 650,000 flood victims in the
African country covering the period from March to end of August.
</P>
<P>
The new appeal, an update of Mozambique's international appeal
of February 23, is based on an assessment carried out by the
United Nations Disaster, Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team,
the UN in-country team and the government of Mozambique further to
the second wave of floods which hit the country at the end of
February.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that second major disaster, Mozambique had requested
from the international community 65 million dollars to assist 300,
000 flood victims for a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
The present appeal covers all UN areas of activity with regard
to relief and rehabilitation. It includes basic needs for food,
health and nutrition, water, sanitation, shelters and educational
programs. A priority is the seeds and tools program, which will
provide important support to the devastated agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, funds are required to carry out the repair of
roads and bridges, as well as to maintain air transportation
assets on a commercial basis.

<HEADLINE> Blair Sets Health Reform Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Wednesday set the health reform a top priority, calling for a
shake-up in return for the additional 2 billion pound (3.2 billion
U.S. dollar) funding announced in the Budget.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the parliament that the need for new cash for the
National Health Service was clear - but said it must be
accompanied by "fundamental reforms".
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, Blair was making his first ever statement
to the Commons on a domestic spending issue, a role normally taken
by a secretary of state, to show how important he believes the
changes are.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's Budget, Chancellor Gordon Brown promised the NHS
an extra 2 billion-pound funding each year for the next four years
- an annual rise of more than 6 percent above inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NHS, Britain's biggest employer, employs one million people
and eats up 54.2 billion pounds a year of taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
Blair insisted extra funding must bring a leaner, more
efficient service.
</P>
<P>
"With the money must come modernization," he said, issuing a
direct challenge to NHS workers: "Work with us to make sure this
money is well spent."
</P>
<P>
After consulting health workers over the coming months, a four-
year plan will be published in July.
</P>
<P>
Reforms will include using top specialists like surgeons more
effectively, standardizing the cost of operations and recruiting
10,000 more nurses. Recruiting private sector managers to revive
failing NHS hospital was another option,Blair's officials said.
</P>
<P>
Blair's decision to make health his personal crusade has
followed months of damaging criticism.
</P>
<P>
A 'flu outbreak in January brought chaos to hospitals and led
to serious operations being canceled, resulting in a barrage of
bad headlines about a crisis in the NHS.
</P>
<P>
Health is shaping up as one of the pivotal issues in general
elections expected to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
Brown's plan will see spending growth almost double to 6.1
percent a year from an historic average of 3.3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The government's aim is to see British health spending catch up
with the European Union average, put at 8.0 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel ELN Destroys Two Electricity Towers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's rebels National
Liberation Army (ELN) knocked down Wednesday two electricity
towers in its campaign against this country's electricity
infrastructure, said authorities.
</P>
<P>
These guerrillas destroyed with explosives a tower in a rural
zone of San Juan de Rio Seco municipality, Cundinamarca department,
and another in Matanzas locality, north of this country,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
A six hour blackout affected Tuesday at least eight regions in
Colombia, including the capital, due to breakdowns following
Monday's attacks in which ELN destroyed 17 energy towers in
Antioquia and Santander departments.
</P>
<P>
Electricity firms said Wednesday that if ELN persists in its
campaign against the energy infrastructure, there will be further
rationing of this service, with subsequent losses to industry and
banking.
</P>
<P>
ELN is the second biggest rebel group in this country after
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

<HEADLINE> British Police Launch Crackdown on Racist Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- British police launched a series
of crackdown on "hated crime" across the capital on Wednesday,
arresting some 70 suspected racists.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Police swoops came as part of Operation Athena,
a campaign aimed at cracking down on racist crime in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Those taken for questioning were alleged to have committed
offenses ranging from the publication of racist material to
racially aggravated assaults.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who,
because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and
destroy the principle of 'Justice for All'," said Detective Chief
Superintendent John Godsave, who headed the operation.
</P>
<P>
Godsave said the raid, in all 32 of the capital's local
districts, was part of the Met's anti-racist Operation Athena.
</P>
<P>
The suspected offenses ranged from grievous bodily harm to the
publication of racist material. The age and sex of the suspects
was not released but police said the arrests spanned Hounslow, an
Asian stronghold in the west of the city, to Greenwich, a wealthy
white enclave in southeast London.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to eradicate the fear and distress caused by hate
crime," Godsave said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Britain is 94 percent white but ethnic minorities have a
stronger presence in the inner cities, London chief among them.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Met's record on promoting black and Asian officers,
rooting out racist staff and clamping down on racially motivated
crime have all come under fire. An official report last year
condemned the capital's police force for institutional racism.
</P>
<P>
The dawn raids came as police questioned three men in
connection with the country's most notorious racist crime: the
unsolved 1993 murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
Two were arrested in London, the third in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The number of racist crimes being reported in Britain was
rising sharply. Police believe greater awareness has encouraged
more victims to come forward.

UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Legal
Counsel Hans Corell and his team had concluded a week-long series

<HEADLINE> New Study Pegs Global Internet Population at 300 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Global Internet usage is well
on its way to reaching one billion users by 2005, with over 300
million people already logged on, according to a new research
report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 150 million people worldwide plan to use the
Internet this year, said the report from the Angus Reid Group, a
Vancouver-based global market and social research company.
</P>
<P>
There were an estimated 40 million Internet users worldwide in
1996. The most recent estimates suggest global Internet usage has
reached 275 million users, according to the study based on a
sample of more than 28,000 Internet users in 34 countries.
Currently Internet usage remains highly concentrated in a few
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Web has much more ground to make up before it can claim to
be a truly worldwide medium on the scale of television," said the
report, citing the fact that even in many developed countries one-
third of adults have not tried the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Of the people surveyed by the Angus Reid Group, 97 percent own
or use television, 42 percent own or use personal computer and
cable television, while 20 percent have home Internet access.
</P>
<P>
While Internet access at home has not become the basic
household commodity, the report said, this gadget inventory has
potentially interesting implications for the future. The
widespread penetration of television, as well as of wired and
cellular telephone, cable and satellite TV communications, could
provide ready access to the Internet from the next generation of
technology, including TV-top or wireless devices that bypass the
requirement of having a specifically configured PC with a modem or
cable link to a local service provider, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Senate unanimously passed
legislation 100-0 Wednesday to repeal the Social Security earnings
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Both parties voted to quit taking Social Security benefits away
from people who continue to work through their late '60s to woo
the older voters in the election year.
</P>
<P>
This measure is expected to boost the income of 800,000 workers
65 through 69 by thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Senate will send the bill back to the House, which also
passed it overwhelmingly on March 1, because the Senate added a
measure to assure that 64-year-old workers are not penalized.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to be approved in the House as soon as a
vote can be scheduled, Congress aides said.
</P>
<P>
"As the baby boomers begin to retire, it is more important than
ever that older Americans who are willing and able to work should
not have their Social Security benefits deferred when they do,"
said President Clinton in a letter to senators from India. He has
promised to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
Under current law, elderly workers 65 through 69 lose one
dollar in Social Security benefits for every three dollars in
wages they make above 17,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Asks for Further Aid of $100 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique, facing a new flood
surge after nearly two months of ruinous rains, Wednesday appealed
to the world for a further 100 million U.S. dollars for flood
relief and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country had asked for 65.5 million dollars
on February 24 and received a total of 58.7 million dollars since
then.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said in a statement
that since the February 24 appeal, the situation had worsened,
with many more people affected by the floods and a massive
increase in infrastructural damage.
</P>
<P>
The last appeal was based on the immediate needs of 300,000
people who required emergency aid, but by mid March that figure
had risen to 650,000. Of these some 450,000 have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
Most of the aid in the latest request are food, tents, blankets
and agricultural inputs, while medicines for malaria, cholera and
other diarrheal diseases are also wanted.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Main Stock Markets Ease at Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stock markets ended
slightly lower Wednesday after the Dow Jones industrial average
lost ground in early trade.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended little changed after shares in
Vodafone recouped much of the early loss they suffered when a huge
placing hit the market. The index ended 8.3 points or 0.1 percent
lower at 6609.6.
</P>
<P>
The decline weighed on the market as a whole, as Vodafone's
heavy weighting delivered about 54 points of downside to the
benchmark index before they recovered to 368.5p.
</P>
<P>
Trading in London in the session was characterized by selling
of tech stocks in favor of so-called "old economy"industries. BG
Group ended up 10.8 percent at 336 pence after the company
disclosed plans to demerge its gas pipeline business.
</P>
<P>
A 25 percent jump in 1999 earnings reported by retailer
Kingfisher sent the stock soaring 9.5 percent, while competitor
MKS spurted 6.1 percent, buoyed by restructuring enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronically traded Xetra Dax closed down 9.
31 points at 7798.62 as losses in index heavyweight Deutsche
Telekom and Siemens offset a sharp rise in insurer Munich Re.
</P>
<P>
Paris showed similar distress in the tech sector. The CAC 40
shed 0.7 percent, or 41.58 points, to end at 6297.29.

<HEADLINE> More Than Half of All U.S. Adults Now Online -- Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More than half of all adults
in the United States are online with daily home use of the
Internet growing rapidly, and women now make up 50 percent of the
online population, according to a U.S. Internet user trends report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mainstreaming of the Internet in the United States is
reflected in two ways, said the report from U.S. research firm
Strategies Group. First, it is often the primary choice for
communications, entertainment and commerce; second, the Internet
is less and less the domain of an information elite.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 57 million U.S. adults or 28 percent
of the population use the Internet from home every day. On average,
home Internet users spend 7.2 hours a week online, compared to 2.2
hours a day on television.
</P>
<P>
In total, 106 million adults or 53 percent of the adult
population use the Internet, either at home or at work or both.
Women now make up almost 50 percent of the online population,
accounting for some 52 million users, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The top three online activities are research, shopping and "
surfing," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of adults who said they have done online
shopping more have doubled their spending in the last year, now
spending about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars monthly, compared to 1.72
billion dollars at the end of 1998. The number of users spending
more than 50 dollars a month online has grown to 20 million,
compared with just 8.5 million a year ago. Nearly 70 percent of
all Internet users browse for goods and services, representing 74
million online shoppers, compared to just 45 million in December
1998. Books, CDs, clothing, computer software and travel services
are the top five categories of online purchases.

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Be Self-sufficient in Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, a traditional crude
importer, will be self-sufficient in oil until the year 2005, said
President of the state oil company Petrobrs Henri Philipe
Reichstul on Wednesday in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the South American country produces 1.3 million
barrels per day (bpd) of oil, meeting only 70 percent of the
countries necessity.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's oil production would rise to 1.8 million bpd, while
local consumption will increase from today's 1.77 million bpd to 2.
1 million bpd, in 2005, said Reichstul. With 300,000 barrels
additional output of Petrobras' overseas companies, Brazil could
actually be self-sufficent in oil, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras will invest in the market of production and refinery,
set up natural gas market in Brazil and make effort to
internationalize the oil company, according to a strategical plan.
"We want to be the leader of energy section in South America,"
said the president of the oil company.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's oil production has been increasing from 694,000 bpd
in 1994 to 1.3 million bpd so far, with an annual increasing rate
of 10 percent. The country's expenditure for fuel imports has
decreased from 88 percent of the total purchase abroad in 1970s to
less than 10 percent now.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks Needs Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
showed a different view with the Egyptian president over
resumption of Syrian-Israeli talks, saying it would take time to
overcome differences on substantive issues between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hosni Mubarak told the Washington Post in an interview on
Wednesday that Syria and Israel were close to a peace accord
through indirect discussions that had continued in the weeks since
their formal negotiations broke down in January.
</P>
<P>
He said that making any decision on outstanding issues "will be
not so complicated" once formal talks resume after President Bill
Clinton meets with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said that there
were still "substantive gaps between the parties and tough
substantive decisions that are required to be made by both sides."
</P>
<P>
"In our view, this is going to take time, substantial time, and
it is not simply a question of process. There are substantive
issues that are outstanding that need to be overcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was working to clarify the needs
and positions of both sides "so that there is confidence that if
the negotiations resume in earnest there will be a reasonable
chance of success."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said on Tuesday after the White House announced his
upcoming meeting with Assad in Geneva that he was "hopeful" about
their summit, but declined to say whether a deal was imminent.
</P>
<P>
And an Israeli official said on Wednesday that Syria and the
United States might be trying to map a future Syrian-Israeli
border at the Geneva summit.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Says OPEC to Find Fair Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming OPEC meeting will
result in a "fair solution" to the problem of high oil prices, the
Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani said here
Wednesday after talks with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
The Emir, who arrived in Rome Tuesday, said at a joint press
conference with D'Alema that the aim of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was to "find a price which
doesn't damage either producers or consumers."
</P>
<P>
A key meeting of the cartel will be held in Vienna on March 27
and although the Emir said that the oil-producing states would
come up with a "fair" policy, his comments suggested that OPEC had
no intention of simply opening its taps in response to calls for
more supply.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the attitude of consumer countries, saying that:
"We want price stability but when prices fall, nobody says
anything and then when they rise, there are a whole series of
initiatives and attempts to challenge it."
</P>
<P>
For his part, D'Alema said that efforts needed to be made to"
guarantee a relative price stability" for oil and "a fluctuation
within an acceptable range."
</P>
<P>
He agreed with the Emir that consumer countries were "partly
responsible" in that they had ignored the plight of oil producing
nations when prices were very low and had "exploited" the
situation.
</P>
<P>
"Then the market pushed prices up to a level which is dangerous
for both us and producers. We are seeking to stabilize the price
at a reasonable, acceptable level, but this has to be done not
through conflict but collaboration between producing countries and
industrialized countries," D'Alema concluded.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have trebled in the last twelve months, to more than
30 U.S. dollars a barrel, and alarm has been growing in Italy over
the impact on inflation, given that petrol pump prices have hit
levels unseen since 1986.

BOGOTA, March 22 (Xinhua)-- General Henry Shelton, Chief of
the Joint Staffs and military advisor of President Bill Clinton,
arrived Wednesday to Colombia to carry out a three day visit to
this country.
</P>

2001.
</P>
<P>
The majority of funds are meant to strengthen mobility and
intelligence of military units for fighting drug trafficking in
southern regions of this country, dominated by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
There is also hope to create, train and provide for two new
antidrug army battalions, each with close to 1,000 men. These
will join an already existent unit, equipped and trained by United

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Italian Economic Growth of 2.5 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
forecast Wednesday that the Italian economy would grow by more
than 2.5 percent this year but warned that the inflation rate
would be higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, the head of the IMF team
of inspectors Maxwell Watson said that growth in Italy could be as
high as 2.75 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Watson also said that Italy was likely to close the year
with an inflation rate closer to 2.2 percent instead of the
currently forecast 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's four-year economic and financial planning
blueprint, the DPEF, predicts growth of 2.2 percent in 2000 but at
the end of February, Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato revised the
forecast upwards to 2.5 percent, which was in line with the latest
European Commission figures.
</P>
<P>
But Watson said Italy needed to speed up the pace of structural
reform in order to make the growth "sustainable and lasting".
</P>
<P>
He said that in his team's meetings over the past few days with
top economic and financial officials, including those at the
Treasury Ministry and the Bank of Italy, the question of how Italy
intended to"amplify and extend this growth to include the largest
number of people and regions" had been pressed.
</P>
<P>
Watson also stressed that fiscal reforms were urgently required,
as this would "help employment and increase the size of the active
workforce."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the IMF team will present its conclusions to Amato
and Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Make Missile Defense Decision as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is every reason why he should make this decision,"said
Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Vice President Al Gore
and a member of the "principals" group of top foreign policy
advisers to the president.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.S. Defense Department announced that the next
test of the National Missile Defense (NMD) system will take place
on June 26, two months later than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
It also said the Pentagon still will be able to tell Clinton
this summer whether the system is technically ready to be deployed
despite delays in testing it.
</P>
<P>
So far, two tests have been staged of the system's ability to
intercept a target missile in space. The first, last fall,
succeeded. The second, in January, failed.
</P>
<P>
"There is enough time for (Clinton) to have the kind of
information he says he needs," Fuerth told a meeting with defense
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"That includes a technical readout from the results of the
third test once it's conducted and then an evaluation of the
impact of a deployment decision on our relations with other
countries generally and on prospects for arms control in
particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
The missile defense system would use a network of radars and
interceptor missiles based in Alaska State to detect, track and
shoot down long-range ballistic missiles outside the Earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. lawmakers and analysts have suggested that Clinton
leave the decision to his successor because of doubts over whether
the system would work technically and fears it would undermine
international arms control pacts.
</P>
<P>
The international community is opposed to the U.S. missile
defense system, which is prohibited by the 1972 Anti-ballistic
Missile treaty. The Clinton administration wants to amend the
treaty to permit such defenses.
