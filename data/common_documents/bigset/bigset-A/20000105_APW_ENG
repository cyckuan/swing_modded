<HEADLINE> NASD Board OKs For-Profit Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The computerized Nasdaq Stock Market could become the first
U.S. exchange to be owned by shareholders under a proposal approved by the board
of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   A plan to convert the Nasdaq to a private, for-profit company was endorsed
unanimously by the board Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal must still be approved by a majority of NASD's members. The
association, which oversees the Nasdaq market, is aiming to complete the
restructuring by midyear.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan does not include an initial public stock offering, known as an IPO,
but leaves that option open.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the NASD intends to sell about a 78 percent stake in the Nasdaq to
a group of Nasdaq market participants that includes NASD member broker-dealer
firms, large institutional investors such as pension and mutual fund companies,
and a handful of large Nasdaq listed companies.
</P>
<P>
	   NASD officials have said the restructuring is necessary to help keep the
computerized Nasdaq stock market competitive with upstart electronic trading
exchanges, known as electronic communications networks, or ECNs.
</P>
<P>
	   The restructuring will create "a much more flexible, viable marketplace,"
said NASD Chairman Frank Zarb.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange is also considering a public stock offering for
the same competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The NASD, which plans to retain a minority stake of about 22 percent in the
computerized Nasdaq market, said it expects to raise about $1 billion by selling
shares in the Nasdaq through so-called private placement deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the proceeds, about $500 million of the sale would be earmarked toward
the NASD's regulation arm. Additional plans include $215 million for the
American Stock Exchange, which merged with the NASD last year, and $114 million
to reduce fees to NASD members.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale is expected to be completed in two phases: the first representing a
47 percent to 49 percent stake, and the second a 30 percent stake. Investment
banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney assisted a NASD committee in
preparing the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarb said the entire NASD membership is expected to vote on the plan by the
end of March. The first phase of the sale will be completed soon after the vote,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman said no decision was made on a possible IPO.

FAA Faulted for Security Lapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration failed to conduct security
checks on dozens of foreigners hired to fix Y2K problems in sensitive computer
systems used for air traffic control, congressional investigators said Tuesday.
The General Accounting Office said it found the FAA had violated its own
security policies by allowing its contractors' foreign employees, who had not
received background checks, to be involved in repairing 15 of 153 critical
computer systems. Citizens of Ukraine, Pakistan, Britain and Ethiopia were given
access without proper checks, as well as 36 Chinese who performed reviews on
eight critical systems.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suspected separatist rebel detonated powerful
explosives strapped to her body near the prime minister's office Wednesday,
killing the attacker and five others, police said. It was not immediately known
if Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was in the building in the midmorning
blast in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital. Four policemen and a civilian were among
those killed. Many people were injured and were being taken to hospitals. There
was no immediate claim of responsibility.

U.S. Makes Offer on Cuban Boy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has asked Cuba to let Elian
Gonzalez's father escort him back to the island if U.S. officials decide the boy
should return to Cuba, a U.S. official said Tuesday. The official said the
request is a contingency plan and does not signal a decision to resolve the
politically charged issue by sending Elian back to his homeland. Fidel Castro's
point man on U.S. affairs said the Cuban government would not stop Gonzalez from
retreiving his son in Miami if he wanted to. Elian was retrieved from an inner
tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25. He had been aboard a Florida-bound
boat that capsized, killing 10 other passengers, including his mother.

Police Work a Lot Safer Than in 1970
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the last 20 years, it became a lot safer to be a
police officer thanks to better equipment, training and national crime trends, a
law enforcement memorial fund said Tuesday. The annual average number of police
officers killed dropped from a high of 222 in the 1970s to 187 in the 1980s and
to 153 in the 1990s, Craig W. Floyd, chairman of the National Law Enforcement
Officers Memorial Fund, said in an interview. At the same time, the number of
police officers in the nation swelled from 246,000 in 1965 to 740,000 in 1999,
FBI figures show.

Va. Tech Leads Sugar Bowl
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Michael Vick's electrifying performance Tuesday night
rallied Virginia Tech to a 29-28 lead over Florida State after three quarters at
the Sugar Bowl. Down 28-7 late in the first half, second-ranked Virginia Tech
struck for two touchdowns and a field goal in the third period. That was enough
to overcome a pair of long TDs by Florida State's Peter Warrick, and threaten to
send the No. 1 Seminoles to their third championship defeat in four seasons.

<HEADLINE> Coke Promotes Top Black Executive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola has promoted and retained its highest-ranking
black executive just two months after he announced plans to retire in the
aftermath of an embarrassing management shakeup.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Ware was promoted Tuesday to executive vice president and head of a new
division overseeing global public affairs and administration Tuesday by Doug
Daft, Coke's incoming chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Ware, 56, had announced in November he was leaving at the end of this year
but said he was staying after accepting the promotion. His retirement decision
came shortly after a management shakeup that meant he would not report directly
to current chief operating officer M. Douglas Ivester, who announced last month
he was leaving.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing that happened ... last November impacted on my acceptance of this
new role," Ware said in an interview. "To be named executive vice president at
Coca-Cola is a big honor for me, because this is a company that I love very
much."
</P>
<P>
	   Ware will continue to chair the company's diversity advisory council, set up
after four current and former Coke employees sued the company, claiming they
were denied promotions and raises because they are black.
</P>
<P>
	   Ware said the new offer was not a figurehead position and that it was not
offered or taken as a peace offering.
</P>
<P>
	   "This stands on the merit of being a substantive and operational role, and
very involved with all aspects of the company," said Ware, who did not disclose
what he would be earning. "My thought process about my retirement was completely
different than this one. And Doug Ivester is still the CEO of Coca-Cola and he
approved this appointment, so that's important to point out."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the new division shows that the Atlanta-based soft drink giant is
serious about its public image, since it marks the first time a public relations
officer will be part of Coke's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The move still needs to be approved by the Atlanta-based soft drink giant's
board of directors. Approval is expected, though, since Ware's demotion last
year was one of the reasons that several key board members told Ivester they had
lost confidence in his leadership, according to numerous reports.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not only a way for the company to say 'Oops, we goofed,' but also a
way to put to rest the racial question," said David Goldman, an industry analyst
with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of Coke's 24 vice presidents are black, including Ware.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's one of the reasons (the demotion) was a mistake to begin with,"
Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. analyst Roy Burry said. "This promotion is the
company's way of saying we can't do that, especially when we have that kind of
thing (the suit) going on."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Joseph Wheeler, who is president of the NAACP branch in suburban
Clayton County, which first received the discrimination complaint from those who
eventually filed the suit, said, "It is rather interesting that a Coke official
will try to clean up Doug Ivester's mess."
</P>
<P>
	   Ware is a former Atlanta city councilman, joining Coke in 1974. He was named
vice president in 1979 and senior vice president in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   He will retain his duties as vice president for the Africa division until a
successor is named, and keep strategic oversight of African operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carl Ware is really a multitalented executive," said John Sicher,
editor-publisher of Beverage Digest. "He knows the business and has a very good
sense for dealing with governments around the world as well as the media."
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement was also Daft's first major move since it was announced
last month that he will succeed Ivester as CEO and chairman at the company's
shareholder meeting in April. Daft currently serves as president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's moving quickly to put his stamp on the company," Goldman said.

<HEADLINE> Millionaires Pony Up for Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mitt Romney began a campaign for million-dollar
Olympic donors by contributing $1 million himself.
</P>
<P>
	Romney got as much from each of eight other donors at a dinner Tuesday
sponsored by Utah's richest industrialist, Jon M. Huntsman, for a select group
of 100 wealthy guests and athletes.
</P>
<P>
	In a related donation, Boyer Co., one of Utah's largest developers, agreed to
build a $5 million Olympic plaza as a centerpiece for the company's 40-acre
Gateway project in downtown Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
	And Romney said he was looking for a sponsor for yet another Olympic plaza
dedicated to athletes on the grounds of the new city library. The Gateway plaza
will be built in honor of Olympic donors and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
	Romney put $1 million of his own on the table in addition to deferring his
$280,000 salary as president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. Romney, who
took over the scandal-plagued games last February, says he'll take the salary
only if the 2002 Winter Olympics break even.
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt opened a dinner on the top floor of Huntsman's corporate
offices in Salt Lake as the organizing committee launched its million-dollar
Ambassador club for individual contributors.
</P>
<P>
	Among the first donors, according to Romney and Olympic officials, were Boyer
Co. President Kem Gardner, who parlayed his $1 million donation into the $5
million Gateway plaza; four Nu Skin executives who asked to remain anonymous;
Spencer Eccles, chairman and CEO of First Security bank; John Price, a
real-estate developer; and James R. Swartz, a Palo Alta, Calif., venture
capitalist who keeps a vacation home at Deer Valley
</P>
<P>
	Gardner runs the Ambassadors club, a group of 25 Utah business leaders helping
Romney raise money for the games. Eccles, Price and Swartz are on the club's
board. Their job is to open corporate doors to let Romney ``twist arms'' for
sponsorship deals.
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman is not a member of the club or an Olympic donor, but he footed the
bill for Tuesday's dinner show. The owner of one of the world's largest chemical
manufacturers had been an unyielding critic of the Salt Lake games until July,
when he offered his support, but not money. He did agree to raise money outside
Utah, saying Utah has already paid enough in dollars and a damaged reputation.
</P>
<P>
	The organizing committee has been struggling to raise money since the Olympic
bribery scandal broke in December 1998 with revelations that Salt Lake bidders
spent $1.2 million in gifts, cash, scholarships, trips and shopping sprees for
members of the International Olympic Committee and family members.
</P>
<P>
	In return for $1 million in cash, donors will get VIP privileges valued at
$100,000 including games' tickets, credentials and Olympic uniforms for 12
people, exclusive seating at sports venues, a car and driver, parking
privileges, an engraved plaque at the Olympic plaza, rides on a bobsled run, a
medallion and more.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Has Sluggish Month  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- December was a tepid end to a banner year for some
automakers, including the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG, which
reported sluggish U.S. light vehicle sales for December.
</P>
<P>
	   But foreign manufacturers as a group continued to post sizable sales gains,
appearing to win more market share away from American makes.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrysler said Tuesday that sales of cars and light trucks were up less than
1 percent in December, with a 3 percent boost in car sales overcoming a slight
decline in truck sales. The increase in cars was led by a surprising increase in
sales of its small Neon compact and Plymouth Breeze/Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge
Stratus sedans.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Neon is a fairly new model, the Breeze/Cirrus/Stratus models are
aging; all have seen sales declines this year, and Chrysler offers rebates of
$1,000 on 2000 Neons and $1,250 on the so-called "cloud cars." But Chrysler
officials said the rebates were not entirely responsible for the sales surge.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've noticed that in certain parts of country the car market has had a
resurgence," said Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and
marketing operations. "We've seen a lot of strength coming in the Northeast."
</P>
<P>
	   The company ended the year with sales up 5 percent, with most of the
increase coming from strong sales of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Dodge
trucks. One dark spot: Chrysler's minivans ended the year with sales off 4
percent for the year and down 8 percent in December. The current models, due to
be replaced this year, have suffered in competition with the Honda Odyssey and
Ford Windstar.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said Tuesday it was increasing minivans incentives again.
Theodor Cunningham, DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for global sales
and marketing, said the move was intended to protect Chrysler's market share
until the new models go on sale later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The competition in the minivan segment is fierce right now and we are
maintaining what we think are reasonable incentive levels," Cunningham said.
"We're going to be aggressive for the rest of the year."
</P>
<P>
	   Some other automakers also reported slower December sales. Toyota Motor Co.
said it sales were down 12 percent, while sales for the year ended up 8 percent.
The Toyota Camry will likely take the crown of best-selling car in America
again, with sales of 320,156 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Subaru said its December sales were down 11 percent, while Saab AB said its
sales for the month were off 17.5 percent for the month. But both posted strong
gains for the year, part of an industrywide increase expected to push total
light vehicle sales well past the record of 16 million vehicles set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one could have predicted such a monster year, nor anticipated the
sustained strength of consumer confidence," said Jim Press, executive vice
president for Toyota's U.S. sales arm. "Every indicator points to a leveling-off
in 2000. But of course, that's what we all said last year."
</P>
<P>
	   Art Spinella, an industry sales analyst with CNW Marketing Research in
Bandon, Ore., said automakers' monthly sales would suffer in comparison to a
strong month last year, and that mild weather had influenced sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "The weather has been fairly decent, and you tend to see cars sell better
than they normally would," he said "Last year, the weather was lousy, and you
saw more trucks."
</P>
<P>
	   Several foreign automakers reported continued strong sales in December,
though. Honda Motor Co. said its sales were up 6 for the month and 6.5 percent
for the year; both increases were driven by the popularity of the Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
	   Nissan Motor Co. saw its sales increase 7.5 percent for the month and 9
percent for the year, thanks to its Xterra SUV.
</P>
<P>
	   European automakers also rang in 2000 with a bang. Mercedes-Benz officially
took the title of best-selling luxury brand, selling 189,011 vehicles in 1999,
an 11 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkswagen said its sales were up 33 percent for the month and 43 percent
for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will report their sales totals
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> One Minor Glitch Reported by Fed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The banking system continued to operate largely free of
Y2K glitches on the second business day of the new year, after a problem
described as minor at a regional Federal Reserve bank had been fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no problems reported with ATM machines and other banking
operations, Charlotte Birch, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is very quiet," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Armored trucks around the country, meanwhile, continued to carry back to the
regional Fed banks some of the billions of extra dollars distributed to banks,
thrifts and credit unions in case of Y2K panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Some banks have elected to keep the surplus currency for future use rather
than return it, Fed spokesman David Skidmore said. He said the number of banks
planning to do so was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank's check-clearing and payments systems "have functioned very
smoothly," Skidmore said. He noted one exception, which he described as a
Y2K-related "minor glitch" in the electronic system by which banks transfer
federal tax payments from businesses and individuals to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
	   Skidmore said the glitch occurred Monday at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago and involved about $700,000 in tax payments from customers of 60
financial institutions in the region, out of a total of some $15 billion
processed nationwide that day. It was repaired by Tuesday, he said, adding that
the only result is that the affected payments were being posted Tuesday, a day
late.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve distributed some $80 billion to banks, thrifts and
credit unions during the fourth quarter of 1999, compared with $23 billion over
the same period a year earlier. But some of the extra currency could have been
requested for reasons unrelated to Y2K, such as bank customers' holiday shopping
needs, Fed officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that 2000 has arrived without a run on banks, the banks and other
financial institutions on Monday started packing up the surplus currency and
sending it back to regional Federal Reserve banks, as previously planned. The
process is expected to take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking industry officials say they're optimistic people won't experience
problems withdrawing cash from automated teller machines.

<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- No. 1 at the start, No. 1 at the finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State is the perfect national champion.
</P>
<P>
	   Led by the sizzling Peter Warrick and the steady Chris Weinke, the Seminoles
held off Virginia Tech for a 46-29 victory in the national championship game
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies' thrilling freshman quarterback, Michael Vick, did all he could
to run his team to victory in the Sugar Bowl, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick electrified a Superdome crowd with a record 20-point game -- he
caught touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards, returned a punt 59 yards for a score
and snagged a 2-point conversion pass from Weinke.
</P>
<P>
	   The 27-year-old Weinke, playing perhaps the final game of his college
career, completed 20 of 34 passes for 329 yards and four TDs -- two to Warrick
and two to Ron Dugans. Warrick finished with six catches for 163 yards in the
highest-scoring Sugar Bowl in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick threw for 225 yards and one TD and ran for 97 yards and a score.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State (12-0) was certain to become the first team to go wire to wire
in The Associated Press' poll since the preseason ratings began in 1950. The
final AP poll will be released early Wednesday to confirm the obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles were automatically crowned national champs in the USA

<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- George McCloud hit two 3-pointers in the final 46 seconds and
Antonio McDyess had 27 points and 13 rebounds as the Denver Nuggets beat the
Dallas Mavericks 98-96 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   McCloud scored 17 of his 19 points in the second half. Nick Van Exel added
17, Ron Mercer had 14 and Raef LaFrentz 11 for the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Finley had 28 points and 10 assists and Gary Trent added 20 points
for the Mavericks who lost their fourth straight. Dallas made all 16 of its free
throws.
</P>
<P>
	   McCloud, who was 5-for-9 on 3-pointers, hit a 3-pointer with 46 seconds to
go to put the Nuggets ahead 95-94. After Finley's layup, McCloud hit the
game-winner with 8.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets took a 76-74 lead into the fourth quarter and neither team
scored until a dunk by McDyess nearly three minutes into the period. Trent got
the Mavericks first points of the final quarter with a finger roll layup and
Dirk Nowitzki tied the game at 80 with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied five times over the next four minutes, the last time at 92
on a dunk and free throw by McDyess with 1:17 left. Shawn Bradley's jump shot
from the wing with 1:01 left put Dallas ahead 94-92 before McCloud's two
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 54-45 at halftime, Denver opened the third quarter with a 14-2 run,
with seven points coming from McCloud to take a 59-56 lead. The Mavericks
regained the lead, 60-59, on two free throws by Ceballos and a jumper by Finley.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel scored 11 points and the Nuggets shot 65 percent on 13-for-20
shooting in the first quarter but trailed 31-29. Finley and Nowitzki had eight
points each in a period where the Mavericks hit 14 of 22 shots.

<HEADLINE> Vick Dazzles, But Not Enough  </HEADLINE>
    By HANK KURZ Jr. AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Michael Vick was dazzling. He just wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Tech's freshman quarterback used spin moves to leave defenders
sprawled on the carpet and speed to leave them grabbing at air Tuesday night
against Florida State in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   And even though his fumble in Hokies territory with 11:58 left gave Florida
State the chance to build a cushion on their way to a 46-29 victory, Vick still
turned the Sugar Bowl into his own showcase with his biggest, best performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The 19-year-old left-hander did most of his damage with his feet, repeatedly
sidestepping drooling defenders as they closed in for the kill, then using his
4.33 speed to burst into the open field and pick up huge chunks of yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick gained 97 yards on 23 carries, including a remarkable 42-yard jaunt
that started when he spun away from a Seminoles lineman who seemed to have a
free shot at him.
</P>
<P>
	   Four plays later, Vick's 3-yard touchdown run made it 28-14, capping a
seven-play, 80-yard drive to give the Hokies hope just 37 seconds before
halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, with the Hokies dominating the third quarter, Vick pitched to Andre
Kendrick out of the option and Kendrick went 29 yards for a TD to make it 28-23.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick also had runs of 15 and 22 yards on the next series, which Kendrick
ended with a 6-yard scoring run that gave the Hokies their first lead, 29-28.
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't just the big gainers that dazzled. Vick frequently found a
space where there appeared to be none, leaving even the Seminoles fans gasping
with disbelief as he moved around the backfield trying to find a way to make a
play.
</P>
<P>
	   He was still trying to make something happen when Seminoles linebacker Bobby
Rhodes hit him after a 12-yard gain in the final quarter and jarred the ball
loose. The Hokies trailed 36-29 at the time, and when Sean Key recovered and
Florida State added a field goal five plays later, the Hokies were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only Vick's seventh fumble of the season, but his second of the game.
He also lost the ball on the Hokies' first series when coach Frank Beamer opted
to go for it on 4th-and-goal from the 1 and Vick was swarmed in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick was 15-of-29 for 225 yards with a 49-yard scoring pass to Andre Davis.
He threw behind several receivers, but also was victimized by several drops and
was almost always throwing while in an all-out sprint.

<HEADLINE> Pataki to propose $700 million business tax cut package in address  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki says cutting business taxes will
help bring jobs to New York, so he plans to propose more than $700 million in
new business tax cuts when he gives his State of the State address.
<P>
	   Pataki said his plan puts "in place new job-creating tax cuts to spur
economic growth across the state, particularly in upstate communities."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki wants to eliminate the gross receipts tax on energy, give a new tax
credit to spur job growth in cities, give new tax cuts for farmers and
environmentally-friendly companies, create upstate "high-tech" enterprise zones,
expand low-cost power for businesses and cut taxes for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have more private-sector jobs upstate than ever before in history
but we must do even more to create jobs and opportunities for the people of New
York," Pataki said. "This job-creating plan will ensure that every corner of New
York shares fully in our economic revival."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will outline more of his plan in today's State of the State address
at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP governor called the elimination of all gross receipt taxes on energy
for businesses and residences as the most important component of his plan. When
fully effective, that proposal would provide $500 million in tax savings
statewide for businesses and industries, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Legislature must approve Pataki's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Republicans also proposed the elimination of the "onerous"
gross receipts tax on energy last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elimination of the GRT is critical to maintaining New York's unrivaled
economic resurgence, especially upstate where business and industry accounts for
the major portion of this tax paid to the state through higher electric and gas
bills," Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for comment on Pataki's proposal
were not immediately returned. Silver will give the Democrats' response to
Pataki after the State of the State address today.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's plan got good reviews from the state Business Council. "This gives
us good reason to hope that the GRT will be eliminated," council spokesman
Robert Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other parts of Pataki's plan include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Expanding the Power for Jobs program to give businesses an extra $20
million in savings. Power for Jobs was conceived as a way of providing
lower-cost electricity to businesses and groups which say they need the cost
savings to create or maintain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Creating upstate high technology enterprise zones, which are supposed to
promote high technology economic development in upstate areas where employment
growth is below the statewide average, and upstate urban job creation tax
credits, which provides a tax credit of as much as $1,000 per job for employers
who either open new companies or expand existing businesses that create a
minimum of 25 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   - Reducing small business corporate franchise tax rates from 7.5 percent to
6.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   - Allowing farmers whose homes are part of their incorporated farming
businesses to take advantage of the school tax relief or STAR tax rebate
program. That would save farmers about $1 million annually after going into
effect in the 2000-01 school year, Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Peter Warrick Stars in Sugar Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There was no catching Peter Warrick this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Determined to leave a lasting impression at Florida State -- and not one
involving his Dillard's shopping scam -- Warrick turned college football's
national title game into his own personal highlight film Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick set a Sugar Bowl record by scoring 20 points, catching touchdown
passes of 64 and 43 yards, scoring on a 59-yard punt return and adding a 2-point
conversion grab in leading the Seminoles over Virginia Tech 46-29.
</P>
<P>
	   Showing why he might be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, Warrick wound up
with six receptions for 163 yards. He earned the most outstanding player award,
along with a sideline handshake from Minnesota Vikings star Randy Moss and a
serenade from Florida State fans in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick had waited his whole career for a game like this, having returned
for his senior season in hopes of this opportunity, and he did more than win his
one-man duel with scrambling Hokies quarterback Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick helped deliver college football's ultimate prize to the top-ranked
Seminoles, three months after his misstep cost him a chance to win the Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly, he savored the moment.
</P>
<P>
	   A virtual no-show in the Seminoles' championship bowl losses in the 1998 and
1996 seasons, Warrick strutted onto the field during pregame introductions and
then backed up his swagger.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick held off an interfering defender for a juggling, 43-yard TD catch
with 7:42 left that closed out the No. 2 Hokies, and celebrated in style. He
took off his helmet, bumped chests with several teammates and paraded up the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick had achieved one goal last month when he received his degree in
political science. But he wanted to put behind him something else -- his arrest
this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick and teammate Laveranues Coles were arrested on a charge of felony
grand theft for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a department
store in Tallahassee. Warrick was suspended two games and reinstated after he
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, which required that he spend 30 hours in a work
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, in what many regarded as a highly inappropriate comment, he said:
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like I killed the president."
</P>
<P>
	   Some fans may have thought of that incident when they thought of Warrick.
Until Tuesday night, that is.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Fla. St 46, No. 2 Va. Tech 29  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD ROSENBLATT AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- No. 1 at the start, No. 1 at the finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State is the perfect national champion.
</P>
<P>
	   Led by the sizzling Peter Warrick and the steady Chris Weinke, the Seminoles
held off Virginia Tech for a 46-29 victory in the national championship game
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies' thrilling freshman quarterback, Michael Vick, did all he could
to run his team to victory in the Sugar Bowl, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick electrified a Superdome crowd with a record 20-point game -- he
caught touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards, returned a punt 59 yards for a score
and snagged a 2-point conversion pass from Weinke.
</P>
<P>
	   The 27-year-old Weinke, playing perhaps the final game of his college
career, completed 20 of 34 passes for 329 yards and four TDs -- two to Warrick
and two to Ron Dugans. Warrick finished with six catches for 163 yards in the
highest-scoring Sugar Bowl in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick threw for 225 yards and one TD and ran for 97 yards and a score.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State (12-0) was certain to become the first team to go wire to wire
in The Associated Press' poll since the preseason ratings began in 1950. The
final AP poll will be released early Wednesday to confirm the obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles were automatically crowned national champs in the USA
Today-ESPN coaches' poll under the Bowl Championship Series format.
</P>
<P>
	   All week, Warrick and his senior pals promised each other they would do
everything possible to avoid losing three title games. They did -- in a big way
-- and Bobby Bowden completed a remarkable year. He won his 300th game in the
first father vs. son coaching matchup, celebrated his 70th birthday and 50th
wedding anniversary and finally attained his first perfect season in 40 years as
a coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick, the All-American wide receiver who lost his chance at the Heisman
Trophy after a two-game suspension for his role in a shopping mall scam, came up
with his best performance in the final game of his college career.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first half, he caught three passes for 100 yards and his punt return
helped the Seminoles build a 28-14 lead after 30 minutes of big plays. Last
season, he was held to one catch for seven yards in a Fiesta Bowl loss to
Tennessee in the national title game. In fact, in three previous bowl games,
Warrick totaled five catches and no TDs.
</P>
<P>
	   He opened the scoring with his 64-yard grab, then took a punt and blazed
past Tech defenders for a 59-yard score and a 28-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Late in the game, with half the crowd of 79,280 chanting "Peter Warrick,
Peter Warrick," Weinke reared back and threw a 43-yard TD pass to the wide
receiver, who caught the ball while diving into the end zone with a Virginia
Tech defender draped over him. The chants rang out again and Warrick ran to the
sideline to celebrate with his teammates.

<HEADLINE> 11 Killed in Sri Lanka Blast  </HEADLINE>
   By DILSHIKHA JAYAMAHA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suspected Tamil rebel set off explosives
strapped to her body near the prime minister's office Wednesday, killing herself
and 10 others, police and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was not in the building during the
explosion. She is in poor health and mostly works from home.
</P>
<P>
	   Police stopped the bomber near the office building. ``Our people found her
movement suspicious and they tried to check her when she exploded herself,''
deputy inspector general of police, Jagath Jayawardene, said of the suicide
bomber.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came after Sri Lanka's president escaped an assassination attempt
last month during the presidential race. A suicide bomber set off explosives
strapped to her body as President Chandrika Kumatatunga was getting into her
car.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was injured in the right eye and doctors reportedly have said
she may lose sight. That blast, at an election rally in downtown Colombo last
month, killed 23 people and wounded more than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four policemen were among those killed in Wednesday's explosion.
Twenty-four others were hospitalized in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion damaged the outer walls of the building housing the office of
Bandaranaike, who is also the president's mother. Earlier, police said the blast
occurred outside the prime minister's house, which is nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw the police people trying to search her,'' Nimal Sirisena, a security
guard at the Russian Embassy, said of the suspected bomber. ``She was resisting
it, and moments later, I heard a big bang.''
</P>
<P>
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but suspicion fell
on the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. The guerrillas have been fighting security
forces for the last 16 years to carve out a homeland for the minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
	   The war has left more than 61,000 people dead. The Tigers have particularly
targeted Kumatatunga and her family because she has said that her security
forces will continue to try and crush the Tamil uprising.
</P>
<P>
	   The Joint Operation Command, the military office in charge of the ongoing
war, is located near the prime minister's office and top military generals often
take the road where the bomber had stationed herself. The Russian Embassy is
also in the same area.

<HEADLINE> Pataki to deliver sixth State of State message  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Still riding an economic boom that has buoyed his
tenure as governor, George Pataki was to deliver his sixth State of State
message today to open the 223rd annual session of the New York Legislature.
<P>
	   Aides said the Republican governor would stress proposals to help overhaul
the state's education system.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Pataki unveiled a $700 million tax-cut proposal he said would
help businesses and areas of upstate New York still not sharing completely in
the fruits of a Wall Street-based economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have more private-sector jobs upstate than ever before in history,
but we must do even more to create jobs and opportunities for the people of New
York," the governor said as he took the wraps off his latest tax-reduction
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has hopes that GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush
might tap him as a running mate, has enacted a series of hefty tax cuts during
his first five years in office. At the same time, Pataki has managed to keep
state spending on the increase, thanks largely to the continued healthy
performance of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone is thrilled with the state of their personal economic
situation. More than 10,000 state workers who have been without contracts since
April of last year planned to demonstrate outside the state Capitol this
afternoon as Pataki delivered his address in the state Assembly chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of 1998, Pataki and state legislators voted themselves hefty pay
raises. He is now paid $179,000 a year while lawmakers get base salaries of
$79,500 a year. Top aides to the governor also received big pay hikes earlier
this year. That has made relations between Pataki and the unions even more
chilled.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's annual address traditionally kicks off the legislative
session and can be an indicator of how things will go as state leaders seek to
hammer out budget accords and enact other legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the days leading up to his latest State of the State message, Pataki
announced that he would ask the Legislature to provide funding to launch a
world-class research institute to study the Hudson River and to give
state-financed school property tax rebates directly to homeowners instead of
filtering them through school districts.
</P>
<P>
	   On the education reform front, the state Board of Regents has already begun

<HEADLINE> Peter Warrick Shines in Sugar Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There was no catching Peter Warrick this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Determined to leave a lasting impression at Florida State -- and not one
involving his Dillard's shopping scam -- Warrick turned college football's
national title game into his own personal highlight film Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick set a Sugar Bowl record by scoring 20 points, catching touchdown
passes of 64 and 43 yards, scoring on a 59-yard punt return and adding a 2-point
conversion grab in leading the Seminoles over Virginia Tech 46-29.
</P>
<P>
	   Showing why he might be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, Warrick wound up
with six receptions for 163 yards. He earned the most outstanding player award,
along with a sideline handshake from Minnesota Vikings star Randy Moss and a
serenade from Florida State fans in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick had waited his whole career for a game like this, having returned
for his senior season in hopes of this opportunity, and he did more than win his
one-man duel with scrambling Hokies quarterback Michael Vick.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick helped deliver college football's ultimate prize to the top-ranked
Seminoles, three months after his misstep cost him a chance to win the Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly, he savored the moment.
</P>
<P>
	   A virtual no-show in the Seminoles' championship bowl losses in the 1998 and
1996 seasons, Warrick strutted onto the field during pregame introductions and
then backed up his swagger.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick held off an interfering defender for a juggling, 43-yard TD catch
with 7:42 left that closed out the No. 2 Hokies, and celebrated in style. He
took off his helmet, bumped chests with several teammates and paraded up the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick had achieved one goal last month when he received his degree in
political science. But he wanted to put behind him something else -- his arrest
this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick and teammate Laveranues Coles were arrested on a charge of felony
grand theft for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a department
store in Tallahassee. Warrick was suspended two games and reinstated after he
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, which required that he spend 30 hours in a work
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, in what many regarded as a highly inappropriate comment, he said:
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like I killed the president."
</P>
<P>
	   Some fans may have thought of that incident when they thought of Warrick.
Until Tuesday night, that is.

<HEADLINE> Seminoles QB Throws Four TD passes  </HEADLINE>
    By BRENT KALLESTAD Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Chris Weinke erased all doubts by throwing for 329 yards
and four touchdowns Tuesday night to lead Florida State to its first perfect
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinke had to shake off the rust from a six-year layoff when he came to
Florida State as a 24-year-old freshman. Many were unsure if could regain his
football skills and lead one of the country's top programs.
</P>
<P>
	   And some, including Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, were uncertain if
Weinke would ever play again after a serious neck injury in the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
	   He prevailed on both counts.
</P>
<P>
	   In what may have been his final game, Weinke found senior receivers Peter
Warrick and Ron Dugans for two touchdowns each as the Seminoles shook off a
furious third-quarter rally by Virginia Tech for a 46-29 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinke, who missed last year's title game against Tennessee with a neck
injury, completed 20 of 34 attempts and was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps best known as the nation's oldest quarterback, the 27-year-old hit
Warrick on scoring plays covering 64 and 43 yards and combined with Dugans on
touchdown plays of 64 and 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinke has won all but one of his 22 starts at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
	   Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward led Florida State to its first national
title in 1993, but the Seminoles were beaten during the regular season at Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinke enrolled at Florida State in 1996 after spending six years as a minor
league baseball player in the Toronto Blue Jays' system.
</P>
<P>
	   And he may have never won the starting job, but Dan Kendra was injured in
the 1998 spring game and sat out last season rehabilitating a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinke injured his neck against Virginia in November 1998 and didn't have
any contact until the Seminoles' first game of the season against Louisiana
Tech.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State has scheduled a Friday news conference at which Weinke will
announce whether he is going to give up his final year of eligibility and enter
his name in the NFL draft.

<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- No. 1 at the start, No. 1 at the finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State is the perfect national champion.
</P>
<P>
	   Led by the sizzling Peter Warrick and the steady Chris Weinke, the Seminoles
held off Virginia Tech for a 46-29 victory in the national championship game
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies' thrilling freshman quarterback, Michael Vick, did all he could
to run his team to victory in the Sugar Bowl, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick electrified a Superdome crowd with a record 20-point game -- he
caught touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards, returned a punt 59 yards for a score
and snagged a 2-point conversion pass from Weinke.
</P>
<P>
	   The 27-year-old Weinke, playing perhaps the final game of his college
career, completed 20 of 34 passes for 329 yards and four TDs -- two to Warrick
and two to Ron Dugans. Warrick finished with six catches for 163 yards in the
highest-scoring Sugar Bowl in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick threw for 225 yards and one TD and ran for 97 yards and a score.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State (12-0) was certain to become the first team to go wire to wire
in The Associated Press' poll since the preseason ratings began in 1950. The
final AP poll will be released early Wednesday to confirm the obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles were automatically crowned national champs in the USA
Today-ESPN coaches' poll under the Bowl Championship Series format.
</P>
<P>
	   All week, Warrick and his senior pals promised each other they would do
everything possible to avoid losing three title games. They did -- in a big way
-- and Bobby Bowden completed a remarkable year. He won his 300th game in the
first father vs. son coaching matchup, celebrated his 70th birthday and 50th
wedding anniversary and finally attained his first perfect season in 40 years as
a coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick, the All-American wide receiver who lost his chance at the Heisman
Trophy after a two-game suspension for his role in a shopping mall scam, came up
with his best performance in the final game of his college career.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first half, he caught three passes for 100 yards and his punt return
helped the Seminoles build a 28-14 lead after 30 minutes of big plays. Last
season, he was held to one catch for seven yards in a Fiesta Bowl loss to
Tennessee in the national title game. In fact, in three previous bowl games,
Warrick totaled five catches and no TDs.
</P>
<P>
	   He opened the scoring with his 64-yard grab, then took a punt and blazed
past Tech defenders for a 59-yard score and a 28-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Late in the game, with half the crowd of 79,280 chanting "Peter Warrick,
Peter Warrick," Weinke reared back and threw a 43-yard TD pass to the wide
receiver, who caught the ball while diving into the end zone with a Virginia
Tech defender draped over him. The chants rang out again and Warrick ran to the
sideline to celebrate with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   The win over the upstart Hokies (11-1) stamped the Seminoles as the Team of
the Decade and ended a run of national title misses under Bowden. Since winning
its first national crown in 1993, Florida State had lost two of the past three
title games -- 23-16 to Tennessee last season, and 52-20 to Florida in '97 in
what until Tuesday night was the highest-scoring Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss ended Virginia Tech's dream season and a bid for its first national
title in 107 years of playing football. Vick was valiant in defeat. The
19-year-old left-hander overcame a lost fumble near the Seminoles goal line on
the game's opening drive and led the Hokies back from a 21-point deficit to a
29-28 lead with 2:13 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State somehow regrouped and regained the lead as Weinke hit Dugans
on a 15-yard score with 12:59 left in the game. Warrick caught a 2-point
conversion pass from Weinke and the 'Noles were back in the lead, 36-29.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State got the ball back when linebacker Bobby Rhodes' helmet knocked
the ball from Vick's grasp and safety Sean Key recovered at the Hokies 34. The
turnover set up Sebastian Janikowski's 32-yard field goal with 10:26 that put
the Seminoles ahead 39-29.
</P>
<P>
	   And then came Warrick's best catch of all to seal the title. After stopping
Tech on fourth down, Florida State took over at the Tech 43 and Weinke found
Warrick, who held onto the ball with cornerback Roynell Whitaker hanging over
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Down 28-14 at the half, Virginia Tech seized the momentum. Vick threw a
26-yard completion to set up Shayne Graham's 23-yard field goal to make it
28-17.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies defense came alive and forced a punt, which was returned 46 yards
to the Seminoles 36 by Ike Carlton, the cornerback subbing for injured Ricky
Hall. Three plays later, Andre Kendrick raced 29 yards for a touchdown to pull
the Hokies within 28-23. Kendrick stepped in for Shyrone Stith, Tech's
1,000-yard rusher who missed the second half with a sprained left ankle. Vick's
2-point conversion pass attempt was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornerback Anthony Midget then intercepted a long pass intended for Warrick,
and Vick went to work again. He threw a 23-yard pass to Cullen Hawkins, was
sacked for a 7-yard loss and then went on a catch-me-if-you-can 22-yard dash to
the 6. Kendrick scored from 6 yards out and the Hokies were ahead for the first
and only time.
</P>
<P>
	   While Virginia Tech may be the undisputed champion on special teams -- 63 in
the 1990s -- it was Florida State that excelled in that department, too.
Sixty-eight seconds after Warrick's first score. it was 14-0 after linebacker
Tommy Polley blocked a punt by Tech's John Kibble, and Jeff Chaney scooped it up
and went 6 yards for a touchdown with 2:14 left in the first quarter. It was the
first time in Kibble's career he had a punt blocked.

</P>
<P>
	   In the second season under the BCS format, everything went Florida State's
way. The Seminoles, ranked No. 1 in both major preseason polls, also had a
schedule that was sixth-toughest among 114 I-A teams. As long as Florida State
kept winning, there was little chance the computer-heavy BCS standings would
leave the 'Noles out of the title game.
</P>
<P>
	   All Bowden's boys had to do was win 'em all and keep their noses clean.
Staying out of trouble, it turned out, was the most difficult part. At least
five players were suspended or kicked off the team for various legal problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick and Laveranues Coles were arrested Oct. 7 on a charge of felony
grand theft for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a Dillard's
department store in Tallahassee. Warrick was suspended two games and reinstated
after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, which required that he spend 30 hours
in a work program.
</P>
<P>
	   On the field, Florida State had a healthy Weinke, Warrick for nine games and
a solid but unspectacular defense led by noseguard Corey Simon. When the defense
was burned for 387 yards and four TD passes by Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton, the
Seminoles' offense took charge for a 41-35 victory on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden got career victory No. 300 against Clemson, coached by Bobby's son,
Tommy, in college football's first father vs. son coaching matchup.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, there was the annual showdown with Florida, this time at The Swamp.
After the Gators went ahead 16-13 midway through the third quarter, Weinke led
the Seminoles to a tying field goal and two more TDs to seal a 30-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-five days later, the relieved Bowden has himself a second national
championship.
</P>
<P>
	   What a decade!

	   "The big-time players show up in the big-time games," teammate Corey Simon
said, "and he showed once again he's a big-time player."
</P>
<P>
	   The victory brought coach Bobby Bowden his first perfect season and second
title.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach Bowden is a great man. I came back because of the love of him. I won
this game for him tonight," Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly, Warrick savored the moment.

<P>

then backed up his swagger.
</P>
<P>
	   He sped past single coverage to catch Chris Weinke's pass in full stride for
a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter. Early in the second period, he fielded a
punt on one bounce and streaked into the end zone for a 28-7 edge
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick held off an interfering defender for a juggling, 43-yard TD catch

	   Warrick thrilled a Superdome crowd with a record 20-point game -- he caught
touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards, returned a punt 59 yards for a score and
snagged a 2-point conversion pass from Weinke.
</P>
<P>
	   The 27-year-old Weinke, playing perhaps the final game of his college
career, completed 20 of 34 passes for 329 yards and four TDs -- two to Warrick
and two to Ron Dugans. Warrick finished with six catches for 163 yards in the
highest-scoring Sugar Bowl in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick threw for 225 yards and one TD and ran for 97 yards and a score.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State (12-0) was certain to become the first team to go wire-to-wire
in The Associated Press' poll since the preseason ratings began in 1950. The
final AP poll will be released early Wednesday to confirm the obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles were automatically crowned national champs in the USA
Today-ESPN coaches' poll under the Bowl Championship Series format.
</P>
<P>
	   All week, Warrick and his senior pals promised each other they would do
everything possible to avoid losing three title games. They did -- in a big way
-- and Bobby Bowden completed a remarkable year. He won his 300th game in the
first father vs. son coaching matchup, celebrated his 70th birthday and 50th
wedding anniversary and finally attained his first perfect season in 40 years as
a coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick, the All-American wide receiver who lost his chance at the Heisman
Trophy after a two-game suspension for his role in a shopping mall scam, came up
with his best performance in the final game of his college career.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first half, he caught three passes for 100 yards and his punt return
helped the Seminoles build a 28-14 lead after 30 minutes of big plays. Last
season, he was held to one catch for seven yards in a Fiesta Bowl loss to
Tennessee in the national title game. In fact, in three previous bowl games,
Warrick totaled five catches and no TDs.
</P>
<P>
	   He opened the scoring with his 64-yard grab, then took a punt and blazed
past Tech defenders for a 59-yard score and a 28-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Late in the game, with half the crowd of 79,280 chanting "Peter Warrick,
Peter Warrick," Weinke reared back and threw a 43-yard TD pass to the wide
receiver, who caught the ball while diving into the end zone with a Virginia
Tech defender draped over him. The chants rang out again and Warrick ran to the
sideline to celebrate with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   The win over the upstart Hokies (11-1) stamped the Seminoles as the Team of
the Decade and ended a run of national title misses under Bowden. Since winning
its first national crown in 1993, Florida State had lost two of the past three
title games -- 23-16 to Tennessee last season, and 52-20 to Florida in '97 in
what until Tuesday night was the highest-scoring Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss ended Virginia Tech's dream season and a bid for its first national
title in 107 years of playing football.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick was valiant in defeat. The 19-year-old left-hander overcame a lost
fumble near the Seminoles goal line on the game's opening drive and led the
Hokies back from a 21-point deficit to a 29-28 lead with 2:13 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State somehow regrouped and regained the lead as Weinke hit Dugans
on a 15-yard score with 12:59 left in the game. Warrick caught a 2-point
conversion pass from Weinke and the 'Noles were back in the lead, 36-29.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State got the ball back when linebacker Bobby Rhodes' helmet knocked
the ball from Vick's grasp and safety Sean Key recovered at the Hokies 34. The
turnover set up Sebastian Janikowski's 32-yard field goal with 10:26 that put
the Seminoles ahead 39-29.
</P>
<P>
	   And then came Warrick's best catch of all to seal the title. After stopping
Tech on fourth down, Florida State took over at the Tech 43 and Weinke found
Warrick, who held onto the ball with cornerback Roynell Whitaker hanging over
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Down 28-14 at the half, Virginia Tech seized the momentum. Vick threw a
26-yard completion to set up Shayne Graham's 23-yard field goal to make it
28-17.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies defense came alive and forced a punt, which was returned 46 yards
to the Seminoles 36 by Ike Carlton, the cornerback subbing for injured Ricky
Hall. Three plays later, Andre Kendrick raced 29 yards for a touchdown to pull
the Hokies within 28-23. Kendrick stepped in for Shyrone Stith, Tech's
1,000-yard rusher who missed the second half with a sprained left ankle. Vick's
2-point conversion pass attempt was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornerback Anthony Midget then intercepted a long pass intended for Warrick,
and Vick went to work again. He threw a 23-yard pass to Cullen Hawkins, was
sacked for a 7-yard loss and then went on a 22-yard dash to the 6. Kendrick
scored from 6 yards out and the Hokies were ahead for the first and only time.
</P>
<P>
	   While Virginia Tech may be the undisputed champion on special teams -- 63 in
the 1990s -- it was Florida State that excelled in that department, too.
Sixty-eight seconds after Warrick's first score. it was 14-0 after linebacker
Tommy Polley blocked a punt by Tech's John Kibble, and Jeff Chaney scooped it up
and went 6 yards for a touchdown with 2:14 left in the first quarter. It was the
first time in Kibble's career he had a punt blocked.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second season under the BCS format, everything went Florida State's
way. The Seminoles, ranked No. 1 in both major preseason polls, also had a
schedule that was sixth-toughest among 114 I-A teams. As long as Florida State
kept winning, there was little chance the computer-heavy BCS standings would
leave the 'Noles out of the title game.
</P>
<P>
	   All Bowden's boys had to do was win 'em all and keep their noses clean.
Staying out of trouble, it turned out, was the most difficult part. At least
five players were suspended or kicked off the team for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick and Laveranues Coles were arrested Oct. 7 on a charge of felony
grand theft for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a Dillard's
department store in Tallahassee. Warrick was suspended two games and reinstated
after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, which required that he spend 30 hours
in a work program.
</P>
<P>
	   On the field, Florida State had a healthy Weinke, Warrick for nine games and
a solid but unspectacular defense led by noseguard Corey Simon. When the defense
was burned for 387 yards and four TD passes by Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton, the
Seminoles' offense took charge for a 41-35 victory on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowden got career victory No. 300 against Clemson, coached by Bobby's son,
Tommy, in college football's first father vs. son coaching matchup.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, there was the annual showdown with Florida, this time at The Swamp.
After the Gators went ahead 16-13 midway through the third quarter, Weinke led
the Seminoles to a tying field goal and two more TDs to seal a 30-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-five days later, the relieved Bowden has himself a second national
championship.
</P>
<P>
	   What a decade!

<HEADLINE> Lakers 122, Clippers 98  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal had 38 points and 15 rebounds Tuesday
night as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Los Angeles Clippers 122-98 to extend
their winning streak to 11 games -- longest in the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was also the 18th in 19 games for the Lakers as well as their 11th
straight over the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers, who scored an NBA record low 19 points in the first half of a
95-68 loss to the Lakers on Dec. 14, lost their third straight after winning
three in a row for the first time since the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers had 20 points by the time this game was 8 1/2 minutes old, and
their 61 first-half points were the most allowed by the Lakers this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, who looked like a much different team in the second half, went
ahead for good by outscoring the Clippers 16-8 to start the third quarter,
putting them ahead 75-69.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, whose 26-5 record is the NBA's best, scored the final nine
points of the period for a 96-79 lead, and the Clippers weren't closer than 14
points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal, who made 17-of-26 field goal attempts and 4-of-9 foul shots, scored
23 points in the first half. He left the game for good with 4:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant added 29 points and nine rebounds, and Glen Rice scored 19
points for the Lakers despite sitting out the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamar Odom and Tyrone Nesby each scored 22 points for the Clippers, with
Odom also getting 12 rebounds. Maurice Taylor added 16 points for the losers.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team led by more than three points until the Clippers scored the
final five of the first quarter for a 29-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers went on a 9-4 run to start the second period to tie the game
33-all, and scored eight straight points to go ahead 50-44. The Clippers then
went on a 17-9 spurt to finish the first half for a 61-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Clippers center Michael Olowokandi drew three fouls in the opening 3:15 of
play, and didn't return to action until the start of the second half. He wound
up with one point and 10 rebounds in 22 minutes, missing all eight of his field
goal attempts.

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech Fans Congregate for Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The mood of hundreds of Virginia Tech fans, many
clad in the school's maroon-and-orange colors, turned from festive to somber
Tuesday night as the Hokies lost 46-29 to Florida State in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite losing the national title game, the Hokies made their supporters
proud.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that Virginia Tech gave it a championship effort," Glenn Hamlin,
37, of Blacksburg, said at Poor Billy's, a downtown Blacksburg bar and grill.
"Just a few plays here or there, and the game could have gone Virginia Tech's
way."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm disappointed but happy they made it that far," said Patrick Cosgriff,
21, of Blacksburg. "Michael Vick is only a freshman, and he did a very good job.
He has some time to improve and get things done."
</P>
<P>
	   Many fans said they were confident that Tech would be a national contender
again.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year, we got things rolling and showed what Virginia Tech can do,"
said Chad Martin, 21, a Tech junior. "Things can only get better from here."
</P>
<P>
	   "If nothing else, we brought a lot of attention to Blacksburg. ... We played
well. It wasn't a blowout like everybody expected," said Dan Whaling, 24, of
Blacksburg. "No matter what, we're going to cheer them on."
</P>
<P>
	   Leading up to the game, the mood was more upbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can't be in New Orleans, this is the place to be," said Scott
Shearer, part owner and manager of Gobbler Town, a popular nightspot in nearby
Christiansburg. Shearer added several Cajun dishes to the menu Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The atmosphere was much like a game at Lane Stadium, with fans cheering and
even doing the wave. Outside, the parking lot was packed, and dozens of Tech
flags attached to car and truck antennas fluttered in the stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
	   Some fans who couldn't make the trip to New Orleans arrived before dark to
get a good table near one of the business' 17 television sets.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been partying all day, getting pumped up for this," said Blane Bush,
29, of Blacksburg. "The regular holidays were nothing. This is what we've been
getting ready for."
</P>
<P>
	   In Blacksburg, Tech's campus was almost deserted, since the school is still
on break for the Christmas and New Year's holidays. But yard signs and posters
were scattered throughout the town supporting the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Terry, headed into Big Al's restaurant downtown just off the campus,
said he wouldn't miss the game for the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been waiting to see something like this for a long time," said Terry.
"If -- pardon me -- I mean when Tech wins, Blacksburg is going to burn down."

<HEADLINE> 11 Killed in Sri Lanka Blast  </HEADLINE>
   By DILSHIKHA JAYAMAHA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A suspected Tamil rebel set off explosives
strapped to her body near the prime minister's office Wednesday, killing herself
and 10 others, police and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was not in the building during the
explosion. She is in poor health and mostly works from home.
</P>
<P>
	   Police stopped the bomber near the office building. ``Our people found her
movement suspicious and they tried to check her when she exploded herself,''
deputy inspector general of police, Jagath Jayawardene, said of the suicide
bomber.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came after Sri Lanka's president escaped an assassination attempt
last month during the presidential race. A suicide bomber set off explosives
strapped to her body as President Chandrika Kumatatunga was getting into her
car.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was injured in the right eye and doctors reportedly have said
she may lose sight. That blast, at an election rally in downtown Colombo last
month, killed 23 people and wounded more than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four policemen were among those killed in Wednesday's explosion.
Twenty-four others were hospitalized in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion damaged the outer walls of the building housing the office of
Bandaranaike, who is also the president's mother. Earlier, police said the blast
occurred outside the prime minister's house, which is nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's office is set 40 feet from the road. It has low brick
walls with iron spikes on top of it for extra security. Several guards with guns
stand outside the building, and all visitors walk through metal detectors and
are searched.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw the police people trying to search her,'' Nimal Sirisena, a security
guard at the Russian Embassy, said of the suspected bomber. ``She was resisting
it, and moments later, I heard a big bang.''
</P>
<P>
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but suspicion fell
on the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. The guerrillas have been fighting security
forces for the last 16 years to carve out a homeland for the minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
	   The war has left more than 61,000 people dead. The Tigers have particularly
targeted Kumatatunga and her family because she has said that her security
forces will continue to try and crush the Tamil uprising.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Police on Tuesday arrested a 30-year-old man as part of their
investigation into the slayings of two men and the wounding of two others at a
shipyard.
</P>
<P>
	   The man arrested at his home has ``previous ties'' to the Northlake Shipyard
and the case appeared to be ``workplace violence,'' police spokeswoman Pam
McCammon said. She would not elaborate, but said the man had been a ``person of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   The man was questioned but not immediately booked into jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Marine engineer Russell James Brisendine, 43, and bookkeeper Peter Giles,
26, were killed in the Nov. 3 attack by a man wearing a coat over camoflage.
They were slain with a semiautomatic handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said the killings were deliberate but the motive remains a
mystery. On Sunday, a handgun and camouflage jacket were found in a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
	   The gun and other items recovered in Gas Works Park near the shipyard
``provided some assistance'' in the investigation, McCammon said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Weathers Ebb  </HEADLINE>
   By TINI TRAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- When the bamboo stalks grow inward or the ants climb
into the rafters, people warn that it's time to brace for the worst.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vietnam, where typhoons, monsoons and floods routinely batter the land,
locals can recite a litany of other ways to predict the rains that inevitably
come their way. Weathering the ebb and flow of flood season is a way of life
here.
</P>
<P>
	   But this past year was worse than usual, with devastating floods in November
and December that killed more than 700 people, caused $285 million in damage and
set back development of central Vietnam by a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   In the wake of such massive death and destruction, Vietnam's leaders are
concluding that short-term relief and stoic endurance are not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to find ways to coexist in harmony with floods and minimize the
impacts of natural disasters,'' Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said as he made
a plea to international donors for assistance during an annual meeting last
month.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Bui Thi Hoa and her family, who have farmed in central
Quang Nam province for generations, have learned to cope with the annual cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   The family's most valuable possessions -- two beds, a wooden chest, a
rickety table -- are routinely strung up by ropes from the ceiling during flood
season. Sacks of rice seed, intended for the winter crop plantings, are stowed
up in the rafters.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrying her 4-year-old son in her arms, Hoa, 27, was resigned about the
recent flooding that destroyed the family's newly replanted rice field.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every year, the rains come,'' she said. ``Sometimes the water is up to my
ankles, sometimes as high as my knees. But every year the floods come. What can
we do? We have no choice but to bear it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The floodwaters reached epic proportions in November when seven feet of
rainfall in three days deluged the seven central provinces -- home to 7 million
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Considered one of the worst floods of the century, the downpours turned
small towns and villages into isolated islands while paralyzing railways and
roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Vietnam launched its largest-ever emergency relief effort, winning
international praise for the rapid response. With the military mobilized for the
first time during a natural disaster, emergency food and medicine were delivered
by helicopter 48 hours after the magnitude of the disaster became evident.
</P>
<P>
	   Four weeks later, a second round of flooding hit the already-soaked region.
Rivers again overflowed and reservoirs threatened to burst.
</P>
<P>
	   With mounting evidence that the intensity and frequency of natural disasters
will only increase in coming years because of global weather shifts, Vietnam's
top leaders acknowledged the need for long-term disaster management plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Relief agencies had begun long-range efforts before the recent floods. The
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies sent workers
early in the year to the flood-prone area to assess disaster contingencies.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, 2,450 families across the central provinces were given
house-strengthening kits that included steel reinforcements for the walls. The
typical bamboo-frame homes are rarely able to withstand strong winds and rain.
</P>
<P>
	   As the recent floods destroyed tens of thousands of homes, only one of the
reinforced houses were damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People told us that those homes saved them, their families and their
neighbors,'' said Vu Minh Hai, the Red Cross' disaster preparedness officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency, which works with the Vietnam Red Cross, has also suggested
building a second story on schools and a large platform over the central market,
creating higher ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, people have lived with flooding all their lives, but it doesn't mean
they know how to prepare for one,'' Hai said. ``We are teaching them to
strengthen their homes and have emergency food and water stored away. We can't
prevent the flood, but we hope to minimize the damage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Once Vietnamese are taught how to prepare for disasters, their natural
resilience will help them endure, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days after the floods peaked and the water began receding, residents
patiently picked up hammers, brooms, shovels and buckets as they began the slow
task of cleaning up the debris that swamped their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you live here a long time, you know there's no year when it doesn't
flood,'' Nguyen Van Thanh said as he wielded a hammer atop his flattened house.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanh, a lifelong resident of Quang Nam, was prosaic: ``You can lose your
home, your livestock, your rice crops. But if you survive, you can still start
over.''

<HEADLINE> Brother of Embassy Assailant Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By AHMED MANTASH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EIN EL-HILWEH, Lebanon (AP) -- The man who attacked the Russian Embassy in
Lebanon used to weep while watching television reports on Russia's offensive in
Chechnya and was driven by a yearning to ``do something,'' his brother said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahmed Raja Abou Kharoub's ``desire was to kill at least one Russian, and we
have the same desire,'' his elder brother, Salam Abou Kharoub, told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The younger Abou Kharoub, a 30-year-old Palestinian, fired four grenades
Monday on the embassy in the capital, Beirut, and sprayed automatic gunfire. One
Lebanese policeman was killed and several passers-by were injured before
security forces gunned down Abou Kharoub.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, dozens of veiled women paid condolences to Abou Kharoub's wife,
Kheiriya Abdel-Aziz, in their two-room flat in the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian
refugee camp, the largest in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Salam Abou Kharoub, 42, said his brother closely followed the news from
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Lebanese and Palestinian Muslims are sympathetic to Chechen Muslims who
have been under heavy bombardment amid Russia's military offensive in the
breakaway republic. Russia launched the offensive in September in a bid to win
control of the territory after Chechen-based militants invaded a neighboring
region and were blamed for bombings elsewhere in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Salam Abou Kharoub said he used to tell his brother to organize a
demonstration but he wanted to ``do something more than that.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was surprised but proud to learn that his brother attacked the
Russian Embassy. ``But I am sad for the victims, especially the policeman,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The slain Abou Kharoub was identified as an aide to the leader of an Islamic
fundamentalist group who was sentenced to death in 1995 for the assassination of
a Muslim cleric in Beirut. The leader, Ahmed Abdel Karim al-Saadi, known as Abu
Mohjen, is believed to be hiding in Ein el-Hilweh, a camp of 75,000 people,
located outside the port of Sidon, 30 miles south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials in the camp say Abu Mohjen's followers had been telling
their men during the past two months that defending the Muslims of Chechnya is a
religious duty and anyone who kills a Russian would become a martyr who will
enter heaven.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of Abu Mohjen's followers were sent to Beirut and other areas in
Lebanon to carry out revenge attacks, and Abou Kharoub's was the first
operation, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Faux turn of the century crimes turn up in Queens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The complaint looked routine as the crime. A man
allegedly tried to sell cocaine to an undercover cop. But the Queens district
attorney's office knew something was wrong when the date of the crime was listed
as Jan. 1, 1900.
<P>
	   In one of the few Y2K problems citywide, complaints being faxed to the
Queens district attorney's office in the year 2000 had suspects committing their
crimes at the beginning of the last century. In the age of technology, police
were forced to rely on their pens, crossing out 1900 and writing in 2000
instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the person swore the crime was committed on Jan. 1, 1900, and the
complaint is the accusatory instrument, and then some eager prosecutor simply
decided to change it, without having that approved, ratified or initialed by the
complainant, then that's invalid," said Ron Kuby, a well-known defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   But Queens Chief Assistant District Attorney Jack Ryan said Tuesday that the
changes were made by the officers who filled out the complaints. He also said
none of the 50 to 100 erroneous complaints faxed to the office were sent to
court until they were fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Computers in the 16 police precincts in Queens all had caught the Y2K bug
over the weekend, but by Monday, only three precincts still were spewing out
turn-of-the-century dated complaints. Lt. Sean Crowley, a police spokesman, said
the problem had been remedied by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Y2K glitch was limited to Queens because it's the only borough where
police use a program called CAPS - Complaints Arrest Processing System. After
the complaint is completed at the precinct, officers print it out and fax or
deliver it to the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan said police find the system "very advantageous" because it doesn't take
much time and enables cops to return to the streets quickly after they write up
their complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the error not been caught, "There would have been a problem with the
statute of limitations," joked Ryan.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Helps ABC's Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- With lots of millennium coverage and football last week,
ABC won the first Nielsen report of year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The three prime-time hours of "ABC 2000," the network's round-the-clock
millennium extravaganza, won its time slot with an average 18.6 million viewers.
The 10.6 household rating for "ABC 2000" tied for eighth place with NBC's
"Frasier."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC also scored with sports, including "NFL Monday Night Football" (3rd
place) and "The Orange Bowl" (6th place).
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, ABC won the week of Dec. 27-Jan 2 with an average prime-time
audience of 14 million viewers (9.0 household rating, 15 share), according to
Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Nielsen data that omits one 30-minute measurement, CBS ranked
second for the week, with 12.5 million viewers (8.3 household rating, 14 share).
That network had four shows in the Top 10, including the TV film "Beyond the
Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder" and "60 Minutes," which were
top-ranked and runner-up, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC had 10.2 million viewers (6.8 rating, 12 share) and Fox had 8.1 million
viewers (5.1 rating, 9 share).
</P>
<P>
	   UPN had 3.9 million viewers (2.5 rating, 4 share), while the WB had 3.0
million viewers (2.1 rating, 3 share). The Pax network had 1.1 million viewers
(0.8 rating, 1 share).
</P>
<P>
	   For the century's final prime-time race last Friday, NBC came in a distant
second to ABC with "Dateline NBC" and a two-hour news special that averaged 9.6
million viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS's Friday lineup, which included a "Late Show with David Letterman"
special, "Grammy's Greatest Performances" and "America's Millennium" (a live
telecast of the outdoor concert in Washington, D.C.), averaged 7.6 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the evening news derby (measuring Monday through Thursday), ABC's "World
News Tonight" tied for first place with customary frontrunner "NBC Nightly
News." Both had an 8.5 rating and 17 share, with NBC narrowly edging out ABC in
total viewers (12.01 million to 11.98 million). "CBS Evening News" had 9.42
total million viewers (6.9 rating, 13 share).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1 percent of the nation's estimated 100.8 million
TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given
show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Dec. 27-Jan. 2, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were "CBS Sunday Movie: 'Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls
Wilder,"' CBS, 15.3; "60 Minutes," CBS, 14.5; "NFL Monday Night Football: N.Y.
Jets at Miami," ABC, 14.4; "Touched By an Angel," CBS, 14.2; "Rose Bowl
Post-game," ABC, 11.9; "Orange Bowl: Alabama vs. Michigan," ABC, 11.3; "NFL
Monday Showcase," ABC, 10.9; tied: "ABC 2000," ABC, and "Frasier," NBC, both
10.6; "Everybody Loves Raymond," CBS, 10.5.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Practitioners Studied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Patients who have asthma, diabetes or high blood pressure
and receive primary care from nurse practitioners fare just as well as those
treated by doctors, researchers suggested today.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers randomly assigned 1,316 patients to either nurse practitioners
or doctors. After six months, patients in both groups got equal benefit
medically and were just as satisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear whether the findings -- involving mostly poor immigrants --
are representative of the population at large or whether the results would be
the same over longer periods, when more complex medical problems might arise,
said an expert not involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
	   About 65,000 nurse practitioners work in this country. They are registered
nurses with advanced, specialized training.
</P>
<P>
	   They are licensed in every state and can write prescriptions in all 50,
though Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Ohio require a doctor to co-sign the
order. Proponents say their training places greater emphasis on disease
prevention, risk reduction and empowering patients to care for themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study adds strong science to earlier studies that suggest nurse
practitioners are high quality, competent providers of primary care who can
achieve the same health outcomes physicians can," said the lead author, Mary
Mundinger, professor of health policy and dean of the Columbia University School
of Nursing in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   She said more than 100 studies had been conducted over the past 30 years
measuring nurse practitioner competence among patients from all walks of life,
in all parts of the United States and with all age groups, including children.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the context of all those other studies, this strongly suggests that
nurse practitioners with other populations will do just as well," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers found the nurse-practitioner patients fared as well
medically -- measured by breathing capacity in asthmatics, blood-sugar control
in diabetics and blood pressure in people with hypertension -- as the doctors'
patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The two groups also had similar rates of referrals to specialists,
hospitalizations and costs, and they were equally satisfied with caregivers, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
	   "This study is a remarkable accomplishment, the most ambitious and
well-executed comparison of nurse practitioners with physicians," an expert not
involved in the work, Dr. Harold Sox of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in
Lebanon, N.H., said in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sox said the patients were a select population -- they were younger,
mostly female, Spanish-speaking and on Medicaid -- and that a six-month study
may not have been long enough to see the full spectrum of complex medical
problems such patients could face.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants were recruited from Columbia-affiliated emergency rooms in New
York while being treated for problems other than asthma, diabetes or high blood
pressure.

<HEADLINE> Study: New Test May Rival Pap Smear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- A test for the human papilloma virus that doesn't require a
pelvic exam may soon rival the Pap smear as an accurate way of screening for
cancer and precancerous conditions, researchers reported today in the Journal of
the American Association.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the two studies found that the new test produced far more
false-positives than the Pap smear, causing many more women to need further
testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the HPV test's widespread use will ever be feasible, affordable and
effective at reducing cervical cancer deaths remains to be seen, said an expert
who was not involved in the work.
</P>
<P>
	   As a screening technique, the test may be most applicable in developing
countries, where pelvic exams and lab exams of cervical cells are often
unavailable, said the expert, Dr. Jack Cuzick of the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund in London.
</P>
<P>
	   But the lead author of one of the studies said the test's false-positive
rate may be much lower among U.S. women -- and similar to that of the Pap smear
-- because they have much lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases than
African and Central American women studied.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think for women over age 35 to 40, HPV testing will end up, in the near
future, replacing a regular Pap smear," said the author, Dr. Thomas Wright Jr.
of Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
	   The HPV test is now licensed in the United States only as a follow-up to an
abnormal Pap smear. It has not been approved for routine screening, though it is
available for that purpose in other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The test is based on the discovery that the sexually transmitted human
papilloma virus, or HPV, causes almost all cases of cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   HPV infects an estimated 40 million Americans and many more worldwide.
Though most of HPV's 80 strains cause no permanent harm, perhaps 1 percent of
infected people get a strain that can cause cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide, almost 360,000 cases of cervical cancer were detected in 1990,
with 190,000 women dying of the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pap smear, which costs $25 to $35, is the most widely used screening
test. It requires a skilled professional to do a pelvic exam and scrape cells
from a woman's cervix. The cells are then analyzed under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
	   "A single Pap smear misses about 40 percent of cervical disease, which is
why women are told to have yearly Pap smears," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   In HPV testing, which costs $45 to $60, women themselves can collect a
sample of cervical tissue at a clinic or doctor's office using a small brush or
cotton swab. The tissue is then analyzed for DNA from 13 types of HPV considered
to be the main culprits in cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright's team and colleagues from AVSC International and the University of
Cape Town screened and followed 1,365 black South African women ages 35 to 65.
The researchers found that the HPV test identified 37 of 56 women with
high-grade cervical disease or cancer, for a detection rate of 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pap smear identified 38 of the 56 women, a rate of 68 percent. But the
false-positive rate for the self-collected HPV test was 17 percent, vs. only 12
percent for the Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
	   In the other study, led by Dr. Mark Schiffman of the National Cancer
Institute, researchers screened 8,554 women in Costa Rica ages 18 years and
older. A total of 138 cases of high-grade cervical disease or cancer were found,
with the HPV test detecting 88 percent and the Pap smear 78 percent. But HPV had
almost twice the rate of false-positives, 11 percent, vs. 5.8 percent for Pap
smears.

<HEADLINE> Peru's President May Face Challenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Opposition politicians are trying to woo the former First
Lady to run on a party ticket challenging her ex-husband, President Alberto
Fujimori, in April's general elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Former First Lady Susana Higuchi hopes to run as a presidential or
vice-presidential candidate for the Independent Moralizing Front, according to
her attorney, Alberto Bautista.
</P>
<P>
	   A final decision will be announced Thursday on whether she will head a
ticket or join the party's vice-presidential or Congressional slates, Bautista
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have had meetings and continue talks with her to see whether she will
participate with us in the upcoming elections,'' said Ernesto Gamarra, a
legislator with the party, which asserts an anti-corruption, pro-human rights
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori said Tuesday he had no problem with his ex-wife's possible
candidacy, and that Peru's democracy guarantees the right of qualified people to
seek public office.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's marital problems became public in 1994, after Fujimori's
supporters in Congress approved a law preventing his wife from running for
president or Congress in the 1995 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   When Higuchi accused Fujimori of tolerating widespread corruption in his
government and ignoring the needs of Peru's poor, he locked her out of the
palace and soon after filed for divorce. The divorce came through in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori, who is coasting ahead of rival candidates in opinion polls,
announced last week that he would run for an unprecedented third five-year term.
Whether his ex-wife's candidacy could pose a serious challenge is unknown.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat at US Army Unit a Hoax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Thousands of South Koreans had to be evacuated
from their villages Wednesday after it was reported a bomb had been planted at a
nearby U.S. military base. The report later turned out to be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities searched Camp Edwards after a former U.S. army soldier under
arrest in the United States claimed a bomb had been planted there, said Lee
Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military command in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferguson would not disclose the soldier's name nor his alleged crime. He had
served at Camp Edwards for two years until the end of 1998, the national Yonhap
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   As the search went on overnight, nearly 1,000 South Korean residents were
evacuated in darkness early Wednesday from the nearby village of Paju, 38 miles
northeast of Seoul near the North Korean border.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities later ordered 2,200 more residents to leave, and suspended train
and bus service to the town. Some 130 U.S. army soldiers at the camp were also
evacuated for the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday morning, the evacuation order was called off, as were the train
and bus suspensions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been notified that the bomb threat was false,'' said Cho Jong-hwa, a
local official in Paju. Cho said the notification came from South Korean law
enforcement authorities who were in close contact with the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Camp Edwards, which belongs to the 2nd U.S. Infantry Division, is located
close to the border with communist North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   About 37,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea under a defense
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Limited Rain, Snow Tough on Cattle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- Ranchers throughout the West are putting out feed, hauling
water and moving cattle to feedlots to cope with what is shaping up as another
warm, dry winter.
</P>
<P>
	   Cattle raisers say the current weather shouldn't immediately harm cattle,
especially since summer rains in some areas produced ample feed. But there could
be trouble come spring.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's scary is if we don't get a lot of winter moisture, the spring feed
will be very limited because the fall has been so dry," said Arizona rancher
Judy Prosser.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosser has moved 900 cattle from her property between Flagstaff and
Winslow, Ariz., to a feedlot in Phoenix to rest the land.
</P>
<P>
	   Rainfall has been sparse in many parts of the West, with near-record dryness
in southern New Mexico and parts of Montana.
</P>
<P>
	   Jupe Means, a rancher near Mule Creek, N.M., called the spring and summer
one of the worst droughts he has seen.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, all but two of 17 areas tracked by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture had below-average precipitation in 1999. Most of Arizona's rain came
in the summer, with next to none coming in the last 3 months, ranchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbara Marks, who ranches about 25 miles south of Alpine, Ariz., said the
area has received some snow in the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every little bit counts. But we had not had any measurable moisture since
September," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marks said she and her family are making sure stock tanks and springs are
kept filled. They also purchased additional hay and vitamin-rich food
supplements in case grazing lands aren't sufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as far north as Wyoming, lack of rainfall is a concern.
</P>
<P>
	   "Water is a huge issue," said Dick Loper, a rangeland consultant for the
Wyoming State Grazing Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Normally, ranchers can rely on snow to provide water for livestock, he said.
He added that ranchers will likely be hauling a lot more this year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   BARRYTON, Mich. (AP) -- For a couple from Mecosta County, Mich., living next
to a factory-style hog farm has been a real stinker.
</P>
<P>
	   For Lester and Linda Cramer, the arrival of the High Lean Pork company in
1997 marked the end of a pleasant home.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the smell is bad, you don't go outside," Linda said. "The smell takes
your breath away."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cramers and four of their neighbors had the property taxes on their
homes reduced 35 percent last month by the Michigan Tax Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   They will appeal to extend the property-tax reduction to include their land
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The concern by neighbors is equal to that of environmental groups, who see
the possibility of harm to the land, air, and most importantly, the water.
</P>
<P>
	   With about 2,500 hogs on the farm, the amount of waste can make hot, summer
days unbearable outdoors. The waste is stored in lagoons, before being sprayed
upon the surrounding fields.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis McNeilly sold some of his property to the company and is still a
neighbor to the plant. He said he can see the operation from his house.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he smells the waste from the hog farm about three or four times a
year. He has 250 head of cattle on his dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have odors," McNeilly said. "We just have to live with it."

<HEADLINE> Humans Smuggled in Cargo Containers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More and more Chinese immigrants are trying to smuggle
themselves into the country by crossing the Pacific packed in cargo containers
aboard ships, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last week, several of the 40-foot-long, canvas-topped metal
containers have been found and more than 60 suspected aliens captured.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen people were taken into custody Tuesday after they fled from a
shipping container aboard a ship at the Port of Seattle, authorities said. A day
earlier, 25 stowaways were found inside two containers on the California
Jupiter, bound for Seattle from Canada. It remained docked in Vancouver on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to be a troubling new trend,'' said Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service Western Region in Laguna Niguel.
``We're concerned that this may increase.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another INS spokeswoman, Virginia Kice, said: ``Some of these ships have
over 1,000 containers. It is, in a sense, like looking for a needle in a
haystack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal agencies formed a working group to investigate. So far, it is
unclear if the same group of smugglers is responsible, Ms. Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
	   For at least a decade, Chinese lured by dreams of financial or political
freedom have sought to enter the United States illegally. The INS estimates as
many as 27,000 illegal Chinese were in the United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement success in stopping smuggling boats apparently has sparked
the container trend, Ms. Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smugglers charge as much as $60,000 per person for container space, about
twice the fee charged those who come on smuggling boats, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
	   Rusty fishing boats and freighters have carried hundreds to America.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, about 700 Chinese citizens were arrested after arriving on boats in
the San Francisco area, including 200 who were dumped from a freighter near the
Golden Gate Bridge. That same year, 10 immigrants died when they jumped from a
freighter that ran aground near New York City. About 300 immigrants were on
board. More recently, boats have been stopped near Guam and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Doors May Be Closing on Nominations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan, a Republican, may find a confirmation
express waiting for him when his nomination to a fourth term as Fed chairman
reaches the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   But dozens of other less popular nominations, including many
long-languishing judicial ones, may end up stranded in the station.
</P>
<P>
	   Many lawyers and lower-court jurists who thought they would be federal
judges by now are cooling their heels.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Paez, a Mexican-American federal judge in Los Angeles, has been
waiting for four years for a vote on his nomination to the federal appeals
bench. Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco labor lawyer, has been waiting two years
to become a federal appeals judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate leaders have promised votes on Paez and Berzon by March 15. But there
are no such agreements on any of the other administration nominees languishing
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Career diplomat Peter Burleigh, promised the ambassadorship to the
Philippines by President Clinton after his widely praised service last year as
acting U.N. ambassador during the Kosovo crisis, is back in Washington,
officially "on leave," awaiting a confirmation vote that may never come.
</P>
<P>
	   His nomination is hung up in an unrelated dispute over the State
Department's treatment of a whistleblower.
</P>
<P>
	   Nominees for other top State Department posts and other federal agencies
remain in limbo.
</P>
<P>
	   With Clinton's term nearing an end, Senate Republicans hopeful of
recapturing the White House have little motivation to move on any nominations --
especially ones that may be controversial or judicial ones involving lifetime
posts. After all, in less than a year Americans will select a new president --
so what's the rush?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats are howling. But they did approximately the same thing when they
controlled Congress and Ronald Reagan's term was winding down in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's too much of it played by both parties," said Sen. Byron Dorgan,
D-S.D. "It's hard enough to get good people to put themselves through the meat
grinder that the Senate confirmation process has become."
</P>
<P>
	   The traditional reluctance to move on nominations in the final year of an
opposition-party president's term is aggravated by a growing tendency of
individual senators to put "holds" on nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   By custom, any senator can block any nomination -- at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., has served notice he will use parliamentary
procedures to try to block all remaining Clinton judicial nominations. He claims
Clinton violated a promise to the Senate not to make certain "recess"
appointments without prior consultation with senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, calls Inhofe's threat "reckless and disproportionate."
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's Web site, updated earlier this week, lists 73 openings in
the federal judiciary -- 48 district court and 24 court of appeals vacancies.
Clinton has 35 nominations pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "You cannot fight crime without trials and judges," Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, cites "substantial progress
in maintaining a low vacancy rate in federal judgeships," Chief Justice William
Rehnquist has complained of severe backlogs in the federal court system.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 33 new judges were confirmed, down from 65 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Confirmations are "always a problem in the final year of a president's
tenure," said Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Ornstein added, "There's no question it's gotten worse. Some nominees who
were put forward three and four years ago are twisting in the wind. And there
are people like Inhofe who abuse the process by keeping all kinds of individuals
hostage."
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe is protesting Clinton's appointment last month during the Senate
recess of Sara M. Fox, a former union lawyer, to another five-year-term as a
member of the National Labor Relations Board. With the recess appointment, she
can serve without Senate confirmation until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Her name was not on a White House list of potential recess appointments,
Inhofe fumed. But the White House claims it cleared the nomination with Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott spokesman John Czwartacki confirmed that the White House "did inform us
at some point prior to the recess" of Clinton's intention. But that doesn't
prevent Inhofe and other conservatives from using their senatorial prerogatives
to mount delaying tactics, Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats might be lamenting that less-popular nominations can't be attached
to more popular ones like amendments on bills -- so they could load them all on
the shoulders of Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, "We're used to battles around here," White House spokesman
Jake Siewert said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Shipyard Killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Police on Tuesday arrested a 30-year-old man as part of their
investigation into the slayings of two men and the wounding of two others at a
shipyard.
</P>
<P>
	   The man, who was not identified, was ``a person of interest very early on in
the investigation,'' police Capt. John Diaz said. The man was being questioned
and held for investigation of homicide and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Diaz would not comment on a specific motive, but said it was ``a workplace
violence issue ... He was tied in to the shipyard.''
</P>
<P>
	   Diaz refused to discuss the man's links to the Northlake Shipyard, a boat
repair business.
</P>
<P>
	   Marine engineer Russell James Brisendine, 43, and bookkeeper Peter Giles,
26, were killed in the Nov. 3 attack by a man wearing a coat over camouflage.
They were slain with a semiautomatic handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said the killings were deliberate but the motive remained a
mystery. An apparent break in the case came Sunday, when a handgun and
camouflage jacket were found in a park a few blocks from the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
	   Diaz refused to discuss details about the gun, saying tests were still being
done. He did not rule out other arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   The park was searched immediately after the shootings. Diaz speculated the
gun and other items weren't found because there would have been more foliage in
early November.

<HEADLINE> Peter Warrick Shines in Sugar Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There was no catching Peter Warrick this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Determined to leave a lasting impression at Florida State -- and not one
involving his Dillard's shopping scam -- Warrick turned college football's
national title game into his own personal highlight film Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick set a Sugar Bowl record with 20 points, catching touchdown passes of
64 and 43 yards, scoring on a 59-yard punt return and adding a 2-point
conversion grab in leading the Seminoles over Virginia Tech 46-29.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the national championship. No one can ever take this away from me,"
Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Showing why he might be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, Warrick wound up
with six receptions for 163 yards. He earned the most outstanding player award,
along with a sideline handshake from Minnesota Vikings star Randy Moss and a
serenade from Florida State fans in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't really focused on last year, because that's all behind me,"
Warrick said. "I thought all night about what kind of game I was going to have,
and hoped I would have the game of my life. I was just trying to do what I've
done all season -- that's make plays."
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick had waited his whole career for a game like this, having returned
for his senior season wishing for this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came back for two reasons: to graduate and to win the national
championship," he said. "I accomplished both of those goals."
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick did more than win his one-man duel with scrambling Hokies
quarterback Michael Vick. He helped deliver college football's ultimate prize to
the top-ranked Seminoles, three months after his misstep cost him a chance to
win the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The big-time players show up in the big-time games," teammate Corey Simon
said, "and he showed once again he's a big-time player."
</P>
<P>
	   The victory brought 70-year-old coach Bobby Bowden his first perfect season
and second title.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach Bowden is a great man. I came back because of the love of him. I won
this game for him tonight," Warrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Bowden: "I told Pete, 'You've got to counter Vick's big plays.' It was
a team win tonight, but I don't know if we could've done it without him."
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly, Warrick savored the moment.
</P>
<P>
	   A virtual no-show in the Seminoles' championship bowl losses in the 1998 and
1996 seasons, Warrick strutted onto the field during pregame introductions and
then backed up his swagger.
</P>
<P>
	   He sped past single coverage to catch Chris Weinke's pass in full stride for
a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter. Early in the second period, he fielded a
punt on one bounce and streaked into the end zone for a 28-7 edge
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick held off an interfering defender for a juggling, 43-yard TD catch
with 7:42 left that closed out the No. 2 Hokies, and celebrated in style. He
took off his helmet, bumped chests with several teammates and paraded up the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right before that play, I asked our offense, 'You want me to finish them
off?' " Warrick said. "And I did."
</P>
<P>
	   Praised Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer: "What a performance by that guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick had achieved one goal last month when he received his degree in
political science. But he wanted to put behind him something else -- his arrest
this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick and teammate Laveranues Coles were arrested on a charge of felony
grand theft for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a department
store in Tallahassee. Warrick was suspended two games and reinstated after he
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, which required that he spend 30 hours in a work
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, in what many regarded as a highly inappropriate comment, he said:
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like I killed the president."
</P>
<P>
	   Some fans may have thought of that incident when they thought of Warrick.
Until Tuesday night, that is.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been through a lot of adversity this season," he said. "Everybody
makes mistakes. It takes a real man to admit it and bounce back."

<HEADLINE> A Title, More Gray Hair for Bowden  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There are very few things left in life that will turn
Bobby Bowden's hair grayer than it already is. Michael Vick did.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State 46, Virginia Tech 29 will be remembered for a long time, for
all kinds of reasons. For delivering the kind of jolt few games that are hyped
this much ever provide. For giving the Seminoles a second national championship
season and their 70-year-old coach his first perfect one. For providing Florida
State's Peter Warrick a spotlight that had nothing to with mug shots and a
chance to display talent that had nothing to do with deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
	   But it may one day be remembered best for something else: the coming-out
party for the next great quarterback, and a worthy successor to Warrick as
college football's most electrifying performer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew he was good," Bowden said, referring to Vick. "But I didn't know he
was that good."
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Tuesday night had rolled into Wednesday morning, Vick had joined
the mutual admiration society.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's one of the finest coaches in the nation," Vick said, "next to coach
Beamer. I think he has a lot of respect for me, too. I know his players do."
</P>
<P>
	   And well they should.

<HEADLINE> Packers May Interview Barry Alvarez  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers are seeking permission to
interview Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez for their coaching job, the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel reported.
</P>
<P>
	   A Packers official left a phone message with Wisconsin athletic director Pat
Richter on Tuesday that indicated the NFL team would like to interview Alvarez,
the newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expect they will be asking (for permission)," Richter told the newspaper.
"They don't have to. ... We're not going to tell him he can't. We're not going
to stand in his way."
</P>
<P>
	   Alvarez was in California on a recruiting trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin became the first Big Ten team to win consecutive Rose Bowls by
beating Stanford 17-9 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Packers general manager Ron Wolf fired first-year coach Ray Rhodes and his
staff Sunday, hours after Green Bay (8-8) missed the playoffs for the first time
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf said his search for a new coach would be "a lengthy process," though he
said the same thing last January before hiring Rhodes five days later.

<HEADLINE> Gene in Women May Have Cancer Link  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene linked to abnormal cell growth in the lung is more
active in women than in men, a discovery that may explain why female smokers are
more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer as males who smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute,
researchers say a gene found on the X chromosome and linked to lung cell growth
is turned on by cigarette smoke and is more active in women than in men.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women are more likely to develop lung cancer after less smoking exposure
than are men," said Sharon P. Shriver, a Pennsylvania State University biologist
and first author of the study. "Also a nonsmoker who develops lung cancer is
three times more likely to be female than male. Our study may provide an
explanation for this."
</P>
<P>
	   The study showed that the action of a specific gene increased lung cancer
risk in both female and male smokers, but the risk was 12 times higher for
female smokers with the active gene and only 2.4 times higher for male smokers
who had the active gene, said Shriver.
</P>
<P>
	   Many studies have shown that both smoking and nonsmoking women are at much
higher risk of developing lung cancer than are their male counterparts, and some
studies have found the risks up to 2.3 times higher for women, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The genetic study suggests a biological reason for this difference, Shriver
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Curtis C. Harris of the National Cancer Institute said the study "adds
evidence that women are more sensitive to tobacco-induced lung cancer." It
supports the conclusion of an earlier NCI study by Harris and others that a
genetic difference in the lungs of women may contribute to the greater lung
cancer risk among women, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the new study, researchers did a genetic study of lung specimens taken
from 38 women and 40 men, both smokers and nonsmokers. Fifty-eight were lung
cancer patients. The rest were undergoing lung surgery for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers tested the lung tissue for activity by a gene called
gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, or GRPR. The gene prompts cells to link up
with the GRP hormone. This linkage, in turn, causes abnormal cell growth that
can lead to lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The GRPR gene was found to be active in 55 percent of the nonsmoking women
and about 75 percent of the smoking women, even if they had been using
cigarettes for less than 25 pack years. (A pack year is smoking 20 cigarettes a
day for one year.)
</P>
<P>
	   Among male nonsmokers, the gene was not active at all, the researchers
found. The gene was active in only 20 percent of the male smokers with 25 or
fewer pack years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Men have to smoke for this gene to kick in," said Jill M. Siegfried, a
University of Pittsburgh researcher who was a co-author of the study. "But women
don't have to smoke at all for the gene to be active. This may be why nonsmoking
women are more susceptible to lung cancer."
</P>
<P>
	   The GRPR gene plays a key role in the development of the lungs and the
bronchial tree, but the gene usually is inactive in adults, Siegfried said. It
becomes active only in the presence of tobacco smoke or some other respiratory
insult, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The gene is on the X chromosome. Women have two of these chromosomes, while
men have one.
</P>
<P>
	   Most genes on one of the X chromosomes in women are inactivated, said
Siegfried, but for some reason the GRPR gene can remain active on both X
chromosomes in women.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think that is the most likely explanation of why we see more frequent
expression of the gene in females compared to males," said Siegfried.
</P>
<P>
	   The important message from the study, said the researchers, is that women
are much more susceptible to lung cancer from cigarette smoke and that women
will develop the disease with a lesser amount of smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   "The take-home message, especially for teen-age girls, is that they should
stop smoking, or, better yet, never start," said Shriver.

<HEADLINE> Jail guard accused in fatal beating of inmate pleads guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - A Nassau County Jail guard has pleaded guilty to
federal conspiracy and witness tampering charges, clearing the way for him to
testify against three fellow guards accused in the fatal beating of an inmate.
<P>
	   Ivano Bavaro, who had previously maintained his innocence, entered the
surprise guilty plea Tuesday morning before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob
Mishler.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know exactly what he has said, so I don't know if it's the truth or
if he's merely changing the story around to protect himself from trial," said
Dennis Lemke, an attorney representing guard Edward Velazquez.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have alleged Bavaro acted as a lookout while Velazquez and
another guard, Patrick Regnier, went into Thomas Pizzuto's cell on Jan. 8, 1999,
and beat the recovering heroin addict as he cried out for his methadone
treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 38-year-old prisoner from Hicksville, who had been serving a 90-day
sentence for traffic violations, suffered a seizure three days after the alleged
beating and died. The Nassau County medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, was accused of filing a false report
indicating that Pizzuto had slipped in the shower. Jury selection is to begin
Monday in the trial against Regnier, Velazquez and Bergen.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaro's expected testimony in that trial could affect the length of his
prison sentence, which could be up to 10 years. Sentencing was scheduled for
March 31. His attorney, Edward Jenks, did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Meadow jail, which houses about 1,800 inmates and is patrolled by
approximately 1,100 guards, has been the subject of numerous allegations of
guard misconduct. Following the death of Pizzuto and other allegations of abuse,
the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of how inmates are
treated.
</P>
<P>
	   All four guards were suspended without pay following their arrests last May.
Bavaro is now expected to be fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting Sheriff Peter R. Heelan, who oversees operations at the jail, said
his department has cooperated with investigators and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are committed to discovering the truth surrounding the death of Mr.
Pizzuto and will reserve final judgment until all of the evidence has been
presented," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Gullo, who is Bergen's attorney, maintained his client's innocence and
said Bergen wasn't at the jail at the time of the alleged attack. He added he
was unaware of any conversations between Bergen and Bavaro that would indicate a
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernest Peace, who represents Regnier, was out of town and unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very, very pleased that the federal prosecutors have handled this
case as aggressively and professionally as they have," said Peter Neufeld, an
attorney representing the Pizzuto family. "We believe that ultimately justice
will prevail and the people responsible for Tommy's death will be convicted and
sentenced appropriately."
</P>
<P>
	   Neufeld has filed notice of an impending civil suit against the jail on
behalf of the Pizzutos, but said Tuesday he would await the outcome of the
criminal trial before proceeding.

<P>
	   Florida State is the perfect national champion.
</P>
<P>
	   Led by the sizzling Peter Warrick and the steady Chris Weinke, the Seminoles
held off Virginia Tech for a 46-29 victory Tuesday night in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies' freshman quarterback, Michael Vick, played an electrifying game
of catch-me-if-you-can, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick thrilled a Superdome crowd with a record 20-point game. He caught
touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards, returned a punt 59 yards for a score and
snagged a 2-point conversion pass from Weinke.
</P>
<P>
	   The 27-year-old Weinke, playing perhaps the final game of his college
career, completed 20 of 34 passes for 329 yards and four TDs -- two to Warrick
and two to Ron Dugans. Warrick finished with six catches for 163 yards in the
highest-scoring Sugar Bowl in history.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the national championship. No one can ever take this away from me,"
said Warrick, who was voted the game's most outstanding player.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick threw for 225 yards and one TD and ran for 97 yards and a score.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State (12-0) was certain to become the first team to go wire-to-wire
in The Associated Press' poll since the preseason ratings began in 1950. The
final AP poll will be released early Wednesday to confirm the obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles were automatically crowned national champs in the USA
Today-ESPN coaches' poll under the Bowl Championship Series format.
</P>
<P>
	   All week, Warrick and his senior pals promised each other they would do
everything possible to avoid losing three title games. They did -- in a big way
-- and Bobby Bowden completed a remarkable year. He won his 300th game in the
first father vs. son coaching matchup, celebrated his 70th birthday and 50th
wedding anniversary and finally attained his first perfect season in 40 years as
a coach.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a load off your shoulder to win this one," Bowden said. "This one I
can enjoy. I already had a ring. These guys didn't have a ring. Now they do."
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick, the All-American wide receiver who lost his chance at the Heisman
Trophy after a two-game suspension for his role in a shopping mall scam, came up
with his best performance in the final game of his college career.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to go out and let me have best game of my life," Warrick said. "It's
great to be here and I'm just happy to be here."
</P>
<P>
	   In the first half, Warrick caught three passes for 100 yards and his punt
return helped the Seminoles build a 28-14 lead after 30 minutes of big plays.
Last season, he was held to one catch for 7 yards in a Fiesta Bowl loss to
Tennessee in the national title game. In fact, in three previous bowl games,
Warrick totaled five catches and no TDs.
</P>
<P>
	   He opened the scoring with his 64-yard grab, then took a punt and blazed
past Tech defenders for a 59-yard score and a 28-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Late in the game, with half the crowd of 79,280 chanting "Peter Warrick,
Peter Warrick," Weinke reared back and threw a 43-yard TD pass to the wide
receiver, who caught the ball while diving into the end zone with a Virginia
Tech defender draped over him. The chants rang out again and Warrick ran to the
sideline to celebrate with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made a great comeback in the second half, but they came back, too, and
you have to give them credit," Tech coach Frank Beamer said a few minutes after
taking a telephone call from President Clinton. "They keep popping at you and
that Warrick, he had a great night. What a performance."
</P>
<P>
	   The win over the upstart Hokies (11-1) stamped the Seminoles as the Team of
the Decade and ended a run of national title misses under Bowden. Since winning
its first national crown in 1993, Florida State had lost two of the past three
title games -- 23-16 to Tennessee last season, and 52-20 to Florida in '97 in
what until Tuesday night was the highest-scoring Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss ended Virginia Tech's dream season and a bid for its first national
title in 107 years of playing football.
</P>
<P>
	   Vick was valiant in defeat. The 19-year-old left-hander overcame a lost
fumble near the Seminoles goal line on the game's opening drive and led the
Hokies back from a 21-point deficit to a 29-28 lead with 2:13 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "They know how to come back, too," Vick said. "They are the No. 1 team in
the nation."
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State regrouped and regained the lead as Weinke hit Dugans on a
15-yard score with 12:59 left in the game. Warrick caught a 2-point conversion
pass from Weinke and the 'Noles were back in the lead, 36-29.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida State got the ball back when linebacker Bobby Rhodes' helmet knocked
the ball from Vick's grasp and safety Sean Key recovered at the Hokies 34. The
turnover set up Sebastian Janikowski's 32-yard field goal with 10:26 that put
the Seminoles ahead 39-29.
</P>
<P>
	   And then came Warrick's best catch of all to seal the title. After stopping
Tech on fourth down, Florida State took over at the Tech 43 and Weinke found
Warrick, who held onto the ball with cornerback Roynell Whitaker hanging over
him.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is something I was waiting for," said Weinke, who missed last year's
title game with a neck injury. "I rehabbed for eight months for this one. We
said last year we could go wire-to-wire and when we went down in the third
quarter, we responded. And that's what it's all about, why we won the national
championship."
</P>
<P>
	   Down 28-14 at the half, Virginia Tech seized the momentum. Vick threw a
26-yard completion to set up Shayne Graham's 23-yard field goal to make it
28-17.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies defense came alive and forced a punt, which was returned 46 yards
to the Seminoles 36 by Ike Carlton, the cornerback subbing for injured Ricky
Hall. Three plays later, Andre Kendrick raced 29 yards for a touchdown to pull
the Hokies within 28-23. Kendrick stepped in for Shyrone Stith, Tech's
1,000-yard rusher who missed the second half with a sprained left ankle. Vick's
2-point conversion pass attempt was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   Cornerback Anthony Midget then intercepted a long pass intended for Warrick,
and Kendrick scored from 6 yards out and the Hokies were ahead for the first and
only time.
</P>
<P>
	   While Virginia Tech may be the undisputed champion on special teams -- 63 in
the 1990s -- it was Florida State that excelled in that department, too.
Sixty-eight seconds after Warrick's first score, it was 14-0 after linebacker
Tommy Polley blocked a punt by Tech's John Kibble. Jeff Chaney scooped it up and
went 6 yards for a touchdown with 2:14 left in the first quarter. It was the
first time in Kibble's career he had a punt blocked.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seminoles were not so perfect off the field. At least five players were
suspended or kicked off the team for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrick and Laveranues Coles were arrested Oct. 7 on a charge of felony
grand theft for paying $21.40 for $412.38 worth of clothing at a Dillard's
department store in Tallahassee. Warrick was suspended two games and reinstated
after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, which required that he spend 30 hours
in a work program.

<HEADLINE> First lady to join her belongings today in Westchester  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton is set to unpack today,
and then spend her first night at her new home in Westchester.
<P>
	   The moving-in process, which makes Mrs. Clinton eligible to run for the U.S.
Senate, began Tuesday when two 26-foot moving vans lumbered up the cul-de-sac in
Chappaqua where the first lady and President Clinton have bought a $1.7 million
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Two old friends were on hand to direct things and Mrs. Clinton is due late
today, said Karen Finney, a spokeswoman for the first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hillary is very excited about this," Finney said. Mrs. Clinton hopes to be
"fully moved in" by the end of next week, in time for a visit from the
president, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually, when someone moves into a new house, neighbors and passersby get to
see some of what's being unloaded - the tacky floor lamps, the shag rug, the
recliner with the cigarette burns in the upholstery.
</P>
<P>
	   There was none of that Tuesday at the Westchester White House. The two
white-and-yellow vans managed to groan up the gravel driveway and around to the
back yard, hidden from a knot of reporters on the street.
</P>
<P>
	   Only when workmen were sighted on a distant porch, wrestling a mattress into
the house, were any belongings on view. Finney said kitchen chairs, rolled-up
rugs and ordinary cardboard boxes were also unloaded.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has said she plans to cut back on first lady duties and spend
most of her time in New York this year. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
her expected Republican opponent for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   The white, three-story wood frame house, built in 1889, features a swimming
pool, five bedrooms, four bathrooms and two fireplaces. The top floor contains
an exercise room.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons, who were criticized when a prominent Democratic fund-raiser
offered help in buying the house, took out a $1.36 million, 30-year adjustable
rate mortgage.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the items on the trucks came out of storage in the Washington
suburbs, though an item or two may have been pulled from the White House, Finney
said. Disappointing the Republican State Committee, which questioned who was
paying for the move, Finney said the Clintons themselves footed the bill.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: Dad May Retrieve Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's government will not stop the father of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez from retrieving his son in Miami if he wants to, says Fidel
Castro's point man on U.S. affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   But Juan Miguel Gonzalez shouldn't go unless U.S. officials agree ahead of
time to let the boy return to Cuba, said Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a free man,'' Alarcon told reporters after meeting Tuesday with the
Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the National Council of Churches leader who came here
in hopes of helping reunite father and son.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He should do whatever he wants. And we will help him. But if I were him I
would ask, for what reason: to finally return the boy, or to delay and delay''
the case even longer.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official said Tuesday that the Clinton administration had asked Cuba
to let Gonzalez escort the boy back to the island if U.S. officials decide the
boy should return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has not commented publicly on the newest report from Washington,
but earlier said that he did not think he should have to go the United States to
pick up his boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said the request was a
contingency plan and does not signal a decision by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to send Elian back to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was retrieved from an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25.
He had been aboard a Florida-bound boat that capsized, killing 10 other
passengers, including his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   A tug of war ensued, with his father demanding his return and his relatives
in Florida insisting he would have a better life in the United States. U.S.
officials paroled the boy to the temporary care of his great-uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service set a Jan. 21 hearing on the
case, but American officials have said a decision could be reached beforehand.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said a decision by the father to
apply for a nonimmigrant visa would be welcome. But for Gonzalez to make the
trip, he also would need travel documents from the Cuban government, Rubin
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The speculation both here and in the United States has been that Havana is
worried that if Gonzalez goes to retrieve his child he may never return.
</P>
<P>
	   If he stayed, however, he could risk permanent separation from his current
wife, his 4-month-old son, and his parents in Cuba. And after weeks of protests
by hundreds of thousands of people demanding his son's return, Gonzalez, a
member of the Communist Party, has repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the
Cuban government and people.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet another gathering in support of Elian's return was held on Tuesday, this
time by Cuba's leading artists, writers, musicians and other cultural figures.
President Castro showed up at the gathering at the Palace of Conventions in
Havana -- his first presence thus far at a pro-Elian rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell, the church council's outgoing secretary-general, met briefly with
Castro on Monday. The council is the United States' largest ecumenical
organization, representing 35 Protestant and Orthodox denominations comprising
52 million congregants.
</P>
<P>
	   After spending most of Monday with Gonzalez and Elian's four grandparents
and a great-grandmother, Campbell was convinced that the boy should be with
them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The human emotion in this family is very real and very powerful,'' said
Campbell, a Baptist minister. ``We believe that this family has both the
emotional strength and economic resources to raise this child.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renominates Greenspan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prospect of Alan Greenspan at the helm of the Federal
Reserve for another four years is winning rave notices on Capitol Hill and Main
Street, even if the announcement didn't immediately cheer Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate predicted Greenspan would win
confirmation easily to a fourth term. President Clinton announced in a brief
Oval Office ceremony Tuesday that he would nominate the 73-year-old Republican
as Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Even those in the business community who have taken issue in the past with
Greenspan's decisions to boost interest rates praised Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a basic rule in business -- don't mess with success," said Jerry
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Jasinowski said he hoped Greenspan would reconsider the need to raise
interest rates when the Federal Reserve next meets to set interest rate policies
on Feb. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of further Fed rate increases were blamed in part for a huge selloff
on Wall Street on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 359.58
points, its fourth biggest point decline ever, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index suffered its worst point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
	   While Greenspan is held in high regard on Wall Street, analysts said
investors' happiness with the prospects of another Greenspan term was outweighed
by growing fears of further Fed interest rate increases. The economy is growing
so rapidly that Fed policy-makers are worried about inflation troubles down the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   Some economists even suggested the central bank, which raised rates in three
quarter-percentage-point moves last year, might boost rates by a half-percentage
point at the February meeting since there are few signs that the economy has
been slowed much by the earlier rate increases.
</P>
<P>
	   In accepting Clinton's request to stay on the job another four years,
Greenspan, who stood next to the president during the Oval Office ceremony,
joked that being Fed chairman was "like eating peanuts. You keep doing it, keep
doing it and you never get tired, because the future is always unknowable."
</P>
<P>
	   Praising Greenspan's "rare combination of technical expertise, sophisticated
analysis and old-fashioned common sense," Clinton said, "Clearly, wise
leadership from the Fed has played a very large role in our strong economy."
</P>
<P>
	   The current economic expansion, which began in March 1991, this month will
tie the current record holder, the 1960s expansion that lasted for 106 months
and will surpass that record in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders in the Republican-controlled Senate predicted Greenspan, who was
first tapped for the Fed post by Ronald Reagan in 1987, would have no trouble
winning another term. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm praised
Clinton's choice and said his committee would meet quickly for a confirmation
hearing on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the GOP presidential
nomination, said in a statement that he had "long urged" Clinton to reappoint
Greenspan, while Democratic candidate Bill Bradley said Greenspan had "been good
for the markets and instrumental in helping resolve the Asian financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed has raised interest rates three times since June as the unemployment
rate continued to dip farther, hoping to slow growth enough so that tight labor
markets don't spark inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, economists give Greenspan credit for allowing the unemployment
rate to dip as low as it has -- 4.1 percent currently -- without slamming down
too hard on the Fed's interest rate brakes. Greenspan has argued that
fundamental improvements in productivity have boosted the economy's
non-inflationary speed limit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has been an extremely innovative Fed chairman," said Allen Sinai,
chief economist for Primark Global Economics in New York. "He has shown an
uncanny ability to sniff out major structural changes in the economy that have
made some of the old rules obsolete."

<HEADLINE> Democrats propose earmarking portion of tobacco tax for counties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - County officials want guarantees that their
taxpayers will not face costs of hundreds of millions of dollars due to a new
health insurance program, Democratic state legislators say.
<P>
	   The Democrats proposed a bill Tuesday to earmark a portion of the state's
soon-to-double tax on cigarettes to cover the counties' portion of the new
Family Health Plus program.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Association of Counties estimates that new program, contained in
the Health Care Reform Act 2000 legislation, will cost counties $360 million
between now and 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a mandate they are not ready for or capable of bearing," state Sen.
Neil Breslin, an Albany County Democrat, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Family Health Plus program is part of an effort included in the Health
Care Reform Act 2000 to make health insurance available to up to one million
working New York adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Family Health Plus would be paid for through Medicaid, a program county
taxpayers pay 25 percent of. The legislation proposed Tuesday would direct the
state to earmark about half the money it will raise through the tobacco taxes to
reimburse counties for their share of the Family Health Plus program.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've always believed that is not a cost that should be passed along to the
counties," Assemblyman Ronald Canestrari, an Albany County Democrat, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Breslin said county leaders and taxpayers are "outraged" by the new expense
being laid at their door by the governor and state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno has tried to reassure the counties
that the Legislature will come to their rescue if the cost of Family Health Plus
or other aspects of the $9 billion Health Care Reform Act 2000 become too
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
	   But Albany County Executive Michael Breslin, Neil Breslin's brother, was not
convinced.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have often heard we will be taken care of and we're not," he said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents of the Health Care Reform Act 2000 legislation say it contains
cost benefits to counties of $144 million a year. They also note that counties
are beginning to receive hundreds of millions of dollars as part of their share
of the settlement with tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
	   But Breslin and other state legislators say some counties' finances are
precarious - they cited Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties as examples -
and that strapped officials have already spent this year's tobacco settlement
money to head off deficits, on building projects and for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting March 1, the state's current 56-cents-a-pack tax on a pack of
cigarettes will jump to $1.11 a pack. It is expected to raise another $400
million or so a year annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The original Health Care Reform Act proposal in the Democratic Assembly
contained a provision that the state would cover costs to county taxpayers of
subsidized insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno spokesman John McArdle said he had not seen the Democratic proposal
and could not comment on it. But he said counties "did very well" in the Health
Care Reform Act 2000 law through the continuation of cost containments in the
Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Add that to the tobacco monies, they are getting over $700 million,"
McArdle said. "And they are not paying a nickel this year for anything under the
new plan for the uninsured."
</P>
<P>
	   Neil Breslin said January would be a perfect time to amend the Health Care
Reform Act to get county taxpayers off the hook.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that early in the session is the time to do it because basically we
sit around and do nothing," he said.

No. 1 Florida State Completes Perfect Season

<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Led by the sizzling Peter Warrick and the steady Chris
Weinke, the Florida State Seminoles held off Virginia Tech for a 46-29 victory
Tuesday night in the Sugar Bowl. Warrick thrilled a Superdome crowd with a
record 20-point game -- he caught touchdown passes of 64 and 43 yards, returned
a punt 59 yards for a score and snagged a 2-point conversion pass from Weinke.
The 27-year-old Weinke, playing perhaps the final game of his college career,
completed 20 of 34 passes for 329 yards and four TDs -- two to Warrick and two
to Ron Dugans. Warrick finished with six catches for 163 yards in the
highest-scoring Sugar Bowl in history.

Colombian Refugees Held Hostages

took 37 workers hostage for several hours Tuesday. The protesting refugees
released the captives later in the day following mediation by Colombian Attorney
General Jaime Bernal. But they said they would continue to occupy the

FAA Faulted for Security Lapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration failed to conduct security
checks on dozens of foreigners hired to fix Y2K problems in sensitive computer
systems used for air traffic control, congressional investigators said Tuesday.
The General Accounting Office said it found the FAA had violated its own
security policies by allowing its contractors' foreign employees, who had not
received background checks, to be involved in repairing 15 of 153 critical
computer systems. Citizens of Ukraine, Pakistan, Britain and Ethiopia were given
access without proper checks, as well as 36 Chinese who performed reviews on
eight critical systems.

<HEADLINE> $8 million offered to inmates for 1971 Attica riot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - In the aftermath of the 1971 Attica riot, the
deadliest prison uprising in U.S. history, Saladin Hadid was among hundreds of
inmates forced to run naked through a gantlet of law enforcement officers.
<P>
	   "They lined up with batons, baseball bats and billy clubs," said Hadid, then
a 19-year-old serving time for robbery. "And they beat you to your knees."
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates who claimed they were tortured, beaten and denied medical treatment
in the hours after police launched a bloody assault to recapture Attica
Correctional Facility were offered $8 million in compensation by New York state
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The original class-action lawsuit, filed in 1974 on behalf of some 1,280
inmates, sought $100 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Under orders from Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, state police attacked the
maximum-security prison near Buffalo on Sept. 13, 1971, the fifth day of the
uprising. More than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were fired over six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 32 inmates and 11 correction officers died, most of them killed
during the raid. Hundreds more were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to settle, the state admitted no wrongdoing. It also agreed to
pay the inmates' lawyers up to $4 million in legal fees and costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the Attica inmates are no longer in prison. They or their survivors
must contact plaintiffs' lawyers to be included in the settlement. U.S. District
Judge Michael Telesca will hold hearings in February to give claimants a chance
to object to the terms of the settlement. He said he expects a final deal to be
reached by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no ideal time to solve a case like this ... but I am assured the
time is now," Telesca said. He added that any deal would not determine "who was
right and wrong. I will leave that to history."
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how many people would come forward and claim
compensation. Elizabeth Fink, attorney for lead plaintiff Akil Al-Jundi, who
died in 1997, said she believes several hundred have died.
</P>
<P>
	   "No amount of money will bring back people's legs, no amount of money will
bring back the people who died," Ms. Fink said. "We think it's a respectful
settlement. It serves what we have been fighting for ... to hold law enforcement
accountable."
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement offer "doesn't seem adequate at all," said Hadid, who served
16 years for robbery, burglary and drug-related crimes and has worked at a hotel
since being released in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "Money will never compensate for the things that were done. I would take
whatever is offered but that doesn't mean I have to like it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hadid described the police assault as "totally mind-blowing. It was like
being in a war and being unprepared - bullets were flying over your head,
hitting the ground around your feet."
</P>
<P>
	   Frank "Big Black" Smith, who helped lead the revolt, thanked the judge for
helping resolve the protracted dispute. "God bless you," he said. "I think where
we're at today is where we need to be."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, 66, who served eight years for robbery and was freed in 1973, had
been forced to lie on a table while officers beat and burned him. He was also
ordered to hold a football under his chin and threatened with death if he
allowed it to fall.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, a federal jury awarded $4 million to Smith and $75,000 to David
Brosig, another inmate who was injured. Telesca was brought into the case in
August when an appeals court reversed those verdicts.
</P>
<P>
	   Those involved in the lawsuit who are still incarcerated can have access to
their settlement money, but the state has enacted some controls on how they can
use the money.

<HEADLINE> Bill would require Megan's Law checks for all coaches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Coaches who want to work with young people in New
York should have their names matched against those in the Megan's Law sex
offender registry to prevent abusers from getting close to kids through
athletics, a state senator says.
<P>
	   "Coaches at all levels have the tremendous respect of their players," Sen.
Michael Nozzolio said. "Kids look up to these individuals as role models, as
traditional parent figures, and that relationship of trust is so damaged when
you have a sexual predator entering into the situation."
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio, a Seneca County Republican, said there is "more potential for
damage than ever" by sex abusers because so many more girls are getting the
opportunity to compete in both scholastic and recreational youth sports
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio's bill, which does not yet have a sponsor in the state Assembly,
would apply to all "youth organizations" who offer sports activities for youths
up to age 18. The legislation would require the organizations themselves to
provide the names, addresses and dates of birth of all coaches and other adult
supervisors, plus the $5 it costs to run each name through the sex registry.
</P>
<P>
	   The first draft of the bill would not require public and private school
coaches to be checked, but Nozzolio spokesman Justin McCarthy said Tuesday they
would be added to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   It would become an annual requirement to check coaches' names against the
registry, if the measure becomes law.
</P>
<P>
	   The sex registry is maintained primarily to allow people to check the names
of men and women who move into their neighborhoods to see if they have a history
of criminal sexual activity. The commission of a range of crimes, including
rape, sodomy and sexual abuse, makes offenders subject to being listed on the
sex-crime registry.
</P>
<P>
	   Violations of Nozzolio's initiative could bring fines of up to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio said he thought of requiring criminal background checks of all
coaches, but decided that would be too costly and also create problems in
defining what kinds of criminal activities would exempt a person from serving as
a coach. Some minor offenses not related to sex activities or abuse of children
could probably be tolerated without disqualifying some people from coaching,
according to the state senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the state Congress of Parents &AMP; Teachers, Jane Bernhard,
said Tuesday her group has not taken a position on Nozzolio's bill. However, she
added that "we certainly are concerned about the welfare of all children and we
would take a look at this legislation and consider it."
</P>
<P>
	   Roy O'Neil, executive director of the state Athletic Administrators'
Association, said he will bring up Nozzolio's bill at a meeting of public school
athletic directors in his group this weekend in Binghamton. He said he can
"sympathize" with the desire of Nozzolio and others to check out as carefully as
possible the backgrounds of youth coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   To coach now in public schools in New York, people have to be certified in
first aid, CPR and must also take a course in recognizing when the children in
their charge have been victims of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio said he developed his bill after reading a September article in
Sports Illustrated magazine which detailed instances where coaches sexually
abused athletes under their supervision. The story also noted that more than 10
million children under age 16 play organized sports under the supervision of
about one million adults.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine detailed 30 cases of coaches sexually abusing children under
their care in the 16 months before the story appeared.

<HEADLINE> Boogie Board Creator Innovating  </HEADLINE>
    By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPISTRANO BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Tom Morey made the first Boogie Board in
his garage 30 years ago, starting the body board wave that came crashing down on
Southern California's beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   No longer was the thrill of riding waves just for surfers. Thousands -- from
schoolchildren to grandmothers -- bought the shorter boards and hit the waves.
It was a ride that took Morey from the beach to the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Morey has returned to his roots -- the garage and the ocean -- with a new
board and a new name.
</P>
<P>
	   "At 65, a guy wonders how much time he has left," he says. "I wanted to
separate what I personally do from what has been done in my name for years. ...
I guess you say I've returned to what I know best -- making and riding
surfboards."
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Morey left his consultant job with Wham-O Corp., which owns the
Morey name and its body board products, to return to garage production of
surfboards.
</P>
<P>
	   To separate himself from the past, Morey now goes by the name "Y." When
asked about it, his response is simply: "Why not?"
</P>
<P>
	   He calls his new company Surfboards by Y, and his new stick -- beach lingo
for surfboard -- is the Swizzle. It is a 9-foot longboard made out of
polypropylene, coated with Fiberglas and capped with rubber ends.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bite down on this," he says, pushing down on the sleek white board. "You
can bite down hard on it and it bounces back into its original shape."
</P>
<P>
	   The board looks like a typical surfboard, long and sleek, but there is a
slight indentation or cutout on either side.
</P>
<P>
	   "It swizzles," he says. "It hugs the water ... giving a better ride."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite surfing's young, hip image, little about the sport has changed since
the 1960s. Popular boards have rigid polyurethane cores, making them heavy with
little give. Morey's new boards, which sell for $650 and can only be purchased
online, are light, durable and, he hopes, a little safer.
</P>
<P>
	   "With these rubber ends, if you wipeout and the board shoots up in the air
and comes down point first on your head, hopefully it won't crack your skull,"
he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Surfer's Journal publisher Steve Pezman says the new additions are ahead of
their time.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is in a space station, orbiting the mainstream of the sport," Pezman
says. "But you can't deny what he's done for the industry."
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Detroit and raised in California, Morey is a University of Southern
California graduate with degrees in music and mathematics. He once worked for
Douglas Aircraft as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1960s, he started a company that commercialized the fin system on
surfboards. He launched his first Boogie Board in 1971, and more than 20 million
have been sold since.
</P>
<P>
	   The first Swizzle was created in February after a year of development. Morey
began selling the board to the public in October, mostly by word of mouth. By
December, 50 boards had been sold.
</P>
<P>
	   Morey makes the boards in the home he shares with his wife, Marchia, and
three of his six children. He has six to 12 surfer-types helping him as
part-time employees.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not about money for me," Morey says. "It's about the shape, design and
materials -- and issuing a wake-up call for the surfing industry."
</P>
<P>
	   Alaistair Taylor, 26, a South African who is ranked among the world's top
surfers, says he responded to an e-mail from Morey to test the boards. Now he's
helping Morey build them.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are different from anything that's been done," Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Swizzle's success, Morey plans to launch a new surf competition
this year -- distance riding. The man who created the first surfing competition
with prize money in 1966, says he wants to see the sport return to its pure form
of riding.
</P>
<P>
	   "With today's competitions, the best surfer doesn't necessarily win," he
says. "It's whoever gets the best, big waves. With a distance competition, it
will be about form and control."
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting at Wahoo Fish Taco in Laguna Beach, a surfer hangout a stone's throw
from crashing waves, Morey described his love for the sport in food terms.
</P>
<P>
	   "For me, surfing's been about personal enjoyment," he says. "Surfing for the
flavor ... like how you eat an ice cream deliberately for the pleasure rather
than thrashing through the experience."
</P>
<P>
	   He says he lives by the adage: "Life's a waste of time, and surfing's a
great way to waste it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's in such a hurry, they forget to enjoy life," he says. "Me, I'm
going to enjoy every minute of it."

<HEADLINE> Candidates Run Against Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain is touted in a campaign ad as ``the polar
opposite of Bill Clinton,'' George W. Bush promises voters he'll never embarrass
them as president and Bill Bradley says he would be happy if people vote for him
``because they want a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential candidates, both Republican and Democratic, all are running
against the White House at a time of peace and prosperity -- and Al Gore is
caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor and GOP front-runner, tells voters in stump
speeches that he won't embarrass them if they send him to the White House.
Elizabeth Dole, endorsed Bush on Tuesday, saying that ``trust is the coin of the
realm'' in a democracy and added: ``Lately, that trust has been tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the Arizona senator who is challenging Bush for the GOP nomination,
launched an ad in crucial South Carolina in which Rep. Lindsey Graham, a
Republican leader of the effort to impeach President Clinton, calls McCain ``the
polar opposite'' of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has absolute total character and candor, the missing element during the
Clinton years,'' Graham says.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain admits the ad was intended to tap into so-called Clinton scandal
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, the Democratic challenger to Gore, recently was asked whether
voters should count Clinton's impeachment scandal against his vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do I want people to vote for me because they want a fresh start? Why
not?'' But, Bradley added, he'd rather win votes for his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore alternately has distanced himself from Clinton's controversies, which
include several investigations and the impeachment trial, and has embraced the
financial policies of the administration. He emphasized his role in the nation's
economic success in a recent interview during a campaign trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One issue that is beginning to emerge is who has the experience to keep
our prosperity going,'' Gore said, ticking off the nation's ``higher
productivity, higher investment levels and 20 million new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been a part of the policy-making team that has put this formula in
place,'' he said, noting the key is paying down the debt and keeping interest
rates low. ``I think I can credibly make the case that I have experience the
others haven't earned.''
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore is embracing the administration's performance on the economy
these days, he distanced himself from Washington in the early fall by moving his
campaign headquarters to Nashville, Tenn., and publicly disapproving of the
president's personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These two forces are very much reflected in Gore's own conduct in the
campaign,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
``It's had a lurching feeling -- from 'I'm embarrassed by Clinton' to 'he's the
greatest president since Roosevelt.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press spent the late summer and
early fall conducting a comprehensive poll on voter attitudes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no one issue in this campaign, but there is an issue and the
issue is Bill Clinton,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center,
noting the key question now is what Gore does about it.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey by the Pew Research Center showed that socially conservative
Democrats who said they were tired of the Clinton administration's problems were
split, with just over half supporting Gore and just under half supporting Bush.
Other Democrats supported Gore over Bush by a wide margin, even if they were
weary of administration problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey indicated many voters who traditionally vote Democratic probably
will remain in the fold on Election Day, ``but the question is how many?'' Kohut
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Half of all people surveyed who didn't support Gore said it was because of
his ties to the Clinton administration, while just over a third cited his
personality and leadership ability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton gave us such a terrible time,'' said Bernice Sharpley of Clive,
Iowa, who said she is a Bush supporter. ``It mortified our country and has us
looking for someone like Bush. ... He is a man of leadership, a man of morals.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore backers like Joe Geller of Miami, chairman of the Dade County
Democrats, say the strength of the economy will drown out other concerns about
the Clinton administration in a general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't feel like it would be fair to the vice president to blame him for
the decisions Clinton made,'' said Rick Earwood, a 38-year-old salesman and
father of four from Decatur, Ala. ``I would think that Gore should get some of
the credit for the good things that Clinton has done.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Preparing Report on Migration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations is preparing a new report alerting
Europe that it may need to accept a significant number of migrants over the next
50 years to maintain population levels and the size of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
	   Europe's population is projected to decrease dramatically over the next five
decades -- primarily due to low fertility rates. In Italy, the current
population of 57 million is expected to shrink to 41 million by 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary estimates from the U.N. Population Division indicate that, with
its low fertility rates, Italy will need 300,000 migrants a year between 1995
and 2025 to keep its labor force at the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany, meanwhile, will need 500,000 migrants a year, according to
estimates compiled for the report, which is expected to be released in March.
</P>
<P>
	   While the developing world's population is ever increasing, Germany's
population of 82 million is expected to decrease to 73 million by 2050,
according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Chamie, director of the U.N. Population Division, acknowledges that
the report is likely to fuel an intense debate in Europe, which -- unlike the
United States, Canada and Australia -- has been generally reluctant to accept
waves of migrants to meet its labor needs.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted recent polls in Switzerland, Austria, France and Germany indicating
that many voters share anti-migrant attitudes, while European politicians fear
unemployment and the backlash from labor unions opposed to cheaper migrant
labor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will be a challenge for them,'' Chamie said. ``But they have to start
now. The longer you wait, the more serious the problem is likely to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Chamie is quick to point out that the United Nations isn't recommending that
European countries and Japan, which is also expected to see a population
decrease, use increased migration to fill out thinning populations. The report
is merely intended to highlight the consequences of maintaining current
migration levels because fertility and mortality rates aren't likely to change
dramatically over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We as demographers don't give them prescriptions,'' he said. ``What we
tell them, though, is if you don't have migrants -- and conditions continue with
fertility as it is, and most of their demographers say the same thing -- then be
prepared for smaller, older populations. This is part of our responsibility, to
indicate trends.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report examines the population situation in eight countries: France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Britain and the United States. It
looks at four separate scenarios, including population levels without migration
and what levels of migration would be required to maintain the population at
1995 levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also looks at what level of migration would be required to
maintain the ratio of the working-age population to the retired-age population.
</P>
<P>
	   While difficult to achieve, that scenario is important to consider because
countries will have to weigh how their working-age population is able to care
for retirees, who will need more services such as health care, Chamie said.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently in Europe, there are five working-age people for every person over
65. In 2050, there will be two working-age people for every retired-age person.
</P>
<P>
	   A special U.N. forum on aging populations and living arrangements is
expected at U.N. headquarters beginning Feb. 8.

<HEADLINE> 'People's State of State' anticipates Pataki's annual plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Using folk songs and a takeoff on the TV game show
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire," activists tried to drill home a serious message
before Gov. George Pataki's State of the State address today.
<P>
	   It was a creative way to try to attract attention for issues increasingly
lacking attention by lawmakers and the public, activists for the poor said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eleven years ago, (then-Gov.) Mario Cuomo at least argued whether he was
trying to help the poor. Now you don't even hear the argument," said Mark
Dunlea, executive director of Hunger Action Network of New York State. "I can't
say we're being heard more now than 11 years ago."
</P>
<P>
	   On the side steps of the Capitol during a cold rain Tuesday, a dozen
activists announced mostly to themselves their 11th People's State of the State.
As many as 20,000 unionized state workers plan to protest the governor's speech
from outside the Capitol today.
</P>
<P>
	   The activists for the poor called for Pataki and the state Legislature to
share the prosperity of an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   Specific measures sought by the statewide coalition of activist groups
included raising the minimum wage to $7.65 an hour and adopting a "living wage
policy" that would regularly increase the pay scale. They also called for
savings from welfare reform to further fund the Empire State Jobs Program to
create transitional jobs for welfare recipients seeking to leave or being
dropped from public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Legislature approved increasing the state's minimum wage
from $4.25 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour starting April
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "People receiving public assistance have not had an increase in their
benefits in 10 years," said Don Friedman of the Community Food Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "In that time, the value of the grant has decreased by about 25 percent," he
said. "The current level makes the meeting of the most basic human needs a
day-to-day struggle."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think if you ask people out on the street if there should be better
education, decent housing, decent jobs - all would agree," said Joe Seeman of
the Alliance for Democracy. "But you've got an entrenched system that's like the
Soviet Union."
</P>
<P>
	   He said groups like his must target individual races in the state
Legislature to change the face of power inside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunlea noted that recent weeks showed a glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, lawmakers passed a $9 billion health care reform act to provide

<HEADLINE> Bush May Be Victim of Own Success  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush may be a victim of his own success.
</P>
<P>
	   He leads in Iowa polls and is piling up endorsements during a two-day swing
that ends today, yet supporters fear the Texas governor can't live up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The concern is magnified by whispers that his grassroots organizers -- so
vital in this caucus state -- are a bit too complacent and might be taking
victory for granted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they're concerned about some weaknesses there,'' said Drake
University political science professor Dennis Goldford, who warns of a ``slow
leak'' in the Bush campaign. That is his way of saying the governor is strong
but vulnerable in the state that opens the presidential nominating season with
its caucuses on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the long run, slow leaks will get you,'' Goldford said.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatively small crowds at some events have fueled the talk, as have reports
that some county campaign chairman are not making the requisite calls to
potential caucus-goers.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than 150 people welcomed Bush to Des Moines at lunchtime Tuesday, but
the crowd grew all day -- until an evening event in Cedar Rapids drew nearly 300
people, all of whom received handshakes and autographs from Bush if they stuck
around after his address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really think it makes a difference,'' Bush said, rubbing his palm after
shaking hands for nearly 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Top advisers say they're confident the governor will win Iowa, but they are
concerned that some grassroots leaders aren't engaged. One campaign official
said the troops are working hard, but not has hard as they should -- at least
not yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign organizations are key to a caucus state like Iowa. Rather than
traditional voting, activists must show up at a neighborhood meeting prepared to
argue with friends and neighbors about politics. That requires a much higher
level of commitment, and demands that candidates put together grassroots
organizations to deliver backers.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks about Bush may reflect genuine concern or be part of a broader
effort to lower expectations. Bush's camp knows that winning Iowa isn't always
as important as doing better than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bush, the expectations are sky high.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign's top money-raiser is supported by six out of 10 Republicans in
national polls and favored by 40 percent to 50 percent of Iowa Republicans,
according to public and campaign polls. His closest Iowa challenger, Steve
Forbes, is about 20 percentage points behind, according to the surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's task is complicated by the fact that he is the only candidate
fighting on two fronts:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Forbes looms as a threat in Iowa, with millions of dollars to spend on
ads raising questions about Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Arizona Sen. John McCain has skipped the caucus state to target New
Hampshire, where he has erased Bush's lead in state polls to emerge as the
governor's chief rival. New Hampshire's primary is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's what happens when you're a national candidate,'' Bush says, putting
himself alone in that category.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, analysts say Bush will have a hard time winning the caucuses with
more than 40 percent of the vote because he is competing with five other
candidates, including two -- Forbes and conservative Gary Bauer -- with
extensive organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that, given the efforts by those three candidates, it's probably
difficult for anybody to get 35 percent,'' said Republican state auditor Richard
Johnson, who is not tied to a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He'll win handily, but whether or not he meets expectations, that's
another matter,'' said House Speaker Brent Siegrist, a Republican backing Bush.
He said a front-runner always worries about complacency from his troops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You just don't know how many people will show up. I think his organization
is pretty good, though you're always concerned about whether people will come
out (and vote) on a cold night,'' Siegrist said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Bush wins with anything less than 40 percent, people are going to say
it's not enough,'' Goldford said. ``I think he's got to do 40 percent, given his
overwhelming dominance to date. But his people are downplaying it because they
don't want to look bad if he doesn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the governor tried to dismiss the notion of a landslide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First of all I hope to win,'' he said in an interview Tuesday. ``I think
the best that anyone has ever done is 37.''
</P>
<P>
	   His history isn't perfect if both parties are considered. Democrat Walter
Mondale got 49 percent in a crowded field in 1984. Gary Hart was second with 16
percent. But on the Republican side, Bob Dole set the standard with a 37 percent
showing in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Issues: China  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the major presidential
candidates a question on the issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's question: Should China be granted permanent normal trade status with
the United States?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``Yes. It is in America's interest to grant China normal trade
status on a permanent rather than annual basis because it would make China a
more reliable trading partner and provide greater access to the Chinese market
for American companies. This will create new and better jobs for America's
workers and farmers. I also believe that giving China a stake in opening its
society and adhering to trade laws will encourage China to abide by
internationally recognized principles of human rights and contribute to the
democratization of its political institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``Yes. I support extension of most favored nation status for China
through accession to the World Trade Organization. The WTO's accession agreement
with China includes measures to strengthen our ability to assure fair trade and
to defend our agricultural and manufacturing base from import surges, unfair
pricing and abusive investment practices such as offsets or forced technology
transfers that cost U.S. jobs. Failure to grant China permanent normal trade
relations will put American farmers and factories at a vast disadvantage with
respect to Europe and Japan and hurt our ability to enforce China's commitments
in the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform Party:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``No. Before giving China permanent MFN, we must get ironclad
assurances on religious freedom, a commitment to nonviolence on Taiwan, a
build-down of China's missile force and elimination of Chinese restrictions on
U.S. goods.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``No. China needs to improve its performance on human rights, as
well as stop threatening aggression against Taiwan and its other neighbors,
before even a discussion of normal trade status should begin. A further concern
is that China has failed to open its markets even to countries like ours that
have placed few if any restrictions on imports from China.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I support permanent normal trade relations for China as
part of China's admission to the WTO (World Trade Organization) for several
reasons. First, it will provide American businesses and farmers access to
China's growing market and narrow our trade deficit with China, which in 1998
reached nearly $60 billion. Second, to join the WTO, China is agreeing to live
by fair trading rules. As president, I will work to ensure that American
exporters get the full benefit of China's market-opening commitments. Third, as
we export American goods and services into China, we will export American
values, especially freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``First, I believe Taiwan -- a democratic and free market
society -- should be permitted into the World Trade Organization before Beijing
is even considered. We must send China's Communist regime a clear message about
the value America places on economic and political freedom and human rights.
Second, China should not receive permanent normal trade status with the U.S.
Instead, China's behavior and trade status must be carefully reviewed and
debated every year. No more business as usual. As president, I will make clear
the rules of engagement China must follow. I will immediately impose sanctions
on Chinese military-owned companies trafficking in weapons of mass destruction
and slave-labor goods. I hope we can have a peaceful, prosperous relationship
with Beijing. But if Beijing chooses the path of confrontation, I will not
hesitate for one moment to revoke its normal trade status. I will never
sacrifice American security, sovereignty or values on the altar of trade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``I support MFN for China and China's admission to the WTO
under appropriate terms, which would include pressing for positive and peaceful
change in China by supporting the development of the rule of law in China and by
placing a high priority on human rights issues. America's farmers and
manufacturers would greatly benefit from increased trade relations with China
and as long as we continue to see progress in the erosion of communism and
economic prosperity, we should move forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``I believe maintaining economic and diplomatic relations with
China serves our national interests. Shutting China off from the world economy
would have the negative effect of turning China inward, removing the positive
influence on the Chinese people of Western societies, and increasing the Chinese
leadership's hostility toward international norms and Western values --
including human rights. As a result of its participation in the WTO, China will
have to abide by the organization's standards governing international trade, and
there will be enforcement mechanisms available to ensure that China does so.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell sharply Wednesday, pushed down by
high-technology issues hit by an overnight tumble on Wall Street. The dollar
slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 460.31 points, or
2.42 percent, at 18,542.55. On Tuesday, the average closed up 68.52 points, or
0.36 percent to finish at a 28-month high of 19,002.86. The half-day session was
the first of the new year.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 103.02 yen, up 0.04 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but
below its late New York level of 103.28 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, share prices plunged after the Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 359.58 points, or 3.17 percent, to 10,997.93 on Tuesday, its
fourth-worst point loss amid worries about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 229.46 points to 3,901.69,
its worst point loss and eighth-worst percentage decline.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, high-technology as well as information and telecommunications
shares were among morning losers. Gainers included biotechnology-related issues
and some oil refinery stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tokyo stock market's fall came as it was about to enter a consolidation
phase following its surge late last year, which was much helped by continued
rallies on Wall Street," said Yoshimasa Kunisawa, an analyst with Okasan
Securities in Tokyo. "We must keep watching how the New York stock market will
move in the next few days."
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section shed 65.63 points, or 3.82 percent, to 1,651.84. The TOPIX closed down
4.73 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo stocks rose about 37 percent in 1999, fueled by growing confidence
that Japan's economy was finally pulling out of a long downturn.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher after gaining ground against the
yen the previous day following intervention by Japan's central bank to weaken
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   But trades remained in a narrow range as investors watched Tokyo stocks and
stayed alert for possible further intervention by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, dealers in Tokyo estimated that the bank spent about $3 billion
in greenback purchases. The interventions, though not the amount, were confirmed
by the Ministry of Finance's vice minister for international affairs, Haruhiko
Kuroda.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.32 yen, up from 105.72 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted
Wednesday. On Tuesday, it settled at 1.7200 percent and its price stood at
101.52.

<HEADLINE> IRS Urged To Continue Reform  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reforms must continue at the Internal Revenue Service
despite concern about steep declines in enforcement actions such as audits and
property seizures, the nation's taxpayer advocate says.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is imperative that we stay the course and see the changes through," said
Val Oveson, an independent IRS watchdog given expanded powers by a 1998 law that
aims to stress service rather than punishment in collection of taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're about 10 or 20 percent down the stream," Oveson said. "If we change
course, we'll get swept down the river."
</P>
<P>
	   Oveson's report warning against a backlash was released Tuesday, the same
day a new General Accounting Office study showed that IRS seizures of property
in delinquent tax cases fell from about 10,000 a year from 1990 through 1997 to
just 200 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The study by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was requested by
Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, an author of the law that
ordered the IRS to change.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth, R-Del., said in a statement that the GAO examination of IRS seizure
actions demonstrates how necessary the changes were. Prior to the new law, Roth
said, the IRS was governed by a heavy-handed system of "goals, quotas and
statistics to conduct and even inflate audits."
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the GAO found instances of superficial investigations, wildly
divergent standards that resulted in seizures 17 times more likely in some
regions than others, sales of assets that brought in little money, inadequate
documentation and inability to target the most noncompliant taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the GAO report confirms many of the weaknesses documented during
congressional hearings and demonstrates how some persist despite the new law, I
remain optimistic that positive change is taking hold," Roth said. "Our reform
efforts will continue to take root."
</P>
<P>
	   The 1998 law expanded the number of taxpayers who could qualify for taxpayer
assistance orders, in which the advocate intervenes to resolve difficult tax
standoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   But although the office provided some aid to 270,000 taxpayers in fiscal
1999, Oveson issued only five such assistance orders during that span. One
reason is that IRS officials often redouble their efforts to fix a problem once
the advocate gets involved, he said, but he acknowledged his office has work to
do as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to do more to sharpen our focus with the most difficult cases,"
Oveson said. "That's one of my goals for next year."
</P>
<P>
	   Oveson, who was chosen by the IRS commissioner, also listed the most serious
problems tax law imposes on taxpayers. Like last year, the sheer complexity of
the law topped the list, including difficulties with the earned income tax
credit for the working poor, rules on taxability of Social Security benefits and
the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Oveson recommended phasing out the alternative minimum tax, which ensnares
some middle-class taxpayers even though it was designed to ensure the rich don't
escape taxes. Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
said Republicans in Congress want to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   "The AMT is a tax-hike time bomb that will hurt more and more middle-income
Americans over the next 10 years," said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Other chronic problems include unclear IRS notices and letters, lack of
one-stop service, inconsistent application of penalties and inability to reach
the IRS on its toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
	   The most litigated tax issues for individual taxpayers are penalties, how
gross income is defined and claiming of trade or business expenses.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From homesick tears shed on the Oregon Trail to U.S.
soldiers in Bosnia sending greetings home via computer, National Geographic has

</P>
<P>
	   A photo of 10,000 sailors who gathered to form a giant Stars and Stripes

``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' a Black Power button and others.
</P>
<P>

	   ``...thoughts of home and my dear father and mother would almost overwhelm
me with grief. As each step bore me farther from them, the unbidden tears would

<HEADLINE> Head of UN Inspection Agency Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has a short-list of
candidates to head the new U.N. weapons inspection agency in Iraq and is
expected to make a decision in the next 10 days, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several names have already been floated in U.N. corridors for a chairman of
the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, known as UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats said the five permanent members of the Security Council -- the
United States, Britain, France, China and Russia -- have been meeting with Annan
to discuss potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   One name frequently mentioned as a top contender is Pasi Patokallio,
Finland's ambassador to Israel and Cyprus, who is a career diplomat and
disarmament expert.
</P>
<P>
	   Patokallio, 50, served as director for nonproliferation and arms control
affairs in Finland's foreign ministry from 1994-95 before becoming the
ministry's deputy director general for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   He chaired preparatory committee meetings to review the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995 and 1997 and headed Finland's delegation to
conferences reviewing the conventions regulating chemical and biological weapons
in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Other candidates believed to be under consideration include U.N.
Undersecretary-General for Disarmament Jayantha Dhanapala; Swedish disarmament
expert Johan Molander, who was a commissioner in the U.N. Special Commission;
Slovenia's U.N. Ambassador Danilo Turk; and Brazil's former U.N. Ambassador
Celso Amorim, who chaired several panels last year on U.N. policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Several disarmament experts have also been mentioned: Roberto Garcia Moritan
of Argentina who served on Amorim's disarmament panel; the South African Foreign
Ministry's Deputy Director-General for Multilateral Affairs Abdul Minty; the
Netherlands' Ambassador to Austria Jaap Ramaker who chaired negotiations that
led to the nuclear test ban treaty; and the Netherlands' roving ambassador Frank
Majoor.
</P>
<P>
	   UNMOVIC was established by the U.N. Security Council on Dec. 17 as the
centerpiece of its new policy aimed at resuming weapons inspections and
completing Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   It replaces the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which pulled out
of Baghdad in December 1998 just before the United States and Britain launched
airstrikes against Iraq because it had failed to cooperate with weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday that Annan had until Jan. 14 to
come up with a chairman for the new agency.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Endorses Ill. Rep. for Gov.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert has publicly endorsed a
three-term state representative over the son of a friend and fellow congressman
in an Illinois Republican congressional primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's announcement was an unusual step for a party leader, but one that
reflects the pressure on the GOP to hold on to every seat it can in order to
maintain its narrow majority in the House. But it also meant the speaker defied
the wishes of retiring GOP Rep. Tom Ewing, a longtime friend who would like to
see his son Sam replace him in the sprawling, mostly rural eastern Illinois
district.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Hastert's public endorsement, the fund-raising help he and his
staff had been giving to state Rep. Bill Brady behind the scenes had become a
source of friction between Ewing and Hastert. Hastert headlined a fund-raiser
for Brady on Tuesday as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's news conference was staged in Champaign, Ill., the part of the
district seen as the base of state Rep. Tim Johnson, widely viewed as the
strongest of Brady's three GOP challengers. Brady represents the Bloomington
area, the district's only other major population center.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert is inserting himself into the primary because of fears that
Democrats might have a chance at the traditionally Republican seat if the
strongest GOP candidate fails to win in the March primary. Either of the
candidates vying for the Democratic nomination is expected to give the
Republican nominee a tough race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Brady is the strongest and best candidate for many reasons,'' Hastert
said. ``Anyone who looks at his experience, leadership and consistent
conservative voting record as a state representative for the past seven years
will make the same conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert also has gotten involved in a New Jersey Republican primary, backing
one former GOP congressman over another in the effort to oust Democratic Rep.
Rush Holt. Hastert, along with Rep. Tom Davis of Virgina, who runs the House
Republican campaign committee, chose former Rep. Dick Zimmer instead of former
Rep. Mike Pappas and will host a fund-raiser for Zimmer next month.

<HEADLINE> Pesticides in Schools Data Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Far too little is known about the health risks facing
children from exposure to pesticides in school, a congressional study concludes,
prompting a call for the Environmental Protection Agency to examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This information gap is troubling,'' Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut,
ranking Democrat on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said Tuesday at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that children are particularly vulnerable to risks associated with
pesticides, including elevated rates of leukemia and brain cancer. So we have
every right to be concerned,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Lieberman released a report by the General Accounting Office that said its
investigators could find no credible statistics on the amount of pesticide used
in the nation's 110,000 public schools, nor information about students exposure
to pesticides, or their health impacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pesticide manufactures and distributors have argued that the chemicals used
in schools are safe and are used in accordance with requirements already issued
by the EPA. Without use of the chemicals students could be exposed to dangerous,
disease carrying pests, the industry argues.
</P>
<P>
	   But a private advocacy group, the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides, has maintained that students frequently are exposed to unhealthy
levels of pesticide residues in classrooms and on playgrounds because of
spraying by pest control companies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the data available suggest students face a hazard,'' said Jay Feldman,
the coalition's executive director, who joined Lieberman at a news conference.
Feldman acknowledged that hard data on pesticide use and health risks in schools
is sketchy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lieberman and Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
are pushing for legislation that would require schools to notify parents before
pesticides are to be used in a school and require schools to adopt pest
management plans that rely less on toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Lieberman said, the EPA should take steps to minimize
students' exposure to pesticides by establishing federal guidelines on parent
notification and on the use of pesticides in school environments, and begin a
``full-scale statistical survey'' to determine whether children are at risk
because of the accumulated exposure to pesticides
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA issued a statement saying it is ``vitally important to call
attention to potential risks from pesticides in schools and in all other places
where children may be exposed'' and that it would consider all the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   Six states -- Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Texas and West
Virginia -- require schools to adopt integrated pest management strategies.
Maryland and Texas are the only states to require parent notification in advance
of pesticide use, although seven other states require schools to provide that
information when requested by a parent, according to GAO.

<HEADLINE> Jews Protest Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Conservative Jews are demanding a halt to the
Middle Eastern peace talks, contending a negotiated Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights would be unsafe for Israel and intolerable to U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters led by members of the ultra-Orthodox Lubavich Hasidic movement
urged Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday to break off talks with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Traitor, go home,'' they chanted during an hour-long demonstration in
light rain outside the makeshift media center at Shepherd College, about a mile
from the Clarion Hotel and Conference Center, where Tuesday's meeting was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Relinquishing the strategic Golan Heights, which Syria has set as the price
for peace, would leave Israel's northern border unprotected, protest leader Levi
Huebner said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Golan is our security,'' Huebner said. ``Peace will be in security and
trust in our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Huebner's group of about 40 Hasidim, mostly from Brooklyn, N.Y., were joined
by about 40 representatives from the New York-based group America for a Safe
Israel and about 40 children from a Hebrew school in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   Herbert Zweibon, chairman of America for a Safe Israel, urged opposition to
any use of U.S. troops or money to enforce a turnover of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our major purpose is to send a message back to Israel that the money that
is being talked about is not going to be forthcoming from the American
taxpayer,'' he said. ``The last thing we need to do is spend money on a deal
that will not work.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, asked about reports the Israelis were seeking $17 billion
in aid to implement a peace deal, said Tuesday, ``There will be some costs
involved there over a period of years, not just in one year. We're trying to
determine exactly what that should be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Religious Jews do not uniformly oppose giving up the Golan, which Israel
captured in the 1967 Six-Day War. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of
Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas party, a coalition partner in Barak's government,
has spoken for returning captured land to Israel's Arab neighbors if it would
lead to a genuine peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Shas supporters tend to be suspicious of Arab intentions and are wary
of returning the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin, asked about the Golan, told a
news conference that a peace agreement would ``require the most painful of
political decisions by both parties.''

<HEADLINE> One Minor Glitch Reported by Fed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The banking system continued to operate largely free of
Y2K glitches on the second business day of the new year after a problem
described as minor at a regional Federal Reserve bank had been fixed.
</P>
<P>
	   No problems were reported with ATM machines and other banking operations,
Charlotte Birch, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, said
Tuesday. "Everything is very quiet," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Armored trucks around the country continued hauling back to the regional Fed
banks some of the billions of extra dollars distributed to banks, thrifts and
credit unions in case of a Y2K panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Some banks have elected to keep the surplus currency for future use rather
than return it, Fed spokesman David Skidmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the central bank's check-clearing and payments systems "have
functioned very smoothly." The one exception, Skidmore said, was a Y2K-related
"minor glitch" in the electronic system by which banks transfer federal tax
payments from businesses and individuals to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
	   Skidmore said the problem occurred Monday at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago and involved about $700,000 in tax payments from customers of 60
financial institutions in the region, out of a total of some $15 billion
processed nationwide that day. It was repaired by Tuesday, he said, the only
ramification being that affected payments were being posted Tuesday, a day late.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve distributed some $80 billion to banks, thrifts and
credit unions during the fourth quarter of 1999, compared with $23 billion over
the same period a year earlier. But some of the extra currency could have been
requested for reasons unrelated to Y2K, such as bank customers' holiday shopping
needs, Fed officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that 2000 has arrived without a run on banks, the banks and other
financial institutions on Monday started packing up the surplus currency and
sending it back to regional Federal Reserve banks, as previously planned. The
process is expected to take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking industry officials say they're optimistic people won't experience
problems withdrawing cash from automated teller machines.

<HEADLINE> Unions win rally site near Capitol after dispute with police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Nearly 200 busloads of angry state workers are
headed to the Capitol today to loudly protest the lack of a contract across the
street from where Gov. George Pataki will present the State of the State.
<P>
	   But the unions almost found themselves well out of earshot.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the Civil Service Employees Association and Public Employees
Federation arrived at a compromise Tuesday afternoon after the state rescinded
the unions' rally permit for closer to the Capitol. State and Albany police on
Monday cited safety reasons in ordering the rally, which may draw 20,000
protesters, away from the Capitol toward the New York State Museum. The museum
is at the opposite end of the sprawling Empire State Plaza.
</P>
<P>
	   The unions threatened legal action Tuesday, then arrived at a compromise
that relocates the rally on the Empire State Plaza, across the street from the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we appreciate the unions' cooperation in moving this rally, we will
hold the leadership accountable for the actions of their members," said Albany
Mayor Gerald Jennings. "We encourage and expect all participants to obey the law
and make their opinions known in an orderly manner."
</P>
<P>
	   That includes staying outside the Capitol, state officials said. Only
invited guests and people with identification doing official business in the
Capitol will be allowed to enter the building, which will be secured by
additional police, said state Criminal Justice Director Katherine Lapp.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the two unions have just entered their tenth month without a
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is being asked whether the governor will hear us," said the
CSEA spokesman Stephen Madarasz. "I think the governor has already heard us. The
question is what he will do about it."
</P>
<P>
	   CSEA President Danny Donahue and PEF President Roger Benson said 8,000 to
10,000 union members from across the state are expected to meet Wednesday
morning at the downtown Pepsi Arena, a couple blocks from the Capitol. Another
12,000 members who work downtown have been encouraged to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue said state officials have been told for more than a month that "tens
of thousands" of members are expected at the rally. But he said the state may
have been surprised by an estimate of 20,000 protesters carried in a report on
the planned rally last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours later, state Criminal Justice Director Katherine Lapp produced an
application dated Nov. 18 from a CSEA officer that estimated the crowd to be
2,000 to 3,000 protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent increase in that estimate along with what Jennings called
inflammatory and irresponsible remarks by union leaders led to the revocation of
the original permit, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings cited a comment from Benson that Albany could turn into a "Seattle
East," making reference to recent violent protests there. Benson, however,
insists his tape-recorded comment included the phrase "peaceful Seattle East."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the governor wasn't immediately available for comment. Last
week, Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon called the demonstration a "campaign
rally" for Donohue, who is facing a challenge for re-election this winter.
McKeon accused the union of closing down negotiations until the CSEA election
was resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Donohue's opponents in that election, Patrick Ellis of Albany, said
he and other members will join the rally, but will make it clear they believe
Donahue is to blame for the lack of a contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki himself said last week that state employees have been treated fairly
by his negotiators and that the state has made "solid" offers to both unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members have been working without a contract since April 1. Benson's
union represents 53,000 professional and scientific workers. The Civil Service
Employees Association has about 77,000 mostly blue-collar state workers.

Europe that it may need to accept a significant number of migrants over the next
50 years to maintain population levels and the size of its workforce. Europe's
population is projected to decrease dramatically over the next five decades --
primarily due to low fertility rates. In Italy, the current population of 57
million is expected to shrink to 41 million by 2050.

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's government will not stop the father of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez from retrieving his son in Miami if he wants to, says Fidel
Castro's point man on U.S. affairs. But Juan Miguel Gonzalez shouldn't go unless
U.S. officials agree ahead of time to let the boy return to Cuba, said Ricardo
Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly. A U.S. official said Tuesday
that the Clinton administration had asked Cuba to let Gonzalez escort the boy
back to the island if U.S. officials decide the boy should return to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Plane Hijackers Said in Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
   By AMIR ZIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A militant Islamic group battling Indian
soldiers in disputed Kashmir says the five hijackers of an Indian passenger
plane are still in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The report runs counter to claims by the Taliban religious army that rules
Afghanistan. The Taliban have said the hijackers left the country with the two
militants and a Muslim cleric freed by India in exchange for the 155 hostages
held aboard an Indian Airlines jet.
</P>
<P>
	   India insists the five fugitives fled into Pakistan, a charge the Pakistani
government denies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``According to our information, they are still in Kandahar,'' the city in
southern Afghanistan where the plane was held, said Syed Salahuddin, chief of
the Islamic Jehad Council, an umbrella group that represents more than one dozen
Muslim militant groups battling Indian troops in disputed Kashmir. Many of these
groups reportedly receive training in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Salahuddin was speaking to reporters late Tuesday and didn't elaborate on
his sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since 1947 and both
countries claim the territory in its entirety. Muslim militants have been waging
an insurgency in Indian-held Kashmir, demanding either independence for the
Muslim-majority region or union with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers and the three freed prisoners, who were major figures in the
Kashmiri insurgency, have not been seen since the eight-day hijacking drama
ended last Friday in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan says its border security has been put on alert and the hijackers
will be arrested if they cross into Pakistan, a difficult task given the length
of the border and the multitude of access points from neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Salahuddin, who also heads the radical Hezb-ul-Mujahedeen, said the
hijackers can remain in Afghanistan in relative safety because the war-wracked
nation already is ostracized.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Afghanistan on Nov. 14 to punish the
ruling Taliban for giving shelter to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, accused by
the United States of bombing its embassies in Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Salahuddin said neither Kashmiri militant groups nor the Pakistani
government was involved in the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a matter of policy, we condemn hijacking. It's an international
crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He speculated that the hijackers may have acted independently to protest
India and its military crackdown in Kashmir against a decade-long insurgency.
</P>
<P>
	   International human rights groups, Pakistan and militant Islamic groups have
sharply criticized India's heavy handed approach to Kashmir, charging massive
human rights violations.

<HEADLINE> Anyone Wanna Buy a Used Y2K Book?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dermot McGuigan knows all about Y2K and he worries about the
survival of ``Y2K &AMP; Y-O-U,'' a guide he co-authored on how to get through
computer-generated chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It first came out in 1998 and it's going to be republished under its
original name, `Your Resilient Home,''' McGuigan, an energy consultant based in
Burlington, Vt., said Tuesday. ``All the same information will be there, except
the Y2K stuff will be downplayed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Almost overnight, Y2K disaster books seem as stale as so much leftover party
food. With no major computer-related problems reported from the turnover to the
year 2000, expect a short shelf life for such titles as ``Timebomb 2000!'' and
``Don't Panic! You Can Prepare for the Y2K Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, we haven't sold as many copies of those kinds of books this
week as we did last week,'' said Debra Williams, director of corporate
communications for Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishing has long operated with different timeframes in mind, issuing
everything from ``classic'' books for the ages to ``instant'' books for next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Y2K books are an especially tricky category. The typical quickie
publication cashes in on a recent news event, like the death of John F. Kennedy
Jr. Y2K releases depended on a future event no one could guarantee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I liken it to movie tie-in books,'' said Laurie Brown, vice president of
marketing at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. ``Most of the sales come before the movie
comes out. If the movie doesn't do well, sales fall off dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
	   If anyone gets stuck with all those unsold copies, it'll probably be the
publishers. Superstore chains such as Barnes &AMP; Noble rarely purchase books
unless they're allowed to return them. Independent stores, meanwhile, tended to
order limited numbers of Y2K titles.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Howarth, owner of Square Books in Oxford, Miss., and the president
of the American Booksellers Association, said he regarded Y2K publications the
same way he does calendars and other materials that date quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We would order one or two copies at a time, and if a Y2K book sold out by
mid-December we didn't bother re-ordering it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And I'm not sure who's going to want them now. If everybody throws them
away, they're going to be collectors' items. But since people think they're
going to be collectors' items, they're going to keep them and the books will be
totally worthless.''
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal for Y2K titles has shifted from fear to amusement; words once
meant to terrify now read like blurbs from old science fiction movies.
</P>
<P>
	   The back cover to ``The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K'' imagines the very
worst: ``What if your faucets are dry? What if your phone is dead, trains and
planes don't run, banks and stores are closed -- and even the government is shut
down?''
</P>
<P>
	   In Anni McClung's ``The Y2K Recipe Collection,'' cooks are advised that the
dishes are ``fully compliant'' and require ``only canned, boxed, and dried items
found in your Y2K food storage pantry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Novels, too, have become instant kitsch.
</P>
<P>
	   In ``The Millennium Bug,'' co-written by George E. Grant and Michael S.
Hyatt, Fortune 500 executive Bob Priam is fired after failing to convince his
boss of the urgency of Y2K preparation. He then sets up his own Y2K consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Sure enough, the great disaster arrives. The market crashes, banks fold and
panic spreads like an untreatable plague. Priam and his family retreat to a
remote farmhouse, where they're still not out of danger.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 6, 2000, just before dusk, ``The air was pure, sharp, and cold,
heavy leaden with drama and disquiet, as befitted Epiphany.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Propose Schools Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is ready to announce a proposal to help
communities rebuild aging and overcrowded schools, playing to an issue that
Democrats think will help them in this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to disclose his plan today after meeting with House and Senate
Democratic leaders, said congressional officials and lobbyists who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal will include a new program of federal grants for school
construction, plus a revival of his effort in recent years to use tax breaks to
help communities finance upgrades to existing schools, the sources said. The
plan will be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he will introduce Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the school construction proposal were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the plan spotlights an election-year desire by the White House and
congressional Democrats to focus on education, which polls show is an issue on
which they hold an advantage over Republicans. The edge exists even though the
GOP has tried to improve its image by abandoning earlier plans to abolish the
Department of Education in favor of supporting added spending for schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has repeatedly proposed using federal money for school construction
in recent years, only to see the idea repeatedly ignored or shot down by
Congress. Many Republicans have objected that the plan would impose federal
strictures on education decisions that should be made by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton's budget proposed using $3.7 billion in tax credits over
five years to help local governments issue close to $25 billion worth of bonds
for school repair and modernization. He said that would be enough to improve
5,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if that money had been approved, it would have addressed only a
fraction of the problem that school and construction industry groups say exists.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that renovation
and repair of America's schools would cost $112 billion, with another $60
billion needed to provide space for an expected 3 million new students over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   That report also said a third of the nation's elementary and secondary
schools need some repair, with 14 million children attending class in
substandard buildings. Almost half the schools lacked the wiring needed to
accommodate computer systems, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is exactly the type of program that's needed,'' said Dan Wilson,
senior director of federal affairs for the American Institute of Architects.
``If we don't do something, it's a national disgrace.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hijack Victim Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The sole American held hostage aboard an Indian Airlines
jet hijacked en route to India says passengers didn't know each day whether they
would eat -- or if each meal might be their last.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You didn't know if there was going to be a delivery or not,'' Jeanne Moore
told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in an interview aired Tuesday. ``You didn't
know if you were going to get swarmed, the guys were going to drop the grenades
or not.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, 53, a special education teacher from Bakersfield, Calif., arrived at
Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday, exhausted and suffering from
pneumonia and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials allowed her to leave through a separate exit to bypass
reporters and relatives, including her elderly parents, who had waited at least
two hours for her arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   She contracted pneumonia during the ordeal and was suffering from stomach
problems, said her brother-in-law George Welch. Otherwise, she was in good
spirits Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Her family has her squirreled away for a few days so she can rest because
her health isn't the best,'' Welch said outside his in-laws' home in Burbank.
``She's happy to be back in the good old USA.''
</P>
<P>
	   She was expected to remain near Los Angeles for the next few days before
returning home.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight-day ordeal for Moore and 154 other passengers began when their jet
was hijacked on its way from Katmandu, Nepal to New Delhi on Christmas Eve. One
passenger was killed shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   It ended on New Year's Eve after three Kashmiri activists were freed from
Indian jails in exchange for the 155 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore described a continually tense atmosphere aboard the plane. She said
one of her captors struck her on the head after she made a slight movement to
blow a bug off her hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was not fun and games all the time,'' she said. ``I don't recommend it
as a vacation to anyone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As bad as you think it is, multiply that by a couple of times and that's
what you've got.''
</P>
<P>
	   While waiting at the airport, her father, Harold Redding, said the family
``did not know what kind of crazy people had a hold of her so we were worried
about her safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   He described his daughter as an ``achiever,'' and said that the hijacking
probably wouldn't stop her from traveling again.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Plunge Jolts Asian Traders  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Jolted by Wall Street's big drop, Asian stock traders
staged a massive selloff today, throwing some prices into free fall as interest
rate fears gripped the markets and once-hot technology shares cooled off fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Red ink splashed through the exchanges as sellers unloaded blue chips --
although analysts noted many prices were tumbling from heights they had reached
in recent record-setting rallies.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dropped 1,333.77 points, or 7.8 percent,
to 15,739.05 by the midday break. The Hang Seng dropped more than 1,000 points
-- from above 17,000 to below 16,000 -- in the first minutes of trading, then
bounced up slightly before plunging again.
</P>
<P>
	   "Euphoria in Hong Kong is ending," said Frank Gong, economist and strategist
with the Bank of America. The Hang Seng ended 1999 with a record close before
setting yet another one Monday, the first day of trading in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's biggest market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average closed down 460.31 points, or 2.4 percent, at 18,542.55,
after partially rebounding from losses of as much as 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index closed with a drop of 6.9
percent after suffering its worst point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
	   "Selling was severe," said Cho Jae-hoon, a senior analyst at Daewoo
Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Asia's plunging prices mirrored those in the United States in one key aspect
-- big falls among technology companies that have shown recent powerful gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips were off by 6.2 percent by midday in Singapore, another market
that had been setting records. Malaysian prices were down by 3 percent.
Indonesian shares lost 2.7 percent in early trading, and Thai stocks quickly
fell 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Philippine blue chips closed with a loss of 3.6 percent, while New Zealand
prices finished 2.4 percent lower. Australian prices closed down 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every sector had a clobbering here," said Eric Gale, senior dealer at the
Ord Minnett Ltd. brokerage in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	   But at Shaw Stockbroking Ltd., dealer Jamie Spiteri said: "Our falls are
modest compared to other regions because Australia hasn't got large technology
companies in its index."
</P>
<P>
	   The selling was set off by Tuesday's slide in New York, where the Dow Jones
industrial average lost 3.2 percent of its value in its fourth-biggest point
loss ever. The Nasdaq composite index, which contains many big high-tech
companies, fell 5.6 percent -- its worst point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders worry the U.S. Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next
month, a move that could weaken U.S. stock prices by increasing corporate
borrowing costs and making the returns on safer investments such as bonds more
attractive.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese blue chips finished 1.1 percent higher after recovering from an
early loss, bucking the trend as investors bought into semiconductor companies
that are a backbone of the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq selling frenzy didn't spread to Taipei because the Nasdaq is
loaded down with Internet stocks that got hit, while Taiwanese high-tech
companies are focused on making hardware, said Jeff Toder, general manager of SG
Securities in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, traders followed the lead from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   But Michael Wong, a dealer at Kim Eng Securities in Singapore, said the
selloff should be viewed in context: markets have recently been showing huge
gains that couldn't go on uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is on a firm base," he said. "There's no problem. There'll be
days when the market pulls back. It's normal."
</P>
<P>
	   Malaysian shares plunged 3 percent in what local traders described as an
early knee-jerk reaction, but Kuala Lumpur's Composite Index soon stabilized and
climbed back to show a loss of just 2.7 percent as some investors decided prices
were looking like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
	   "Definitely the New York Stock Exchange has had an impact," said Azharuddin
Nordin, chief analyst at Mayban Securities in the Malaysian capital.

<HEADLINE> USDA Faces Squabble Over Pork Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department, caught between squabbling hog
farmers, is struggling to validate petitions that seek a referendum on the fees
that producers pay for the advertising campaign that touts pork as ``the other
white meat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the fees submitted petitions last May containing 16,500
signatures, more than the 14,986 required under government rules to call a
referendum. But defenders of the program question whether many of the signatures
are valid, and USDA has yet to validate the petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Kathleen Merrigan, administrator of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service,
said Tuesday that she hopes to finish reviewing the petitions later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the signatures were illegible, and some petitions were missing
addresses and other information, Merrigan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't appear at this time that anyone is pleased with all that we've
done. ... Sometimes that happens when you are in the middle and you are trying
to run a fair and objective process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA used a telemarketing firm to contact a statistically valid sample of
1,400 people who signed the petitions, but some refused to cooperate with the
callers and others denied signing petitions. The department last month sent
followup letters to 428 of the petition signers pleading with them to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the ``checkoff fees'' demanded Tuesday that the department hold
a referendum on the $48 million program by March. They say the program, which
pays for research as well as advertising, say it has done little to stimulate
pork consumption and mostly benefits meat processors and large, corporate farm
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best this is bureaucratic bungling. At worse, the USDA is trying to
derail the democratic process,'' said Mark McDowell, a Hampton, Iowa, farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Producers are required to pay 45 cents for every $100 of animal value. The
money goes to the quasi-governmental National Pork Board, which contracts
promotion services through the National Pork Producers Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the program say they get very little for the fees. Pork
consumption has been relatively flat despite the advertising, rising from 51.5
pounds per person in 1985 to 53.4 pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The program's supporters, led by the National Pork Producers Council,
contend it has benefited all farmers by improving the reputation of pork with
consumers and sponsoring research that has yielded leaner pigs.
</P>
<P>
	   If the fee is abolished, ``the only people who will benefit are the largest
players in the industry who have the capacity in their own integrated structures
to do their own promotion and to maintain their own research and to keep it to
themselves,'' said John McNutt, a West Branch, Iowa, farmer who is president of
the producers council.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Will Bring Israeli Culture  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights (AP) -- If Israel agrees this year to return the
Golan heights to Syria as part of a peace deal, it will include 18,000 Arabs who
have been indelibly marked by their 30 years under Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
	   While most say they long for the return, they speak freely of the influences
they will take with them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When this land goes back to Syria, everything we have inside us will go
back with us,'' Jihad Shufi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli and Syrian leaders are meeting in the United States this week to
renew peace talks, frozen for four years. Israel has indicated it is ready to
return almost all of the strategic plateau captured in the 1967 Mideast War,
leaving the fate of its more than 15,000 Jewish settlers to be decided.
</P>
<P>
	   Often ignored in the equation are the Arab speakers who stayed here after
the Israeli conquest -- mostly Druze, hilltop-dwelling descendants of a
12th-century offshoot of Shiite Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Druze say they will be overjoyed to be reunited with family members
they have not seen in years. To communicate with her parents, Fayza Shufi yells
to them across the border through megaphones at ``Shouting Hill,'' her sole link
to the cherry farm where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
	   That, and expensive rerouted long-distance phone calls, are how marriages
like hers to Jihad Shufi are arranged.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Druze in the Golan have refused Israeli citizenship to demonstrate
their loyalty to Syria. Hundreds turn out for pro-Syrian parades, singing the
country's anthem and waving its flag.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, much has changed since a border was driven between them and their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the Druze have graduated from Israeli colleges and acknowledge
adopting aspects of Israeli culture. They carry cellphones unavailable in Syria
and greet each other with the familiar Hebrew version of ``what's up?''
</P>
<P>
	   More substantially, Israel's Western-level economy earns them wages
unimaginable in Syria -- and the very protests they periodically stage against
Israel would be unimaginable under President Hafez Assad's strict authoritarian
rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When this area goes back to Syria, I will take my Israeli behavior with
me,'' Salim Ibrahim, 25, said in Hebrew from his home in this farming town, the
first winter snow falling on the minefields separating their village from Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will teach the Syrians, who still work with donkeys, some things we
have learned about farming from the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli reports say that Assad fears just such a bridgehead could loosen his
strict regime -- and is one of the reasons he has hesitated about peace until
now.
</P>
<P>
	   Ibrahim, a friend of the Shufis, said he hopes to open a guest house in
Syria like the Jewish-owned one he works at in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men hope they will be able to make a living in Syria, but fret about
its economy, where a Syrian teacher makes as little as one-tenth the salary of
his Israeli counterpart.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, their money will go much farther. A television in Syria
costs about a quarter of what it costs in Israel, and the Syrian government
subsidizes farmers, Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ibrahims and Shufis say giving up their Israeli lifestyles would be
worth it if an agreement would guarantee one thing: the reunification of their
families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope there will be the type of peace that will let us come back to
visit Israel,'' said Jihad Shufi.

<HEADLINE> FAA Faulted for Security Lapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dozens of foreign citizens hired to fix Y2K problems for
the Federal Aviation Administration were given access to sensitive computer
systems used for air traffic control without undergoing security checks,
congressional investigators say.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA violated its own security policies by allowing its contractors'
foreign employees, who had not received background checks, to be involved in
repairing 15 of 153 critical computer systems, according to a report issued
Tuesday by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those given access without proper checks were 36 Chinese citizens who
performed Y2K reviews on eight critical systems, including one involved in
air-to-ground communications. Other foreign citizens given access came from
Ukraine, Pakistan, Britain and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The extent of access unscreened individuals had to the air traffic control
system merits serious attention by the White House and others responsible for
ensuring the security of sensitive computer systems on which we all rely,'' said
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Science Committee.
The panel had asked the GAO to investigate the extent to which the FAA relied on
foreign nationals for Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's security failure put the nation's air traffic systems at greater
risk to people wishing to insert faulty or deliberately harmful changes into the
computer code, said Joel C. Willemssen, the GAO's director of civil agencies
information systems.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the systems reviewed by the foreign citizens helps manage the flow of
air traffic across the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   After being informed by the investigators in early December of the security
lapse, the FAA has now nearly completed the background investigations that
should have been conducted initially, said chief FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner. So
far, the checks have turned up no security problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't follow our procedures,'' Brenner said. ``It was pointed out to
us. We fixed it immediately and the system worked.''
</P>
<P>
	   None of the computer systems involved were classified and none experienced
Y2K problems, Brenner said. He added that the agency's air traffic control
system is protected by multiple layers of security.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA is reviewing all its software contracts to discover why some
initially failed to conduct the security checks, and the agency plans to issue a
report by the end of the month, Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's policy requires background checks of all FAA and contractor
employees. The agency's Y2K Program Office told the investigators it didn't know
about the requirement, the GAO said. The FAA also was unaware of whether the
agency or the contractors had performed background checks on any of the
contractor employees, including foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   The contractors, Primeon and Computer Generated Solutions Inc., were not
given direct access to the FAA's computers. Instead, the FAA sent them copies of
the program codes on computer disks through express mail, the investigators
said. The contractors had to sign agreements requiring them to return or destroy
all copies of the program codes.
</P>
<P>
	   But the investigators warned that ``copies of the code could be sold and/or
reviewed to identify system weaknesses that could later be exploited.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner said the FAA's contractors were well known to government agencies
and had years of experience and reliability.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 20, Sensenbrenner sent a letter to National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger, expressing concern that other agencies might have also violated security
rules while rushing to repair Y2K problems.

<HEADLINE> Santana Basks in Grammy Glow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- In a year when pop music was dominated by teen
divas and fresh-faced male groups, rock veteran Carlos Santana has emerged as
the Comeback Kid of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, whose career took off when his band headlined at Woodstock in 1969,
was showered with 10 Grammy nominations on Tuesday for his multi-platinum album,
"Supernatural," including an album of the year nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old Santana received more nominations than any other group or
artist, including the Backstreet Boys, whose "Millennium" was the top-selling
album of 1999. The group had four nominations in all.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen-year-old Britney Spears, who had the second best-selling album of
1999 for "... Baby One More Time," received two nominations, including best new
artist.
</P>
<P>
	   While fans of the Backstreet Boys and Spears are mainly teens and young
adults, Santana appealed to both baby boomers and young music fans by fusing his
fierce guitar stylings with new stars such as Dave Matthews and Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels good, like Mr. Bill Cosby with his show in the '80s, to relate to
all generations," Santana said after the nominations were announced.
</P>
<P>
	   "With Cosby, you'd see grandparents, parents, teen-age kids and little kids
watching," he said. "'Supernatural's' kind of like that, appealing to all ages.
When the music hits the heart, there are no generation gaps."
</P>
<P>
	   The native of Tijuana, Mexico, has many influences. A self-taught guitarist
and the son of a mariachi player, he listened to the rock and blues he heard in
San Francisco and mixed them with Mexican rhythms.
</P>
<P>
	   His first album, "Santana," which included the singles "Jingo" and "Evil
Ways," established his group's style. "Jingo" was a top 40 hit and was popular
on FM underground radio and juke boxes in Spanish Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's blazing guitar has been the cornerstone of all the groups he has
formed, beginning in 1966 with the Santana Blues Band.
</P>
<P>
	   After his fiery Woodstock gig, Santana quickly released three smash albums,
"Santana," "Abraxas" and "Santana III," along with such hit singles as "Black
Magic Woman" and "Oye Como Va."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana's critical and commercial success waned in the later 1970s as he
segued from blues to more of a jazz-fusion style. But he remained a prolific
recorder and musical experimenter, winning a rock instrumental Grammy with
"Blues for Salvador" in 1988 and writing music for the film "La Bamba."
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural" has sold 4.6 million copies, according to SoundScan, which
tracks record sales. Santana's previous bestseller, "Abraxas" from 1970, took 16
years to hit 4 million copies, a feat "Supernatural" accomplished in months.
</P>
<P>
	   The single "Smooth," recorded with Matchbox 20 singer Rob Thomas, was
Santana's first No. 1 hit and was nominated for record of the year and pop vocal
collaboration. Santana's "Love of My Life," featuring Matthews, also was
nominated for pop vocal collaboration.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides "Smooth," other nominees for record of the year were "I Want It That
Way" by the Backstreet Boys, "Believe" by Cher, "Livin' La Vida Loca" by Ricky
Martin and "No Scrubs" by TLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Other album of the year nominees were "Fly" by the Dixie Chicks, "When I
Look in Your Eyes" by Diana Krall and "FanMail" by TLC, which had six
nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, who has only that lone Grammy win for his work on 29 albums, began
his commercial comeback 2 1/2 years ago, when he teamed up again with Clive
Davis, the head and founder of Arista Records. Davis, who signed Santana to his
first record contract with CBS Records in 1969, is the co-producer of
"Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   "He wanted to be on the radio again," Davis said. "What we tried to do was
half an album of cuts that spoke for the best of radio-friendly, vintage
Santana, and other cuts with collaborators that would be natural and cohesive
and who were influenced by Carlos."
</P>
<P>
	   The album's success comes at a rocky time for Davis, who has been caught in
a power struggle with BMG, which owns Arista.
</P>
<P>
	   BMG, which traditionally has a mandatory retirement age of 60 for
executives, has been trying to appoint a successor for the 66-year-old Davis, a
move he has been fighting. Some top Arista artists have backed Davis, saying
BMG's effort was an affront to one of the industry's most respected executives.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Santana, he said Tuesday's nominations were gratifying but that the
real honor was that "all of these incredible people wanted to work with me."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not the kind of people who do things to get rewards. It's not like,
'Jump up, puppy, and I'll give you a biscuit,"' Santana said. "As Miles Davis
said, joy is in the pursuance, not in the attaining."

<HEADLINE> Mexico Responds to TB Concerns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Stung by U.S. concerns over tuberculosis cases in border
areas and among immigrants, the Mexican government said it is working with U.S.
officials to track disease carriers and ensure they take medication.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is an understanding between our two countries to strengthen control,
supervision and prevention efforts," Mexico's Health Secretariat said in a press
statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, President Clinton appointed eight medical professionals to a
U.S.-Mexico border health commission charged with improving health standards for
those living in border regions like southern Texas, where tuberculosis rates are
high. The New York Times reported Monday that U.S. public health authorities are
calling for widespread tuberculosis screening of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretariat said the number of newly detected cases in Mexico declined
from 18,037 in 1998 to 13,311 in 1999, and that less than 20 percent of those
cases occurred in Mexico's border states. However, the Gulf coast state of
Veracruz -- one of the states with the highest rates of immigration to the
United States -- had one of the worst tuberculosis rates as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks tumbled again today, extending Tuesday's
record-setting drop in the Nasdaq composite index, but blue-chip shares fell
only slightly as the new year's selloff eased in the broader market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 153.18 at 3,748.51 in the first hour of
trading, sliding another 4 percent after Tuesday's plunge of a record 229
points, or 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Dow Jones industrial average was off just 7.14 at 10,990.79 after
losing 359.58 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The selling took hold on Tuesday as growing fears of higher interest rates
gave investors a reason to take some profits from 1999's meteoric gains,
especially in the technology and Internet group.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader-stock measures were also posting more modest losses than the Nasdaq.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 17.48 at 1,381.94.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange and by a 2-to-1 ration on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Russell
2000 index was down 10.36 at 468.02.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 126.33 million shares, almost even with Tuesday's early
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas markets were dragged lower by Tuesday's sellling frenzy on Wall

with a loss of 7.2 percent.

	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.42 percent. In European trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.50 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.20

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon needs to conduct more test-firings of a laser
at orbiting Air Force satellites in order to better understand how an enemy
might disrupt American satellites in time of war, the commander-in-chief of U.S.
Space Command said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should understand our vulnerabilities,'' Air Force Gen. Richard Myers
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Myers, who will leave his post at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., next month
to become vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on March 1, said other
countries are developing ``laser dazzlers'' that could interfere with U.S.
satellites. He would not identify these countries, but China is known to be
developing such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military is increasingly dependent on satellites in both peacetime
and in war.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon conducted such a ``laser dazzler'' test against its satellites
in October 1997 using the Army's MIRACL laser, an acronym for the 1980s-vintage
Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser, which is based at White Sands Missile
Range, N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   That test marked the first time the United States had fired a high-powered
laser at a satellite in orbit. Afterward, the Pentagon said the test failed to
achieve one of its main objectives because the laser beam's impact was not
recorded as planned.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Propose Schools Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today was announcing a $1.3 billion
proposal to help communities rebuild aging and overcrowded schools, playing to
an issue that Democrats think will help them in this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to disclose his plan after meeting with House and Senate
Democratic leaders about budget priorities for the next fiscal year, according
to White House press secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal will include a new program of federal grants for school
construction, plus a revival of Clinton's effort in recent years to use tax
breaks to help communities upgrade existing schools, the sources said. The plan
will be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he will send to Congress Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP-controlled Congress has been cool to Clinton's education spending
proposals in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unmistakable, the need to get schools modernized, to get repairs
done, to make sure kids are getting the best education they can,'' Lockhart
said. ``For the Republican majority that has opposed this in the past, as they
go home and face the voters this year, I think they may see this issue in a
different way.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan spotlights an election-year desire by the White House and
congressional Democrats to focus on education, which polls show is an issue on
which they hold an advantage over Republicans. The edge exists even though the
GOP has tried to improve its image by abandoning earlier plans to abolish the
Department of Education in favor of supporting added spending for schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has repeatedly proposed using federal money for school construction
in recent years, only to see the idea repeatedly ignored or shot down by
Congress. Many Republicans have objected that the plan would impose federal
strictures on education decisions that should be made by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton's budget proposed using $3.7 billion in tax credits over
five years to help local governments issue close to $25 billion worth of bonds
for school repair and modernization. He said that would be enough to improve
5,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if that money had been approved, it would have addressed only a
fraction of the problem that school and construction industry groups say exists.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that renovation
and repair of America's schools would cost $112 billion, with another $60
billion needed to provide space for an expected 3 million new students over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   That report also said a third of the nation's elementary and secondary
schools need some repair, with 14 million children attending class in
substandard buildings. Almost half the schools lacked the wiring needed to
accommodate computer systems, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is exactly the type of program that's needed,'' said Dan Wilson,
senior director of federal affairs for the American Institute of Architects.
``If we don't do something, it's a national disgrace.''

to discuss a breakdown on New Year's Eve of a ground station that processes data
from intelligence satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office.
That system was knocked out for several hours by a Y2K glitch and not fully
restored until Monday morning. Myers said the breakdown had no military
significance as far as he knew.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks tumbled again today, extending Tuesday's

recovered somewhat from their own steep selloff.

<P>
   MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) -- The State Department has ordered the world's largest
civilian test-pilot school to stop teaching foreigners, fearing the classes may
supply hostile nations with information about U.S. weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Test Pilot School at Mojave Airport said that since 15 of the
17 students in the class that began Monday are not Americans, the order it
received that same day effectively closed the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuition for the yearlong class is $500,000 per student. The school has a
staff of 50.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department said it realized that the school lacked a license to
teach foreigners after four Pakistani pilots recently applied for U.S. visas to
so they could train there in supersonic fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
	   The school's owners said they had asked for the license but were told by
federal officials that it was not necessary. They are awaiting approval of a new
license request.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How long will it take to resolve? That's the question of the day,'' said
Russ Stewart, the school's director of marketing and an instructor.
</P>
<P>
	   The current class included students from seven nations, most members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with others from Australia and South Korea,
the school said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart said the school teaches only the basics of flying jets, not fighter
tactics or weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The texts we use are the same as you can buy in any college bookstore,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The school doesn't even fly any current U.S. military aircraft, Stewart
said. Its most powerful planes are Swedish-built Saab Drakens, which can fly at
twice the speed of sound.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Garbage Guru  </HEADLINE>
    By TED ANTHONY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Goodwill Industries takes American Express -- that was
Susan Strasser's first major surprise of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Credit cards to buy castoffs? Just perfect. This miniature revelation, at
the Goodwill shop just off Broadway on Manhattan's Upper West Side, fits
Strasser's notion about the nation -- that Americans have a complicated
relationship with the things they throw away.
</P>
<P>
	   Strasser, a social historian who has plumbed everyday life for, among other
things, a history of housework, thinks a lot about such things. Throw it away,
and she's interested. Garbage -- yours, mine and everyone's; out on the curb, in
the wastebasket or inside the Dumpster -- is the source of her fascination,
perhaps a curious notion in a world increasingly crowded with adjectives like
"new," "fresh," "clean" and "sterile."
</P>
<P>
	   But that's exactly why Strasser, who has a knack for making the obscure into
the fascinating, wrote her new book, "Waste and Want: A Social History of
Trash."
</P>
<P>
	   In a country where acquisition and novelty are king and queen, Strasser sees
the politics of disposal as the flip side of materialism -- a way in an
increasingly disposable culture to seek insight into what we're all about.
</P>
<P>
	   "In many circumstances, we throw things out because we don't know what to do
with them," she says. "People have a tremendous discomfort about the subject.
Some of it is guilt, but some of it is confusion -- 'What do I do with this? I
don't feel comfortable that I'm generating all of these disposable items, but I
don't know how else to live."'
</P>
<P>
	   Strasser's book is an impressive piece of research, especially given the
understandable paucity of source material about garbage. She had to do a lot of
bibliographic trash-picking.
</P>
<P>
	   In the book, she delves into how -- and how slowly -- the notion of people
thinking about trash developed. She tells of clothes recycled into quilts and
furniture upholstery, of localized barter systems evolving into a mass market of
goods, and of the staggering -- and often unnoticed -- changes that the
emergence of paper products and sanitary napkins wrought upon the material
world.
</P>
<P>
	   She shines the most in her exploration of emerging consumerism -- especially
the historical backdrop against which it occurred. "The taste for novelty, the
conviction that new things represented progress," she writes, "contributed to
the celebration of the modern way."
</P>
<P>
	   On a recent afternoon in Manhattan, Strasser sits in a coffee house and
inventories the things around her, projecting ahead to the time when they will
become throwaways. She orders peppermint tea and pointedly asks for a "real
cup," not a disposable one. "If I'm going to stick around," she says, "I get a
cup that can be reused."
</P>
<P>
	   Then she reveals more. She reuses rags instead of paper towels. She composts
-- in a pile in her back yard. She's always pondering what she can keep instead
of throw away. But for her -- and for everyone -- such decisions, though
mundane, can be perplexing.
</P>
<P>
	   Because, the notions about what's disposable are changing. Americans have
more surplus goods than ever, and there exists what Strasser calls "a communal
agreement that we all want new stuff." So eBay and garage sales and the notion
of "shabby chic" have grown popular.
</P>
<P>
	   Such ideas are hardly new; they're just spun differently to suit the age.
Everybody used to turn throwaways into showpieces when possessions were scarcer
than they are today. But now that abundance abounds, what's more American than
the garage sale -- acknowledging that old stuff you no longer want might be your
next-door neighbor's cool new thing?
</P>
<P>
	   "Garage sales are a function of affluence," Strasser says, noting that they
first took hold in the late 1960s, after enough time had passed from the
prosperity of the postwar years for new stuff to lose its sheen. "It's always
been that when people die, stuff got sold. But it was never like this."
</P>
<P>
	   But a garage sale, she says, is a conscious choice to discard. You're going
to be far more careful about the items you put out for neighbors to buy than the
ratty old goods you throw in a garbage bag and put out at the curb.
</P>
<P>
	   "The clothes we wear and the objects we surround ourselves with are the
things that define us. That's what we use to say, 'I'm me,"' she says. "And part
of how we mark change in our lives is getting rid of stuff that doesn't fit our
conception of ourselves anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those things ends up at stores like Goodwill, so Strasser heads
there to check things out. The first thing she sees upon entering is an old
Compaq Prolinea computer -- a good example of something that's going to become
more disposable in coming years. Then to the racks of garments.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lots of clothes -- heavy on the clothes," she muses.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, on one shelf, she finds the perfect thought-provoking object for her
purposes -- a McDonaldland Happy Meal Girl Doll, complete with plastic
cheeseburger, plastic fries, tiny plastic coke cup and happy meal box.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hmm." Strasser's face squinches as she processes the oddity. "Plastic
replicas of disposable things."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the disposable made permanent," she marvels.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase is made (with the AmEx card), and she steps outside the store
to unpack the doll box's contents. Behind her, an animal hospital employee
brings out trash bags to dump at the curb. It's garbage day in New York City,
arguably the world capital of voluminous garbage.
</P>
<P>
	   So here's the social historian, holding a plastic bag that contains a
battery-operated gurgling soda cup with a golden "M" on it, studiously gazing at
plastic French-fries -- in a regular, "disposable" Happy Meal box designed to be
kept as a toy.
</P>
<P>
	   Boggles the mind -- and it's a perfect example of the conflict between what
to keep and what to discard that Strasser has studied so closely.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a general sanitizing of this culture. And trash is not acceptable
in a sanitized culture," Strasser says. "But ultimately, nothing is disposable.
Disposable is a marketing term. It's defined by people who are trying to sell
things based on cleanliness and convenience."
</P>
<P>
	   It's a world where even thoughts become a product with an existence -- a
physical book with a "birth," a "life" and, odds are, eventually a trash-related
demise.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a fascinating process for me to watch my ideas turn into a
mass-produced product," she says, tapping a copy of her book. "A friend of mine
asked, 'What color is your book going to be?' I didn't know. I didn't quite
grasp it was going to be an object."
</P>
<P>
	   But Strasser will be the first to acknowledge that even after all the time
she's spent on the subject, ingrained human notions of missing the evident can
still kick in. What color is her book, you might ask? The answer surprised even
her.
</P>
<P>
	   It's shiny and black -- just like a Hefty bag.

	   Excerpts from "Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash":
</P>
<P>
	   "'Disposability' became a selling point for postwar consumer goods,
especially things made out of paper and, later, lightweight plastics. It was not
a hard sell to people who could remember scrubbing diapers, handkerchiefs and
kitchen towels on washboards. Disposable products made cleanliness possible
without considerable effort or hired help. Kitchen slops came to have zero or
negative value. Although the stubborn and backward might accumulate cupboards
full of disposable aluminum potpie pans or plastic microwaving platters on the
chance that they might come in handy, most people threw them out, preferring
consumption to making do."
</P>
<P>
	   "The moon is littered with astronauts' castoffs, while tens of thousands of
pieces of debris orbit the Earth -- spent rocket boosters, dead satellites,
garbage from manned space missions, and tiny but fast-moving bits of metal and
chips of paint. Those of use not responsible for safeguarding the operational
spacecraft endangered by this orbiting trash grimace at the very idea of it, but
then we shrug."
</P>
<P>
	   "Kleenex, Kotex and Shredded Wheat boxes -- the literal throwaways --
represent the most extreme form of a relationship to objects that was new at the
beginning of the 20th century. More and more things were made and sold with an
understanding that they would soon be worthless or obsolete."

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Carter: Still Fighting  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Rubin "Hurricane" Carter deals with life like he boxed in
the 1960s: fists up, coming at you, "no dancing, no shuffling, no jiving."
</P>
<P>
	   That stormy style inspired the nickname synonymous with the man. And his
swarming, straight-ahead approach has been the lone constant in six decades of
contrasts so striking that his survival seems remarkable, his triumph
impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   A juvenile delinquent turned prizefighter who beat a world champion, Carter
was wrongfully convicted of three murders in 1966 and spent 19 years in prison.
Drawing on a burning intensity fueled by anger, he overcame personal demons and
a corrupt and racist criminal justice system to clear his name and regain his
freedom in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Dylan wrote a ballad about "The Hurricane," and Muhammad Ali championed
his cause. And now Norman Jewison ("In the Heat of the Night," "Moonstruck,"
"The Thomas Crown Affair") has told Carter's shattering story in a new movie,
"The Hurricane," starring Denzel Washington as the boxer.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, a new biography has hit bookstores and a 1991 account of
his two-decade legal odyssey has been republished to coincide with the film's
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone at the Victorian house in Toronto where Carter lives and runs
his Association in Defense of the Wrongly Convicted rang constantly during a
recent interview, and with each call, Carter talks loudly into the receiver
about a hectic schedule of interviews, film screenings and an upcoming
appearance at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   No one is more surprised about all the hoopla than the still muscular
62-year-old.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am absolutely flabbergasted that my life has been so full, you know, of
all sorts of things," Carter says in his deliberate, strongly inflected style.
"And yet this is not the ending. This is just the beginning. ... Man, my life is
miraculous. My life is wonderful. I am healthy. I am awake. What more could one
want? I am perfect."
</P>
<P>
	   Those who know him say such language reflects Carter's intensity more so
than any total fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
	   "'The Hurricane' to us is energy and power," says Sam Chaiton, co-author of
"Lazerus and The Hurricane," the 1991 account of how Chaiton and his housemates
took up Carter's cause and helped him overturn his murder rap in a U.S. federal
court in 1985. "He's able to give back to society after having so much taken
from him."
</P>
<P>
	   What exactly did "Hurricane" Carter lose? The chorus of Dylan's song ends
with the line: "One time he could've been the champion of the world." And the
movie shows him defeating then welterweight champion Emile Griffith in a
non-title bout before his 1966 arrest with John Artis for the triple murder of
three whites in a Paterson, N.J. bar.
</P>
<P>
	   He is asked if he ever saw Griffith's later legendary bouts with Nino
Benvenuti, and Carter's normally robust voice shrinks to a whisper.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, I was in prison," he says. "That's gone. Two decades just gone."
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting at his cluttered desk, wearing a blue University of San Diego law
school sweatshirt, dark pants and knee-high dark buckskin boots with a tassled
fringe, Carter constantly leans forward and gestures with his large boxer's
hands while recounting his prison struggles.
</P>
<P>
	   In the film, Washington, portraying Carter, refuses to wear prison clothes
or eat prison food in a protest against his unjust conviction. While stripped of
any ambiguity -- the film justifies Carter's stabbing of a white pedophile that
landed him in a juvenile reformatory -- it depicts the boxer's personal
transformation during lengthy sessions in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
	   Sounding like a middleweight Nelson Mandela, Carter described the thought
process at the time: "Go beyond yourself in these arduous conditions. Don't give
in to your captors. Realize this is an opportunity, instead of a tragedy. It's
an opportunity because now you don't have ... all the trappings of civility. You
have time, you have space on your hands. Use it."
</P>
<P>
	   In his affinity for overstating and understating in the same thought, Carter
attributed his strength and sustenance in prison to "anger, true and utter,
unmitigated anger, anger that the system, that the government, is going to
impose guilt on me when the government knew I was not guilty."
</P>
<P>
	   The current release of James Hirsch's authorized biography, "Hurricane --
The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter," has sparked another kind of anger.
While the film is based on Carter's jail house book "The 16th Round" and
"Lazerus and The Hurricane," Carter is promoting the Hirsch book while ignoring
the re-release of Chaiton's account written with Terry Swinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaiton and Swinton were two of the 13 Canadians who learned of Carter's
case through Lezra Martin, a Brooklyn, N.Y., youth they helped educate. The
first book Martin ever read in his life was "The 16th Round," and he started a
correspondence with the imprisoned Carter that led to his benefactors'
involvement in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   In the film, the Canadians are depicted as three composite characters --
Chaiton, Swinton and Lisa Peters, who later married Carter when he got out of
prison and moved into the group house in Toronto where the Canadians lived.
Carter and Peters now are separated, and he lives with someone else.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirsch's book describes the group house as a different kind of prison for
Carter, who says in the book he felt like a "trophy horse" there but wanted to
pay back the Canadians for the money they spent on his case.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaiton and Swinton called the description of life in the group house
untrue. They said -- and Carter agreed -- that he would have faced problems
adapting no matter where he lived after prison.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you stay in those conditions for 20 long years, fighting the prison
system tooth and nail every single day, you're going to need a lot of
readjustment when you walk away from there," Carter explained. "You're never
completely readjusted. Those things are always there. They're dormant, but
they're there, and if you forget about them, they'll become active."
</P>
<P>
	   Leon Friedman, a Hofstra University law professor who worked on Carter's
case, said he thinks "The Hurricane" has softened a bit but still has a
prizefighter's mentality.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had one focus then -- getting out of jail. Now I think he's a little
more mellow," Friedman said. "The intensity is still there. He's still
fighting."
</P>
<P>
	   Through his Association in Defense of the Wrongly Convicted, Carter has
helped a handful of people correct legal wrongs. He put up $34,000 in proceeds
from the film for the case of 28-year-old Christopher Bates, who has spent six
years in prison on a murder charge he claims is bogus.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 29, Bates refused to plead guilty to a reduced charge of
manslaughter that would have set him free. He said Carter advised him to fight
the charge instead of accepting guilt in exchange for his release.
</P>
<P>
	   "His nickname, the 'Hurricane,' just suits this guy perfectly," Bates told
The Toronto Star newspaper. "He said, 'Don't worry. We're going to take care of
this thing right.' "

<HEADLINE> Hub of Indian Art Tackles Imitations  </HEADLINE>
    By PAULINE ARRILLAGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GALLUP, N.M. (AP) -- Bob Lawson keeps a vial of hydrochloric acid behind the
counter at Navajo Trading Co. When an unknown artist wants to sell him jewelry,
he splashes a drop on each piece to determine if it's sterling silver or nickel.
</P>
<P>
	   When dropped on silver, it dissolves without a trace. But when the acid is
applied to nickel, the metal turns an aqua color, an indication that the jewelry
he has isn't the real thing.
</P>
<P>
	   Next door to Lawson's shop, the owners of Richardson's Trading Co., who have
been in business for 86 years, have begun purchasing fake Navajo rugs to show
customers who want to be sure what they're buying is authentic. Their own
weavers are now instructed to tag their creations with photographs and
biographies.
</P>
<P>
	   Other crafts people, such as Zuni Indian silversmiths Jan and Wilda Boone,
are branding their pieces with initials and symbols -- anything to prove that
their work is indeed their own.
</P>
<P>
	   In the town renowned as the retail center for authentic Native American arts
and crafts, shopkeepers and artisans are going to battle against a growing
threat: the importation and sale of impostor products.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a foe as old as the Indian arts trade itself but one many who work in
the industry have only begun to take on, driven by the government's failure to
enforce laws meant to protect their products and livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has gone unaddressed for so long that it is taking a very strong hold on
our ability to put out authentic handmade products," says Andy Abeita, a
sculptor in New Mexico's Isleta Pueblo who has become a leader in the fight
against the misrepresentation of Indian-style wares.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking about artists who may not have the opportunity to teach their
children the trade that their fathers taught them and, possibly, their fathers
before them."
</P>
<P>
	   Albeita was talking about artists like the Boones, who make earrings and
bracelets in a makeshift workshop at their home in the Zuni Pueblo, south of
Gallup. Jan's parents were silversmiths, as were his grandparents before.
Wilda's made animal carvings, as the couple's 22-year-old daughter does now.
</P>
<P>
	   Although their trade has been passed down from generation to generation, the
Boones would prefer their two youngest children find another way to make a
living. The imitations have changed their business forever, they say, causing
buyers to be more wary of their own creations, which like most Indian jewelry
can run anywhere from $10 for a pair of small earrings to several hundred
dollars for large necklaces.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to go into a store and try to sell something that you've worked
so hard on and they're like, 'Uh huh.' It breaks your heart," says Jan Boone,
who is studying construction and plans to get out of the jewelry trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The imitations, he says, are "cutting right down into our way of life, let
alone our way to make a living, and taking food out of our kids' mouths."
</P>
<P>
	   Gallup, a borough of 20,000 people between the Navajo and Zuni Indian
reservations in western New Mexico, was a product of the Indian arts industry.
Trading post entrepreneurs were among the first settlers here in the late 1800s,
and quickly found fortune purchasing Indian-made goods. Items ranged from guns,
saddles and buckskins to turquoise jewelry, blankets and carvings.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in those days glass beads made to look like turquoise were being
produced in Czechoslovakia and Japan, says Martin Link, publisher of the Indian
Trader, a monthly industry newspaper in Gallup, where more than 100 trading
posts and galleries still line a two-block stretch of downtown. But back then,
says Link, "the look-alikes and the fakes were obviously look-alikes and fakes."
</P>
<P>
	   As the popularity of Native American-made jewelry grew in the 1970s and
'80s, the copies became more sophisticated and retailers less candid about
whether their wares were indeed authentic. Soon imitation Navajo rugs, Hopi
kachina dolls and other crafts were being sold as handmade Indian products.
</P>
<P>
	   Today up to half of the Indian-style arts and crafts sold in the United
States -- an industry that generates $1 billion annually -- may not be
authentic, according to the Albuquerque-based Indian Arts and Crafts
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 80 percent of the jewelry pieces sold in Gallup are thought to be cast
reproductions rather than authentic handmade, Abeita says.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed up with the influx of impostors, Native Americans persuaded Congress in
1990 to rewrite a decades-old law to stiffen penalties against those who
misrepresent a product as Indian-made.
</P>
<P>
	   Complaints are reviewed by the Interior Department's Indian Arts and Crafts
Board, which can then forward cases to the Justice Department for prosecution.
Violators face a fine of up to $250,000 and a possible five-year prison term,
while businesses can be fined up to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the law took effect in November 1996, no cases have been referred for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting IACB director Meridith Stanton says several cases are pending
referral, and blames the failure to prosecute on a lack of viable complaints
from artists and retailers. The board has received 46 complaints, including 20
in writing, over the past three years. Only written complaints are investigated.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are quick to complain about their neighbor down the block, but to
actually sit down and formally accuse them of breaking the law, that takes a
commitment," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten states, including New Mexico, have statutes similar to the federal law,
although prosecutions in state courts also are rare, says Abeita, who last year
worked as a consultant to the New Mexico attorney general's office, coordinating
investigations of impostor goods.
</P>
<P>
	   His work culminated in six civil lawsuits earlier this year against
businesses in Gallup, Santa Fe and Taos. Four cases resulted in fines ranging
from $5,000 to $25,000 and one business, a repeat offender, was shut down for
two years. The other two cases are pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to those, however, cases against unscrupulous retailers were rare,
admits Bennett Cohn, head of litigation for the New Mexico AG's office, which
periodically performs "buys" at some of the more than 500 Indian arts and crafts
dealers in the state and tests the products to ensure they are authentic.
</P>
<P>
	   Abeita admits artists and retailers are hesitant to turn in their own
because of fears the bad publicity will negatively affect the entire industry.
However, he also insists authorities are ignorant about laws designed to protect
Indian goods and, therefore, lax on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past few years, Abeita has traveled to U.S. Customs ports in New
Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and California to teach inspectors how to spot
Indian-style products, which must be indelibly marked with the country of origin
in order to be legally imported. Items not marked can be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem is that once a product has been identified and an exporter has
been made aware, they simply port-shop somewhere else," Abeita says.
</P>
<P>
	   With such efforts failing to stop the flow of impostor goods, the front-line
in the battle has shifted to the communities and people whose existence depend
on success.
</P>
<P>
	   In Gallup, stores such as Richardson's post signs warning customers to
beware of imitations. In the Zuni Pueblo, an art museum prominently displays
plastic stones and imitation jewelry made in "Zuni, Philippines."
</P>
<P>
	   Abeita is working with the Zuni, Navajo and Hopi tribes to patent their own
trademarks, but the work is slow-going. He and others admit the best weapon in
this fight is an educated consumer.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the livelihood of Gallup," says Link, of the Indian Trader. "If the
laws aren't eventually enforced and the situation somehow controlled, the impact
will be nothing but adverse.

Indian-made jewelry, I think our whole culture, not just the Indian culture,
will be the worst for it."

<P>
	   Tips for buying Indian-made products:
</P>
<P>
	   JEWELRY
</P>
<P>
	   -- If jewelry is made of silver, it should be marked "sterling." Jewelry
should exhibit natural metals and stones. Metals should be solid instead of
plated or filled. Edges should be smooth and even instead of crudely or sharply
cut. All stones should be natural, not cake, composite or resin-treated
materials.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   POTTERY
</P>
<P>
	   -- Pottery design should display proportion and balance. Pottery should be
made from natural rather than commercial clay. It should be handmade, not made
of commercially molded greenware. Paints also should be natural, and pottery
should be fired in a traditional outdoor manner or in a kiln. The painted design
should be well executed and polished surfaces should be smooth and even.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   RUGS AND BLANKETS
</P>
<P>
	   -- Weaving should reflect quality, balance and design. Weavings should be
made from homespun or commercial yarns of natural fibers such as cotton and
wool. Colors should derive from native plant dyes instead of commercial dyes.
Collecting native dyes and spinning yarn is far more labor intensive and,
therefore, may cause the weaving to be more expensive. A good quality Navajo rug
should lie flat with even edges and have the same thickness throughout.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BASKETS
</P>
<P>
	   -- Baskets should be woven with natural materials. The key to identifying
quality Indian baskets is discovering the materials and process used to make
them. Indian basketry varies from coarse construction and minimal design to
extremely fine weaving with intricate design. Some baskets are utilitarian,
while others are made for ceremonial purposes. Handmade baskets that are
delicately woven with all natural materials gathered by the artist generally
will be more expensive due to the labor involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   GENERAL
</P>
<P>
	   -- Whatever the item, consumers should take the time to inform themselves
and ask questions. They should be aware, however, that Native American
craftspeople may not divulge certain information related to the process or
material sources of some items, especially pottery. It is a matter of respect
that certain information must remain a secret to be shared only among those who
practice the art.

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Chris Cornell  </HEADLINE>
    By LUIS CABRERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Chris Cornell has stopped screaming.
</P>
<P>
	   The vocal virtuoso who raged through seven releases with the grunge group
Soundgarden has toned it down on his first solo effort, "Euphoria Morning,"
released on the A&AMP;M label.
</P>
<P>
	   "This overall requires more subtlety," Cornell says. "I have to be really on
target with what I'm doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Electric guitars still growl, but Euphoria's songs are lush with keyboards,
acoustic guitars and layers of other instruments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm definitely somebody who likes the texture and sound of a lot of
different guitars," Cornell said. "I use those as voices."
</P>
<P>
	   Soundgarden's 1997 breakup -- amid reports of infighting -- was for many the
final nail in the coffin of Seattle's grunge rock scene, which got its start
when local groups in the late 1980s began to experiment with minimalist hard
rock, often played grindingly slow. Grunge dominated rock after 1991, led by
such multiplatinum releases as Nirvana's "Nevermind" and Soundgarden's
"Badmotorfinger."
</P>
<P>
	   But the scene was fading by 1994, after Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain killed
himself and other bands were stymied by drug problems, were breaking up or were
backing away from the limelight.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it became an international focus, though, most of the bands that were
part of that weren't around anymore," the 35-year-old Cornell says. "I wasn't
around anymore, I was off touring with my band. In a sense, that kind of killed
the scene. But I've always felt like scenes die anyway, and that's not a bad way
to die."
</P>
<P>
	   Cornell served as producer on "Euphoria Morning." He also wrote most of its
songs and laid down guitar tracks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every decision at the end of the day was mine," he said, adding that he
enjoyed "the freedom to sort of extract out of yourself or anyone else something
you think they're capable of that might help the song."
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, helping the song meant using an electric kitchen mixer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It had these little wire tongs that spin around, and we put those on the
guitar strings," he says, to get the distinctly full sound on the main guitar
lick on Euphoria's biggest single, "Can't Change Me."
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle native recently unveiled his new material for an appreciative
sellout crowd at the city's Paramount Theater. Slender with short hair and a
goatee adorning his chin, and dressed casually in jeans and a black jacket,
Cornell gave a workmanlike performance of the new songs.
</P>
<P>
	   The early Soundgarden's Cornell likely would have been prowling the stage,
whipping his near belt-length hair as he howled through a crushing set in front
of an overwhelmingly male audience. The new incarnation occasionally rattled the
rafters for his evenly mixed crowd of men and women, but for the most part he
appeared content to weave his vocals with Natasha Shneider's keyboards and Alain
Johannes' trebly guitar.
</P>
<P>
	   Soundgarden sold more than 20 million albums, CDs and cassettes over 12
years, but Cornell says he wasn't necessarily after huge commercial success when
he set out to record "Euphoria Morning."
</P>
<P>
	   The release charted as high as No. 18 in October, but it has since fallen
well below the top 100 on the Billboard charts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't worry about that," Cornell says. "I don't think it's a record I
ever expected to be an overwhelming success, and I also know it's more a word of
mouth piece than a huge commercial record."
</P>
<P>
	   It won't be his last project, he says. He's also not ready to give up the
road, even though he's lived out of tour buses and hotels for much of his adult
life.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never was interested in playing music so I could have a certain degree of
success and retire," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   "I imagine myself lying on the beach with the sun pouring down on me and
saying, 'this is great,' for about 15 minutes. Then I'm going to get really
bored and wish I was playing songs and making albums."

<HEADLINE> The Artists: Kazimir Malevich  </HEADLINE>
    By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The small canvas painted with a blue rectangle and
black circle may not look like much to the untrained eye. And the "Untitled"
sketch of pencil lines is elegant but hardly a head-turner.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet these works by Russian avant-garde pioneer Kazimir Malevich are so
important to the preservation of modern art that a German museum director risked
his life smuggling them out of his Nazi-occupied homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   They've recently been the center of an international custody agreement
between Malevich's heirs and Harvard University's Busch-Reisinger Museum, which
has displayed the pictures in its Cambridge gallery for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvard has agreed to give back the works to the artist's family, marking
another victory in a growing movement to return to the rightful owners art and
assets lost or looted during World War II, said Lawrence Kaye, a New York City
attorney who represented Malevich's family.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is very important to modern art and art recovery," Kaye said.
"It's important to the (Malevich) family to be able to assert their rights. ...
This family is trying to restore their heritage."
</P>
<P>
	   The tale of the two wayward pictures begins in 1927, when Malevich brought
scores of his works from his home in Leningrad -- where officials often forbade
public showings of it because they believed it to be subversive -- to Berlin, a
city more accepting of the burgeoning avant-garde movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Malevich returned home and died several years later without ever retrieving
the art.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1915 oil painting "Suprematist Painting (Rectangle and Circle)" and
pencil-on-paper drawing "Untitled" wound up in the hands of Dr. Alexander
Dorner, director of the Landesmuseum in Hannover, Germany, and a passionate
supporter of modern art.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1933, when Adolf Hitler's National Socialist Party took control, the
government launched a campaign to rid the country of so-called "degenerate art."
</P>
<P>
	   Hitler targeted the works of artists like Malevich because his work didn't
propagandize values of robust health and good-looking Aryan citizens engaged in
productive activities, said Kirk Varnedoe, chief curator of painting and
sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, the artist's roots in communist Russia made his work even more
repulsive in Hitler's eyes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "(Hitler) felt art should not challenge, that it should be comforting,"
Varnedoe said. "He wanted it to show the affirmative aspect of life. He disliked
aggressive, deforming art."
</P>
<P>
	   In contract, Malevich was an anti-traditionalist who took Pablo Picasso's
Cubist perspective further into abstraction. He often used black and colored
geometric shapes against a white background, creating art that had no references
to the natural world beloved by more conventional Impressionist painters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Malevich's work looks so simple, but it's very subtle and beautiful with an
amazing sense of space," Varnedoe said. "It's anything but flat, dry and
mechanical."
</P>
<P>
	   By the mid-to-late-1930s -- as more and more abstract art was seized from
German museums to be destroyed or sold abroad -- Dorner knew the Malevich
pictures were in jeopardy, said Peter Nisbet, Busch-Reisinger's curator. He also
knew he faced deportation to a labor camp for his support of avant-garde art.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorner emigrated to the United States in 1938, secreting "Suprematist
Painting" and "Untitled" in his luggage.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's probably no accident that the paintings (he took) were among the
smallest," Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorner served as director of a museum at the Rhode Island School of Design
and later taught at Bennington College in Vermont. When he died in 1957, the
Malevich pictures were willed to Busch-Reisinger until their proper owner could
be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Malevich's heirs began a
campaign to reclaim his work, now scattered in museums in Cambridge, New York,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Moscow, Russia, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, the Museum of Modern Art agreed to give Malevich's descendants an
undisclosed cash payment and one painting, "Suprematist Composition (1923-25)"
in exchange for 15 other works that had been in the museum since they were
smuggled out of Germany in 1935.
</P>
<P>
	   Recovery efforts also have been aimed at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam,
which owns 36 of Malevich's works -- the largest collection outside Russia.
However, museum officials there say the pictures are their legal property.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 2, Harvard announced it would return the Malevich sketch and
painting it housed for more than 50 years, but it's not clear when the art will
leave or where it will go. Nisbet said no arrangements had been made.
</P>
<P>
	   The pictures may be sold, or possibly returned to Europe. The oil painting
from Malevich's Suprematist period could be worth millions of dollars, said
Kaye, the family's attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   "Malevich left his art for safekeeping, and now it's coming full circle," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Collection Blends Art, Politics  </HEADLINE>
    By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Look around the walls of the United Nations, covered
with priceless Picassos and ancient artifacts from around the world, and you'll
notice that maps are conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
	   With borders on nearly every continent in dispute, maps are considered too
politically sensitive to be displayed as part of the vast U.N. art collection.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also no coincidence that the U.N. Arts Committee, which chooses what
gifts from U.N. countries get placed where, consists of a single person -- one
of Secretary-General Kofi Annan's top political advisers who has no fine arts
background.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the business of art at the United Nations is hardly artistic. It's
politics and diplomacy at its most basic.
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats try to score subtle political points through their gifts to the
organization and U.N. officials try desperately to avoid insulting any country
when the organization has to object, reject or otherwise intervene over an
offering.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see my work more as being in the realm of diplomacy than in the realm of
curatorship," concedes arts committee chairman Alvaro de Soto, who on most days
carries the title of U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   He describes his job as a delicate balance of persuasion and tact to try to
procure top-notch art and artifacts while ensuring the gifts don't overwhelm the
minimalist-inspired building.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Secretary-General and his colleagues have to try to elicit the best, to
discourage the worst and to display the collection in the way best suited to the
buildings and to each work of art itself," de Soto's predecessor, Brian
Urquhart, wrote in a preface to a coffee-table book on the collection, "A World
of Art: The United Nations Collection."
</P>
<P>
	   The greatest problem facing the arts committee is "preventing the United
Nations from becoming a curiosity shop," Urquhart said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Urquhart, who is now retired, recalls having to politely decline a gift from
an unnamed Pacific island ambassador to display a prized, stuffed coelacanth --
a prehistoric fish.
</P>
<P>
	   A decomposing animal, Urquhart remembers arguing, was perhaps not an
appropriate addition to a collection that included a gilded statuette of the god
Osiris from Egypt that dated back to 700 B.C. and a 2,000-year-old burial mantle
from Peru.
</P>
<P>
	   Urquart similarly labels as an "anatomical freak" a recent gift from Kenya,
Namibia and Nepal that caused quite a stir when it was unveiled in the U.N.
garden last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The life-sized bronze elephant arrived with larger-than-life genitalia,
prompting U.N. officials to quickly plant shrubs to try to camouflage the
offending organ.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the whole, the art at the United Nations is intentionally without
scandal or controversy, and for the most part tries to avoid overtly
nationalistic sentiments.
</P>
<P>
	   And there are some gems in the public and private halls of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the Security Council hangs an authorized tapestry of Picasso's
"Guernica," on loan from the estate of Nelson Rockefeller. Not far away is
Iraq's 1977 gift -- the Codes of Hammurabi, king of Babylon from 1792-1750 B.C.,
written on a tall stone statue and urging that justice prevail in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   A gift from Tunisia has a place of honor outside the delegates' lounge -- a
delicate 3rd-century mosaic depicting the four seasons. Iran donated a
fabulously intricate Persian rug that hangs on a wall outside the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   But not all gifts are so innocuous.
</P>
<P>
	   Take the ceremony in May to mark Israel's 50th anniversary as a member of
the United Nations. Then-Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon came to New York to
present a magnificent gift to the organization: a decorative stone from the
entranceway of a 4th-century Western Galilean synagogue that was recently
uncovered by archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
	   The stone, which is prominently displayed in the hallway outside the
delegates' lounge, features carvings of traditional Jewish ritual symbols,
including a menorah.
</P>
<P>
	   While the gift was deemed noncontroversial, Sharon's remarks in presenting
it went right to the heart of one of the key unresolved issues in negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians -- the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that the stone emphasized "the uninterrupted Jewish existence of
thousands of years in the land of Israel," Sharon proclaimed: "Jerusalem is
Jerusalem! For 3,000 years, the capital of the Jewish people, the chosen
people!"
</P>
<P>
	   A fairly uncomfortable looking Annan, his eyes avoiding Sharon and darting
about the crowd, thanked the minister for the gift and made some brief remarks
that avoided any mention of Jerusalem, which Israel vows it will never give up.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians were quick to pounce on the ceremony, saying it was being
held in "total disregard of the strained and antagonistic relationship Israel
has had with the U.N."
</P>
<P>
	   It should be noted that when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat visited the
United Nations in March, he presented Annan with a gift that hasn't been
publicly seen since: It was a map.

<HEADLINE> Ex-husband of slain quad mom indicted by feds, arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A businessman who has been under the eye of federal
and state investigators for more than two years appeared before a federal
magistrate this morning to face charges that he conspired to arrange the murder
of his ex-wife in Florida, the mother of quadruplets.
<P>
	   Allen Blackthorne entered no plea today in his appearance before U.S.
Magistrate Pam Mathy. Prosecutors unsealed an indictment returned Tuesday by a
federal grand jury in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
	   The counts accused him of conspiracy to use interstate commerce in a murder
for hire, which can be punishable by death, and interstate domestic violence,
which can be punishable by life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   The magistrate ordered Blackthorne detained without bond pending a hearing
next Wednesday. Prosecutors asked that he be held without bond until trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Blackthorne appeared in court unshackled but clad in a gray jail uniform. As
he entered, he and his wife, Maureen, exchanged nods and smiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities arrested Blackthorne Wednesday after he finished a round of golf
at the Oak Hills Country Club, said his lawyer, Richard Lubin of West Palm
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   "We, of course, for two years have been offering to turn him in if they ever
decided to charge him," Lubin said in a phone interview on Tuesday. "We again
made that offer in writing today, but they chose to arrest him rather than
voluntarily surrender."
</P>
<P>
	   Lubin said Blackthorne looks forward to the chance to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a terrible tragedy what happened here, but Allen Blackthorne had
nothing to do with it," he said. "He has been living under a cloud for two years
while various prosecutors and authorities looked at him. He's been investigated
every which way."
</P>
<P>
	   Maureen Blackthorne, his current wife, had similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our position is, if it happens, great; let's get it over and done with,"
Mrs. Blackthorne told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. "You get tired of it. You
can't continue living your life in fear."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal and state authorities have investigated the Nov. 7, 1997, death of
Blackthorne's ex-wife, 35-year-old Sheila Bellush, who was shot and stabbed in
her Sarasota, Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
	   Her 2-year-old quadruplets were found wandering in blood near her body. The
children were not physically harmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bellush's murder occurred six weeks after she and her husband, James
Bellush, and children moved to Florida from San Antonio. Mrs. Bellush had two
older daughters in addition to the quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
	   James Bellush and the children moved to Sussex County, N.J., after Mrs.
Bellush was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men are serving prison sentences in connection with the scheme to kill
or maim Mrs. Bellush.
</P>
<P>
	   Another, alleged triggerman Jose Luis Del Toro, is scheduled for trial July
10.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel Rocha, 30, and accomplice Samuel Gonzales, 29, were brought to Texas
from two Florida state prisons for questioning at the request of federal
investigators in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Rocha - a golfing buddy of Blackthorne's - approached
Gonzales about hurting Mrs. Bellush and that Gonzales hired Del Toro.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 91; Dow Up 71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks tumbled again today, extending Tuesday's
record-setting drop in the Nasdaq composite index, but blue-chip shares
recovered somewhat from their own steep selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 91.00 at 3,810.69 at midday after
Tuesday's plunge of a record 229 points, or 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Dow Jones industrial average regained 71.67 points, rising to
11,069.60 after losing 359.58 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the recovery in the Dow was a technical bounce in response to
Tuesday's drop, but they warned the blue chips' advance might not last.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the way the market tries to find a bottom , by trial and error," said
Larry Wachtel, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow was led higher by two industrial stalwarts, DuPont, up 2 1/2 to 67
1/2, and Boeing, up 2 1/2 to 42 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   The selling took hold on Tuesday as growing fears of higher interest rates
gave investors a reason to take some profits from 1999's meteoric gains,
especially in the technology and Internet group.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued taking those profits today. Microsoft was off 1 at 111
5/8, while Yahoo! dropped 29 to 414.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader-stock measures were also posting more modest losses than the Nasdaq.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.25 at 1,396.17.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancers were narrowly ahead of decliners on the New York Stock Exchange,
while on the Nasdaq Stock Market, decliners had a lead of about 7-to-5. The
Russell 2000 index was down 4.39 at 473.99.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 482.51 million shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas markets were dragged lower by Tuesday's sellling frenzy on Wall
Street. Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.42 percent. In European trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.29 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.95
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.39 percent.

    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - People suffering from drug and alcohol abuse
will be offered counseling and referrals to treatment programs when they visit
the emergency room at Yale-New Haven Hospital for other problems.
<P>
	   The new program is aimed at reducing emergency visits while getting patients
the treatment they need.

of having problems with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of these same people were coming into the emergency room again and
again, but they were not questioned about treatment for an alcohol or drug
problem, said Linda Degutis, an assistant professor of public health and surgery
at the Yale School of Medicine who is coordinating the program.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you knew that they had diabetes, you'd do something about it. This is an
opportunity to do something about their alcohol abuse," Degutis said.
</P>
<P>
	   The program is modeled after one at Boston Medical Center, using about
$200,000 in grants from the state and from New Haven Fighting Back, which
coordinates anti-drug efforts in the city. Similar programs are underway in
Kansas City, Mo. and Vallejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Marzella Tyson, the project director for New Haven Fighting Back, said the
program may be replicated statewide if it is shown to work in New Haven.
Fighting Back is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   The program began at Yale-New Haven Hospital Dec. 1 with three counselors in
the emergency room, to cover the busiest hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients are asked basic questions about their drug or alcohol use, but are
not required to participate. If the answers show that a patient may have a
problem, they will get some counseling in the emergency room and be referred to
Alcoholics Anonymous, a detoxification center or other help.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyson said the emergency room counseling works well because it hits people
at a low moment, when their drug or alcohol abuse has caused an injury, a car
accident or a run-in with violence.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's at a vulnerable time. It's a time to really talk about the root of the
problem," Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. David F. Musto, a Yale professor who is on the national advisory board
for Fight Back, said while some emergency room doctors do try to address
patients' alcohol or drug problems, most emergency rooms are not set up to
handle referrals for counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   "My experience in the emergency room is that people have very specific
problems you're dealing with. If you don't have a specific problem, there's
someone else who does, and there isn't much time for an in-depth discussion of
your lifestyle," Musto said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said counseling and referrals may help prevent injuries, such as falls at
home, and more serious problems such as repeated drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless you can do something about the fundamental problem, these accidents
will keep happening," Musto said.
</P>
<P>
	   Degutis said the counseling program also should stop binge drinking habits
of young people from turning into alcoholism in the future. Most of the 22
percent of people cited in the study were between the ages of 18 and 35.
</P>
<P>
	   The program has a financial benefit also, since some people needing
emergency care do not have insurance, or their insurance will not pay for the
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   "It hits all of us, I think, because if you pay for emergency room visits or
someone gets in a serious crash, it's very costly. To pay for 5 minutes of
preventative counseling, that's cheaper, and it's very effective," Degutis said.

<HEADLINE> Some inmates shipped to Va. have more privileges than in state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - Smoking cigarettes and visiting with other
inmates are among the privileges some Connecticut inmates are entitled at a
high-security Virginia prison.
<P>
	   Those inmates would not be given those rights were they not transferred
out-of-state because of overcrowding in Connecticut's super-maximum security
prison, say lawmakers who toured the Virginia facility.
</P>
<P>
	   At Northern Correctional Institute - Connecticut's super-maximum security
prison, most inmates are locked in isolation 23 hours a day. Inmates at Wallens
Ridge in Big Stone Gap, Va., are allowed out of their cells several hours a day
and can interact with other inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   At Wallens Ridge, inmates are allowed to smoke in their cells; Connecticut
prisons are smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't what I expected," said state Rep. Wade A. Hyslop Jr., D-New
London, who toured the prison Tuesday with state Rep. Michael P. Lawlor, D-East
Haven and other state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his relief that the prison was not as harsh as he had thought,
Hyslop said, "I still believe they are Connecticut inmates and they should be
housed in Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Correction, in an effort to ease overcrowding in
Connecticut prisons, has contracted to send 484 men to the prison in remote
southwest Virginia. The department has transferred 320 men since October,
spokeswoman Christina M. Polce said.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators fear what has been billed as a temporary measure could become
permanent. The General Assembly has authorized the state to send 500 prisoners
out of Connecticut, but Gov. John G. Rowland has said he may ask for permission
to transfer up to 2,000 more, Lawlor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyslop said the cost of sending prisoners out of state - an estimated $11.6
million a year - is too expensive and the inmates should not be separated from
their families.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers have also cited concerns that the Virginia prison guards are
nearly all white, while 80 percent of the Connecticut inmates being sent there
are black or Hispanic. Connecticut's overall prison population is about 70
percent black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallens Ridge and its twin Red Onion State Prison have been cited by the New
York-based Human Rights Watch for alleged abuses including inmates being fired
at with shotguns for minor misconduct violations and degrading living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Prison officials in both Virginia and Connecticut have disputed the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Defense lawyer blames fire department error led to fatal fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The lawyer for a Branford business owner charged
with arson murder claims mismanagement of the fire department cost a firefighter
his life.
<P>
	   The second trial of Anthony Bontatibus was scheduled to get underway
Wednesday with jury selection in Superior Court. Bontatibus' first trial in June
1998 ended with a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Bontatibus, 60, is accused of setting the fire in his Floors and More
business on Thanksgiving, 1996. Firefighter Edward Ramos, 36, died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be the defense in this case that the Branford Fire Department's
total mismanagement of this fire of unknown origin was what caused Edward Ramos'
death," defense lawyer Thomas Ullmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ullmann said the fire department underestimated the strength of the fire,
was too aggressive in attacking it and lacked accountability.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire Chief Peter Buonome said he supports the state's action against
Bontatibus.
</P>
<P>
	   "Arson fires are set with the intention to do harm, and that makes an arson
fire a very dangerous fire for firefighters to fight," Buonome said. "In our
case, if there wasn't an arson fire, there wouldn't be an arson death."
</P>
<P>
	   New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 1998 trial, Dearington painted Bontatibus as a man heavily in
debt, who set his business on fire to reap about $124,000 in insurance money.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers argued all the evidence pointed to gas and electrical
problems as the cause of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Fire Chief William Pepe testified at the first trial that he and
another firefighter escaped from the burning building as Ramos sprayed water on
them to keep the flames away.
</P>
<P>
	   He also testified that he was ordered not to go back in the building, since
it was believed that only six firefighters had gone into the building, and they
all had come out. Ramos apparently had slipped into the building unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Division of Occupational Health and Safety fined the fire
department for 15 violations in handling the fire. The department was ordered to
set up a system to account for the location of firefighters at fire scenes.

<P>
	   Emily Watson, born on Jan. 14, 1967, stars in "Angela's Ashes," the new film
directed by Alan Parker and based on the book by Frank McCourt. Watson's
previous films include "Breaking the Waves" and "Hilary and Jackie," the story
of famed cellist Jacqueline du Pre. Watson says she was attracted to the role of
Angela McCourt because "there is humor in the story as well as the tragedy. ...
Angela is a survivor." Watson also stars in "The Cradle Will Rock," directed by
Tim Robbins, now in theaters nationwide, and will be seen in Alan Rudolph's
"Trixie," co-starring Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
	   Rapper Slick Rick was born Richard Walters on Jan. 14, 1965. He has a
distinctive look and style, and his rhymes are recited and sampled by rap and
rhythm-and-blues artists alike. "I was always good in English, first of all, and
I used to like to tell stories, so when rap came about, it was just transferring
stories into rap," Slick Rick says. "I always like to add a touch of humor,
because I just got a thing about making people laugh. So, it's almost like
you've got comedy, stories and rap combined into one package." His new album
"The Art of Storytelling" on the Def Jam label was released last year. The album
includes guest performances by Raekwon, Nas and Outkast. It also features the
reunion of Slick Rick and rapper Doug E. Fresh.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine years after their farewell concert, The Judds performed before
thousands of screaming fans in Phoenix on New Year's Eve. The reunion concert
was a warm-up to a tour that is set to begin Feb. 4 in Denver. "We are going out
on tour because I'm not dead and she's not pregnant," says Naomi Judd, who quit
the popular mother-daughter act after contracting hepatitis C. Judd, who was
born on Jan. 11, 1946, said she has tested free of the virus for two years. Judd
and daughter Wynonna rose to stardom in 1984 with "Mama He's Crazy." They went
on to win six Grammy awards. The Judds say their reunion is temporary, and the
tour will definitely end in April.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Stefon Harris  </HEADLINE>
    By CHARLES J. GANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stefon Harris is one of the young musicians poised to play
a leading role in jazz in the new century. It's remarkable how far he has come
in such a short time. Harris, 26, didn't get into jazz seriously until he was in
college.
</P>
<P>
	   He is the heir apparent in the lineage of jazz vibraphonists whose small
ranks were thinned by the recent deaths of legends Red Norvo and Milt Jackson.
Harris has absorbed their influences, but is now discovering his own sound,
exploring all the sonic potential of an instrument that blends qualities of the
piano (melody) and drums (rhythm).
</P>
<P>
	   Harris is also determined to make his mark as a composer, drawing on his
classical training to emphasize melody over improvisation. His original
compositions are predominantly featured on "A Cloud of Red Dust" (1998), chosen
as the recording debut of the year at the 1999 Jazz Awards, and on his new album
"Black Action Figure," released by Blue Note in September. This month, Harris
received a Grammy nomination for best jazz instrumental solo on the standard
"There Is No Greater Love" from his new album.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike many of his peers, Harris had little early exposure to jazz. His
mother, a Pentecostal minister, discouraged her son from pursuing a career in
the arts while he was growing up in Albany, N.Y. But the prodigy earned a full
scholarship to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., dreaming of
becoming a percussionist with the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
	   After a classmate introduced him to jazz, Harris moved to New York to attend
the Manhattan School of Music, receiving a bachelor of arts degree in classical
percussion and a master's in jazz performance as a vibraphonist. He apprenticed
in bands led by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, drummer Max Roach, bassist Buster
Williams and saxophonist Joe Henderson.
</P>
<P>
	   He now belongs to a small community of musicians who often play together and
appear on each other's records, including saxophonists Greg Osby and Mark Shim,
and pianist Jason Moran. Last year, they toured as the New Directions sextet to
mark Blue Note Records' 60th anniversary, and their album is being released this
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris said this group differs from the much-hyped Young Lions, who ushered
in a retro neo-traditional movement in jazz. "We're all searching for our own
voices," he said in a recent interview at Blue Note's offices. "We're really
trying to be individuals in the great tradition of jazz."
</P>
<P>
	   1. Do you regret that you didn't get an earlier start in jazz?
</P>
<P>
	   Harris: I don't have any regrets. I would be a very different musician had I
grown up in a situation like a Wynton Marsalis. I'm very grateful for the fact
that I wasn't exposed to jazz at a young age. ... I was playing classical music,
so I wasn't lacking in terms of a musical foundation and was fairly well
prepared to learn jazz. ... I was playing in orchestras and percussion
ensembles, and that gave me a different perspective. I played paper and rocks,
and all types of sound, and that made me more open-minded about playing a lot of
20th-century music. ... Now that I've gone in the direction of jazz, I try to
maintain that open-mindedness. I'm not afraid to try things. ... If you're
growing up in a tradition where they say 'this is jazz and it must be that way,'
that can be limiting.
</P>
<P>
	   2. What caused you to switch from classical music to jazz?
</P>
<P>
	   Harris: There was a Charlie Parker record, 'Now's the Time,' that a friend
at college played for me. ... Charlie Parker just sounded so liberated. His
imagination was just running wild. That type of spiritual liberation was very
inviting for me. Also, I never enjoyed my classical writing. ... I had to use
these rules and found myself very constricted. My writing was leaning in a
direction of jazz, so for me to perform my own music, I would have to study
jazz.
</P>
<P>
	   3. How did you end up choosing the vibes?
</P>
<P>
	   Harris: When I was a kid, I played something like 20 instruments. I taught
myself to read music at the piano when I was very young. When I started to take
lessons, I was a little bit more advanced than the other kids, so they would
keep giving me different instruments -- clarinet and trombone, tuba and flute. I
just loved the music. It didn't really matter what instrument I played.
</P>
<P>
	   I ended up going to college as a percussionist because that was my strongest
area. ... I won concerto competitions playing classical music on the marimba. So
it was a logical transition from classical marimba to jazz vibes. ... And
hearing Milt Jackson certainly inspired me. You're dealing with these slats of
metal and it's hard to get the instrument to breathe. And to hear someone like
Milt Jackson who could make the vibes speak like a human voice was fascinating.
</P>
<P>
	   4. How would you describe your approach to playing the vibes?
</P>
<P>
	   Harris: I guess I'd have to compare myself to the other great vibes players
to answer that. ... I really dig the way that Lionel Hampton always addressed
rhythm with a certain intensity. He used very basic structures and was always
swinging. He had a very percussive sound because he used very hard mallets and
he had the motor spinning really fast.
</P>
<P>
	   I enjoy the beautiful, warm tone that Milt Jackson always got. He used these
mallets with very large heads which produced a softer touch, and then he slowed
the vibrato down so that it was closer to the way a vocalist would use vibrato.
</P>
<P>
	   And then Bobby Hutcherson came along. He used a smaller head and had a
brighter sound than Milt. He integrated a lot more harmonic tricks in developing
his own voice. There's a sense of reckless abandonment and adventure I get from
him.
</P>
<P>
	   So, I guess I'd describe my approach by saying I'm a combination of all
those guys. One thing that I do differently is that I play in large intervals a
lot. I don't think like a vocalist anymore. ... I'm trying to consolidate a
unique style of my own.
</P>
<P>
	   5. Does "Black Action Figure" reflect a different side of you than your
debut album?
</P>
<P>
	   Harris: They're two very different albums, which is a good thing because
I've changed. 'A Cloud of Red Dust' reflected a young person coming to New York,
being open-minded and trying to learn as much as I possibly could. I was
performing in an African dance company, a salsa band, small opera companies,
musical theater and a Latin jazz group. The album sort of captured my scattered
brain. It has lots of African and Latin influences, and some classical
influences.
</P>
<P>
	   On 'Black Action Figure,' I'm a little more focused and the record doesn't
have as many influences. It's a more funky record without the Latin rhythms or
African percussion. There are some backbeat tunes and a hint of Caribbean
calypso-type feels. It's a bright and spunky record, and very optimistic. It's
not quite as pensive. ... I'm a little more carefree and I'm taking a lot more
chances.

<HEADLINE> Elvis Presley Gospel CD Planned  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- There's one dream the king of rock 'n' roll never
realized.
</P>
<P>
	   "His dream from childhood until I last saw him 11 months before he died was
to be a gospel singer," said Donnie Sumner, who toured with Elvis Presley during
the 1970s. "He never felt like he got to fulfill his mission in life because he
got caught up in secular music -- otherwise known as rock 'n' roll."
</P>
<P>
	   "He Touched Me: The Gospel Music of Elvis Presley" on RCA Records features
the best of Presley's gospel recordings on a new double CD, and a two-video
collection with the same title is being sold by mail order. The Nashville
Network will air an edited version of the video on Jan. 8, the anniversary of
Presley's 65th birthday. The documentary spans Presley's career, which began in
1954 when he recorded for the Sun label in Memphis and ended with his death at
his Graceland mansion in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Presley was raised a Pentecostal in the Assemblies of God. As a youth, he
was a regular at Ellis Auditorium in Memphis during rousing, intense and
harmony-filled gospel music performances.
</P>
<P>
	   He admired Sumner's uncle, J.D. Sumner, who sang bass for the Blackwood
Brothers and J.D. Sumner and the Stamps. The latter group toured with Presley
for five years. J.D. Sumner died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of his stage movements were copied from Big Chief Wetherington (of the
Statesman)," Sumner said. "He liked Jake Hess and James Blackwood, and his
favorite black gospel quartet was the Golden Gate Quartet out of San Francisco.
He used to carry a briefcase of their records wherever he went, and that's what
he would listen to."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Presley rocked the world, he never let go of his gospel roots.
Starting with The Jordanaires, he usually worked with a gospel quartet and
incorporated gospel music into his shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In an essay "Presley and the Gospel Tradition," published in "The Elvis
Reader" (1992), music historian Charles Wolfe wrote that in the 1950s, Presley
considered leaving rock 'n' roll to join a gospel quartet: "The fact that
Presley, while starting to change the face of American popular music with his
new rock music, would even seriously consider an invitation to join a major
gospel group suggests how much gospel music counted in his musical values at the
time."
</P>
<P>
	   The documentary shows how gospel music remained a constant in Presley's
life. Especially compelling is footage of the late-night gospel sing-alongs that
followed his live performances.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Brown, who now runs MCA Records in Nashville, was a member of Donnie
Sumner's group Voice and was present at many of those informal get-togethers. He
said Presley had a different demeanor when he sang gospel.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shown in his face," Brown says in the documentary. "You could tell it
was a deeper love for that music than secular mainstream songs that made him a
star."
</P>
<P>
	   Presley liked to shout out songs for Sumner and Voice to sing and would join
in on the bass part.
</P>
<P>
	   "He always wanted to be a bass singer," Sumner said. "His favorite song was
'In the Sweet By and By.' One night we sang that one -- all four verses -- back
to back 18 times."
</P>
<P>
	   As he got older, Presley became less interested in singing "Blue Suede
Shoes" and his other rock 'n' roll hits, calling them "bubble gum rock," Sumner
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He never felt comfortable with that kind of music. He felt like he had to
rehearse it, to practice it to get his moves down right. (That's) because it
didn't come from his heart," Sumner said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But he could stand flat-footed anywhere, anytime and sing a gospel song and
soul would come out of his lips, it would roll off his chest and fall onto the
floor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I mean, he had soul in gospel music. That was where he felt comfortable. He
relaxed and got inside the song."
</P>
<P>
	   Sumner quit the Presley show about a year before the singer died. He asked
Presley to release him from his contract, saying he wanted to go into treatment
for drug abuse and turn his life around.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said, 'I'm proud of you. Go do what you've got to do. I wish I could do
that. I'd like to go somewhere and start all over. But I guess I got to keep
being Elvis."'
</P>
<P>

	   Elsewhere in country music
</P>
<P>
	   VINTAGE WILLIE NELSON: Before he was a cosmic cowboy, Willie Nelson tried on
a farmer image and recorded "Country Willie -- His Own Songs." The 1965 album,
re-released on CD by Buddha Records, includes "Night Life," "Hello Walls" and
"It Should Be Easier Now." The CD is a reminder that even way back then, Nelson
was a genius at creating Zenlike country music lyrics. His jazz-inflected,
to-the-point vocal phrasing was in place on the album, and producer Chet Atkins
helped him craft a sparse sound that could only work with such great songs.
Highly recommended.

<HEADLINE> NBC Announces Agreement With NAACP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC said today it will seek out more minority writers,
producers and directors for its television shows, ending the threat of an NAACP
boycott against the network.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar deals may be near with ABC, CBS and Fox, Kweisi Mfume, president of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said as the deal
with NBC was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   What began last summer as a protest against the scarcity of minority cast
members on the fall's schedule of new network shows eventually resulted in a
deal that almost exclusively affects people behind the cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   If more minorities are in position to create shows and decide what gets on
the air, more diverse casts and programming options will naturally follow, Mfume
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are continuing our work with the other networks, but the NBC model
really becomes the model for emulation," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "NBC has come to realize that we can and must do more," NBC President Bob
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has agreed to hire at least one new minority writer next fall for all
its second-year shows, and is encouraging producers to hire minorities for
free-lance writing jobs. The network will also boost its support for various job
training and internship programs to get more minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has also promised to double its amount of purchases from minority-owned
businesses over the next 18 months, an additional $10 million in spending. And
Mfume and top NBC executives will be hosts of an all-day seminar next month for
producers and studio heads to come up with more ideas for increasing diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP had threatened a boycott after complaining about the "virtual
whitewash" in new programming. The organization said if negotiations with other
networks don't bear fruit within the next 10 days, it may still resort to a
boycott against them.

<HEADLINE> Many cabbies observe Ramadan, prepare for Eid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - With Hanukkah, Christmas and New Year's now memories,
the city seems to be back to normal at last. Except for one thing. At sunset
every evening, cabs are oddly few and far between, parked instead near mosques
or Middle Eastern restaurants.
<P>
	   It is Ramadan in the city, where many cabbies are observant Muslims who stop
to break their fast every sunset and do not drive at all on Eid al-Fitr, or
feast of the fast-breaking, a major celebration at the end of the Islamic month
of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we break our fast at home or at mosques or at halal restaurants," the
Islamic equivalent of kosher, "it is beautiful, beautiful," said Sajid Ayub, a
cabbie from Queens, halfway through his fast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   During the Islamic lunar month of Ramadan, which started Dec. 9, Muslims
abstain from all food and drink between sunrise and sunset, stopping work to
break their fast together each evening.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do get some complaints during Ramadan, especially when we break our
fast," admitted Farooq Bhatti, president of the Pak Brothers Yellow Cab Drivers
Union. "But it's a special time for us. At that time, if you go to Lexington
Avenue between 26th and 30th streets, where there are halal Pakistani
restaurants, you will find many many cabbies."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Chatkhara restaurant, up to 50 cabbies break their fast with dates
and juice every Ramadan evening before praying at the restaurant or at a nearby
mosque and then eating a big meal of kebab and other delicacies, said cashier
Badar Raja. "Out front it's all taxis and limousines," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other cabbies break the fast at home or at mosques.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this time, we have very beautiful everything," Ayub, 40, of Queens, said
enthusiastically. "There is hot food and wonderful juice, beautiful!"
</P>
<P>
	   On Eid, which is determined by the sighting of the new moon and is expected
to fall on Friday or Saturday this year, most Muslim drivers take the day off
for communal prayers and time with their families.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh no way, we could never work on Eid," said Ayub, who has been driving in
the city for 12 years and estimated that 60 percent of cabbies are Muslim. "The
Indians they drive, the other people they drive."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown raised its rating on the stock from "market
perform" to "buy," saying it expects the share price to reach 78 within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares dropped as investors locked in profits from a 26 percent rise over
four recent trading days. Shares rose after Sony announced a 2-for-1 stock
split.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial waste company earned 25 cents a share in its fiscal first
quarter, lower than the 30 cents projected by analysts. CIBC World Markets and
Merrill Lynch lowered their ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the stock. An analyst said the
stock has already reached Morgan Stanley's price target, and could suffer if
interest rates increase later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The giant online retailer said fourth-quarter sales more than doubled from a
year ago, but quarterly losses will widen because it overstocked for the holiday
season. Some analysts had expected a bigger rise in sales.

	   The company said it expects to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of 40
cents to 44 cents a share, below analysts' estimates of 53 cents per share. BMC,
a maker of computer-management software, cited underperforming North American
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   A J.C. Bradford analyst widened his estimate of the company's fourth-quarter
loss to 30 cents per share. A consensus estimate previously predicted a loss of
13 cents per share. Rowecom manages corporate magazine subscriptions over the

<HEADLINE> Cos. Offer Tainted Blood Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Two U.S. medical firms and a Dutch
organization have offered to pay up to $2.36 million to Dutch hemophiliacs
infected with the AIDS virus during blood transfusions in the 1980s, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer is intended to help the remaining survivors of the 130 people
infected with HIV by tainted blood, said Jose Willemsen, spokeswoman for the
Organization for Hemophilia Patients, or CLB.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement was negotiated by the CLB and U.S. medical companies Baxter
International Inc. and Aventius Bhering, formerly known as Centeon. The
companies said the offer still must be approved by the survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Aventius spokesman Guy Esnouf and Baxter spokesman Marten Nibelce refused to
give further details. Both spokesmen are Dutch representatives for their
respective companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The $2.36 million figure represents a maximum amount and could be lowered,
depending on how many patients participate in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The CLB is a Dutch volunteer organization that helped deliver the tainted
blood. The organization said it will foot a third of the bill for the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear exactly how many people are entitled to the funds, since an
unknown number have died from AIDS, said Willemsen.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although a large number of them have already passed away, we are pleased
that this story has come to an end," Willemsen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, victims must retract any lawsuits against the
companies. The families of the deceased will inherit the payment in case of
death.
</P>
<P>
	   The Netherlands Red Cross will distribute the funds, according to
Willemsen.

<HEADLINE> What This Stock Market Needs ...  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A few stock market views from some experienced,
conservative, sensible folk who have seen it all before:
</P>
<P>
	   Such as H. Bradlee Perry, who observes that anyone "who postulates that
stocks are less risky than bonds is living in a foolish, dangerous dreamworld."
</P>
<P>
	   Perry, who delivered his views at the 50th anniversary dinner of the
Financial Analysts Society of Detroit, is a former chairman of David L. Babson &AMP;
Co., investment counselor.
</P>
<P>
	   He went back a way to make his point, reminding listeners of the observation
by Prof. Irving Fisher in 1929 that "stocks have reached a permanently high
plateau."
</P>
<P>
	   That, of course, was the year of the great crash, in which the professor, a
genius to contemporaries, lost everything, including his house, which Yale
University bought and rented back to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Perry is concerned about volatility. As he told the Detroit audience in
October, "the average holding period for all the publicly held shares of
Amazon.com is just eight days!"
</P>
<P>
	   For Dell Computer, he continued, "it's four months, Microsoft six months,
Cisco nine months, and Wal-Mart 18 months." Who, he asks, will stay the course
when times become difficult?
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Gerald W. Perritt, a former mathematics professor and author of several
books of stock analysis, expresses his views in the "Mutual Fund Letter," which
he founded and has edited since leaving academe.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that great fortunes will be made by investors who own stocks of
companies that will benefit from the great technological explosion," he says.
But the past too has lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
	   And so, he explains, "I plan to continue to employ the conventional wisdom
I've learned from more than 30 years of stock market experience."
</P>
<P>
	   The new paradigm contends that diversification only reduces investment
return, and that if you want big gains you must invest in only a few stocks.
Perritt will reduce risk by diversifying.
</P>
<P>
	   The new wisdom says you should day-trade stocks and pick up handsome
profits. He will invest for the long term.
</P>
<P>
	   New thinking says ignore price-earnings ratios and buy what's moving. He
will avoid all stocks with unreasonably high price-to-earnings ratios.
</P>
<P>
	   The new paradigm maintains that a stock not already rising isn't worth
buying. Perritt says he will invest in "beaten down, out-of-favor stocks" that
he feels are reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The analysts at Wright Investors' Service hold firm to the philosophy of its
founder, John Winthrop Wright, that the funds it manages (in the billions) must
meet fiduciary standards.
</P>
<P>
	   While that doesn't necessarily rule out investments in some of today's
high-tech companies, it does mean that such investments meet very high standards
of management, earnings and longevity.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright goes by long-term performance numbers rather than short-term emotion.
And so it asks rather coldly, if high P-E stocks soar when interest rates fall,
what is their downside when rates rise?
</P>
<P>
	   While Wright doesn't expect further significant moves to raise interest
rates by the Federal Reserve, it believes there's "enough risk of such an
outcome to make record P-E multiples of many growth and technology stocks appear
reckless."

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Bones in Elevator Solved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- There is no murder behind the mystery of the bones
discovered Dec. 3 in the elevator shaft of the elegant Blackstone Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   What was first considered possible evidence of a long-ago murder is probably
the remains of someone's lunch.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all butchered cattle and pigs and turkey and chicken," said Rob Bozell
of the Nebraska State Historical Society, who was asked to examine the bones by
the State Patrol. The bones were probably leftovers from a construction worker's
lunch, or maybe something an animal dragged in, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bones were discovered by workers replacing the elevator.
</P>
<P>
	   The finding -- at a hotel known for its Prohibition-era liveliness -- set
off speculation that an organized crime figure might have been killed and the
body hidden in the foundation of the building.

<HEADLINE> New Appeal on Polio Launched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    GENEVA (AP) -- The World Health Organization and the U.N. children's fund on
Thursday urged heads of state of 30 African and Asian countries to make a final
push to wipe out polio.
</P>
<P>
	   WHO and UNICEF sent the appeal to countries still afflicted by the crippling
disease. Polio has been wiped out in the Americas, Europe and the Western
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are on the verge of an historic public health victory -- the eradication
of poliomyelitis, a disease which has caused untold suffering to millions of
children in all parts of the world," WHO chief Gro Harlem Brundtland and UNICEF
head Carol Bellamy wrote in a letter.
</P>
<P>
	   They urged heads of affected nations in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to
provide leadership for extra immunization efforts. They also asked the leaders
to push truces that would allow mass vaccination campaigns in areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   At a conference in New Delhi, Brundtland described the year 2000 as a
"window of opportunity" to defeat the disease. The U.N. health agency has set
the end of the year as a target for its elimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Polio is highly infectious. It affects the spinal cord and brain, causing
paralysis and sometimes death. It usually affects children under 5 years old.
The number of reported polio cases worldwide has declined from 35,000 in 1988 to
5,200 in 1999, but many cases aren't reported.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 70 percent of the world's remaining cases are in India. The
country is in the midst of a vast immunization drive to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the other cases are in conflict-stricken sub-Saharan African nations
like Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Home Work Safety Rules Rescinded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a barrage of criticism, Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman today withdrew a federal interpretation letter saying that companies'
normal workplace safety obligations also apply to employees who do their work at
home.
</P>
<P>
	   She said an advisory drafted by departmental officials was informal and was
not intended to be taken as a statement of policy for the entire business
community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a letter to one employer. It provided guidance to him on his
employees working at home,'' she said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press. ``The letter, however, caused widespread confusion and
unintended consequences for others. And therefore, as a result of those
unintended consequences, I have made a decision to withdraw the letter today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Herman said, however, that the controversy has raised important questions
about what protections Americans who work at home can expect from the
government. She said she will convene a conference of business and labor leaders
and set up an interagency task force to conduct a wide-ranging study of the
issue.

	   In addition to a $700 million tax-cut proposal aimed mostly at businesses,
Pataki called for legislation that would permit those convicted of three
misdemeanors to be tried as felons on subsequent misdemeanor arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   "History must say that we were not just marking time, that we were not
content to merely carry the torch of time, but that we did all that could be
done to make it burn as bright as possible before handing it on to the next
generation," Pataki told lawmakers during his one-hour speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Still riding a Wall Street-driven economic boom that has buoyed his tenure
as governor, Pataki's early afternoon speech was delivered to a joint session of
the state Legislature in the cavernous Assembly chamber of the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview beforehand, Pataki said he felt "sick as a dog" after
battling a cold for the past week. At the podium, he looked pale and coughed
several times, repeatedly sipping water during applause breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   Braving freezing temperatures, thousands of state workers demonstrated
outside the Capitol against the governor. They have been without a contract
since April of last year. Concern about the demonstrations had led to unusually
tight security in and around the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, Pataki said his $700 million tax-cut proposal, initially unveiled on
the eve of his speech, would help businesses and areas of upstate New York still
not sharing completely in the fruits of the state's economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   In an official Democratic response to Pataki's address, state Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver said he was "pleased that the governor has finally
acknowledged what the Assembly majority has been saying all along, that more
must be done to spur the Main Street economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki has enacted a series of hefty tax cuts during his first five years in
office even while increasing state spending. It is an economic trick made
possible largely by the continued healthy performance of Wall Street that has
left state tax coffers bulging, even with the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   With some of the big-ticket items, such as the tax-cut plan, already made
public, Pataki chose to highlight education reform in his State of the State
message.
</P>
<P>
	   "My education proposal this year is about empowerment: empowering parents,
empowering children, empowering families," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Packaging a host of old and new ideas into a program he called "Schools
2000," Pataki called for requiring all school districts to establish codes of
conduct that would cover appropriate standards for language and dress. He did
not define what he thought those were.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said all school districts should also be required to teach
students about "civility, character" and "observance of laws and rules, courtesy
and dignity."
</P>
<P>
	   He called for giving the mayors of the state's largest cities, including New
York City, greater control over their school systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Stressing the importance of school safety in the wake of the Columbine
shootings last year, Pataki called for creation of a statewide database that
would track all violent crimes in schools and mandatory violence prevention
training for teachers and school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   To fight crime generally, Pataki called on the Legislature to adopt his
measure that would allow criminals convicted of multiple misdemeanors to be
tried as felons.
</P>
<P>
	   "Across our state, there are too many examples of criminals who've been
arrested for as many as 110 misdemeanors - for crimes like assault with the
intent to cause physical injury - without going to prison," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor renewed his calls for ending parole for all felons - it was
ended for violent felons last year - and for taking DNA samples from everyone
convicted of a crime. Currently, the state is only authorized to take DNA
samples from those convicted of certain violent felonies.
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Chairman William Powers, a political ally of the governor, said
Pataki's message "charts a bold new course for the families of New York as we
enter a new century."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's latest message was 30 pages long, a far cry from the 139 that
former Gov. Mario Cuomo's 1994 and final State of the State message ran. Cuomo's
first message to the Legislature, in 1993, was 33 pages long.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 41.24; Dow Up 153.42  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks extended Tuesday's record-setting drop in
the Nasdaq composite index today, but narrowed their losses as blue-chip shares
recovered from their own steep selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 41.24 at 3,860.45 in midafternoon after
Tuesday's plunge of a record 229 points, or 5.6 percent. In earlier trading, the
Nasdaq had dropped as much as 166 points.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Dow Jones industrial average regained 153.42 points, rising to
11,151.35 after losing 359.58 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the recovery in the Dow was a technical bounce in response to
Tuesday's drop, but they warned the blue chips' advance might not last.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the way the market tries to find a bottom, by trial and error," said
Larry Wachtel, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow was led higher by two industrial stalwarts, DuPont, up 3 to 68 and
Boeing, up 2 11/16 to 42 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The selling took hold on Tuesday as growing fears of higher interest rates
gave investors a reason to take some profits from 1999's meteoric gains,
especially in the technology and Internet group.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors continued taking those profits today. Microsoft was off 1 at 111
5/8, while Yahoo! dropped 29 to 414.
</P>
<P>
	   Market analysts continued to suggest that the wave of selling was overdue in
a market that sprinted to record levels at the close of 1999. Also, said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for Primark Global Economics, the extremely high prices
of many stocks set them up for a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any correction can be sharp, quick and sizeable," Sinai said.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader-stock measures were also faring better than the Nasdaq. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.60 at 1,405.02. The Russell 2000 index was down 2.19
at 476.19.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancers were narrowly ahead of decliners on the New York Stock Exchange,
while on the Nasdaq Stock Market, decliners had a lead of about 7-to-5.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 708.55 million shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas markets were dragged lower by Tuesday's sellling frenzy on Wall
Street. Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.42 percent. In European trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.29 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.95
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.39 percent.

<HEADLINE> Home Work Safety Rules Withdrawn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a barrage of criticism, Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman today withdrew a federal interpretation letter saying that companies'
normal workplace safety obligations also apply to employees who do their work at
home.
</P>
<P>
	   She said an advisory drafted by departmental officials was informal and was
not intended to be taken as a statement of policy for the entire business
community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a letter to one employer. It provided guidance to him on his
employees working at home,'' she said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press. ``The letter, however, caused widespread confusion and
unintended consequences for others. And therefore, as a result of those
unintended consequences, I have made a decision to withdraw the letter today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Herman said, however, that the controversy has raised important questions
about what protections Americans who work at home can expect from the
government. She said she will convene a conference of business and labor leaders
and set up an interagency task force to conduct a wide-ranging study of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We acknowledge ... that employers are responsible for employee safety and
health, but we don't know what that means and how that applies to these new work
arrangements in the home today. That is why we need a national dialogue on this
subject,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was written by officials at the department's Occupational Safety
and Health Administration to a Texas-based credit services company that had
sought advice about moving some of its sales executives into home offices.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, OSHA provided specific examples in an area of law that had
remained unclear, even as the number of Americans regularly working at home has
swelled to almost 20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Such federal agency ``interpretation'' letters to individual companies often
are made public, and other businesses look to them for general guidance. This
one, dated Nov. 15, was posted on the Labor Department's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   When business groups began to notice, they called attention to it, sparking
news reports this week and strong condemnation from Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Putting home workers in the position of having to comply with thousands of
pages of OSHA regulations and making employers responsible for making sure that
they do is simply foolish,'' said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman of a
House investigations subcommittee on work force issues.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA officials insisted Tuesday there had been no change in government
policy and that the agency would take no new action. There will be no government
inspections of home offices, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the firestorm continued today, with Republicans asking the
administration to rescind the letter and promising hearings in the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders had already pledged to scrutinize OSHA after Congress
returns from its holiday break because of regulations the agency proposed in
November that would require employers to minimize everyday physical -- or
``ergonomic'' -- stresses of certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., of the House Committee on Education and the
Workforce has asked the administration to prolong a public comment period
required before those regulations could become final.
</P>
<P>
	   The now-retracted OSHA interpretation of how workplace safety rules apply in
the home said that employers could be held liable if they know or should
reasonably have known about home workplace hazards -- such as computers that
overload home electrical circuits creating a fire hazard, or rickety stairs
leading to a basement office.
</P>
<P>
	   It suggested that companies should train people to set up safe home offices
and periodically inspect at-home workers' quarters.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, GTE Mull Spinoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to ease regulatory concerns about their planned
merger, Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. are exploring the idea of spinning off GTE's
Internet assets into a separate public corporation, federal filings indicate.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is intended to help the companies gain Federal Communications
Commission approval of the deal, originally valued at $52 billion. It would
create the nation's largest local phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger faces hurdles because of GTE's Internet backbone -- the massive
data pipelines that criss-cross the country carrying computer traffic. For
regulatory purposes, this constitutes long-distance service, which Bell
companies are not allowed to offer within their local calling boundaries without
receiving FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic just last month secured FCC permission to offer long-distance
in New York state only, but it could take years before it gets the ability to
provide long-distance throughout its local calling region.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan being floated by the companies, GTE's Internet assets would
be transferred into a new public corporation that would be 90 percent owned and
controlled by public shareholders. The merged Bell AtlanticGTE would have a 10
percent voting and economic interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   But the combined company would have the option to increase its ownership to
80 percent within five years from the closing of the merger, giving it time to
win the needed regulatory approval to own the Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
	   A Bell Atlantic spokeswoman stressed that the idea of spinning off GTE's
Internet assets is part of its exploratory discussions with the FCC and does not
constitute a formal request.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, AT&AMP;T says it will continue to press forward with its court
appeal of the FCC ruling allowing Bell Atlantic to offer long-distance in New
York. That's after the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia on Tuesday rejected AT&AMP;T's request to stay the commission's decision
pending appeal.

<HEADLINE> Deadline looms in land claim, parties want intensive talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   VERONA, N.Y. (AP) - County leaders fear that without a major
breakthrough soon, land claim talks with the Oneida Indian Nation could reach an
impasse that sends the dispute back to court.
<P>
	   Court-appointed mediator Ron Riccio has scheduled "around-the-clock"
meetings for Jan. 24-26 and has said he would decide after that whether it is
possible to reach an out-of-court settlement in the 30-year-old land claim
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   All parties involved in the talks need to commit to a "very intensive"
negotiation schedule, Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace and Rocco
DiVeronica, chairman of the Madison County Board of Supervisors, said in a
written statement issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   County leaders said they would like to see talks resume sooner.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lack of a more aggressive schedule on the part of all parties would
mean taking this claim to court, which could take years, and lead to a great
deal more expense to all," DiVeronica said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But more importantly, it would mean increased tensions and instability to
Central New York, where relations and civility among formerly friendly neighbors
have already deteriorated dramatically," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter accused the counties
of jeopardizing negotiations by taking steps to foreclose on tax-delinquent
Oneida-owned land. The state and counties then accused Halbritter of ruining
negotiations by seeking the federal government's approval to serve liquor at the
Turning Stone casino.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas have always been willing to negotiate aggressively, said Mark
Emery, a spokesman for the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, which is joined in
the claim by Oneida tribes from Wisconsin and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas, with the support of the U.S. Justice Department, are seeking
the return of 250,000 acres of ancestral land in Oneida and Madison counties.
The U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that the land was seized in questionable
transactions with the state and private individuals and ruled the Oneidas were
entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   After 13 years of failed negotiations, Riccio entered the case in February
as a court-appointed settlement master. Talks have been held regularly.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have been unable to agree on three main issues: land
ownership, money and sovereign Indian jurisdiction. They have come together on
some minor issues such as hunting and fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Arlinda Locklear, a lawyer for the Oneida Indian Nation of Wisconsin, was
not optimistic that a settlement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're at a stage where we know what the possibilities are. I think it is
more of a question of whether each side is willing to make the compromises
needed for a settlement," Locklear said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Riccio declares an impasse, the case would return to U.S. District Judge
Neal McCurn. McCurn's first task would be to rule on the Oneida's outstanding
request to expand the case to sue the state and 20,000 landowners.

<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Mickey Mouse is a little under the
weather, but he's going to get better, Walt Disney Co. chairman
Michael Eisner said today in a letter reassuring shareholders about
recent setbacks. Eisner painted a rosy picture of the entertainment
giant's finances, but acknowledged that ``a spectacular decade for
Disney'' ended on a sour note. Revenues for 1999 increased only 2
percent to $23.4 billion and operating income fell 21 percent to
$3.2 billion, Eisner said. ``Your company is really in excellent
health despite the short-term earnings hiccup,'' Eisner wrote.
Downturns in Disney's home video and consumer products divisions
led to the disappointing performance in 1999, Eisner said.

The new bottle -- which has clear glass and not the green glass of
that early version -- will feature 24 cities, chosen for their
historical ties with the company. It has ``Coca-Cola'' embossed on
the sides, not printed in white script like the glass bottle most
recently in use. The new bottle is part of a broader marketing

a drive-through tunnel or another rail connection, Eurotunnel said
in a statement. The company said the project was unlikely to get
underway before 2025. Under the 1986 legislation setting up the
current link, Eurotunnel was required to produce proposals for a
second tunnel by 2000. The legislation said the tunnel would be
provided when technical and economic conditions permitted and when
an increase of traffic justified it.

Economics Ministry were quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency today. The expansion after a decade-long trend of decline
has inspired optimism in Russian officials. However, economists
have pointed out that many of the gains were made by recovering
ground lost during the 1998 financial crisis, and that the country
faces other severe economic problems, including a sharp decline in
foreign investment.

	   Mali Rail System Is Victim of Y2K
</P>
<P>
	   BAMAKO, Mali (AP) -- The computer system used to track goods
transported on Mali's railway system has been disrupted by Y2K,
officials in the West African country said today. The glitch was
discovered on the line between Mali's capital, Bamako, and
Senegal's capital, Dakar, railway director Mikoro Gassama said.
Railway officials have resorted to manual record-keeping while they
try to fix the problem. No train delays or cancellations were
reported as a result.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Urged To Test Satellites  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon needs to investigate more fully how an
adversary could disrupt U.S. military operations with low-power attacks on U.S.
satellites, the commander of U.S. Space Command said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should understand our vulnerabilities,'' Air Force Gen. Richard Myers
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   One means of doing that, Myers said, is by using U.S. lasers in test firings
on orbiting U.S. satellites. The Pentagon conducted such a ``laser dazzler''
test against one of its satellites in October 1997 using an Army laser.
</P>
<P>
	   The laser beam used in that test did not destroy or damage the satellite's
infrared camera, which was the target. The intent of such laser strikes is to
temporarily ``blind'' the camera with a burst of light.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics called the experiment a mistake by giving other nations the
impression that the United States is moving toward offensive use of lasers in
space -- a step the Pentagon is not ready to make.
</P>
<P>
	   Myers said more tests like the one in 1997 would help the Pentagon gauge the
vulnerability of its satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   The laser beam used in that test did not destroy or damage the satellite's
infrared camera, which was the target. The intent of such laser strikes is to
temporarily ``blind'' the camera with a burst of light.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a program that needs to be developed and fleshed out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military increasingly is dependent on satellites in both peacetime
and in war.
</P>
<P>
	   Myers, who will leave his post at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., next month
to become vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on March 1, said other
countries are developing ``laser dazzlers'' that could interfere with U.S.
satellites. He would not identify these countries, but China is known to be
developing such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Pentagon news conference, Myers said Space Command's operations were
not affected by any Y2K-related computer problems. He declined to discuss a
breakdown on New Year's Eve of a ground station that processes data from
intelligence satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office. That
system was knocked out for several hours by a Y2K glitch and not fully restored
until Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley in first debate of 2000, fighting all the way  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) - Arguing all the way to the debate, Al Gore gained an
influential ally Wednesday, while Bill Bradley made an issue of the vice
president's 1996 fund raising in an increasingly combative Democratic
presidential campaign.
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley waged a day's campaign crossfire on their way to the first
televised debate of the new year, at the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   They have debated three times before, harsher in each outing, as
front-runner Gore has tried to fend off the challenger who has gained the
pollsters' lead in surveys on the Feb. 1 New Hampshire presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts endorsed Gore on Wednesday, saying
"no one has fought harder or been a stronger voice for our Democratic
priorities." They campaigned together on education in Boston and health care in
Portsmouth, two issues on which the Massachusetts senator, running for
re-election himself in 2000, is a leading liberal voice in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy said he's convinced that the "the best way to try to get effective
universal health care in place, as well as strengthen our education system, as
well as strengthen our environment," is to nominate Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley discounted the endorsement in advance as a sign of Gore's entrenched
power with the Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator said his health care proposal, more extensive
and costlier than Gore's, stands as a major difference between them. They've
been disputing that almost daily, and in all their debates.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've offered a big solution," Bradley said in an interview with WBUR in
Boston. "The vice president has been nibbling around the edges of the issue, and
I think that's a significant difference."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, meanwhile, was criticizing Bradley in similar terms. "We cannot have
slow, incremental advancement," he said in Boston. "We have to bring dramatic,
indeed, I would say, revolutionary progress, break the mold."
</P>
<P>
	   He said that will take a resolute fight "not on just one issue, not on just
a handful of challenges, but a fight to meet every challenge."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his differences with Gore include a greater dedication to meet
"the absolute need for campaign finance reform, which is the linchpin to
virtually everything else we might want to do in Washington."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore points out that he's been for campaign reform for 20 years. Bradley
said the difference is that it is central to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "While he supports campaign finance reform he doesn't speak about it with
the same degree of intensity and commitment," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has added a new element to his campaign on that issue, saying that
the conduct of the vice president in raising money for the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign is a point Republicans would raise next fall should Gore be the
nominee. The vice president's calls from the White House to Democratic donors,
and his appearance at a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple near Los
Angeles, stirred controversy and criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   When that came up in earlier debates, Bradley didn't make an issue of it,
but said there had been too many campaign money excesses four years ago and that
the whole system needed reform. He took the sharper tone in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley insisted he is not becoming an attack campaigner. "I mean, negative
politics is the way politics is always practiced. It is, in a way, what's turned
people off about politics.
</P>
<P>
	   "Attacks are easy," Bradley said. "It takes discipline not to attack."
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley, a mild dissenter when he and Gore first debated, said he won't
be silent when his views are misrepresented. He accuses the vice president of
distortions, untruths, negativism, gimmicks and desperation tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore says Bradley has the wrong ideas on some issues, no ideas on some
others. He says Bradley's plan would blunder the economy into recession. And he
slaps at the style he ascribes to his rival. "A presidency is not an academic
exercise," Gore said. "It's not a seminar on a grand theory, it is a day to day
resolute fight."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plunge Pounds World Markets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. blue-chip stocks pushed upward today after yesterday's
big plunge but technology stocks still had a rather rough time as investors
cashed in on last year's record-shattering gains amid worries about the
profitability of Internet companies. However, tech stock losses were
substantially less than yesterday's.
</P>
<P>
	   European markets were down in late trading, but had recovered from their
lows of the day. Asian markets, which ended their trading before American
markets opened, suffered substantial losses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which plummeted almost 360 points Tuesday,
was up 102.07 at 11,100.00 at late morning. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index, which plunged a record 264 points Tuesday, was off an
additional 70.51 points, or by 1.8 percent, at 3,831.18.
</P>
<P>
	   Among unsettling factors for technology shares was news that Amazon.com's
losses were not narrowing, despite a jump in Christmas sales of books and music.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest rate jitters still gripped markets and investors appeared to take
little comfort in a decision today by the European Central Bank to hold interest
rates steady. There are widespread expectations that rates will rise in the
United States and overseas in the coming months, squeezing corporate profits,
cooling the economy and taking a toll on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, skirted direct
mention of boosting interest rates, but said inflation was rising, mainly due to
increasing energy costs, and would peak early this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest confirmation that the U.S. economy is growing with vigor,
keeping inflation fears afloat, the Commerce Department said today that American
factory orders for manufactured goods rose 1.2 percent in November, the first
increase since August, as companies producing electronic products enjoyed a
surge in demand.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading in Europe, major indexes were down 2.1 percent in
London, 3.4 percent in Paris and 0.74 percent in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   In Asia, traders staged a huge selloff today led by a big slide in prices on
the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of higher interest rates gripped exchanges virtually everywhere -- and
once-hot technology shares cooled off fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at British brokerage Greig Middleton and
Co. Ltd., blamed the selloff on an overreaction to long-standing concerns that
the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank might all
raise lending rates soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is being used as the excuse rather than the reason for people to bank
some of the fantastic profits they made on telecoms and Internet stocks last
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Central Bank left key interest rates unchanged at its regular
board meeting today. While the decision was expected, most economists predict a
rate increase by as early as March to guard against inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   High-tech shares may have lost some of their momentum, but Wood-Smith saw no
signs of an impending collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are the growth stocks of the 21st century, so although the bubble may
deflate occasionally, it ain't going to burst," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips on Asia's biggest market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, bounced back
from steep early losses but still finished with a 2.4 percent decline for the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   The mood was mostly gloomy throughout the region, with investors bailing out
of technology shares -- as they had on Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every sector had a clobbering here," said Eric Gale, senior dealer at the
Ord Minnett Ltd. brokerage in Sydney, Australia, where blue chips finished down
2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 1,226.10 points, or 7.2 percent, at 15,846.72. That represented
only a slight recovery from an early slide that pushed the Hang Seng down by 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second-worst point loss in history for Hong Kong, Asia's No. 2
market. The biggest point drop was the 1,438.31-point plunge of Oct. 28, 1997,
at the height of the Asian financial crises.
</P>
<P>
	   "Euphoria in Hong Kong is ending," said Frank Gong, economist and strategist
with the Bank of America. The Hang Seng had rung out 1999 with a record close
before setting yet another one Monday, the first day of trading in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index closed with a drop of 6.9
percent and its worst point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips finished down 5.5 percent in Singapore, another market that had
been setting records. Indonesian shares fell 3.2 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Philippine blue chips closed with a loss of 3.6 percent, while New Zealand
prices finished 2.4 percent lower. Thai stocks fell 6.5 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese blue chips finished 1.1 percent higher after recovering from an
early loss.

<HEADLINE> Defense lawyer blames fire department error led to fatal fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The lawyer for a Branford business owner charged
with arson murder claims mismanagement of the fire department cost a firefighter
his life.
<P>
	   The second trial of Anthony Bontatibus got underway Wednesday with jury
selection in Superior Court. Bontatibus' first trial in June 1998 ended with a
hung jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Bontatibus, 60, is accused of setting the fire in his Floors and More
business on Thanksgiving, 1996. Firefighter Edward Ramos, 36, died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be the defense in this case that the Branford Fire Department's
total mismanagement of this fire of unknown origin was what caused Edward Ramos'
death," defense lawyer Thomas Ullmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ullmann said the fire department underestimated the strength of the fire,
was too aggressive in attacking it and lacked accountability.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire Chief Peter Buonome said he supports the state's action against
Bontatibus.
</P>
<P>
	   "Arson fires are set with the intention to do harm, and that makes an arson
fire a very dangerous fire for firefighters to fight," Buonome said. "In our
case, if there wasn't an arson fire, there wouldn't be an arson death."
</P>
<P>
	   New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 1998 trial, Dearington painted Bontatibus as a man heavily in
debt, who set his business on fire to reap about $124,000 in insurance money.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers argued all the evidence pointed to gas and electrical
problems as the cause of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Fire Chief William Pepe testified at the first trial that he and
another firefighter escaped from the burning building as Ramos sprayed water on
them to keep the flames away.
</P>
<P>
	   He also testified that he was ordered not to go back in the building, since
it was believed that only six firefighters had gone into the building, and they
all had come out. Ramos apparently had slipped into the building unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Division of Occupational Health and Safety fined the fire
department for 15 violations in handling the fire. The department was ordered to
set up a system to account for the location of firefighters at fire scenes.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks were regaining lost ground in late trading
today in a strong attempt to rebound from Tuesday's white-knuckle declines.
</P>
<P>
	   But the turnaround came too late to help European stocks, which closed
lower, or Asian markets, which took heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which plummeted almost 360 points Tuesday,
was up 171.88 at 11,169.81 in late trading.
</P>
<P>
	   And while disappointing news from Amazon.com and BMC Software Inc. sent the
Nasdaq composite index down as much as 166.82 in the morning, by late afternoon
the index had recovered much of those losses. It was down 9.54 at 3,892.15 late
in the trading day as investors went bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday, the Nasdaq suffered a a record 264-point drop as investors took
profits following an unprecedented 85 percent surge in the technology-heavy
index in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors reacted to a negative report from Amazon.com, which said its
losses were not narrowing, despite a jump in Christmas sales of books and music.
Meanwhile, BMC Software warned that it's fiscal third-quarter profits will fall
short of expectations. The reports provided an incentive to take profits from a
rally that had lifted the Nasdaq an unprecedented 85 percent last year.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks began marching back from a steep decline
today as investors proved unwilling to abandon the shares that pumped up their
portfolios last year. Blue-chip stocks were sharply higher, bouncing back from
Tuesday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Nasdaq
composite index was down 18.31 at 3,883.38 after popping briefly into positive
territory. In earlier trading, the Nasdaq had dropped as much as 166 points and
appeared likely to extend Tuesday's plunge of a record 229 points, or 5.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 165.67 points, rising to 11,163.60
after losing 359.58 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the steep recovery in the Dow was a technical bounce in
response to Tuesday's drop, but they warned the blue chips' advance might not
last.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the way the market tries to find a bottom, by trial and error," said
Larry Wachtel, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The blue-chip index benefited from investors' move into cyclical stocks,
which rise and fall along with the broader economy and are generally seen as a
safer bet than technology or financial shares.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow was led higher by cyclical companies like DuPont, up 2 7/8 to 67
7/8, and 3M, up 4 5/8 to 95 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonethless, IBM was the Dow's strongest performers today, rising 6 11/16 to
118 3/4. A Bank of America analyst labeled the stock a "strong buy" and said the
share price should reach 150.
</P>
<P>
	   A broad market selloff that began Monday escalated on Tuesday as growing
fears of higher interest rates gave investors a reason to take some profits from
1999's meteoric gains, especially in the technology and Internet group.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those companies remained in a slump today. Yahoo! dropped 25 1/32 to
417 31/32, and Qualcomm fell 6 1/16 to 156.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com fell 10 1/8 to 71 13/16 after saying its quarterly losses would
widen because it overstocked for the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the trading session wore on, some of the shares that tumbled this
week attracted buyers at their new, lower prices. Software maker Intuit rose 12
5/16 to 73 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Market analysts continued to suggest that the wave of selling was overdue in
a market that sprinted to record levels at the close of 1999. Also, said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for Primark Global Economics, the extremely high prices
of many stocks set them up for a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any correction can be sharp, quick and sizeable," Sinai said. In fact,
Sinai believes a correction of 10 percent or more is likely, and would benefit
the market by allowing new buyers to step in.
</P>
<P>
	   Other stock measures were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.94
at 1,404.36. The Russell 2000 index was down 0.42 at 477.96.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancers were narrowly ahead of decliners on the New York Stock Exchange,
while on the Nasdaq Stock Market, advancers had a lead of about 10-to-9.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 861.13 million shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas markets were dragged lower by Tuesday's sellling frenzy on Wall
Street. Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.42 percent. In European trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.29 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.95
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.39 percent.

    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - A reserved copy of "The Blair Witch Project."

Santa's Salon &AMP; Spa.
<P>
	   From the video store to the pet grooming shop, the newly minted New York
neighbors of President Clinton and wife Hillary prepped for the first couple's
arrival Wednesday by promising nothing but the best in their Westchester County
home.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would be willing to offer my services, and I'm pleased to have her in
this little town," said hair stylist Santa Nikkels, owner of Santa's Salon &AMP;
Spa. "I would be able to do her hair at (her) home."
</P>
<P>
	   Nikkels was so thrilled by the Clintons' imminent arrival that she sent Mrs.
Clinton a letter volunteering her services.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told her, 'I'm excited because I'm new here, too,"' said Nikkels, an
Ecuadorian immigrant who opened her Chappaqua shop just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   While some residents in the hamlet of 17,000 have griped about the incessant
attention drawn by the Clintons, most people seemed eager to greet them in the
hours before the couple actually spent their first night in the $1.7 million
home.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's been some disturbance for the people on the (Clintons')
street," said Chappaqua resident Wilma Rapp, a customer at the Q Nails salon.
"Other than that, people feel pretty good about the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
	   "You tell somebody you live in Chappaqua and they say, 'Oh! Hillary!"'
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the more jaded townsfolk observed that Chappaqua's already hosted
its share of celebrities: presidential imitator Chevy Chase, Tony Award-winning
actress Glenn Close, New York Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of famous people who lived in this town, and still do," said
David Arco, owner of Chappaqua Limousine. Among the fares his company has
ferried in the last 50 years: President Richard Nixon and diplomat Averell
Harriman.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Blockbuster in neighboring Mount Kisco, assistant manager Carmita
DeVries said the staff would be willing to put a few videos aside for the
Clintons - if they called in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do that for everybody," DeVries stressed, making it clear there was no
preferential treatment. "It will be interesting to see what they rent. But of
course, we don't give out that information."
</P>
<P>
	   Christine DiPaulo, owner of Wags &AMP; Whiskers pet grooming, said the Secret
Service already had visited her store. When the presidential pets need a
shampoo, this will likely be the place.
</P>
<P>
	   The agents "asked if it would be all right if somebody stayed with the pet,"
DiPaulo said. "I said, 'Of course.' I don't really expect to see Mrs. Clinton,
though."
</P>
<P>
	   Town Supervisor Marion Sinek, who stopped outside the Clintons' home on
Wednesday, said the couple had chosen to live in Chappaqua for the same reason
as many locals.
</P>
<P>
	   No, not to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a beautiful suburb with beautiful streets like this," the Democratic
official said, standing on the Clintons' new block. "We are happy to have them.
We welcome them."

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Rise 1.2 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Factory orders rose 1.2 percent in November as strong
demand for electronic products gave American manufacturers their first increase
in orders since August.
</P>
<P>
	   The November advance followed no gain in October and a 1 percent decline in
September, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Orders had risen by 1.3
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebound in manufacturing was just one more piece of evidence that the
U.S. economy is showing little evidence of a slowdown, despite three interest
rate increases last year by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research in New York, said there was
little doubt the Fed will raise rates again at their first meeting this year, a
two-day session on Feb. 1-2, with more increases to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we get continued economic strength and tight labor markets, we are
looking for another three Fed rate hikes," Yamarone said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks, led by technology companies, had plunged Tuesday as investors grew
increasingly worried about the possibility of future Fed actions. The Dow Jones
industrial average, which suffered its fourth-worst point drop of all time
Tuesday, losing 360 points, recovered a bit Wednesday, rising by more than 200
points in late afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton announced Tuesday that he was nominating Alan Greenspan
for a fourth, four-year term as Fed chairman, something investors saw as
removing any uncertainty over the Fed's freedom to increase interest rates if
they saw the need to move.
</P>
<P>
	   For November, manufacturing orders increased by $4.5 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $365.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebound in demand was led by a $3 billion increase in orders for
electrical equipment, which rose 8.4 percent over the October level, the biggest
gain for this category since July 1998. Demand for electronic components, a
category that includes computer chips, shot up by 32.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for primary metals, including steel, rose 1.8 percent to $15.7
billion. Compared with a year earlier, orders for primary metals were up 8
percent, a hopeful sign for an industry battered by a flood of cheaper imports
since the Asian crisis started in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. steel industry succeeded in getting the government to impose stiff
anti-dumping tariffs on various steel products in an effort to stem the import
tide and combat layoffs that had cost thousands of steelworker jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for cars, planes and other transportation equipment actually fell by
3.5 percent in November to $45.1 billion, reflecting in large part a drop in
demand for aircraft and parts.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the volatile transportation category, overall factory orders would
have been up by 1.9 percent in November, the biggest advance since a 2.6 percent
rise in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Stan Shipley, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York, said that now
that South Korea, Thailand and other Asian crisis countries were mounting solid
economic rebounds, demand for U.S. manufactured goods was beginning to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   "Almost every indicator of industrial activity suggests that the factory
sector should have healthy gains in the months ahead," Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, rose
by 0.9 percent in November. This represented a downward revision from an advance
report two weeks ago that estimated durable-goods orders had risen 1.2 percent
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for nondurable goods were up 1.6 percent in November following a 1.1
percent October increase.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Legislative Agenda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Wednesday unveiled a 2000 legislative
agenda, highlighting a school revitalization plan that Democrats hope will give
them an advantage with voters this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton's plan consists mostly of efforts he pursued unsuccessfully last
year, such as hate crime legislation, gun restrictions, a minimum wage increase,
a patient's bill of rights and fixing Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was revealing his plan in a meeting with House and Senate Democratic
leaders about budget priorities for the next fiscal year. Afterward, he was
heading to Chappaqua, N.Y., to join his wife, who was moving into their new
house north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal will include a new program that devotes $1.3
billion a year for school construction. He also is seeking to revive earlier
efforts to use tax breaks to help communities upgrade existing schools. The plan
will be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he will send to Congress on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not expected to be embraced by the GOP-controlled Congress, which
consistently has been cool to his education proposals. But White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said there is a sense this year that Republican leaders will not be
able to thwart the plan during budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have found that we've been very effective in getting things done at the
table late in the process,'' Lockhart said. ``We're determined to get this
problem addressed any way we can, and if the Republican majority wants to block
it, we're going to find innovative ways to unblock it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan spotlights an election-year desire by the White House and
congressional Democrats to focus on education, an issue where they hold an
advantage over Republicans, according to polls. The edge exists even though the
GOP has tried to improve its image by abandoning plans to abolish the Department
of Education in favor of supporting added spending for schools.
</P>
<P>
	   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said Wednesday that
despite Clinton's proposal, the GOP is planning another school construction
proposal as part of an overall tax relief package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past two years, the House of Representatives passed plans to help
build and renovate public schools, but both times the president blocked them,''
Archer said. ``I hope this year that our schoolchildren will come before
politics, and that the president works with us. We need to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton's budget proposed using $3.7 billion in tax credits over
five years to help local governments issue close to $25 billion worth of bonds
for school repair and modernization. He said that would be enough to improve
5,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if that money had been approved, it would have addressed only a
fraction of the problem that school and construction industry groups say exists.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that renovation
and repair of America's schools would cost $112 billion, with an additional $60
billion needed to provide space for an expected 3 million new students over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   That report also said a third of the nation's elementary and secondary
schools need some repair, with 14 million children attending class in
substandard buildings. Almost half the schools lacked the wiring needed to
accommodate computer systems, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is exactly the type of program that's needed,'' said Dan Wilson,
senior director of federal affairs for the American Institute of Architects.
``If we don't do something, it's a national disgrace.''

<HEADLINE> Doors May Be Closing on Nominations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan, a Republican, may find a confirmation
express waiting for him when his nomination to a fourth term as Fed chairman
reaches the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   But dozens of other less popular nominations, including many
long-languishing judicial ones, may end up stranded in the station.
</P>
<P>
	   Many lawyers and lower-court jurists who thought they would be federal
judges by now are cooling their heels.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Paez, a Mexican-American federal judge in Los Angeles, has been
waiting for four years for a vote on his nomination to the federal appeals
bench. Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco labor lawyer, has been waiting two years
to become a federal appeals judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate leaders have promised votes on Paez and Berzon by March 15. But there
are no such agreements on any of the other administration nominees languishing
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Career diplomat Peter Burleigh, promised the ambassadorship to the
Philippines by President Clinton after his widely praised service last year as
acting U.N. ambassador during the Kosovo crisis, is back in Washington,
officially ``on leave,'' awaiting a confirmation vote that may never come.
</P>
<P>
	   His nomination is hung up in an unrelated dispute over the State
Department's treatment of a whistleblower.
</P>
<P>
	   Nominees for other top State Department posts and other federal agencies
remain in limbo.
</P>
<P>
	   With Clinton's term nearing an end, Senate Republicans hopeful of
recapturing the White House have little motivation to move on any nominations --
especially ones that may be controversial or judicial ones involving lifetime
posts. After all, in less than a year Americans will select a new president --
so what's the rush?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats are howling. But they did approximately the same thing when they
controlled Congress and Ronald Reagan's term was winding down in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's too much of it played by both parties,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D. ``It's hard enough to get good people to put themselves through the meat
grinder that the Senate confirmation process has become.''
</P>
<P>
	   The traditional reluctance to move on nominations in the final year of an
opposition-party president's term is aggravated by a growing tendency of
individual senators to put ``holds'' on nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   By custom, any senator can block any nomination -- at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., has served notice he will use parliamentary
procedures to try to block all remaining Clinton judicial nominations. He claims
Clinton violated a promise to the Senate not to make certain ``recess''
appointments without prior consultation with senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, calls Inhofe's threat ``reckless and disproportionate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's Web site, updated earlier this week, lists 73 openings in
the federal judiciary -- 48 district court and 24 court of appeals vacancies.
Clinton has 35 nominations pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot fight crime without trials and judges,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, cites ``substantial
progress in maintaining a low vacancy rate in federal judgeships,'' Chief
Justice William Rehnquist has complained of severe backlogs in the federal court
system.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 33 new judges were confirmed, down from 65 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Confirmations are ``always a problem in the final year of a president's
tenure,'' said Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Ornstein added, ``There's no question it's gotten worse. Some nominees who
were put forward three and four years ago are twisting in the wind. And there
are people like Inhofe who abuse the process by keeping all kinds of individuals
hostage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inhofe is protesting Clinton's appointment last month during the Senate
recess of Sara M. Fox, a former union lawyer, to another five-year-term as a
member of the National Labor Relations Board. With the recess appointment, she
can serve without Senate confirmation until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Her name was not on a White House list of potential recess appointments,
Inhofe fumed. But the White House claims it cleared the nomination with Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott spokesman John Czwartacki confirmed that the White House ``did inform
us at some point prior to the recess'' of Clinton's intention. But that doesn't
prevent Inhofe and other conservatives from using their senatorial prerogatives
to mount delaying tactics, Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats might be lamenting that less-popular nominations can't be attached
to more popular ones like amendments on bills -- so they could load them all on
the shoulders of Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, ``We're used to battles around here,'' White House
spokesman Jake Siewert said Tuesday.

<TEXT>
    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - The population of this well-to-do Westchester
hamlet increased by two Wednesday, and everybody noticed: President and Hillary
Clinton headed north to spend their first night in their new $1.7 million home.
<P>
	   "I think every American can understand it's quite an exciting event to move
into a house," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters before the
first couple arrived in their new Westchester County home.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, Mrs. Clinton - who needs a New York address to mount her run for
the U.S. Senate - was scheduled to arrive alone to unpack. An unexpected break
in the president's schedule allowed him to accompany the first lady, Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' furniture and other goods arrived Tuesday afternoon in two
moving vans. The president has said they plan to live in Chappaqua after he
leaves office in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before their arrival in the upscale suburb of 17,000, the Clintons had
caused several minor stirs.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, protesters upset by U.S. policy in East Timor marched outside
the home - even though it was still vacant. In November, the government squashed
plans to sell T-shirts reading "Secret Service, Chappaqua Bureau, Presidential
Detail," saying use of the Secret Service label was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Local officials soon made parking on the Clintons' cul-de-sac illegal to
spare neighbors any imposition from the media. Authorities also approved
installation of an 8-foot fence and a guard booth on the Clintons' property;
neither is yet in place.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican
opponent in this year's U.S. Senate race, played on the "carpetbagger" theme he
has use against Mrs. Clinton in offering a backhanded welcome to she and the
president.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very, very proud of the fact that people from around the country
want to come to New York, including people from Arkansas," Giuliani said. "We
welcome all newcomers, and recognize the fact that they are newcomers."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki, another Republican, offered similar sentiments during
his state of the state address.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why, even people from Hope, Arkansas, understand that New York is the best
state to live in," he said in Albany.

<HEADLINE> State education board toughens GPA requirement for prospective  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Prospective teachers will have to make better
grades in college if they want to make it into New Jersey's classrooms.
<P>
	   The state Board of Education on Wednesday approved new rules requiring
students in New Jersey colleges to earn a grade-point average of 2.75, or a
B-minus, to be eligible to teach. Previously, they had to earn 2.5, a C average.
</P>
<P>
	   Education students from other states and "alternate route" teachers would
also have to make that grade. Previously, these teacher candidates had no
minimum grade-point average to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   The new rules take effect for students who will enter their junior year in
September 2000 and to alternate route candidates who apply after that time,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The change could render an estimated 20 percent of prospective teachers
unfit for the classroom, with alternate route teachers being hardest hit. A
recent state survey suggests 33 percent of alternate route candidates would be
ineligible to teach.
</P>
<P>
	   Alternate route teachers typically have degrees in subjects other than
education and become eligible to teach through a special state certification
program.
</P>
<P>
	   In a survey conducted last summer, 19 percent of a pool of about 300
candidates would have failed to make the 2.75 grade requirement, said Ellen
Schechter, assistant education commissioner. That includes alternate route and
out-of-state candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   About one-third of alternate route candidates had GPAs below 2.75, compared
to 9 percent of in-state traditional students and 21 percent of out-of-state
students.
</P>
<P>
	   About 25 percent of new teachers hired in New Jersey come to the classroom
through the alternate route, Schecter said. Half of new teachers are in-state
students and the other 25 percent are students from out-of-state colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark Superintendent Marion Bolden said the district, like many urban
schools, has a hard time recruiting new teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Am I concerned about a diminishing pool of minority teachers? Yes," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said she was unsure whether the new requirement will cause a more
severe teacher shortage for urban districts.
</P>
<P>
	   James Harris, education coordinator for the New Jersey chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, is convinced it
will.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will make it more difficult, not easier," Harris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The entire policy is questionable, he said, because no research shows that
students with higher GPAs are necessarily better teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Schechter said the department's informal survey conducted last summer
showed the higher requirement cut evenly across racial lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Education Commissioner David Hespe said he hopes the higher standard will
prompt students to achieve better grades rather than reduce the supply of
teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're focusing on teacher quality in New Jersey," Hespe said. "If we want a
heavier academic focus, this is what we need to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman originally proposed the idea in her 1999 State of the
State address. "C-plus isn't good enough," she declared, saying prospective
teachers should maintain at least a B average in college. The final proposal,
however, only raises the bar to a B-minus.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Wednesday, the state board heard a proposal to increase the minimum
number of students who must pass state tests in fourth and eighth grades from 75
percent to 85 percent. The requirement would not kick in until spring 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   Districts that fail to meet this benchmark would receive "conditional" state
certification and would have to work to improve their students' scores, Hespe
said. The board may act on the plan as early as April.
</P>
<P>
	   High schools already have to show that 85 percent of their students can pass
the 11th grade test to gain state certification.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Marks Takeover Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers celebrated the fifth anniversary of
their historic takeover of the House on Wednesday by trumpeting their
accomplishments and playing down the danger that they will be ousted from power
next November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have changed the nation's fiscal landscape,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference. The 1995 takeover marked
the first time the GOP had control of the House in four decades.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans listed among their greatest achievements of the past five
years the overhaul of the welfare system, the balancing of the federal budget,
increased local control over education spending, tax relief and more money for
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton White House, which has struggled constantly with Congress since
both chambers came under GOP control in 1995, says it deserves much of the
credit for bringing the budget in balance and improving education in the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts and some 60 House GOP members are meeting this week to discuss how to
get their message out in preparation for the reopening of Congress on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans arrived in January 1995, with an aggressively conservative
class of 73 House freshmen and a new speaker, Newt Gingrich, determined to bring
about radical changes to the way Washington did business.
</P>
<P>
	   While some aspects of his ``Contract with America,'' such as welfare and
anti-crime legislation, did become law, others, such as legal and regulatory
reforms, were less successful, and Gingrich resigned after House Republicans
lost seats in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
	   Gingrich, who in the past year has been involved in very public divorce
proceedings, was not mentioned at the anniversary press conference. Asked about
the omission, Watts said that while Gingrich helped lead the charge in the GOP
revolution, ``we want to focus on the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans face a tough future, trying to carry out their agenda of tax
cuts and lower government spending with a slim majority in the House of 222-212,
with one independent who usually votes with the Democrats. In addition, 21 House
Republicans have announced they are retiring at the end of this session, against
only six Democrats, boosting Democratic chances of recapturing the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican majority in the Senate, 55-45, appears secure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our vital signs show that we are in very good shape,'' Watts insisted,
saying that Republicans will stay on the offensive in battling the White House
on such issues as tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Rise in Military Housing Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose in his nearly completed
2001 budget an increase in housing allowances for members of the military who
live off base, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra money is part of a package of financial incentives to keep troops
from leaving the service and to attract more recruits.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen was scheduled to announce the proposed
increase in housing allowances during a visit Thursday to Camp Pendleton,
Calif., a major Marine Corps base north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials who disclosed the planned increase Wednesday would not
reveal details.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen has said in several recent appearances with U.S. troops abroad that
housing allowances should go up. During a stop in Naples, Italy, on Dec. 21,
Cohen told sailors and Marines that he was determined to improve housing and
health care for troops during his final year as Pentagon chief in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to do our level best to make sure you and your family have
the best we can provide,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's budget gave military members a 4.8 percent across-the-board pay
raise, the largest since 1981. Congress also made a one-time adjustment to the
Pentagon's pay scales, so that about 75 percent of all service members will
receive extra pay raises on July 1 ranging up to an additional 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   As more bases have closed in recent years, military members have
consolidated at a smaller number of locations -- in many cases finding
themselves in more expensive real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasing allowances for those who live off base is one of several aspects
of Cohen's plan for improving housing. The others are using military
construction funds to repair or replace some of the 200,000 military housing
units judged to be substandard, and using private contractors to build more
on-base housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year the Army signed a 50-year, $3 billion contract with Carson
Family Housing of Charlotte, N.C., to privatize family housing at Fort Carson,
Colo. The privatization approach is meant to achieve housing improvements more
quickly than through the traditional use of government construction funds.

<HEADLINE> Hartford's improved test scores may be enough to meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Higher scores on the 1999 Connecticut Mastery
Test are part of the broader process of improving the Hartford public schools,
the schools superintendent says.
<P>
	   Hartford students improved more in a single year than in the past four years
combined on the standardized tests given to students in fourth, sixth and eighth
grades.
</P>
<P>
	   "These scores signify a beginning, not an end," said Matt Losak, a spokesman
for Superintendent of Schools Anthony S. Amato. "We have a lot more work to do.
We have every reason to be proud that we're on the right track."
</P>
<P>
	   Losak also credited the schools' board of trustees, teachers and the
teachers' union with improving the scores.
</P>
<P>
	   Math scores among fourth graders increased 13 percent and reading and
writing scores rose 7 percent from 1998 to 1999. Writing scores among sixth
graders rose by 7 percent; reading scores by 11 percent and math scores by 21
percent. Eighth-grade math scores improved by 11 percent; reading scores by 12
percent and writing scores rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   When he took the helm of Hartford's troubled schools on April 1, Amato, a
former district superintendent in New York City, promised Hartford parents that
their children would "never be last again" on a statewide scoring index.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford ranks 164th out of 164 school districts statewide. Although a new
index has not been calculated officially, sources told The Hartford Courant on
Tuesday it appears Hartford's double-digit gains in math and reading would be
enough to lift the city out of last place.
</P>
<P>
	   "Superintendent Amato is more interested in how we did against ourselves
than any other district," Losak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The district has not said that the scores would raise Hartford from the
bottom of the index, Losak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford's index score of 41.1 last year was 4.9 points behind New Haven and
5.3 points behind Windham. Although New Haven's test scores improved in most
categories, the city did not see the significant gains that Hartford did.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources told The Courant they expect Hartford will climb past New Haven on
the index, and could pass one or more other districts.

<HEADLINE> In a new era, New Jersey politicos say 'liberal' not a dirty word  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It seems "liberal" might not be a dirty word
anymore.
<P>
	   The advent of a new decade, new century, new millennium heralds a time when
tired words of the past year can be redefined or discarded.
</P>
<P>
	   And one political word due to be recast is "liberal." Or, more to the point,
political candidates are exhibiting less fear of being branded as such when they
propose ambitious and costly spending programs.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey has played a big role in America's new flirtation with liberal
ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider:
</P>
<P>
	   "Amidst historic prosperity, society is doing far too little to secure
fairness, to help the poor, to bring down economic barriers and lift up those
who have been left out," says Year 2000 political hopeful Number One. "The
private sector, and the market's invisible hand, will not always serve the
public interest unless government challenges or requires that it do so."
</P>
<P>
	   A second hopeful says: "We must remember we (government) have done the big
things in the past. We can do the big things in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   And "If you want to help working families in America today you have to start
with unions. We must end child poverty. We must raise the minimum wage and
expand the earned income tax credit."
</P>
<P>
	   Liberal sentiments in full.
</P>
<P>
	   The first is from Jon Corzine, the self-financing newcomer seeking the
Democratic nomination to run for the U.S. Senate begin vacated by Frank
Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   The second set belongs to Bill Bradley. The former New Jersey senator is
giving Vice President Al Gore fits in the fight for the Democratic nomination
for president.
</P>
<P>
	   "In good economic times, being a liberal is not necessarily a bad thing,"
said Rider University political analyst David Rebovich. "There seems to be money
to go around, and people are willing to at least entertain what would in the
past seem like overly generous or overly expensive programs."
</P>
<P>
	   Said Steve Goldstein, Corzine's campaign manager for policy: "I don't know
if you call it a resurgence of progressivism, but it seems pretty close to that.
People are talking about a pro-active government the way people have not talked
about it for decades."
</P>
<P>
	   But this liberal ideal for the 2000s is a new variety. It comes with limits,
price tags and a quest for earthy credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Emma Byrne, a senior adviser in the Bradley campaign, was on former Gov. Jim
Florio's staff when the public reacted furiously to his tax increases in the
early '90s. She said the difference today with Bradley is the origin of his
so-called liberal ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is living rooms and community centers and town meetings," she said.
"When you find ways to touch people directly and look them in the eye, there's
no room for labels to get in the way."
</P>
<P>
	   Rebovich said, "Candidates can afford to be more liberal-sounding now in
general because there is public recognition that there is a balance of power in
Washington. We recognize that the liberals are not going to go haywire, they are
not going to run away with everything."
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone thinks the new liberal impulse will prove terribly durable.
</P>
<P>
	   Former U.S. Rep. Dick Zimmer, who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate as a
Republican in 1996, said money issues will come home to roost with things like
Corzine's promises of universal health care and federal spending on education.
He said both parties now regard a balanced budget as sacred.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was ticking in my head the costs of the universal this and the universal
that that Corzine was proposing, and it sounded to me like a trillion-dollar
speech," Zimmer said. "He is a Wall Street mega-millionaire who can propose,
pardon the expression, liberal programs. The fact that he has proposed some
incredibly expensive programs will hurt him."
</P>
<P>
	   "They are out-liberalizing each other," said Republican lobbyist Roger
Bodman.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the Democratic primaries are decided, "I think you will see them
sprinting to the center of the political spectrum," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is any great sea change, millennium or not, among the
American people," he added. "I think moderation will rule."

<HEADLINE> NYC Ballet Starts Regular Repertoire  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York City Ballet, whose scheduled opening night was
canceled by a musicians' strike, "waltzed into the millennium" with its
orchestra playing for five ballets.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's evening of ballets, all danced to waltzes, concluded with George
Balanchine's gloriously lush, five-part "Vienna Waltzes." It followed the
traditional season of Balanchine's "The Nutcracker."
</P>
<P>
	   Opening night, Nov. 23, was to have presented eight short ballets and ballet
excerpts. That program was canceled but "The Nutcracker" began, as scheduled
Nov. 26, with recorded music. The strike was settled and musicians returned to
the pit for the Dec. 7 "Nutcracker."
</P>
<P>
	   The winter repertoire season, which runs until Feb. 27 at the New York State
Theater, began with the one-time-only waltz program.
</P>
<P>
	   First came Balanchine's pink and green "Garland Dance," which includes
children from the School of American Ballet. It was followed by "Valse Triste,"
choreographed by Peter Martins. An ethereal Darci Kistler was partnered with
Jock Soto. This is definitely a ballerina's star turn.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvonne Borree and Benjamin Millepied were perky in Balanchine's
"Valse-Fantaisie." Martins' "The Waltz Project" was a supremely clever modern
piece for four couples, using music by 10 contemporary composers.
</P>
<P>
	   Hugo Fiorato conducted.

<HEADLINE> DC Leaders Scrutinize School Board  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mayor of the nation's capital and other city leaders
called Wednesday for a referendum that could abolish the city's oldest elected
body -- the school board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current leadership has become too political and divisive as schools
crumble,'' said Mayor Anthony Williams, who is seeking a mandate from the
district's voters that would give him authority to appoint school trustees and
hire a superintendent.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Williams' proposal, trustee appointments would require confirmation by
the district's 13-member city council.
</P>
<P>
	   The council's Education and Libraries Committee is expected to finalize
wording of the legislation within 10 days and move toward a first hearing by the
council on January 18, said City Councilwoman Kathleen Patterson. Williams is
seeking to place the referendum on a citywide ballot in May.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved, Williams' initiative would do away with the oldest elected
offices in district government. Since April 1968, the 11-member board has played
a role in running the district's schools. Former Mayor Marion Barry began his
28-year political career on the school board.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining test scores and fiscal problems have increased interventions by
various entities, including a presidentially appointed financial control board
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Responsibility is divided among the superintendent, the board of
education, the board of trustees, Congress, the control board, the mayor and
council,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system we have today enables everyone to point the finger at everybody
else, '' said City Councilman Jack Evans, citing a survey he commissioned prior
to his unsuccessful 1998 bid for mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Although nearly two dozen community leaders spoke Wednesday in support of
the changes, skepticism remains among some parents' groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We see a council and a mayor who tend to spend less on education,'' said
Delabian Rice-Thurston, director of Parents United. The community activist
contends that the nearly 71,000 students enrolled in district schools could
suffer under the mayor's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best the parents of school-aged children represent just 30 percent of
the registered voters in the district,'' said Rice-Thurston, whose group's
complaints led to repairs to correct extensive fire code violations in most of
the city's schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the elected school board noted that nine of their 11 members have
been newly elected in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're proposing three months to turn this around,'' said Rev. Robert G.
Childs, who was elected school board president this week. Roberts has pledged to
restore community confidence in the current board.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Probes Fatal Greyhound Case  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDE R. MARX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sleepy, drugged driver and poor safety procedures
contributed to a Greyhound bus crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike that killed
seven people and injured 16 others in June 1998, federal investigators said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board determined that Milton Wisner's
alertness was adversely impacted by an antihistamine and Greyhound Lines Inc.'s
scheduling of irregular work periods for its drivers. The board also said the
Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission's practice of allowing non-emergency parking in
pull-off areas contributed to the accident's severity.
</P>
<P>
	   Greyhound Executive Vice President Jack W, Haugsland disputed the findings
and said fatigue was ``not a major factor'' in causing the accident. He said
studies by their pathologists indicated Wisner had suffered a heart attack, a
claim the board specifically rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Haugsland also said the company's scheduling and safety were sound, noting
that the company has a good safety record.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission spokeswoman Kathy Liebler said the agency
would not comment on the board's findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisner, 61, of Boothwyn, Pa., suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome and had
complained to his physician about it. He was taking an antihistamine to combat a
chronic sinus problem. In addition, NTSB records indicated that Wisner had been
involved in seven accidents since 1990 and had been cited for speeding twice.
One of those incidents resulted in his being suspended for five days.
</P>
<P>
	   He was on his last run before retiring, driving in a mountainous area, when
at about 4:30 a.m. on June 20, 1998, his bus ran into a tractor-trailer legally
parked in a roadside area about 60 miles west of Harrisburg. The crash pushed
the truck into the back of another truck parked in front of it.
</P>
<P>
	   The bus left New York City with 23 passengers and had stopped in
Philadelphia on its way to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisner, his wife and an 8-year-old boy in their care were killed along with
four other passengers. The truck's two co-drivers, who had been asleep in the
cab, were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The board criticized Greyhound's ``lax'' procedures in documenting safety
violations and monitoring the ``widespread speeding'' of its drivers. The board
said the company does not adequately respond to consumer complaints about
safety, saying it had taken no action when a woman complained about Wisner's
driving habits.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB recommended that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
require that signs over emergency exits be constructed to illuminate in the dark
and that all buses be equipped with emergency lights with self-contained,
independent power sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Greyhound should revise its scheduling process, improve its record keeping,
and insure that complaints made on its 800 line are acted on and placed in
drivers' files, the board said.
</P>
<P>
	   And it recommended that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission prohibit
non-emergency parking in pull-off areas adjacent to the highway, provide
adequate rest areas for nonemergency parking, and conduct more drills to improve
handling of large-scale disasters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stocks Start Recovery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. blue-chip stocks regained some lost ground today in a
rebound from Tuesday's white-knuckle declines, while technology shares remained
under pressure but bounced back from a steep selloff early in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnaround came too late to help European stocks, which closed lower, or
Asian markets, which took heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which plummeted almost 360 points Tuesday,
ended up 124.72 to close at 11,122.65 in extremely heavy trading, according to
preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
	   And while disappointing news from Amazon.com and BMC Software Inc. sent the
Nasdaq composite index down as much as 166.82 in the morning, the index made a
strong bid at a comeback to close with a decline of 24.08 at 3,877.61, according
to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday, the Nasdaq suffered a a record 264-point drop as investors took
profits following an unprecedented 85 percent surge in the technology-heavy
index in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest rate jitters still gripped markets and investors appeared to take
little comfort in a decision today by the European Central Bank to hold interest
rates steady. There are widespread expectations that rates will rise in the
United States and overseas in the coming months, squeezing corporate profits,
cooling the economy and taking a toll on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, skirted direct
mention of boosting interest rates, but said inflation was rising, mainly due to
increasing energy costs, and would peak early this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest confirmation that the U.S. economy is growing with vigor,
keeping inflation fears afloat, the Commerce Department said today that American
factory orders for manufactured goods rose 1.2 percent in November, the first
increase since August, as companies producing electronic products enjoyed a
surge in demand.
</P>
<P>
	   In Europe, major indexes fell 1.95 percent in London, 3.39 percent in Paris
and 1.29 percent in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   In Asia, traders staged a huge selloff today led by a big slide in prices on
the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of higher interest rates gripped exchanges virtually everywhere -- and
once-hot technology shares cooled off fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at British brokerage Greig Middleton and
Co. Ltd., blamed the selloff on an overreaction to long-standing concerns that
the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank might all
raise lending rates soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is being used as the excuse rather than the reason for people to bank
some of the fantastic profits they made on telecoms and Internet stocks last
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Central Bank left key interest rates unchanged at its regular
board meeting today. While the decision was expected, most economists predict a
rate increase by as early as March to guard against inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   High-tech shares may have lost some of their momentum, but Wood-Smith saw no
signs of an impending collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are the growth stocks of the 21st century, so although the bubble may
deflate occasionally, it ain't going to burst," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips on Asia's biggest market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, bounced back
from steep early losses but still finished with a 2.4 percent decline for the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   The mood was mostly gloomy throughout the region, with investors bailing out
of technology shares -- as they had on Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every sector had a clobbering here," said Eric Gale, senior dealer at the
Ord Minnett Ltd. brokerage in Sydney, Australia, where blue chips finished down
2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 1,226.10 points, or 7.2 percent, at 15,846.72. That represented
only a slight recovery from an early slide that pushed the Hang Seng down by 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second-worst point loss in history for Hong Kong, Asia's No. 2
market. The biggest point drop was the 1,438.31-point plunge of Oct. 28, 1997,
at the height of the Asian financial crises.
</P>
<P>
	   "Euphoria in Hong Kong is ending," said Frank Gong, economist and strategist
with the Bank of America. The Hang Seng had rung out 1999 with a record close
before setting yet another one Monday, the first day of trading in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index closed with a drop of 6.9
percent and its worst point loss in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips finished down 5.5 percent in Singapore, another market that had
been setting records. Indonesian shares fell 3.2 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Philippine blue chips closed with a loss of 3.6 percent, while New Zealand
prices finished 2.4 percent lower. Thai stocks fell 6.5 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese blue chips finished 1.1 percent higher after recovering from an
early loss.

<HEADLINE> Pataki responds to dark year in schooling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Responding to a dark year in education, Gov. George
Pataki on Wednesday called for school children to adhere to codes of conduct and
teachers to undergo background checks and crisis training.
<P>
	   "He's responding to things that people have been talking about," Democratic
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said after Pataki's State of the State speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's plan - called "Schools 2000" - follows last year's well-publicized
rash of school shootings in Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia and other states. While
his state was spared the violence epitomized by the massacre at Columbine High,
Pataki has stressed that school safety should go hand-in-hand with the ongoing
campaign to bring more accountability to New York's educational system.
</P>
<P>
	   "Schools 2000 will create safe schools for our children and families, ensure
that all our children have a qualified teacher and insist that failing schools
are held accountable," the governor told the Legislature Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki wants all school districts to establish codes of conduct that would
cover everything from appropriate standards for language and dress to rules for
expulsion of students. He again called for teachers to get the power to banish
unruly students from their classrooms for up to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said all districts should also be required to teach students
about "civility, character and citizenship" and instruct them on "principles
including honesty, tolerance ... (and) observance of laws and rules, courtesy
and dignity."
</P>
<P>
	   Those proposals were largely taken from the 1999 recommendations of a task
force on school violence appointed by Pataki and chaired by Lt. Gov. Mary
Donohue.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver applauded the governor for his concern but noted that Pataki didn't
mention anything about new gun control laws. "Guns in our schools, guns on our
streets ... He didn't touch on that at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki also called for creation of a statewide database that would track all
violent crimes in schools and mandatory violence prevention training for
teachers and school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   All of Pataki's proposals would have to be approved by the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's problems last year came in trying to move to higher educational
standards, as seen in reports of teacher-approved cheating on standardized tests
in New York City and statewide test results showing more than half of last
year's fourth graders failing a standardized English test.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's plan would battle the problem by getting more teachers into the
schools that would need them.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki called for the creation of 5,000 awards that would cover tuition
costs of up to $3,400 a year - equivalent to tuition at State University of New
York campuses - for prospective teachers agreeing to work in areas of the state
with chronic teacher shortages.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also called for creation of "alternative credentialing" of
teacher that would allow people who have lived lives of accomplishments to serve
as classroom teachers, even though they don't have traditional teacher training.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, Colin Powell can't teach in the New York schools that he grew up
in," Pataki said. "Billy Joel is not 'qualified' to teach piano to kids on Long
Island."
</P>
<P>
	   Education Commissioner Richard Mills and Regent Chancellor Carl Hayden both
applauded Pataki's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have the governor of the state of New York giving a powerful recruiting
message for teachers," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone approved, however. Alan Lubin, executive vice president of New
York State United Teachers union, called Pataki's plan unrealistic. He says
there's already a system that would allow non-teachers to get a waiver to teach
for a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter how talented, Billy Joel or any other prospective teacher must
prove they can cut it in the classroom and show mastery of teaching methods," he
said. "Just because someone has knowledge doesn't mean they have the ability to
impart it to others."
</P>
<P>
	   Hayden and Mills pointed out that Pataki made no mention of scaling back on
the Regents' plan to increase educational standards. Seniors for the first time
will have to have passed a Regents' education test to graduate this year. Some
lawmakers and educators have been complaining that the students have not be
adequately prepared to pass that test and have been advocating changes.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there was ever a question about that, it has been answered," Hayden
said. "He's pledging the support that we need."

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 124.72; Nasdaq Off 12.85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors moved back into the battered stock market today,
sending the Dow Jones industrials sharply higher and helping the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite edge back from a steep decline to finish
modestly lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.72 to 11,122.65. The blue-chip
index had risen as much as 216 points in earlier trading; it lost 359.58
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq ended a highly volatile session with a loss of 23.85 points at
3,877.84. In early trading, the index fell as much as 166 points and appeared
likely to extend yesterday's plunge of a record 229 points, or 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But buyers stepped in during the afternoon session, sending the Nasdaq index
briefly into positive territory.
</P>
<P>
	   "The selling just kind of ran its course," said Bill Schneider, head of
block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. "People don't like to be out of this
market."
</P>
<P>
	   The catalyst for steep selling on Monday and Tuesday -- fear of rising
interest rates -- remained in the background of the market today. Bond yields
rose, hurting shares of many banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
	   And investors began shifting into cyclical stocks, which follow the fortunes
of the broader economy and are generally seen as a safer bet than technology or
financial shares when interest rates are rising.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow was led higher by cyclical companies like DuPont and 3M.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, IBM was the Dow's strongest performers today. A Bank of America
analyst labeled the stock a "strong buy" and said the share price should reach
150.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts were wary of the Dow's recovery, suggesting it was a mere
technical bounce in response to Tuesday's drop and warning that the blue chips'
advance might not last.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the way the market tries to find a bottom, by trial and error," said
Larry Wachtel, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   As interest rate worries have knocked the market off-balance, some investors
have found a reason to take some profits from 1999's meteoric gains, especially
in the technology and Internet group.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those companies remained in a slump today. Yahoo! and Qualcomm fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com fell after saying its quarterly losses would widen because it
overstocked for the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the trading session wore on, some of the shares that tumbled this
week attracted buyers at their new, lower prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the absence of downward pressure, a little value-hunting took place,"
Schneider said. Software maker Intuit rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts continued to suggest that the wave of selling was overdue in a
market that sprinted to record levels at the close of 1999. Also, said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for Primark Global Economics, the extremely high prices
of many stocks set them up for a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any correction can be sharp, quick and sizeable," Sinai said. In fact,
Sinai believes a correction of 10 percent or more is likely, and would benefit
the market by allowing new buyers to step in.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas markets were dragged lower by Tuesday's sellling frenzy on Wall
Street. Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.42 percent. In European trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.29 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.95
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.39 percent.

<HEADLINE> NBC Announces Agreement With NAACP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC struck a deal with the NAACP on Wednesday to
systematically find more minorities to write, produce and direct its television
shows, removing the threat of a boycott against the network.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC said it had reached a similar agreement, though the NAACP did not
immediately confirm that. Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, predicted accords would be reached soon
with ABC, CBS and Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   In NBC's case, what began last summer as a protest against the scarcity of
minority cast members on the fall broadcast schedule resulted in a deal that
almost exclusively affects people behind the cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that some of the criticism helped to send an alarm throughout
the entire industry," said Mfume, whose organization is establishing a Hollywood
office to monitor network progress.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has agreed to hire at least one new minority writer next fall for all of
its second-year shows, and is encouraging producers to hire minorities in
creative positions. The network will also boost its support for various job
training and internship programs to get more minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has also promised to double its purchasing from minority-owned
businesses over the next 18 months, for an additional $10 million in spending.
Mfume and top NBC executives will run an all-day seminar next month for
producers and studio heads to come up with more ideas for increasing diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   The network also pledged to discourage the practice of assigning minority
writers to programs largely with minority themes.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP had threatened a boycott after complaining about the "virtual
whitewash" in new programming this fall. The threat hung over all four networks,
with the NAACP never specifying which one it considered to have the biggest
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   If negotiations with other networks don't bear fruit within the next 10
days, the NAACP may still resort to a boycott against them, Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
	   The toughest part of the often-tense negotiations with the NAACP came in
admitting the network needed to do more, said NBC President Bob Wright. NBC
thought it was doing well in this area, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our goal is to make it unequivocally clear that NBC is committed to
diversity," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume said it was important to change the employment practices because if
more minorities are in position to create shows and decide what gets on the air,
more diverse casts and programming options will naturally follow.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC distributed a "statement of understanding" that said it is dedicated to
joining the NAACP in "increasing the degree of diversity in the network
television industry both in front of and behind the camera and to attaining
long-term ... solutions in the areas of hiring, promotion, pipeline development
and procurement."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC promised meetings between its personnel executives and the NAACP to
discuss minority hiring.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume recalled how, as a youngster, it was so unusual to see black people on
television that he ran around his neighborhood to alert people when one was on.
When Bill Cosby was hired as a regular cast member of "I Spy" in the 1960s, it
was a groundbreaking moment.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the 1970s, television has regressed in its depiction of minorities --
and both TV executives and the NAACP must share the blame, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People took their eyes off the issue and assumed the issue would take care
of itself," he said.

	   Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown raised its rating on the stock from "market
perform" to "buy," saying it expects the share price to reach 78 within a year.

quarter, lower than the 30 cents projected by analysts. CIBC World Markets and
Merrill Lynch lowered their ratings on the stock.

<P>
	   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the stock. An analyst said the
stock has already reached Morgan Stanley's price target, and could suffer if
interest rates increase later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The giant online retailer said fourth-quarter sales more than doubled from a
year ago, but quarterly losses will widen because it overstocked for the holiday
season. Some analysts had expected a bigger rise in sales.

	   The online magazine unveiled a content partnership pact with Red Hat Inc.,
the distributor of the Linux operating system. Red Hat will feature technology
news and commentary from Salon on its recently launched "Wide Open News" Web

cents to 44 cents a share, below analysts' estimates of 53 cents per share. BMC,
a maker of computer-management software, cited underperforming North American
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   A J.C. Bradford analyst widened his estimate of the company's fourth-quarter

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Legislative Agenda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday his legislative agenda
will focus on revitalizing public schools, declaring American children should
not have to put up with leaking roofs and busted windows. He hopes the focus on
fixing crumbling schools will give Democrats an election year edge.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton discussed budget priorities with House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. Afterward, the
president said his top priority will be funding programs to repair or renovate
dilapidated schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't expect our students to meet high academic standards if their
schools don't even meet high building standards,'' Clinton said. ``Our New
Year's resolution is to reach across party lines to help our children reach for
the sky.''
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, Clinton's agenda consists mostly of efforts he pursued
unsuccessfully last year, such as hate crime legislation, gun restrictions, a
minimum wage increase, a patient's bill of rights and fixing Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This unfinished agenda was a casualty of last year's raw partisan
politics,'' Gephardt said. ``We all hope this year can be different.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president appealed for GOP lawmakers to compromise on ``a simple bill''
for shoring up Social Security that would apply interest savings from the
national debt and the Social Security surplus to the program's trust fund. ``I
am certainly more than willing to do my part and meet them halfway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was heading to Chappaqua, N.Y., to join his wife, who was moving
into their new house north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal will include a new program that devotes $1.3
billion a year for school construction. He also is seeking to revive earlier
efforts to use tax breaks to help communities upgrade existing schools. The plan
will be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he will send to Congress on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not expected to be embraced by the GOP-controlled Congress, which
consistently has been cool to his education proposals. But White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said there is a sense this year that Republican leaders will not be
able to thwart the plan during budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have found that we've been very effective in getting things done at the
table late in the process,'' Lockhart said. ``We're determined to get this
problem addressed any way we can, and if the Republican majority wants to block
it, we're going to find innovative ways to unblock it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan spotlights an election-year desire by the White House and
congressional Democrats to focus on education, an issue where they hold an
advantage over Republicans, according to polls. The edge exists even though the
GOP has tried to improve its image by abandoning plans to abolish the Department
of Education in favor of supporting added spending for schools.
</P>
<P>
	   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said Wednesday that
despite Clinton's proposal, the GOP is planning another school construction
proposal as part of an overall tax relief package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past two years, the House of Representatives passed plans to help
build and renovate public schools, but both times the president blocked them,''
Archer said. ``I hope this year that our schoolchildren will come before
politics, and that the president works with us. We need to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton's budget proposed using $3.7 billion in tax credits over
five years to help local governments issue close to $25 billion worth of bonds
for school repair and modernization. He said that would be enough to improve
5,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if that money had been approved, it would have addressed only a
fraction of the problem that school and construction industry groups say exists.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that renovation
and repair of America's schools would cost $112 billion, with an additional $60
billion needed to provide space for an expected 3 million new students over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   That report also said a third of the nation's elementary and secondary
schools need some repair, with 14 million children attending class in
substandard buildings. Almost half the schools lacked the wiring needed to
accommodate computer systems, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 124.72; Nasdaq Off 23.85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors moved back into the battered stock market today,
sending the Dow Jones industrials sharply higher and helping the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite edge back from a steep decline to finish
modestly lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.72 to 11,122.65. The blue-chip
index had risen as much as 216 points in earlier trading; it lost 359.58
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq ended a highly volatile session with a loss of 23.85 points at
3,877.84. In early trading, the index fell as much as 166 points and appeared
likely to extend yesterday's plunge of a record 229 points, or 5.6 percent. But
buyers stepped in during the afternoon session, sending the Nasdaq index briefly
into positive territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.69 to 1,402.11.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,785 up, 1,363 down and 387 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.07 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 983.62 million in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.45 to 478.83.
</P>
<P>
	   "The selling just kind of ran its course," said Bill Schneider, head of
block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. "People don't like to be out of this
market."
</P>
<P>
	   The catalyst for steep selling on Monday and Tuesday -- fear of rising
interest rates -- remained in the background of the market today. Bond yields
rose, hurting shares of many banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
	   And investors began shifting into cyclical stocks, which follow the fortunes
of the broader economy and are generally seen as a safer bet than technology or
financial shares when interest rates are rising.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow was led higher by cyclical companies like DuPont and 3M.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, IBM was the Dow's strongest performers today. A Bank of America
analyst labeled the stock a "strong buy" and said the share price should reach
150.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts were wary of the Dow's recovery, suggesting it was a mere
technical bounce in response to Tuesday's drop and warning that the blue chips'
advance might not last.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the way the market tries to find a bottom, by trial and error," said
Larry Wachtel, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   As interest rate worries have knocked the market off-balance, some investors
have found a reason to take some profits from 1999's meteoric gains, especially
in the technology and Internet group.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those companies remained in a slump today. Yahoo! and Qualcomm fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com fell after saying its quarterly losses would widen because it
overstocked for the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the trading session wore on, some of the shares that tumbled this
week attracted buyers at their new, lower prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the absence of downward pressure, a little value-hunting took place,"
Schneider said. Software maker Intuit rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts continued to suggest that the wave of selling was overdue in a
market that sprinted to record levels at the close of 1999. Also, said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for Primark Global Economics, the extremely high prices
of many stocks set them up for a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any correction can be sharp, quick and sizeable," Sinai said. In fact,
Sinai believes a correction of 10 percent or more is likely, and would benefit
the market by allowing new buyers to step in.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas markets were dragged lower by Tuesday's sellling frenzy on Wall
Street. Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.42 percent. In European trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.29 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.95
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.39 percent.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Celebrate Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican artists picked up more than a
dozen Grammy nominations this week -- and they weren't all in the Spanish
language categories, either.
</P>
<P>
	   Megastars like Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez were among the nominees
announced Tuesday. The nominations they and other Puerto Rican songsters grabbed
in a number of categories demonstrated the growing popularity of Latin pop music
on American charts.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin earned three nominations, with "Livin' La Vida Loca" up for best
record and male pop vocal performance and his self-titled album nominated for
pop album of the year. The catchy single also netted Puerto Rican co-songwriter
Robi Rosa a song of the year nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's happy that he's able to open doors to Latinos in the American market
and that he can get across the message that Puerto Rico has a lot to give," said
Martin's manager, Angelo Medina.
</P>
<P>
	   Squaring off with Martin for best male pop vocal performance is Puerto Rican
Marc Anthony for his song "I Need to Know." Lopez has been nominated for best
dance recording for "Waiting for Tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   In the Spanish-language categories, Puerto Ricans snatched up all five
nominations for best merengue performance. Merengue singer Elvis Crespo,
nominated for "Pintame," said in a statement that he felt "immense
satisfaction."
</P>
<P>
	   "A Grammy nomination is to see in front of you the fruit of many
sacrifices," Crespo said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The other four merengue nominees were Manny Manuel, Giselle, Grupomania and
Jailene Cintron.
</P>
<P>
	   Also among the Puerto Rican nominees were Tito Puente, whose "Mambo
Birdland" earned him a nomination for best traditional tropical Latin
performance; and salsa singers India and Jerry Rivera, with "Sola" and "De Otra
Manera," respectively.

<HEADLINE> 'Tokyo Joe' Sued for Alleged Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Wednesday sued a man who calls
himself Tokyo Joe for allegedly defrauding investors on his Web site by failing
to tell them he was selling the same stocks he was advising them to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   The man's attorney said he will contest the allegations in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo Joe, described as a self-proclaimed expert in day trading, charged
members of his investment club up to $200 a month for stock picks and other
advice, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those membership fees amounted to more than $1.1 million from July 1998
through June 1999, the SEC said in its civil lawsuit filed in federal court in
Chicago. The agency also alleged that Tokyo Joe, 50, a New York City resident
whose real name is Yun Soo Oh Park, illegally touted a stock to investors
without disclosing he had received shares from the company and lied about his
trading performance record.
</P>
<P>
	   In its suit, the SEC is seeking injunctions against Park and his company,
Tokyo Joe's Societe Anonyme, as well as unspecified fines and restitution to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Park's attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin, a former top SEC official, said his client
will contest the suit.
</P>
<P>
	   "We intend to defend against the action," Sorkin said. "I would have hoped
that the SEC would have dealt with these issues ... (such as use of the Internet
and day trading) through regulation as opposed to litigation. There are some
very murky issues."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC's suit was the latest in a string of enforcement actions in recent
years against alleged securities fraud using the Internet. Federal and state
securities regulators say this new form of fraud has been proliferating in
Internet junk mail, online newsletters, electronic "chat rooms" and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters anywhere in
the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and lure investors across the
country, who have lost millions in such schemes, the regulators say.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet has witnessed the rapid growth of Web sites run by
self-proclaimed investment gurus," said SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker.
"Today's action makes clear that we will not tolerate fraudulent conduct or
undisclosed conflicts of interest by those peddling investment advice on the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   Park, who never registered with the SEC as an investment adviser, operated
his Societe Anonyme from his home in New York, the agency said in its suit.
</P>
<P>
	   It alleged that Park misled members of Societe Anonyme by failing to
disclose or lying to them about the fact that he already owned -- and was
selling -- the same stocks he was advising them to buy. Park profited by selling
the stocks into the buying flurry he had created by his recommendations, a
practice known as scalping, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   On some occasions, Park advised members to hold a stock for several days or
longer or designated a target stock price while he actually sold the same stock,
sometimes below the target price, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the regulators alleged, Park posted trading performance results
on his Web site that were "materially false and misleading," in an effort to
recruit new members and get current members to follow his investment
recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Hypertension by Country Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Northern European and American men with high blood pressure are three times
more likely to die of a heart attack than men with the same blood pressure from
Japan or the Mediterranean coast of Europe, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Although genetics may explain some of the difference, diet also plays an
important part, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As compared with the diets in Northern Europe and the United States, the
Mediterranean diet at base line contained less meat and fewer dairy products,
but more olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables and alcohol," they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers from the Netherlands analyzed data on 12,031 middle-aged men in
six geographic areas and found that in every region, the risk of death from
coronary heart disease increased as blood pressure rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the risk of death rose 28 percent for each 10-point increase in
systolic blood pressure (the first number in the blood pressure reading) or each
5-point increase in diastolic blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   But the number of deaths varied widely from place to place.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, among men with a systolic blood pressure of 140, there were
about 70 deaths per 10,000 person-years in Northern Europe and the United
States, compared with 20 deaths in Japan and the Mediterranean. A person-year is
a measure of the number of years lived by the participants after the study
began.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Pasternak, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and
director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, said it
provides further evidence that lifestyle, not genetics, should be the main focus
of efforts to prevent heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you eliminate the factors that we know about, which are largely
lifestyle issues -- smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, lack of
exercise and diabetes -- you can eliminate somewhere between 70 and 90 percent
of disease in our population," Pasternak said.
</P>
<P>
	   For a long time, doctors have defined high blood pressure as 140 over 90 and
higher. But the study adds to a growing body of evidence that people who fall
below that mark can still benefit significantly by cutting their blood pressure
further.
</P>
<P>
	   "This makes it clear the risk is pretty continuous," Pasternak said. "Taking
someone from 135 to 125 would lower their risk by 25 or 30 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   The study also suggests that doctors in Northern Europe, the United States
and other high-risk areas should treat high and moderately elevated blood
pressure more aggressively than doctors in Japan and the Mediterranean, said Dr.
Teri Manolio, who directs several large heart-disease studies for the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were enrolled in the study between 1958 and 1964 and followed for 25
years. They were 40 to 59 years old when they joined the study.
</P>
<P>
	   After adjusting for age, smoking and cholesterol levels, the study found the
highest rates of death from coronary heart disease among Northern European and
American men. Serbian and inland southern European men had average death rates,
and Japanese and Mediterranean European men had the lowest.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was led by Peggy van den Hoogen of the National Institute of
Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven, the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> New Flu Drugs Selling Briskly  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two new prescription flu drugs are selling briskly, spurred
by the early onset of the flu season across the United States as well as intense
advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are doubts whether the new medicines -- Relenza and Tamiflu -- can
sustain the momentum: That's because patients need to start taking the
medications within 48 hours after symptoms appear, and some doctors are not
convinced the relatively expensive medicines will dramatically shorten the
suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Glaxo Wellcome, maker of Relenza, and Roche Laboratories, maker of
Tamiflu, are betting they can change the way patients and the medical profession
approaches the ailment that affects up to 50 million people each year and causes
up to 40,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   The drugmakers are targeting cities hit hard by the flu with advertising as
they pitch their medication to doctors. Glaxo has hired Wayne Knight, who played
the pesky mailman Newman on "Seinfeld," to personify the flu bug in its ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Relenza has the early lead. More than 51,000 Relenza prescriptions were
written in the week ending Dec. 24, more than four times the level in the first
week of December, according to IMS Health, a market research firm. Tamiflu,
though, is coming on strong. Tamiflu sold nearly 45,000 prescriptions the same
week, or nearly 10 times more than in the first week of December.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're seeing a nice solid start from both products," said Jeff Chafkin, an
analyst with PaineWebber. "They're not blockbusters, but the early trends look
good."
</P>
<P>
	   Lori Schieri, an administrator at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, took Tamiflu just hours after she developed the
bad cough, headache and 101 degree fever associated with the flu. That was on
Friday, Dec. 17. By Saturday night her fever broke. And she was back to work on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was great to feel better so quickly," said Schieri, who recalled the
previous time she had the flu, she was in bed for a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Schieri, most people either try to get through the flu using
over-the-counter medicines that try to control symptoms. And those who decide to
see a doctor, often do so only after being sick for several days. That's a
problem as the new flu drugs are only useful in the first two days after
symptoms appear. The medicines work by blocking the advance of flu through the
body.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a quagmire because people often wait three days or more to come in,"
said Dr. Thomas Weida, a family doctor in Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Flu can typically last five to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Health experts say neither of the flu drugs should replace flu vaccines --
the shots clearly offer people a better chance at staying flu-free all winter.
The new drugs will help those that neglect to get a shot or those that get sick
even with the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a step forward, but not a giant step forward," said Dr. John
Bartlett, chief of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   He said because the drug needs to get to patients quickly, some doctors may
be forced to prescribe it over the telephone without seeing the patient.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his doubts about the drugs, Bartlett said the drugmakers' ad
campaigns will reinforce the danger of the flu, particularly to the elderly and
those with chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms this flu season
started earlier than usual, and has been spotted in all regions of the country.
So far, only Type A, the most common type of influenza, has appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not so good news for the makers of the new flu drugs, which trumpet
their ability to treat both the A and B strains.
</P>
<P>
	   Type A can also be treated by older flu medicines such as the generic drug
amantadine. That anti-viral drug typically sells for $10, compared to the
$45-$65 for Relenza and Tamiflu. Not all insurers cover the new drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Amantadine also helps reduce the length of the flu but has side effects the
can cause users to lose balance or think clearly. Tamiflu's pill has fewer of
those side effects, but can cause nausea. The main side effects from Relenza are
sinus problems and diarrhea. Because Relenza must be inhaled, it also is not
recommended for patients with asthma or other chronic lung diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamiflu should have an advantage over Relenza simply because most people
prefer a pill over an inhaler, said Myron Holubiak, president of Roche
Laboratories. Both drugs are taken twice a day for five days.

<HEADLINE> Ultrasound May Detect Fetus Anemia  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Ultrasound can detect virtually all cases of life-threatening anemia in
fetuses, sparing many pregnant women the need for a riskier surgical test, a
study found.
</P>
<P>
	   Serious anemia occurs in a small percentage of fetuses who inherit certain
types of red blood cells from their fathers. If the mother doesn't have the same
type, her immune system may form antibodies that attack the fetus's red blood
cells, causing serious complications and even death in the fetus.
</P>
<P>
	   A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine found that ultrasound
was 100 percent effective at detecting moderate or severe fetal anemia.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers used ultrasound to measure the speed of blood moving through the
middle cerebral artery in 112 fetuses at risk for anemia.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower the level of red blood cells and the life-giving oxygen they
carry, the faster the fetus's heart pumps, trying to get oxygen to the brain.
The study found that fetuses in which the blood velocity was more than 1 1/2
times normal had either moderate or severe anemia, necessitating a blood
transfusion before the 34th week of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The diagnosis was confirmed with the current standard test for fetal anemia:
cordocentesis, which involves inserting a needle through the mother's uterus and
into the umbilical cord to withdraw fetal blood.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 14,000 pregnancies in the United States each year involve a
risk of fetal anemia. Currently, all of those mothers must undergo repeated
cordocentesis, even though only about 10 percent to 20 percent of the fetuses
will actually develop serious anemia, said Dr. Giancarlo Mari, a Yale University
researcher who led the study.
</P>
<P>
	   Cordocentesis carries a risk of infection, bleeding and fetal death, and
also increases the likelihood the mother will develop the antibodies that cause
serious fetal anemia in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultrasound diagnosis would allow most at-risk mothers to avoid
cordocentesis, which would be needed only to confirm the presence of anemia
after it is detected by ultrasound, Mari said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the problem -- we do invasive procedures in 80 to 90 percent of
pregnant women who do not need anything," Mari said.
</P>
<P>
	   The most common type of fetal anemia occurs when the mother's blood is
Rh-negative and the fetus's blood is Rh-positive. Screening for the Rh factor is
nearly universal in developed countries and a simple treatment is available to
prevent antibody formation.

<HEADLINE> Strep Prevention in Pregnancy Helps  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A U.S. public health effort to detect and treat streptococcus B in pregnant
women has cut the rate of strep in newborns by 65 percent, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The most dramatic decrease came among black newborns, who got streptococcus
B at nearly twice the rate of white newborns when the study began in 1993. The
rate of infection for black infants fell from about 2.5 per 1,000 live births to
0.8 in 1998, close to the 1998 rate for white infants of 0.5.
</P>
<P>
	   Streptococcus B can cause death or disabilities, including mental
retardation, vision and hearing problems, in newborns infected while passing
through the birth canal. Transmission can be prevented by giving infected women
antibiotics during labor.
</P>
<P>
	   The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine involved monitoring,
testing and treatment for the disease in eight areas of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of cases of newborn streptococcus B dropped steeply after joint
guidelines for prevention were issued in 1996 by the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study found. The study was led
by Stephanie Schrag of the CDC.

of symptoms -- from morning sickness to memory loss -- that are considered
common passages of life.
</P>
<P>
	   The final regulation by the Food and Drug Administration surprised consumer
advocates, who say it weakens patient protections.
</P>
<P>
	   The new rule ``allows supplement manufacturers to make claims regarding
serious health conditions without any pre-market review by the FDA,'' said Bruce
Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That means consumers at the beginning of the 21st century are about the
same place as consumers at the end of the 19th century,'' Silverglade said.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue are the $6 billion worth of dietary supplements that Americans buy
each year -- pills, capsules and teas that do not undergo any government
scrutiny for safety or effectiveness before selling.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law allows the products to make truthful claims that they maintain
the healthful ``structure or function'' of the body -- but they may not claim to
treat diseases. Actual treatments must undergo rigorous scientific study not
required for supplements.
</P>
<P>
	   The question was where to draw the line -- what is a real disease and what
is just a symptom or annoyance that supplements could legally claim to ease?
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA proposed in 1998 that supplements cannot even imply that they
diagnose, treat, prevent or cure a disease or definitive disease symptom. But
the agency received thousands of letters, from the supplements industry and
consumers, complaining that was too strict.
</P>
<P>
	   So Wednesday, the FDA relented a little: Supplements will be allowed to
claim to help ``common conditions'' associated with ``passages of life'' such as
pregnancy, menopause, adolescence and aging -- but clear diseases and serious
symptoms are still off-limits.
</P>
<P>
	   That means supplements could claim to ease ordinary morning sickness or the
common leg swelling of late pregnancy, but not toxemia or other serious
pregnancy complications. They could claim to treat teen-age acne and menopausal
hot flashes. They could claim to treat muscle pain -- but not joint pain because
that's a classic symptom of arthritis, clearly a disease. They could claim to
treat ``mild memory loss associated with aging'' -- but not real dementia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents supplement makers,
did not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Silverglade said the FDA's decision means more confusion for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   How can consumers distinguish mild memory loss from the beginnings of
Alzheimer's disease, he asked. How does a pregnant woman know if her morning
sickness was ``normal'' or a warning of a serious condition, he added. Plus, he
said, allowing pregnancy-related claims opens the way to more use of supplements
that have not been tested for fetal safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a difficult line to draw,'' acknowledged FDA associate policy chief
Peggy Dotzel. But ``if it's a symptom you encounter in the context of stages of
everyday life, that's not a disease.''

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria Get Down to Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The handover was quick and unemotional. An Israeli officer
shook hands with Palestinian officials and muttered ``Bye, folks'' before he led
a convoy of jeeps out of an Israeli army base in the West Bank on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli pullback from a small slice of land was one of the last before
Israel and the Palestinians draw their final borders in a September peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal ended a seven-week deadlock between the two sides over a
relatively minor issue -- whether the Palestinians would have a say in sketching
the maps of the partial troop withdrawals. Israeli and Palestinian officials
were mum about how the dispute was resolved, but both sides said privately the
other gave in.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians held up a November handover of 5 percent of the West Bank,
complaining about the type of land being offered, and demanding more populated
land closer to east Jerusalem, their hoped-for capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians said they were trying to establish the principle that
Israel cannot dictate the withdrawal maps. Israel resisted, and now denies
reports that it eventually relented and promised the Palestinians some of the
desired areas in the next scheduled withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank
on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who is believed to be involved in
backchannel talks with the Palestinians, said the Palestinians looked a gift
horse in the mouth when they held up the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians ``didn't receive a `tempting offer' because they don't need
a `tempting offer' to receive territory,'' Beilin told Israel radio on
Wednesday. ``There is a limit to absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Once the partial pullbacks are completed, the Palestinians will have full or
partial control over 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's withdrawal began around midday when several trucks loaded with
furniture and mattresses pulled out of the Yosef army base east of the West Bank
town of Nablus. Braving driving rain, Israel troops lowered their flag.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli lieutenant colonel shook hands with Palestinian officials waiting
at the gate, and left with a quick ``bye, folks.'' A convoy of Israeli jeeps
drove away and the Palestinians rushed in and hoisted their own banner.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the army said it transferred six bases and camps in the northern and
southern West Bank, giving 3 percent of the land to Palestinian civil rule and 2
percent to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said however
that the 2 percent, mostly areas north of the town of Ramallah, would only be
officially turned over Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in charge of the withdrawal were
meeting Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   By Feb. 13, the two sides are to reach agreement on the framework for a
final peace treaty, which would include an outline of a future border between
Israel and the Palestinian entity. Negotiators have reported some progress, but
it was uncertain whether they could meet the self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track came at a time when Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was engaged in intensive peace talks with Syria. The
withdrawal appeared to back Barak's claim that it was possible to move ahead on
both tracks simultaneously, and that he would not focus on one at the expense of
the other.

<HEADLINE> State workers protest while Pataki delivers State of State  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Thousands of state workers from Long Island to
Buffalo failed to disrupt Gov. George Pataki's State of the State address
Wednesday as hoped, but said their protest delivered their message of anger and
frustration to their boss anyway.
<P>
	   Some demonstrators taunted and threw objects at state and Albany city police
and part of the crowd closed a city street after breaking through a temporary
fence on the Capitol lawn. But there were no arrests at the demonstration
sponsored by the Civil Service Employees Association and the Public Employees
Federation, said state Criminal Justice Services Director Katherine Lapp.
</P>
<P>
	   "On behalf of everyone, we are greatly disappointed in today's acts," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany Mayor Gerald Jennings said the activities of some demonstrators could
have warranted arrests, but that police decided to avoid making them.
</P>
<P>
	   Immediately after the event, several troopers at the scene said the crowd
was cooperative and they knew of no serious problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowd estimates varied widely.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said 5,000 to 6,000 members of the two unions protested,
while the unions themselves said the figure was closer to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
	   While Pataki was delivering his State of the State speech in the state
Assembly chamber, union members chanted, blew whistles and beat drums outside
across the street from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Union members also toted signs for more than an hour in wind chills of
minus-2 degrees calling Pataki a hypocrite for providing double-digit raises to
lawmakers and his staff while offering little to the union members despite
budget surpluses. Some signs compared Pataki to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-five minutes into Pataki's hour-long speech, protesters outside broke
through a temporary fence and streamed closer to the back of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   A hundred troopers with wooden clubs held chest-high got between the
protesters and the building, flanked by Albany police in riot helmets with
visors down. They held the line with the help of union leaders as protesters
chanted "Show your face!" and "Georgie! Georgie!"
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters insisted they simply wanted their voices heard.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all about respect," said Frank Horodysky, 60, from Poughkeepsie. "I
voted for the governor and I have a lot of respect for him, but he shouldn't
shun his people. I don't expect a 33 percent raise, but we should get at least 4
or 5 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki administration's latest offer included 11-percent raises over
four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not offering me anything," said Diane Lilly, 43, of Brooklyn. After
nine years as a keyboard specialist while also performing the duties of
timekeeper, purchasing agent and commissary worker at the Queens Borough
Correctional Facility, she said she and her three children live on her salary of
$23,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state is dealing with us like a public assistance project," said George
Gergis, 57, who with 18 other PEF members left on a 5:30 a.m. bus from Long
Island. The pharmacist has worked at the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center for 23 years
and makes $43,000 a year. He said the private-sector equivalent would be
$65,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11 percent, four-year package offered to the unions is similar to deals
already approved by CSEA members at the state Thruway Authority and by United
University Professions, Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've tried to talk to the union in recent weeks, but they said they can't
go," McKeon said. "CSEA has made it clear to us they don't have time to
negotiate."
</P>
<P>
	   McKeon said union leaders are too busy getting re-elected to negotiate and
he called Wednesday's protest nothing more than a campaign rally for CSEA
President Danny Donohue.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki administration has made a "solid offer" to the unions that represent
130,000 workers and treated the members as the best public workers in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
	   State police refused to say how many additional officers were assigned to
the Capitol Wednesday or the cost, but uniformed state police could be seen at
doorways in the Capitol and throughout the adjoining Empire State Plaza in
numbers rarely seen.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Rise 1.2 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Factory orders rose 1.2 percent in November as strong
demand for electronic products gave American manufacturers their first increase
in orders since August.
</P>
<P>
	   The November advance followed no gain in October and a 1 percent decline in
September, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Orders had risen by 1.3
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebound in manufacturing was just one more piece of evidence that the
U.S. economy is showing little evidence of a slowdown, despite three interest
rate increases last year by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research in New York, said there was
little doubt the Fed will raise rates again at their first meeting this year, a
two-day session on Feb. 1-2, with more increases to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we get continued economic strength and tight labor markets, we are
looking for another three Fed rate hikes," Yamarone said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks, led by technology companies, had plunged Tuesday as investors grew
increasingly worried about the possibility of future Fed actions. The Dow Jones
industrial average, which suffered its fourth-worst point drop of all time
Tuesday, losing 360 points, recovered somewhat Wednesday, rising by 125 points
to close at 11,123.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton announced Tuesday that he was nominating Alan Greenspan
for a fourth, four-year term as Fed chairman, something investors saw as
removing any uncertainty over the Fed's freedom to increase interest rates if
they saw the need to move.
</P>
<P>
	   For November, manufacturing orders increased by $4.5 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $365.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebound in demand was led by a $3 billion increase in orders for
electrical equipment, which rose 8.4 percent over the October level, the biggest
gain for this category since July 1998. Demand for electronic components, a
category that includes computer chips, shot up by 32.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for primary metals, including steel, rose 1.8 percent to $15.7
billion. Compared with a year earlier, orders for primary metals were up 8
percent, a hopeful sign for an industry battered by a flood of cheaper imports
since the Asian crisis started in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. steel industry succeeded in getting the government to impose stiff
anti-dumping tariffs on various steel products in an effort to stem the import
tide and combat layoffs that had cost thousands of steelworker jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for cars, planes and other transportation equipment actually fell by
3.5 percent in November to $45.1 billion, reflecting in large part a drop in
demand for aircraft and parts.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the volatile transportation category, overall factory orders would
have been up by 1.9 percent in November, the biggest advance since a 2.6 percent
rise in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Stan Shipley, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York, said that now
that South Korea, Thailand and other Asian crisis countries were mounting solid
economic rebounds, demand for U.S. manufactured goods was beginning to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   "Almost every indicator of industrial activity suggests that the factory
sector should have healthy gains in the months ahead," Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, rose
by 0.9 percent in November. This represented a downward revision from an advance
report two weeks ago that estimated durable-goods orders had risen 1.2 percent
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for nondurable goods were up 1.6 percent in November following a 1.1
percent October increase.

<HEADLINE> Silver Falls on Dumping Fears  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Fears that China will dump silver on the market sent silver futures prices
sharply lower in trading Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   On other markets, energy futures prices declined. and grain and soybean
futures prices were higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver prices plunged on a report in the semi-official Peoples Morning News
that the Chinese government will sell some of its silver reserves. The amount of
silver to be sold was not mentioned. However, China is believed to have 93
million ounces of silver in reserve, according to analyst James Steel of Refco.
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   China is currently producing about 1,300 tons of silver annually, while
consumption in that country is about 800 tons, making it plausible that a sale
would take place, Steel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report sent prices plunging as much as 21.5 cents before recovering
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver has a variety of industrial uses, but is primarily used in
photography, jewelry and silverware.
</P>
<P>
	   "Demand for silver is quite good right now," Steel said. "Particularly
because photography in the East is more popular in than in the West. The
Japanese continue to take pictures despite their troubled economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for silver in India is also very strong. The upcoming wedding season
and Hindu festivals is expected to spur demand for silver.
</P>
<P>
	   Contributing to the drop of silver prices was selling by speculators hedging
against possible Y2K-related problems. Because few problems occurred with the
arrival of year 2000, a lot of silver is coming back on the market both
physically and in futures, Steel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's rally on the New York Stock Exchange pushed gold futures prices
lower, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver for February delivery was 16.5 cents lower at $5.212 a troy ounce;
February gold was $1.60 lower at $282.10 a troy ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange in reaction to
data showing a decline in U.S. stockpiles was less than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday that U.S. crude oil stores
fell 1.568 million barrels to 292.335 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Energy Department reported Wednesday a 1.8 million-barrel decline,
placing total crude oil stocks at 290.3 million barrels, only 6 million barrels
above the record low of 284.5 million barrels in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   It was expected the decline would be 2 million to 4 million barrels,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   February light sweet crude was 64 cents lower at $24.91 a barrel; February
heating oil was 1.23 cents lower at 66.55 cents a gallon; February unleaded
gasoline was .92 cent lower at 67.58 cents a gallon; February natural gas was .8
cent lower at $2.168 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Grain and soybean futures prices moved higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean prices were boosted by a revised weather forecast that calls for dry
conditions to continue in Brazil into next week. Originally, forecasts were for
rain to fall in the soybean crop areas over the weekend. The lack of rain is
hurting development of the crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat futures prices were higher in technical trading by commodity funds.
The strength of the soybean market also gave a lift to wheat futures. The prices
were prevented from going higher by light export demand for U.S. wheat.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the March corn contract was unchanged, with nearby contracts
lifted by the strength of the soybean market. However, corn prices continue to
be hurt by the large stockpiles of corn held by farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery was 2 1/2 cents higher at $2.49 3/4 a bushel; March
corn was unchanged at $2.03 a bushel; March oats were a  1/4 cent higher at
$1.09 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans were 5 1/2 cents higher at $4.77 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Home Work Safety Rules Withdrawn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers and
corporate America, the Labor Department withdrew an advisory letter Wednesday
that had said companies have the same safety responsibilities for employees
working at home as in the office.
</P>
<P>
	   However, angry Republicans in Congress said they still plan to investigate
the circumstances surrounding the department's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Workforce Committee's panel
on employer-employee relations, said he wants Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to
give Congress all memos and other documentation relating to the advisory letter
sent to a company regarding at-home workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a fine line separating big government from Big Brother,'' Boehner
said. ``Americans deserve to know the full extent of this intrusive scheme.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman of the House Workforce Committee's
investigations panel, has promised a hearing as early as this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans had already pledged to scrutinize the department over
regulations proposed in November that would require employers to minimize
everyday physical -- or ``ergonomic'' -- stresses of certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Herman said Wednesday that the advisory on at-home workers was an informal
response to questions from a single company and was not intended as a statement
of policy for all businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The letter, however, caused widespread confusion and unintended
consequences for others,'' she said in an interview. ``As a result of those
unintended consequences, I have made a decision to withdraw the letter today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the controversy has raised important questions about what
protections Americans working at home can expect from the government, Herman
said, so she will convene a conference of business and labor leaders and set up
an interagency task force to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We acknowledge ... that employers are responsible for employee safety and
health, but we don't know what that means and how that applies to these new work
arrangements in the home today. That is why we need a national dialog on this
subject,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversial letter was written by officials at Labor's Occupational
Safety and Health Administration in response to a Texas-based credit services
company that had sought advice about moving some sales executives into home
offices.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA provided specific examples in an area of law that has remained unclear,
even as the number of Americans regularly working at home has swelled to almost
20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Such ``interpretation'' letters to individual companies often are made
public, and other businesses look to them for guidance. This one, dated Nov. 15,
was posted on the Labor Department's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   Once business groups noticed, they called attention to it, sparking news
reports early this week and strong condemnation from Republicans on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA officials insisted Tuesday there had been no change in policy and that
there would be no government inspections of home offices.
</P>
<P>
	   The criticism continued, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Cleary, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
applauded Herman's retraction Wednesday but said, ``The call for a national
dialog seems a little late and, frankly, seems timed to the news cycle with a
view to killing an embarrassing story. ... Better late than never, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO's director of safety and health, Peg Seminario, said, ``If
you're moving into an area here that has such broad application, you want to do
this in a considered way. So, we're glad to be a part of this dialog.''
</P>
<P>
	   The now-retracted OSHA letter said, ``All employers, including those which
have entered into 'work at home' agreements with employees, are responsible for
complying with ... safety and health standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   It described how an employer could be liable if it knew or reasonably should
have known about home workplace hazards -- such as computers that overload home
electrical circuits, creating a fire hazard, or rickety stairs leading to a
basement office.
</P>
<P>
	   And it suggested companies should train people to set up safe home offices
and periodically inspect at-home workers' quarters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A small, U.S.-registered plane piloted by a businessman
disappeared for several hours over west-central Mexico, prompting a 12-hour
search by hundreds of civilians and troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Searchers found the plane and its passengers Wednesday on the banks of Lake
Patzcuaro, a popular tourist destination about 25 miles west of Morelia, the
Michoacan state capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilot Xavier Nicolas Picot of Sunnyvale, Calif. had taken off from Tepic on
Tuesday afternoon and filed a flight plan for Morelia, 135 miles west of Mexico
City, according to Jose de Jesus Contreras, inspector at the Tepic airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Picot was accompanied by his wife and three children in a Lake LA4-200 float
plane.
</P>
<P>
	   When the plane did not arrive at Morelia, officials began a search involving
hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
	   Adalberto Garcia de Leon, the state civil defense director, said officials
were considering legal or administrative action against Picot.
</P>
<P>
	   Aircraft broker Jim Campbell, of Northern Aircraft in Colchester, Vt., said
Picot is a Paris-based businessman and experienced private pilot who has flown
with his family throughout North and South America. Picot had given Campbell's
telephone as a contact number on forms at the Tepic airport.

	   Dow Ends Up 124.72; Nasdaq Off 23.85
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors moved back into the battered stock
market today, sending the Dow Jones industrials sharply higher and
helping the technology-dominated Nasdaq compositeo back from a
steep decline to finish modestly lower. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 124.72 to 11,122.65. The blue-chip index had risen as
much as 216 points in earlier trading; it lost 359.58 yesterday.
The Nasdaq ended a highly volatile session with a loss of 23.85
points at 3,877.84. In early trading, the index fell as much as 166
points and appeared likely to extend yesterday's plunge of a record
229 points, or 5.6 percent. But buyers stepped in during the
afternoon session, sending the Nasdaq index briefly into positive
territory. ``The selling just kind of ran its course,'' said Bill
Schneider, head of block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. ``People
don't like to be out of this market.''

	   Nation's Capital Loves Greenspan
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prospect of Alan Greenspan at the helm of
the Federal Reserve for another four years is winning rave notices
on Capitol Hill and Main Street. Republicans and Democrats alike in
the Senate predicted Greenspan would easily win confirmation to a
fourth term. President Clinton announced yesterday that he would
nominate Greenspan, for another term as Fed chairman. Pleasure at
the move was also heard in the business community. ``There's a
basic rule in business -- don't mess with success,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Jasinowski also said, however, that he hopes Greenspan will not see
a need to raise interest rates next month.

	   Bell Atlantic, GTE Mull Spinoff
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to ease regulatory concerns about their
planned merger, Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. are exploring the idea
of spinning off GTE's Internet assets into a separate public
corporation, federal filings indicate. The move is intended to help
the companies gain Federal Communications Commission approval of
the deal, originally valued at $52 billion. It would create the
nation's largest local phone company. The merger faces hurdles
because of GTE's Internet backbone -- the massive data pipelines
that criss-cross the country carrying computer traffic. For
regulatory purposes, this constitutes long-distance service, which
Bell companies are not allowed to offer within their local calling
boundaries without receiving FCC approval.

doubled from a year ago, but the giant Internet retailer said today
its quarterly losses would widen because it overstocked for the
holiday season. Seattle-based Amazon said its fourth-quarter sales,
powered by a strong Christmas, totaled more than $650 million,
compared to $253 million in the final three months of 1998 and
greater than its $610 million in sales for all of 1998. Amazon.com

speech at the semiannual MacWorld show, Jobs said Apple would
partner with EarthLink Network Inc., an Internet service provider,
to deliver new Internet services to Apple computer users in the
United States. Apple will invest $200 million in EarthLink and get

<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Mickey Mouse is a little under the
weather, but he's going to get better, Walt Disney Co. chairman
Michael Eisner said today in a letter reassuring shareholders about
recent setbacks. Eisner painted a rosy picture of the entertainment
giant's finances, but acknowledged that ``a spectacular decade for
Disney'' ended on a sour note. Revenues for 1999 increased only 2
percent to $23.4 billion and operating income fell 21 percent to
$3.2 billion, Eisner said. ``Your company is really in excellent
health despite the short-term earnings hiccup,'' Eisner wrote.
Downturns in Disney's home video and consumer products divisions
led to the disappointing performance in 1999, Eisner said.

The new bottle has clear glass and not the green glass of that

<HEADLINE> Spending caps and public financing top senators' list for reform  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn (AP) - The state Senate's top Democrats on Wednesday
proposed mandatory spending caps on political campaigns in Connecticut and
public financing of some races through voluntary donations from taxpayers.
<P>
	   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan and Senate Majority Leader
George Jepsen said spending caps will eliminate an unfair fundraising advantage
enjoyed by incumbents and prevent candidates from building exorbitant campaign
war chests.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe the caps we have proposed are fair, and we believe they are also
strict and reasonable," said Sullivan, D-West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, caps would begin in 2002 with gubernatorial candidates
allowed to raise $5 million. Candidates for other statewide offices could
collect $750,000. State senate races would be capped at $105,000 and candidates
in House races could raise $40,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Voluntary public financing would kick in for the 2002 gubernatorial
election, and would start in 2006 for all statewide offices. Money for campaigns
would come via a check-off on the state income tax form that would allow a $5
contribution taken out of any refund.
</P>
<P>
	   The public financing would be a dollar-for-dollar match to the candidate's
private fundraising. That means a gubernatorial candidate could raise $2.5
million and be eligible for $2.5 million in public financing to stay within the
cap.
</P>
<P>
	   During the last gubernatorial race, Gov. John G. Rowland raised $6.4
million. His opponent, Barbara Kennelly, raised $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In order to receive the public money, candidates would not be allowed to
exceed the spending caps. If a candidate's opponent broke the cap, he would
receive an additional match of 50 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's additional public financing for those who play by the rules,"
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan and Jepsen said legislative candidates should not be eligible for
public financing, largely because it would be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign spending caps have been ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme
Court, and Republican leaders blasted the proposal as an infringement on the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   "As much as I believe there is too much money in campaigns sometimes, you
can't restrict a person on how much money they're allowed to give," said Sen.
Louis DeLuca, R-Woodbury. "The Supreme Court already said that."
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan and Jepsen said they are willing to test the legality of spending
caps.
</P>
<P>
	   "We accept that there are constitutional issues with spending caps,"
Sullivan said. "But we are encouraged that there seems to be a willingness to
revisit that issue."
</P>
<P>
	   A bill that would have allowed for public financing of any candidate who
agreed to spending limits was debated in the House last year, but never made it
to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But following former state Treasurer Paul Silvester's guilty plea to federal
corruption charges stemming from illegal fund-raising, lawmakers and state
agencies have been refocused on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Elections Enforcement Commission voted last month to restrict
contributions from political action committees and political party committees
who now can donate as much as they choose. Lobbyists and their PACs would be
able to donate less to candidates for the Legislature and statewide offices as
well as to party committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan by Jepsen and Sullivan, candidates would be prohibited from
raising money for themselves or others from anyone doing state business that the
candidate may control while in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan and Jepsen said they may be willing to change the provisions of
their plan and tinker with the spending caps
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't view this as the final word on public financing," said Jepsen,
D-Stamford. "We view it as a positive step forward in helping to frame the
debate in the coming months."
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland has said he is open to all campaign finance reform ideas, but would
not comment directly on the proposal made by Jepsen and Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said the governor plans to meet with
legislative leaders within the next month to discuss campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   "His hope is that they could come to some agreement about a proposal that
could be put forth in the Legislature," Pagani said.

<HEADLINE> Weld: I'd be hard to stop for New York governor in 2006  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BOSTON (AP) - Former Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld moved to
Manhattan on Wednesday with his sights set on becoming only the second American
to be elected governor of two states.
<P>
	   Before he'd even carried his suitcase into his Upper East Side apartment,
Weld was chatting about his roots in Smithtown, Long Island, and his vacation
homes in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   His not-so-subtle message: He's no carpetbagger, referring to the title
bestowed by some on his former co-worker, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who also moved
to New York State on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton - who became friends with Weld when they were both young
lawyers working on the Watergate hearings - is running for U.S. Senate from her
home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld, 54, can't run for governor until he satisfies New York's five-year
residency requirement for the post.
</P>
<P>
	   But he'd be formidable in 2006, he said Wednesday, barring races by either
of his two pals, Gov. George Pataki or New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who as
associate attorney general hired him as a federal prosecutor in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd be hard to stop," Weld, a Republican, said in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press from his Manhattan law office .
</P>
<P>
	   Should Weld succeed, he would join Sam Houston as the only two-state
governor in United States history. Houston was governor of Tennessee from
1827-29 and Texas from 1859-61.
</P>
<P>
	   New York may have a harsh political environment, but Massachusetts is even
harsher, said former New York City Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Massachusetts chews you up more than New York, and we do plenty of
chewing," said Koch, who recently encountered Weld in a barbershop.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't write him off as a kook," said Gerald Doherty, former
Massachusetts state Democratic chairman, who worked on Robert F. Kennedy's 1964
Senate race in New York and ran Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign there.
"I've become a great respecter of him and his abilities to relate to people."
</P>
<P>
	   Brainy, funny and unpredictable - he once dove, fully clothed, into the
Charles River after signing an environmental bill - Weld strongly appealed to
suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He also attracted Irish- and Italian-American voters, despite his patrician
lineage that includes his namesake, William Floyd, who signed the Declaration of
Independence from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I may be a tightly wound Yankee, but that's not how I feel," Weld said
Wednesday. "I feel much more ethnic. I think I was separated at birth from an
Irish-Italian mother."
</P>
<P>
	   He narrowly won his long-shot campaign for governor in 1990 on a platform of
fighting crime, reforming welfare and cutting taxes. Over the next four years,
heavily Democratic Massachusetts came to like his brand of fiscal conservatism
and social liberalism and re-elected him by a landslide five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   He has a notoriously short attention span, however, and soon got bored.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor is the longest I've ever had a job," Weld said.
</P>
<P>
	   He challenged incumbent John Kerry for U.S. Senate in 1996 and lost.
</P>
<P>
	   The next year he resigned, and President Clinton nominated him as U.S.
Ambassador to Mexico. But Sen. Jesse Helms thought Weld too liberal, and blocked
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he's written two suspense novels, "Mackerel By Moonlight" and
"Big Ugly."
</P>
<P>
	   These days, he said, he's fully engaged as managing partner at McDermott,
Will &AMP; Emery's New York office, where he has been busy buying and selling
companies. "I'm enjoying that," he said. "I've got a reasonably steep learning
curve."
</P>
<P>
	   He won't sell his house in Cambridge, where his five children grew up. His
wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, lectures at Harvard University and Boston College.
</P>
<P>
	   If he does run in 2006, he will first have to win the hearts and minds of
New York Republicans and Conservative Party members - as well as the national
GOP, said New York consultant Jay Severin.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Weld would face the high prospect of a Republican primary," Severin
said. "If he gets beyond that, 'President Weld' is a very plausible phrase."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Paul Cellucci, Weld's running mate and lieutenant governor for six
years, said he wouldn't be surprised if he pulled off his third gubernatorial
race in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anyone can do it, Bill Weld can do it," he said. "He certainly was the
person who led our state back from some pretty tough times - he'll always be
remembered fondly."

<HEADLINE> Auto Sales Set New Record  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- American consumers flush with the rewards of a high-revving
economy set a new record for auto sales in 1999, buying 16.9 million new
passenger cars, pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Every major automaker, from giant General Motors Corp. to Korea's Daewoo
Motor Co., sold more vehicles this year in the United States than they did in
1998, as industry sales went up 9 percent. The year also ended on a high note,
with overall sales for December up 4 percent, helped by a stronger demand for
trucks.
</P>
<P>
	   However, some automakers had reasons to be concerned. GM ended the year with
about 29 percent of the market -- the first time it has ended a year free of
strikes with less than 30 percent market share since the 1920s. Ford Motor Co.
saw its sales up 4 percent for the year though its slice of the market shrunk
more than any other manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   And while GM, Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG still
sold more than two-thirds of all the new vehicles in the United States in 1999,
European and Asian automakers added buyers at a fast clip.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, GM's sales were up 6 percent, with a surprising 21 percent
jump in light truck sales -- pickups, vans, minivans and SUVs -- more than
compensating for a 7 percent decline in car sales. GM's results do not include
the Saab brand, of which it owns 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our recovery in December (from a weak November) was because we had the
correct product, sufficient inventory and the right value," said Paul Ballew,
GM's director of industry analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rod Lache, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, suspected that
incentives played a large role in GM's sales increases.
</P>
<P>
	   "In October and November, you saw GM's market share sliding down. They
became alarmed and piled incentives back on," Lache said. "What's unclear is
what is the cost and whether its sustainable."
</P>
<P>
	   Ballew acknowledged that special incentives for company employees that
expired at the end of the month did help sales; many of GM's truck and SUV
models that had blockbuster months had also been the target of several
incentives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our efforts were to address some areas of the market where other companies
had changed the equation on us, and those efforts we took in December I would
view as a normal response to the marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many GM car lines posted big losses for the month; Oldsmobile was down 25
percent, Buick was down 19 percent and Cadillac was down 13 percent. Cadillac
ended the year with a small decline, a result Ballew said was due to the launch
of a new DeVille and a highly competitive market for luxury cars
</P>
<P>
	   GM said Tuesday it would bring back its "loyalty coupons," a $500 incentive
for millions of GM vehicle owners. But Ballew said the coupons were not an
attempt to start a rebate or incentive war with other automakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Wednesday, Ford said that December sales were down slightly from
last year, due to strong December 1998 sales of its Ranger pickup, Explorer and
Expedition SUVs and Windstar minivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's car sales, excluding Volvo and Jaguar, were up 5.5 percent, thanks in
large part to strong demand for its Focus compact. And Ford also once again
claimed the title of best-selling truck and best-selling vehicle, selling
869,001 F-Series pickups.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, GM, Ford and Chrysler saw sales rise 6 percent. Asian
automakers posted a 13 percent gain, and European automakers had a 27 percent
sales increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of those increases came at the extreme ends of the market. Asian
automakers Kia and Hyundai, along with German automaker Volkswagen, made huge
gains in markets for smaller cars. And continued prosperity drove demand for
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and other luxury automakers to new sales heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Lache said part of the shift could be pinned on better vehicles from foreign
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the long-term, if you don't have innovative products, you won't be
gaining share," Lache said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to next year's lineups, "I think Ford is in a reasonably good
situation," Lache said. "GM and DaimlerChrysler might have to tap the incentive
can a little more."
</P>
<P>
	   While some industry observers had been forecasting a moderate slowdown next
year, the sales estimates for 2000 have been creeping closer to this year's
totals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't see a significant shift," Jim O'Connor, president of Ford Motor
Co.'s Ford division, said earlier this month. "We think its going to be another
very, very strong year."

<HEADLINE> Freed Militant Arrives in Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
   By ZAHID HUSSAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- One of three Kashmiri militants freed as part of a
deal to end the Indian Airlines hijacking called on his followers Wednesday to
destroy India and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Encircled by men dressed in camouflage-colored clothes and brandishing
automatic rifles, Maulana Masood Azhar gave a fiery speech to 10,000 supporters
who gathered in front of a central Karachi mosque.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have come here because this is my duty to tell you that Muslims should
not rest in peace until we have destroyed America and India,'' Azhar said,
vowing to liberate the embattled Kashmir region from Indian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd responded by screaming, ``God is Great!'' and ``Death to India,
Death to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar's arrival in Karachi from neighboring Afghanistan, where the eight-day
hijacking ended Friday, was unannounced.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the Pakistani government earlier said that the hijackers would be
arrested if they stepped foot in their country, there was no effort to detain
Azhar or to bar him from speaking Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have come back and I will not rest in peace until Kashmir is
liberated,'' Azhar told the crowd, many of them members of his militant group,
Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen. The group is considered one of the most radical groups
fighting in Indian-ruled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed with grenades, pistols and knives, five hijackers seized Flight 814
some 40 minutes after it took off from Katmandu, Nepal, on a scheduled flight to
New Delhi on Dec. 24. The hijacked plane made stops in India, Pakistan and the
United Arab Emirates before landing in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   To secure the release of the 155 hostages, India agreed to release Azhar,
along with two other jailed Kashmiri militants.
</P>
<P>
	   The whereabouts of the other two -- Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, an Indian
Kashmiri, and Ahmed Umar Saeed Sheikh, a Pakistani-born British citizen -- was
not clear Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar, his head wrapped in a checkered scarf, said the five hijackers were
all Indian Kashmiris. He said they had returned to Kashmir, the disputed
territory divided between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are preparing for their next assault,'' he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
	   When the speech ended several bodyguards, with kalashnikov automatic rifles,
whisked Azhar into a truck and sped off.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan said after the hijacking that its border security was put on alert
and the hijackers would be arrested if found, a difficult task given the length
of the border and the multitude of access points from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers have not been seen since they left the airport in southern
Afghanistan. They were given 10 hours by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban to leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The three militants are Kashmiri activists opposed to Indian rule in
Kashmir, which has been the source of decades of conflict. Both countries lay
claim to the entire territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar and Sheikh had been in Indian jails since 1994, although neither had
reportedly been formally charged. Azhar, a Pakistani Islamic cleric and a
radical ideologue was jailed for trying to unite several of the Kashmiri rebel
groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan previously said Azhar, whose father is a retired school teacher
from Punjab province, would be allowed to return to his homeland because he did
not face any charges at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the hijacking ended, India and Pakistan have exchanged bitter
accusations. India says Pakistan orchestrated the drama, a charge vehemently
denied by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf on Tuesday said India was
launching a propaganda campaign against his country to deflect criticism over
how New Delhi handled negotiations with the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Islamabad, Pakistani officials demanded that India make public
information it claims to have on the hijackers' identities and alleged Pakistani
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fabrication of allegations without a shred of evidence is reprehensible,''
a Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   India's home minister, L.K. Advani, said India has ``irrefutable evidence of
Pakistan's involvement in cross-border terrorism and in this particular
hijacking.'' He did not offer details.

<HEADLINE> Norway Rescue Effort a Disaster  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- It was a rescue worker's nightmare. Intense heat from
the burning trains. Freezing cold of a Norwegian winter. Trapped, tortured
victims almost within arm's reach yet impossible to save.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The worst thing to experience is to stand there and watch people burn,''
said Ola Sunderaal, one of the first rescuers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The head-on collision between two passenger trains on Tuesday was one of the
worst in Norwegian history, with 20 believed dead. The exact number remained
unclear a day after the crash because of uncertainly about precisely how many
people -- about 100 -- were on board.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-speed crash was so savage that several rail cars were compressed
into a pile of metal the length of a single car. A 100-ton locomotive lay on its
side, which rescuers hope to move Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires blazed for about six hours hampering initial rescue efforts. Five
bodies were pulled from the wreckage before darkness fell Wednesday. Twelve in
all have been recovered with at least four more bodies are on the train.
</P>
<P>
	   Police late Wednesday adjusted the number of missing and presumed dead to 4,
from about 20 earlier in the day. They gave no reason for the downward revision,
but said there was no hope of finding more survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 30 passengers and crew who were injured, 12 remained in the hospital,
some with broken bones.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident happened at Rena, Norway, about 110 miles north of the capital
Oslo.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the high-pitched scream of cutting tools ripped through the
forest silence and tangled wreckage of the trains to pry loose bodies, many
burned beyond recognition. The process could take days to complete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very hard work because (the bodies) are so stuck in the wreckage.''
said Trond Simarud, a rescue specialist. ``We have to work millimeter by
millimeter (inch by inch) to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, three busloads of friends and relatives of the dead and
missing arrived to place flowers, light candles and seek solace. Young soldiers,
many of whom had spent the freezing night in tents, cordoned off the wreck site.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, family members, some crying, joined rescue workers and police in
uniform for memorial services in nearby churches, where torches burned outside
in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, bulldozers, army tanks and workers felled tall pine trees to
improve access to the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering stink of smoke from the burned-out wreckage was a pungent
reminder of the chaos, terror and frustration of the previous day.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunderaal, an ambulance crewman, recalled he had entered wrecked cars trying
to help. The fire drove him back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the worst thing I have experienced, going through the train seeing
people who were alive and conscious who we couldn't help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An express train, with 83 people aboard, was headed south for the city of
Trondheim. A local train, at first said to have 17 people aboard, was headed
north. The state railroad NSB on Wednesday said that number was no longer
certain.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash has not been determined. The trains raced at each
other at about 55 mph around a corner. The engineers had no chance to stop,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria Get Down to Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Under close U.S. supervision, Israeli and Syrian
negotiators Wednesday took up two of the toughest challenges in their fledgling
pursuit of a peace treaty: their future relationship and security measures along
their border.
</P>
<P>
	   They worked in the seclusion of a U.S. government retreat just beyond this
239-year-old town, the oldest in West Virginia. They left for later discussion
terms of an Israeli pullback on the strategic Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are chugging along in a professional manner,'' the State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseeing the talks was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, with her
military aide, Army Lt. Gen. Donald Kerrick, at the security committee sessions
and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk engaged in peace terms discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   American, Israeli and Syrian legal experts participated in preparation for a
landmark treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   If the negotiations succeed -- and no one is making any such claim at this
preliminary stage -- Israel would surrender the Golan Heights, a security buffer
zone along the border, and Syria would establish diplomatic relations with its
longtime adversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has signaled his willingness to make
territorial concessions, but is holding back until Syrian President Hafez Assad
authorizes his delegation here to outline what kind of diplomatic, economic and
political relationship he would extend in return.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton was here for the first two days, but on Wednesday he kept
away for a meeting with Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate
Democratic leader, and the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, on this year's congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton then planned an overnight trip to Chappaqua, N.Y., where he and
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are making a new home as she pursues a seat in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he will be coming back Thursday,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said Clinton probably would return,
but would not make a decision until Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The meetings of the peace-terms and security committees are to be followed
by the convening of committees on the prospective Golan Heights retreat and
apportioning scarce water resources.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the first face-to-face negotiations between the two sides in
nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Shlomo Yamai of Israel and Gen. Ibrahim Omar of Syria headed their
governments' delegations in the security talks, while Zvi Shtauber and Walid
Muallem were the Israeli and Syrian delegation leaders, respectively, in the
negotiations on peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright met over lunch with Barak and scheduled a separate meeting at day's
end with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, Haim Ramon, minister for Jerusalem affairs, told The Associated
Press that ``the atmosphere of the talks is very serious, to the point.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Americans are trying to bridge the gaps and are working hard for
that,'' Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli official said his government would not compromise on Israeli
security and that concluding a treaty would require at least a few months of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the convening of the working
groups was a sign of progress. He said Assad was being updated on all
developments in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Troops Leaving West Bank  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The handover was quick and unemotional. An Israeli officer
shook hands with Palestinian officials and muttered ``Bye, folks'' before he led
a convoy of jeeps out of an Israeli army base in the West Bank on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli pullback from a small slice of land was one of the last before
Israel and the Palestinians draw their final borders in a September peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal ended a seven-week deadlock between the two sides over a
relatively minor issue -- whether the Palestinians would have a say in sketching
the maps of the partial troop withdrawals. Israeli and Palestinian officials
were mum about how the dispute was resolved, but both sides said privately the
other gave in.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians held up a November handover of 5 percent of the West Bank,
complaining about the type of land being offered, and demanding more populated
land closer to east Jerusalem, their hoped-for capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians said they were trying to establish the principle that
Israel cannot dictate the withdrawal maps. Israel resisted, and now denies
reports that it eventually relented and promised the Palestinians some of the
desired areas in the next scheduled withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank
on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who is believed to be involved in
backchannel talks with the Palestinians, said the Palestinians looked a gift
horse in the mouth when they held up the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians ``didn't receive a `tempting offer' because they don't need
a `tempting offer' to receive territory,'' Beilin told Israel radio on
Wednesday. ``There is a limit to absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Once the partial pullbacks are completed, the Palestinians will have full or
partial control over 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's withdrawal began around midday when several trucks loaded with
furniture and mattresses pulled out of the Yosef army base east of the West Bank
town of Nablus. Braving driving rain, Israel troops lowered their flag.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli lieutenant colonel shook hands with Palestinian officials waiting
at the gate, and left with a quick ``bye, folks.'' A convoy of Israeli jeeps
drove away and the Palestinians rushed in and hoisted their own banner.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the army said it transferred six bases and camps in the northern and
southern West Bank, giving 3 percent of the land to Palestinian civil rule and 2
percent to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said however
that the 2 percent, mostly areas north of the town of Ramallah, would only be
officially turned over Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in charge of the withdrawal were
meeting Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   By Feb. 13, the two sides are to reach agreement on the framework for a
final peace treaty, which would include an outline of a future border between
Israel and the Palestinian entity. Negotiators have reported some progress, but
it was uncertain whether they could meet the self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track came at a time when Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was engaged in intensive peace talks with Syria. The
withdrawal appeared to back Barak's claim that it was possible to move ahead on
both tracks simultaneously, and that he would not focus on one at the expense of
the other.

<HEADLINE> Media Accused of Gun Control Bias  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A conservative media group accused television networks
Wednesday of biased coverage of the gun control debate.
</P>
<P>
	   The television networks are so badly spinning the gun control debate in
favor of gun control they have become the ``communications division of the
anti-gun lobby,'' said Brent Bozell. He chairs the Media Research Center, which
released its study of two years of television news stories on gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   The study analyzed the morning shows and evening newscasts between July 1,
1997, and June 30, 1999, on ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a powerful, pervasive bias in the media,'' said Oliver North, the
former Iran-Contra figure who now hosts a political talk show and is a national
board member of the National Rifle Association. ``This blitz of bias is having
an extraordinary impact on public policy and legal opinion.''
</P>
<P>
	   CNN spokesman David Bittler defended his network's reporting, saying, ``We
do not advocate for or against any particular position and we stand behind the
balance and fairness that goes into all our reporting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calls made to the three other networks were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of guns has increasingly been in the news as the nation has
grappled with school shootings in places like Littleton, Colo., Paducah, Ky.,
and Pearl, Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Bozell's group says it examined 653 morning and evening news stories on gun
policy issues and found that stories advocating more gun control outnumbered
stories opposing gun control 357 to 36, or a ratio of 10 to 1. Another 260
stories were neutral, the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   In many cases, the study said, pro-gun themes were not covered and gun
proponents were not given air time.
</P>
<P>
	   Naomi Paiss, spokeswoman for Handgun Control, called the complaints
``lovable chutzpah'' on North's part.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Add to that the right-wing domination of talk radio, the toeing by
congressional Republicans of the NRA's line, the slavish devotion of the
Republican presidential frontrunner to the NRA message and this is clearly the
comedy press conference with which to start off the new year,'' Paiss said.

<HEADLINE> 'Tokyo Joe' Sued for Alleged Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Wednesday sued a man who calls
himself Tokyo Joe for allegedly defrauding investors on his Web site by failing
to tell them he was selling the same stocks he was advising them to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   The man's attorney said he will contest the allegations in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo Joe, described as a self-proclaimed expert in day trading, charged
members of his investment club up to $200 a month for stock picks and other
advice, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those membership fees amounted to more than $1.1 million from July 1998
through June 1999, the SEC said in its civil lawsuit filed in federal court in
Chicago. The agency also alleged that Tokyo Joe, 50, a New York City resident
whose real name is Yun Soo Oh Park, illegally touted a stock to investors
without disclosing he had received shares from the company and lied about his
trading performance record.
</P>
<P>
	   In its suit, the SEC is seeking injunctions against Park and his company,
Tokyo Joe's Societe Anonyme, as well as unspecified fines and restitution to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Park's attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin, a former top SEC official, said his client
will contest the suit.
</P>
<P>
	   "We intend to defend against the action," Sorkin said. "I would have hoped
that the SEC would have dealt with these issues ... (such as use of the Internet
and day trading) through regulation as opposed to litigation. There are some
very murky issues."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC's suit was the latest in a string of enforcement actions in recent
years against alleged securities fraud using the Internet. Federal and state
securities regulators say this new form of fraud has been proliferating in
Internet junk mail, online newsletters, electronic "chat rooms" and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters anywhere in
the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and lure investors across the
country, who have lost millions in such schemes, the regulators say.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet has witnessed the rapid growth of Web sites run by
self-proclaimed investment gurus," said SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker.
"Today's action makes clear that we will not tolerate fraudulent conduct or
undisclosed conflicts of interest by those peddling investment advice on the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   Park, who never registered with the SEC as an investment adviser, operated
his Societe Anonyme from his home in New York, the agency said in its suit.
</P>
<P>
	   It alleged that Park misled members of Societe Anonyme by failing to
disclose or lying to them about the fact that he already owned -- and was
selling -- the same stocks he was advising them to buy. Park profited by selling
the stocks into the buying flurry he had created by his recommendations, a
practice known as scalping, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   On some occasions, Park advised members to hold a stock for several days or
longer or designated a target stock price while he actually sold the same stock,
sometimes below the target price, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the regulators alleged, Park posted trading performance results
on his Web site that were "materially false and misleading," in an effort to
recruit new members and get current members to follow his investment
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: The SEC advises people to think twice before investing their
money in stocks or other investments they learn about through the Internet. The
agency has issued a brochure on Internet fraud on its Web site at

<HEADLINE> Disney Execs Don't Get Bonuses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Eisner and most other top Walt Disney Co.
executives, typically rewarded with hefty bonuses, received no such payments
last year because of weak earnings, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's net income of $1.37 billion for 1999 was down 28 percent from the
year before and fell short of earnings targets the company had set to warrant
bonuses for top executives.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to stockholders, Eisner summarized Disney's disappointing year
as a "short-term earnings hiccup" and repeated recent assurances that the
company was taking steps to improve long-term prospects, including revitalizing
its video division and other cost-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Eisner received a $5 million bonus and he got $9.9 million the year
before. Eisner's 1999 salary was $750,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice chairman Roy E. Disney, who drew a salary of $537,692 in 1999, also
received no bonus after getting a total of $1.1 million in extra pay over the
previous two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Other executives going without bonuses last year include vice chairman
Sanford Litvack, who received about $2.6 million in bonuses the previous two
years, and John Cooke, executive vice president for corporate affairs, who got
bonuses totaling about $900,000 the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the company has performed well, people are rewarded accordingly," said
Disney spokesman John Dreyer. "We had an off year, so the same thing applies
there."
</P>
<P>
	   The only top executive awarded a bonus was Louis Meisinger, executive
president and general counsel, who received a $350,000 bonus on top of his 1999
salary of $650,000. The bonus was awarded for extraordinary services to the
company, but Dreyer would not disclose details.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonus information was included in materials released in advance of Disney's
annual shareholder meeting Feb. 22 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Downturns in Disney's home-video and merchandising operations largely
accounted for last year's earnings decline and nominal 2 percent gain in revenue
to $23.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   With the videotape market saturated for classic Disney films such as "Snow
White" and "The Lion King," the company has scrapped its old pattern of short,
periodic releases of animated titles.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the animated library now will be available year-round, with 10 top
titles being withheld for reissue, one a year, starting with "Snow White" in
fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   A latecomer to digital video, Disney also plans to release movies
simultaneously on DVD and VHS. As more consumers buy DVD players, the company is
counting on many shoppers to replace their VHS copies of Disney movies with
digital versions.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think DVD players are here to stay, and as people replace their VCRs, it
will result in replacement of their favorite home videos," said Katherine
Styponias, an entertainment-industry analyst for Prudential Securities. "Disney
fits that bill in many households."
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's earnings declines should flatten out by the second quarter of this
year, and the company may register strong growth again by 2001 as cost-cutting
benefits kick in, Styponias said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney's cost-control efforts include a smaller slate of movies, lower film
budgets and consolidation to reduce overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   With its purchase of Web portal Infoseek, Disney is consolidating its
Internet operations. The company also is consolidating some television
operations, which include ABC, acquired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Such cost-cutting will help eliminate inefficiencies resulting from Disney's
rapid expansion in the 1990s, Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The time has come to do as my maternal grandmother always strongly
suggested I do: 'Turn off the lights when you leave the room,"' Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   To boost sluggish merchandise sales, Disney is reducing product lines at its
studio stores and the number of its licensees to better focus on such core
characters as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney stores also are getting facelifts, including computer kiosks to allow
shoppers to order items unavailable on the shelves, Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Product sales should get a boost from such recent Disney hits as "Toy Story
2" and upcoming releases that include the Pooh tale "The Tigger Movie,"
"Dinosaur," a combination of live action and computer animation, and "102
Dalmatians," Eisner said.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Auto Sales Set Record  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- American consumers flush with the rewards of a high-revving
economy set a new record for auto sales in 1999, buying 16.9 million new
passenger cars, pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Every major automaker, from giant General Motors Corp. to Korea's Daewoo
Motor Co., sold more vehicles this year in the United States than they did in
1998, as industry sales went up 9 percent. The year also ended on a high note,
with overall sales for December up 4 percent, helped by a stronger demand for
trucks.
</P>
<P>
	   However, some automakers had reasons to be concerned. GM ended the year with
about 29 percent of the market -- the first time it has ended a year free of
strikes with less than 30 percent market share since the 1920s. Ford Motor Co.
saw its sales up 4 percent for the year though its slice of the market shrunk
more than any other manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   And while GM, Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG still
sold more than two-thirds of all the new vehicles in the United States in 1999,
European and Asian automakers added buyers at a fast clip.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, GM's sales were up 6 percent, with a surprising 21 percent
jump in light truck sales -- pickups, vans, minivans and SUVs -- more than
compensating for a 7 percent decline in car sales. GM's results do not include
the Saab brand, of which it owns 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our recovery in December (from a weak November) was because we had the
correct product, sufficient inventory and the right value," said Paul Ballew,
GM's director of industry analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rod Lache, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, suspected that
incentives played a large role in GM's sales increases.
</P>
<P>
	   "In October and November, you saw GM's market share sliding down. They
became alarmed and piled incentives back on," Lache said. "What's unclear is
what is the cost and whether its sustainable."
</P>
<P>
	   Ballew acknowledged that special incentives for company employees that
expired at the end of the month did help sales; many of GM's truck and SUV
models that had blockbuster months had also been the target of several
incentives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our efforts were to address some areas of the market where other companies
had changed the equation on us, and those efforts we took in December I would
view as a normal response to the marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many GM car lines posted big losses for the month; Oldsmobile was down 25
percent, Buick was down 19 percent and Cadillac was down 13 percent. Cadillac
ended the year with a small decline, a result Ballew said was due to the launch
of a new DeVille and a highly competitive market for luxury cars
</P>
<P>
	   GM said Tuesday it would bring back its "loyalty coupons," a $500 incentive
for millions of GM vehicle owners. But Ballew said the coupons were not an
attempt to start a rebate or incentive war with other automakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Wednesday, Ford said that December sales were down slightly from
last year, due to strong December 1998 sales of its Ranger pickup, Explorer and
Expedition SUVs and Windstar minivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's car sales, excluding Volvo and Jaguar, were up 5.5 percent, thanks in
large part to strong demand for its Focus compact. And Ford also once again
claimed the title of best-selling truck and best-selling vehicle, selling
869,001 F-Series pickups.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, GM, Ford and Chrysler saw sales rise 6 percent. Asian
automakers posted a 13 percent gain, and European automakers had a 27 percent
sales increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of those increases came at the extreme ends of the market. Asian
automakers Kia and Hyundai, along with German automaker Volkswagen, made huge
gains in markets for smaller cars. And continued prosperity drove demand for
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and other luxury automakers to new sales heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Lache said part of the shift could be pinned on better vehicles from foreign
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the long-term, if you don't have innovative products, you won't be
gaining share," Lache said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to next year's lineups, "I think Ford is in a reasonably good
situation," Lache said. "GM and DaimlerChrysler might have to tap the incentive
can a little more."
</P>
<P>
	   While some industry observers had been forecasting a moderate slowdown next
year, the sales estimates for 2000 have been creeping closer to this year's
totals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't see a significant shift," Jim O'Connor, president of Ford Motor
Co.'s Ford division, said earlier this month. "We think its going to be another
very, very strong year."

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria Get Down to Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Under close U.S. supervision, Israeli and Syrian
negotiators Wednesday took up two of the toughest challenges in their fledgling
pursuit of a peace treaty: their future relationship and security measures along
their border.
</P>
<P>
	   They worked in the seclusion of a U.S. government retreat just beyond this
239-year-old town, the oldest in West Virginia. They left for later discussion
terms of an Israeli pullback on the strategic Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are chugging along in a professional manner,'' the State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseeing the talks was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Her military
aide, Army Lt. Gen. Donald Kerrick, was at the security committee sessions and
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk engaged in peace terms discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   American, Israeli and Syrian legal experts participated in preparation for a
landmark treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   If the negotiations succeed -- and no one is making any such claim at this
preliminary stage -- Israel would surrender the Golan Heights, a security buffer
zone along the border, and Syria would establish diplomatic relations with its
longtime adversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has signaled his willingness to make
territorial concessions. But he is holding back until Syrian President Hafez
Assad authorizes his delegation here to outline what kind of diplomatic,
economic and political relationship he would extend in return.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton was in West Virginia for the first two days. But on
Wednesday he kept away for a meeting with Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota,
the Senate Democratic leader, and the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, on this year's congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton then was heading on an overnight trip to Chappaqua, N.Y., where he
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are moving belongings into a new home as
she pursues a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said Clinton probably would return,
but would not make a decision until Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The meetings of the peace-terms and security committees are to be followed
by the convening of committees on the prospective Golan Heights retreat and
apportioning scarce water resources.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the first face-to-face negotiations between the two sides in
nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Shlomo Yamai of Israel and Gen. Ibrahim Omar of Syria headed their
governments' delegations in the security talks, while Zvi Shtauber and Walid
Muallem were the Israeli and Syrian delegation leaders, respectively, in the
negotiations on peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright met over lunch with Barak and then, at day's end, with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, Haim Ramon, minister for Jerusalem affairs, told The Associated
Press that ``the atmosphere of the talks is very serious, to the point.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Americans are trying to bridge the gaps and are working hard for
that,'' Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli official said his government would not compromise on Israeli
security and that concluding a treaty would require at least a few months of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the convening of the working
groups was a sign of progress. He said Assad was being updated on all
developments in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The atmosphere for peacemaking remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday night, Clinton and Albright were the hosts of an informal
gathering of six Israeli and six Syrian officials. Non-alcoholic drinks were
served. ``It was very informal; I believe Barak talked in Arabic during some of
the discussions,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday, Syrian reporters objected to the seating of a Jerusalem
Post reporter at their desk in the media center. Janine Zacharia, an American
who is the newspaper's correspondent in Washington, was moved by State
Department officials to another part of the room at Shepherd College.

<HEADLINE> Technology Shares Begin Bounce-Back  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks reversed course Wednesday after a two-day
plunge that sent the Nasdaq market sliding 10 percent, but the buying wasn't
strong enough to convince many people that the worst is over.
</P>
<P>
	   That cautionary note aside, analysts stressed that the sudden new year's
selloff has barely taken a bite from last year's 85 percent gain by the Nasdaq,
or even the 50 percent advance of the past two months.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a pretty extraordinary performance," said Byron Wien, the U.S.
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, asserting that it wouldn't
be shocking to see the Nasdaq composite index surrender half of its 1999 gain.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, rather than the fears of rising interest rates widely blamed for
the sudden downturn, the sheer size of 1999's gains may have been the driving
force behind post New Year's drop, said Wien and other analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   With such huge profits tucked away in stocks, many investors were waiting to
sell after Dec. 31 so they could delay paying taxes on those gains until April
2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of the selling in the technology stocks was really tax-related, and
most of it has flushed through the system," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical
analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "Does this mean we're heading straight up? I doubt it. I
don't think we can bring this straight up until there's a further wash out in
technology."
</P>
<P>
	   After tumbling a record 229 points on Tuesday, the Nasdaq -- a bellwether
for the technology industry -- fell another 166 points in Wednesday's early
trading before rebounding to finish the day just 24.15 points lower, at
3,877.54.
</P>
<P>
	   While most experts agree that there's plenty of excess that can be wrung
from technology stocks, they also stand by the main premise behind 1999's stock
swell -- that even through most Internet companies continue to lose money, tech
and non-tech companies alike willl eventually prosper from the rapid spread of
the Internet into business and everyday life.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the main question Wednesday wasn't why, but how long and how far
stocks might drop before resuming the powerful rally of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, the selloff didn't stop Goldman Sachs on Tuesday from issuing a
list of stocks the investment firm expects to rise at least 35 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a third of the 85 names on that list were Internet-related themes.
Among them were America Online, the leading Web service, and Cisco Systems, the
biggest manufacturer of Internet equipment. Both companies saw their share
prices more than double last year, exceeding virtually every benchmark for
measuring a company's value.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet is the most important business phenomenon in our lifetime,"
said Wien. "I still believe that, but many stock prices were suggesting a profit
reality that was pretty hard to achieve."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, even as evidence continued to mount Wednesday that the Federal
Reserve may need to slow the economy again with higher interest rates to prevent
inflation, tech-stock proponents were undeterred.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, December was a fantasy that could not be prolonged in light of the
new year, but you can't just look at interest rates to determine whether stock
prices are going to go up or down," said Joe Battipaglia, chief investment
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co., forecasting that the profits of companies that
trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market will grow 35 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "You get one, two, three market pullbacks a year, so why should this year be
any different? Until l find evidence that this bull market is over, I'll stay
fully invested."

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 124.72; Nasdaq Off 24.15  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors moved back into the battered stock market
Wednesday, sending the Dow Jones industrials sharply higher and helping the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite recover from a steep decline to finish
modestly lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.72 to 11,122.65. The blue-chip
index had risen as much as 216 points in earlier trading; it lost 359.58 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq ended a highly volatile session with a loss of 24.15 at 3,877.54.
In early trading, the index fell as much as 166 points and appeared likely to
extend Tuesday's plunge of a record 229 points, or 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But buyers stepped in during the afternoon session, sending the Nasdaq index
briefly into positive territory. Broader stock indicators also gained ground,
with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rising 2.69 to 1,402.11.
</P>
<P>
	   "The selling just kind of ran its course," said Bill Schneider, head of
block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. "People don't like to be out of this
market."
</P>
<P>
	   The catalyst for steep selling on Monday and Tuesday -- the fear of rising
interest rates -- was still in the background for the market Wednesday. Bond
yields rose, hurting shares of many banks and brokerages. American Express fell
3 27/32 to 147 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   And investors began shifting into cyclical stocks, which follow the fortunes
of the broader economy and are generally seen as a safer bet than technology or
financial issues when interest rates are rising.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow was led higher by cyclical companies like DuPont, up 2 15/16 to 67
15/16, and Alcoa, up 4 11/16 to 86. Oil companies were mostly higher, with Exxon
Mobil up 4 3/16 to 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, IBM was also among the Dow's strongest performers, rising 3
15/16 to 116. A Bank of America analyst labeled the computer maker a "strong
buy" and said its stock price should reach 150.
</P>
<P>
	   But some analysts were wary of the Dow's recovery, suggesting it was a mere
technical bounce in response to Tuesday's sharp drop and warning that the blue
chips' advance might not last.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the way the market tries to find a bottom, by trial and error," said
Larry Wachtel, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   As interest rate worries have knocked the market off-balance, some investors
have found a reason to take some profits from 1999's meteoric gains, especially
in the technology and Internet group.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those companies remained in a slump Wednesday. Yahoo! fell 32 1/2 to
410 1/2 and Qualcomm fell 5 5/8 to 156 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazon.com fell 12 3/16 to 69 3/4 after saying its quarterly losses would
widen because it overstocked for the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the trading session wore on, some of the shares that tumbled this
week attracted buyers at their new, lower prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the absence of downward pressure, a little value-hunting took place,"
said Schneider, the Warburg Dillon Read analyst. Software maker Intuit rose 17
9/16 to 78 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts continued to suggest that the wave of selling was overdue in a
market that sprinted to record levels at the close of 1999. Also, said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for Primark Global Economics, the extremely high prices
of many stocks set them up for a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any correction can be sharp, quick and sizeable," Sinai said. In fact,
Sinai believes a correction of 10 percent or more is likely, and would benefit
the market by allowing new buyers to step in.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect the volatility that has dominated Wall Street this week to
continue in the coming sessions. It's not yet clear whether that volatility will
propel the market higher or send it lower again, Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pendulum has already swung from one extreme to the other this week," he
said. "In this market, the duration of the swings is very short.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.32 billion shares, compared with
1.24 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.45 to 478.83.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas markets were dragged down by Tuesday's selling frenzy on Wall
Street. Prices were hit hardest in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index finished
with a loss of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, the Nikkei stock average fell 2.42 percent. In European trading,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.29 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.95
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.39 percent.

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City reaches agreement with MGM Grand, but strings are  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - MGM Grand's beleaguered plan to build a $1
billion casino hotel megaresort here took a symbolic step forward Wednesday when
the City Council approved a development agreement between the company and the
city.
<P>
	   The agreement, which was unanimously approved, requires MGM and the city to
jointly fund more than $25 million in road improvements linking the foot of the
Atlantic City Expressway with Arctic Avenue and allowing MGM-bound traffic to
bypass several stoplights.
</P>
<P>
	   Although hurdles remain, the principals characterized the agreement as a
vote of confidence for a project that badly needed it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's certainly a major milestone," said Kenneth Rosevear, president of
development for Las Vegas-based MGM Grand Inc. "It sends a very strong signal
that they want us to go ahead. It's been a long process but we're gratified the
council was so receptive," he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   MGM, operator of the 5,005-room MGM Grand in Las Vegas, announced plans for
the Atlantic City project in 1996 and has spent more than $50 million acquiring
land for it.
</P>
<P>
	   But holdout property owners, eminent domain proceedings against a pair of
land speculators and negotiations over the road improvements have delayed the
project, which is planned for a 40-acre site near Showboat Casino Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement approved Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
	   -The city and MGM will each contribute $11.3 million toward the road
improvements, which will consist of either an underpass or a flyover that lets
eastbound vehicles coming off the Expressway avoid several traffic lights en
route to the northern end of the city. Mayor James Whelan said the city favors
an open-air underpass that would funnel traffic onto Arctic Avenue. It would not
entail the razing of homes or taking of any properties, as did the $330 million
tunnel being built to improve access to the site where Mirage Resorts Inc. plans
to build, Whelan said.
</P>
<P>
	   -MGM has an option to take over city-owned Garden Pier and demolish the
storm-damaged ocean side of it. If they exercise the option, MGM officials would
have to pay to relocate the Atlantic City Art Center and Historical Museum, the
two structures on the pier.
</P>
<P>
	   -MGM pays the city $850,300 for two small streets that would be abandoned
and then included in the MGM project site.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote was 9-0, but support for the plan wasn't unanimous among residents.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't like the idea of a tunnel or overpass to MGM's door," said resident
Thomas Murphy, 74, who spoke in a public session prior to the vote. He accused
the city of being like "Nazi Germany" because of its use of eminent domain to
seize the two remaining privately held properties in the MGM area.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Mair, the city's business administrator, defended the condemnation
proceedings, saying: "What's happening is getting property out of the hands of
out-of-state land speculators."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the progress, the project is still years from opening. The road
improvements still must be designed and built, which will take about two years.
Construction on the casino itself won't start for 3 1/2 years, according to
Stuart Wiser, the city's development director.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal says Purple Heart Museum money was mismanaged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The former director of the National Purple Heart
Museum project squandered nearly $620,000 of public and private money that
should have been used to build the museum in Enfield, according to a report
released Wednesday by the state's Attorney General.
<P>
	   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Joseph Donahue wasted money on
poorly planned fundraising schemes as executive director for the National Purple
Heart Museum Committee Inc. Blumenthal said the organization's record-keeping
was so bad that it is nearly impossible to track how and when money was spent.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee, which was formed in 1986 to build a museum dedicated to
recipients of the Purple Heart service award, received two state grants. In
1992, they received $250,000 for planing and design costs, and $1 million in
1998. Half of the $1 million grant was supposed to be matched with private
donations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Persian Gulf War commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf took a post
on the museum's advisory board.
</P>
<P>
	   But after spending about $500,000 of the state money and another $120,000 of
private donations, the only thing the organization has to show is a $33,000
architectural design plan for the museum, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization has also failed to collect the $18.75 million of private
donations that it promised to raise in its 1997 state grant application,
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Blumenthal's investigation, Donahue took a $6,000 private
donation for the museum, kept $500 and funneled the rest to his wife's bank
account in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal is referring Donahue's alleged criminal activity to the Chief
State's Attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahue left his post as executive director last year. A spokesperson for
the Attorney General said Donahue has moved out of Connecticut, and Purple Heart
museum officials said he is working in the Washington, D.C. area. Attempts by
The Associated Press to reach Donahue through listings in that area were not
successful.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal's report also criticizes the museum's board of directors for not
keeping closer tabs on Donahue.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board of directors repeatedly failed to address the financial condition
of (the museum project) or exercise proper oversight of its executive director,"
Blumenthal wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
	   Chuck Alfano, the museum project's current executive director, said the
board has set up more oversight of his office.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfano said public funds have been withheld from the project while
Blumenthal has been investigating the mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this will have a negative effect initially," Alfano said. "But I'm
confident this museum can be built."

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Off Vs. Others  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen for a second consecutive
day Wednesday following a recovery in U.S. stock prices. The dollar slipped
slightly against other currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar posted another day of solid gains against the Japanese currency,
trading at 104.35 yen in late New York dealings, up from 103.28 yen late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar had also risen the day before after the Bank of Japan stepped
into currency markets to deflate the value of the yen, whose meteoric rise over
the past year has threatened a Japanese economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   A recovery on Wall Street helped improve sentiment toward the dollar, a day
after a precipitous plunge in U.S. stock prices led currency traders to dump the
currency. Big swings in the stock market can affect the dollar as traders
anticipate demand for dollars by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the euro edged slightly higher against the dollar after a
report showed unemployment in Germany increased less than expected, the latest
encouraging sign for Europe's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was quoted at $1.0315 in late trading Wednesday, up from $1.0299
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Wednesday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8960 German marks, down from 1.8987; 6.3589
French francs, down from 6.3679; and 1,877.05 Italian lire, down from 1,879.69.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5554 Swiss francs, down from 1.5576, and
1.4485 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4525. The British pound rose to $1.6418
from $1.6364.

    	   COLLINGSWOOD, N.J. (AP) - At a Teamsters union local ringed by police in
riot gear, the union opened a hearing Wednesday on the ouster of embattled
Philadelphia local chief John P. Morris.
<P>
	   Teamsters president James P. Hoffa signed an emergency order in November
removing the 73-year-old Morris as secretary-treasurer of Local 115 for charges
including alleged weapons purchases with union money and intimidation of members
he considered disloyal.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris attacked his ouster as head of the 2,700-member local as a political
payback because he backed Hoffa rival Ron Carey for the union presidency. He won
a federal court ruling last week that no emergency existed to justify removing
him without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   No crowds gathered outside the union hall, and during a lunch break in the
closed-door proceedings, Morris scoffed at "all these storm troopers and people
on roofs with rifles."
</P>
<P>
	   Collingswood Police Chief Thomas Garrity said 100 officers were at the
scene, in part because some of the allegations against Morris involved weapons
and in part to avoid a repeat of an earlier confrontation at the Local 676
building in Collingswood.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had been forced to close U.S. 130 at one point in the fall of 1988
while dispersing angry members of Local 115 and Local 676 who confronted one
another during the union election campaign. Local 676 supported Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
	   Though there were no arrests at that time, Garrity said, "There were verbal
confrontations and it was a tense situation. We were non-prepared for that. We
want to be prepared."
</P>
<P>
	   Garrity said the full force of police would remain in place throughout the
hearing, scheduled to last two to three days.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 officers wearing riot helmets and batons lined the union hall
parking lot, and those entering the building passed through a metal detector.
Two officers, one with a rifle and one with field glasses, stood on a rooftop
across from U.S. 130, and two mounted police patrolled the union hall parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
	   A block away, more than 20 police cars and vans, a food truck and a Camden
County Department of Corrections bus were parked in a lot fenced off with yellow
police tape.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a riot squad. That's a SWAT team. We're not John Dillinger," Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Rainville, a spokesman for the Teamsters international union, noted
that the accusations against Morris included using Teamster funds to buy and
stockpile weapons including shot guns and stun guns as well as combat fatigues
and other clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris said the combat gear was for warmth on cold picket lines, and stun
guns might be needed to defend against antiunion violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Rainville disagreed with that.
</P>
<P>
	   "My union doesn't own any guns," Rainville said. "It is not an appropriate
use of union funds to purchase weapons and it is not an appropriate response on
a picket line to use a stun gun."
</P>
<P>
	   Rainville said the panel of Teamsters officials - Charles Byrnes, secretary
treasurer of Local 926 in Pittsburgh; Denis Taylor, president of Local 355 in
Baltimore; and Ron McClain, president of Local 147 in Des Moines, Iowa - would
hear two or three days of testimony from union investigators and Morris and his
backers.
</P>
<P>
	   The three will send a letter to Hoffa within 60 days recommending whether a
trusteeship should be imposed, Rainville said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the international union began presenting its case Wednesday, Morris said,
"Statements have been made in there making us look like we were putting up some
kind of paramilitary. They want you to believe we were raising an army."
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't wait for our side to get the truth out," said Dennis Travis, a
Local 115 member backing Morris.

<HEADLINE> Competition May Affect Electricity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Electric providers may have avoided the Y2K bug, but the
industry's rush toward competition is making America's power system less
reliable, an Energy Department task force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force examined power disruptions during peak electricity demand
last summer in Chicago, New York City, Texas and other areas in the mid-Atlantic
and Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Aging infrastructure and increased demand for power have strained many
transmission and distribution systems to the point of interrupting service,''
said the interim task force report. It said some utilities, in focusing on
surviving in a competitive market, cut spending on areas aimed at reliability.
</P>
<P>
	   Increased electricity use and new demands caused by the trend toward
competition among power providers ``are stressing the electrical system'' and
increasing the risk of temporary blackouts or brownouts during peak demand
periods, the report continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said cooperation between industry and the
government in dealing with the Y2K computer glitch ``was a good step toward
achieving a more reliable electric grid.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the report by the department's task force investigating power
disruptions last summer was evidence that additional steps must be taken to
ensure electricity reliability. He urged Congress to enact legislation aimed at
increasing reliability of the power grids.
</P>
<P>
	   The interim report, given to Richardson this week with a final version
expected in March, found that electric utilities were undergoing fundamental
change from operating as local monopolies to becoming rivals in an increasingly
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
	   The disruptions last summer ``demonstrate that the necessary operating
practices, regulatory policies and technological tools for dealing with the
changes are not yet in place to guarantee an acceptable level of reliability,''
said the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force, made up of power industry experts from the government and
private industry, was asked to examine power disruptions and electricity price
spikes that occurred during high electricity demand last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   They included outages in Chicago, New York City, Long Island, New Jersey,
the mid-Atlantic from Virginia to Delaware, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and
Louisiana as well as some non-outage electricity grid disturbances in New
England and the mid-Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force said competitive pressures make it more difficult to
coordinate the flow of electricity since more parties participate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately the development of reliability management reforms, tools,
technologies and operating procedures has lagged behind economic reforms in the
electric industry,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In anticipation of competitive markets, some utilities have adopted a
strategy of cost-cutting that involves reduced spending on reliability... The
overall effect has been that infrastructure for reliability assurance has been
considerably eroded.''

<HEADLINE> Hartford's improved test scores may be enough to meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Higher scores on the 1999 Connecticut Mastery
Test are part of the broader process of improving the Hartford public schools,
the schools superintendent says.
<P>
	   Hartford students improved more in a single year than in the past four years
combined on the standardized tests given to students in fourth, sixth and eighth
grades.
</P>
<P>
	   "These scores signify a beginning, not an end," said Matt Losak, a spokesman
for Superintendent of Schools Anthony S. Amato. "We have a lot more work to do.
We have every reason to be proud that we're on the right track."
</P>
<P>
	   Losak also credited the schools' board of trustees, teachers and the
teachers' union with improving the scores.
</P>
<P>
	   Math scores among fourth graders increased 13 percent and reading and
writing scores rose 7 percent from 1998 to 1999. Writing scores among sixth
graders rose by 7 percent; reading scores by 11 percent and math scores by 21
percent. Eighth-grade math scores improved by 11 percent; reading scores by 12
percent and writing scores rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   When he took the helm of Hartford's troubled schools on April 1, Amato, a
former district superintendent in New York City, promised Hartford parents that
their children would "never be last again" on a statewide scoring index.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford ranks 164th out of 164 school districts statewide. Although a new
index has not been calculated officially, sources told The Hartford Courant on
Tuesday it appears Hartford's double-digit gains in math and reading would be
enough to lift the city out of last place.
</P>
<P>
	   "Superintendent Amato is more interested in how we did against ourselves
than any other district," Losak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The district has not said that the scores would raise Hartford from the
bottom of the index, Losak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford's index score of 41.1 last year was 4.9 points behind New Haven and
5.3 points behind Windham. Although New Haven's test scores improved in most
categories, the city did not see the significant gains that Hartford did.
</P>
<P>
	   In math, four percent more New Haven fourth- and sixth-graders scored above
the state goal, while scores for eighth-graders held steady. Fourth- and
eighth-graders showed improvement in reading, but scores for students in sixth
grade fell slightly. In writing, seven percent more eighth-graders scored above
the state goal and sixth-graders also improved, but fourth-graders' scores
dipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've seen some progress that I'm very, very happy about," said New Haven
Schools Superintendent Reginald Mayo. "I believe in slow, sustained growth for
test scores and that's basically what we're doing in New Haven."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayo credited improvements on revamped teacher training and several programs
established last year, including providing mentors for young readers.

<HEADLINE> French Storm Repairs May Take Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Devastating storms that swept through Europe a week ago caused
so much damage to France's electrical system that it could take three years to
fully restore it, the chairman of the national electricity company said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Immediate repair work would cost around $770 million, EDF Chairman Francois
Roussely said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a catastrophe without precedent in Europe,'' Roussely said in an
interview on French radio station RTL. ``For a good part of 2000, and without
doubt still in 2001, our electricity system will be fragile, we will have more
failures, the quality of our product will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Finance Minister Christian Sautter said it was too early to give a complete
damage estimate but that it would run to more than $5 billion. Storm victims are
to be given a delay in filing income taxes and special deductions for those in
difficulty, Sautter said.
</P>
<P>
	   By Wednesday, the number of customers still without power had fallen below
300,000. But repairs have been proceeding slowly. The remaining affected
customers live in thinly populated, mountainous or forested areas that are
difficult to work in. Most of the households are located in southwestern,
western and central France -- areas badly hit by the storms that killed 88
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Roussely said the company expected all customers to be reconnected by early
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   EDF has hired several companies to help repair its severely damaged
transmission network. Some 1,200 technicians from across Europe are working on
the repairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm also badly damaged some of France's most famed monuments,
including the Notre Dame Cathedral and the chateau at Versailles. The high winds
damaged between 260 and 300 million trees, according to the National Forest
Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts estimate it will take a century to completely restore France's
forests.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Will Not Wait for U.N.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations still has concerns about the
Cambodian government's latest plan to use the country's justice system to
prosecute Khmer Rouge leaders, a U.N. spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodia, meanwhile, said it will press forward with preparations to try
Khmer Rouge leaders for genocide with or without further input from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Om Yentieng, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Hun Sen, said in Phnom Penh
that Cambodia's latest tribunal plan will be presented Thursday to the Cabinet.
``We are going to push it forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar statements were made two weeks ago when the plan first came up for
approval, but the Cabinet voted to delay after receiving an appeal from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. legal counsel Hans Corell informed Cambodia's U.N. Ambassador Ouch
Borith of ``some remaining concerns'' with the country's new plans at a meeting
early Wednesday afternoon, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hun Sen has pledged to convene a tribunal before April to judge senior Khmer
Rouge leaders, blamed for the deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians during their rule
in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Cambodia has wooed U.N. support for a tribunal since the guerrilla movement
finally crumbled in late 1998, but has rejected calls for a wholly U.N.-run
international tribunal, saying national sovereignty is at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The current tribunal plan calls for a judicial panel with a majority of
Cambodians that requires agreement of at least one foreign-appointed judge to
pass rulings.
</P>
<P>
	   Eckhard did not say what the United Nations' remaining concerns were, but
U.N. legal experts have expressed reservations toward any trial rooted in
Cambodia's corrupt and politicized judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Hun Sen reached various accommodations with Khmer Rouge leaders since 1996
to end a long civil war, and critics fear that many leaders will escape
prosecution under the bargains.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Union's 'Sickout' Blocked  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the union of
Northwest Airlines' flight attendants to stop its members from staging a
"sickout" over stalled contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Donovan Frank said officials of Teamsters Local 2000 must immediately
take "all reasonable steps within their power" to prevent flight attendants from
falsely calling in sick.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest had sought the decision, characterizing a higher-than-normal
illness rate around the holidays as "guerrilla warfare" by the attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said it has had to cancel more than 300 flights since Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Local 2000 President Billie Davenport said the union had told its members
not to participate in any illegal job action, but Frank wasn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
	   "The union's public posture may be one of denial, but the evidence indicates
that its private strategy is one of advocating a concerted 'sickout,"' Frank
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling specifically named Davenport and fellow union leaders Danny
Campbell, Andrew Damis and Jose Ibarra. Frank ordered them and "other people
acting in concert with them" to take all reasonable steps to prevent attendants
from calling in sick when they're not.
</P>
<P>
	   His order was to remain in effect until a hearing on a preliminary
injunction, which wasn't immediately scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest is based in Eagan, Minn.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing earlier Wednesday, Northwest attorney Timothy Thornton told
Frank that job action by members of Teamsters Local 2000 was "in the nature of
guerrilla warfare in labor relations" and must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   But union attorney Michael Bloom denied that Local 2000 had sanctioned any
job action and said there is no justification for a temporary restraining order
against the union or its officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where is the evidence that these flight attendants were not sick?" Bloom
asked. "The numbers do not speak for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Northwest said the flight attendants were
trying to pressure the airline in contract talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton said the sickout had slowed but was continuing. He said that more
than 650 flight attendants called in sick on Tuesday, compared with a daily sick
average of 381.
</P>
<P>
	   The Railway Labor Act prohibits sickouts and other job actions against
employers before the National Mediation Board has declared negotiations at an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   Although mediated talks between Northwest and its flight attendants have
been recessed since Dec. 7 and no talks are scheduled, the board has not
declared an impasse to trigger a 30-day countdown to a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton said Northwest intends to discipline flight attendants who stayed
away from work when they weren't sick. He said 12 union members would be
questioned on Thursday and said hundreds of flight attendants could lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 Northwest flight attendants has been seeking a new
contract since September 1996. In late August, Local 2000 members overwhelmingly
rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed by union negotiators.

<HEADLINE> Largest Mass. HMO in Receivership  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- Accounting errors at Massachusetts' largest HMO have left the
company with losses tens of millions of dollars greater than expected and a
court order placing it in receivership.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the HMO, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, closed its 125,000-client
Rhode Island operation because of massive losses there.
</P>
<P>
	   Massachusetts Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt, who will oversee
operations at the HMO for the state Supreme Judicial Court, wouldn't speculate
on Harvard Pilgrim's future.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge placed the health maintenance organization in receivership on
Tuesday after the HMO blamed accounting errors for loss estimates that rose from
$100 million to more than $170 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Using one accounting standard, Ruthardt said, the company has a $40 million
balance. Using another, which values buildings less and takes future liabilities
into account, the company would be in the red, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Linzer, spokesman for Harvard Pilgrim, said the company's 1.1 million
subscribers should not be alarmed. "The order will no way affect the care and
coverage our members receive," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The court order placing the HMO in receivership prohibits its creditors from
seeking payment from Harvard Pilgrim through federal bankruptcy. It also
requires a plan for rehabilitating the company to be submitted to the court
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Linzer said the problems in past accounting practices came to light as the
company prepared a bond deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore referred to Harvard Pilgrim's woes while campaigning
in Massachusetts on Wednesday, saying they point out "the need to pass a patient
bill of rights."

<HEADLINE> Feds: Florida trailer park residents gave blood to aid Medicare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Three men were accused by federal authorities Wednesday
of drawing blood from residents of a Florida trailer park to submit phony
Medicare claims and cheat the program of more than $3 million.
<P>
	   Medicare fraud and conspiracy charges were brought against Albert Huerta,
36, of North Bergen, N.J., Jose Hernandez, 42, and Alejandro Pujol, 36, both of
Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White announced the arrest in a news release,
crediting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services with helping to
unearth a scam that ripped off the federally administered program of $3.6
million.
</P>
<P>
	   An indictment returned in U.S. District Court in Manhattan accused the
defendants of cheating the government by submitting blood samples for lab
testing and subsequent reimbursement by Medicare even though no doctor had
ordered the tests.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants allegedly paid Medicare beneficiaries at a trailer park in
Florida for the blood, then submitted it to Liberty Testing Laboratories,
formerly a blood testing laboratory in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Huerta, once the head of Liberty, was accused of participating in the scam
along with Ara Miranda, a Liberty employee who was previously arrested and
indicted in the case last August.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Miranda allegedly submitted the blood samples from Florida to Liberty
with test order forms that stated they had been drawn from Medicare
beneficiaries and that a physician had ordered them.
</P>
<P>
	   Hernandez, Pujol, Ms. Miranda and others allegedly helped draw the blood.
The trailer park where they allegedly collected it was not further identified in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the indictment, Ms. Miranda obtained the names of the
physicians and Medicare beneficiaries listed in the fake test order forms from
Hernandez, who owned a Florida medical billing company.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, the defendants could each face a maximum of five years in
prison on each of two counts in the indictment. They also could face up to
$250,000 in fines.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Probes Flood Security  </HEADLINE>
   By FABIOLA SANCHEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The prosecutor's office opened an investigation
Wednesday into allegations that security forces committed human rights abuses
while trying to curb looting in areas devastated by killer mudslides.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they decided to open the probe after having received
complaints from a leading Venezuelan human rights group, Provea. The group said
soldiers allegedly detained and killed some thieves, beat residents, illegally
entered homes and restricted free travel.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Raul Salazar has denied the security forces committed
abuses. Provea said it could not produce any witnesses because residents were
afraid to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of northern Vargas State -- which was the worst area hit by the
disaster -- was turned into ghost towns after the floods. Thieves tried to take
advantage by looting abandoned homes and businesses throughout the state,
located along Venezuela's Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dec. 15 floods unleashed an avalanche of mud, boulders and trees, which
came roaring down the mountain that separates Caracas from the Caribbean Sea.

	   Officials estimate that between 5,000 and 30,000 people were killed, making
it Venezuela's worst natural disaster this century.

<HEADLINE> Algerians Negotiate To End Deadlock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- The Algerian army is meeting with Islamic insurgents
to try to break a deadlock in a peace plan for this violence-wracked country,
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic Salvation Army, known as the AIS, accused the government of
failing to honor an alleged agreement to let 600 of its injured and aging
members return to civilian life without penalty. AIS said its forces have been
put on a state of alert.
</P>
<P>
	   An army delegation traveled by helicopter Tuesday to the Jijel region, 200
miles east of Algiers, the AIS base, to try to settle the dispute, the El Watan
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is an emissary of the Algerian army meeting with (AIS leader) Emir
Madani Mezrag,'' Abdelkrim Ould Adda, spokesman for the Salvation Front's
executive branch in exile, confirmed in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Algerian authorities did not comment on the reported meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The AIS, which called a truce in October 1997, is a moderate insurgency
movement rivaling the radical Armed Islamic Group that has been blamed for
deadly attacks carried out almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islamic Salvation Front is the AIS' political wing.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his efforts to bring peace to the war-ravaged nation, President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika has offered partial amnesty to insurgents -- notably the
radical Armed Islamic Group -- who turn themselves in by Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The AIS maintains that its own deal with the army is separate and that its
fighters are not to be counted among those insurgents. The AIS will reportedly
cooperate with the Algerian army in tracking the Armed Islamic Group and other
radical insurgents refusing peace.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Salvation Front's exiled branch had announced Monday that the AIS
was freezing the accord because authorities were not honoring the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, violence in Algeria showed no sign of slowing.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven people were shot dead and 15 wounded by four armed men at a village
cafe near the coastal town of Bou Haroun, 30 miles west of Algiers, the daily La
Tribune reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Several massacres leaving scores of people dead have been carried out during
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that started Dec. 9 and ends later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100,000 people have been killed since the start of the Islamic
insurgency in 1992 -- triggered by an army decision to cancel parliamentary
elections that the Salvation Front was poised to win.

<HEADLINE> Former West New York Police Chief sentenced to 4 years in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The former chief of the West New York police force
was sentenced to four years in prison Wednesday for leading a band of rogue cops
in what prosecutors say was the most pervasive police corruption in New Jersey.
<P>
	   Retired Chief Alexander V. Oriente tearfully apologized for his role in the
corruption that turned the 140-member police department in the Hudson County
community into a racketeering gang.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente, said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary, "represented a nightmare
scenario in law enforcement. He set the example for those he commanded and
infected the department with corruption."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Jerome Simandle said he wanted the sentence to send a
message to others sworn to uphold the law.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the chief of police is corrupt who is going to police them?" the judge
asked. "When the chief goes bad, a great deal suffers. It was not a pretty
sight."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also ordered Oriente to pay a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say police took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and
kickbacks from 1989 to 1997 to shield prostitutes, illicit liquor sales and
illegal gambling operations in the mile-square town of 50,000 just across the
Hudson River from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente, 67, of Ridgefield, admitted using some of the illegal profits to
keep a mistress, and having an affair with a madam.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that the things I did in the police department were not correct, but
I have started a new life," he told the judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente struck a deal with federal prosecutors and agreed to cooperate
shortly after a 69-count racketeering indictment was returned in January 1998
charging Oriente and nine current or former West New York police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Oriente pleaded guilty to a single count each of racketeering and
conspiracy to defraud the IRS by failing to report $80,000 in bribes on his
income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carlos Ortiz said calling Oriente a "bad cop was a
gross understatement of what he did."
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente received a reduced sentence Wednesday for assisting prosecutors and
testifying against four West New York police officers - the only defendants to
go to trial among the more than 30 charged in the case. He could have faced up
to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, Oriente admitted collecting at least $2 million through
loansharking and payoffs from illegal gambling operations. He said the money was
distributed to others involved in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Police corruption allowed three amusement companies, at least one with ties
to the Cuban mob, to place illegal video gaming machines in more than 200
establishments in the town, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the establishments protected were bars allowed to sell liquor after
legal closing times and the madam who paid at least $130,000 in bribes to keep
the corrupt officers from arresting prostitutes, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors also said that coconspirators in the case - businesses that paid
bribes to police - netted as much as $1.5 million for their illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente said the corruption began almost as soon as he joined the force. He
retired in 1997 after a 40-year career. His son, Alexander L., a detective on
the force, admitted taking money from an illegal gambling business owner and
will be sentenced next week.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I joined the West New York police department I was very young and was
placed in a corrupt environment which was a normal part of this police
department and I was foolish enough to go along with this corruption," the elder
Oriente said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge Wednesday also sentenced Jose Grana Sr., 61, of West New York, a
reputed Cuban-American organized crime boss, to 4 1/2 years in prison and
imposed a $30,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Grana admitted paying bribes to police to protect his multimillion dollar
illegal gambling business. His son, Jose Jr., 34, was also sentenced to 5 years
and fined $25,000 for his role in the corruption scheme.

<HEADLINE> GM Restarts 'Loyalty Coupons'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has reintroduced a "loyalty coupon"
program that set off a heated battle over customer incentives among automakers
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   But GM and industry analysts said Wednesday the new coupons were meant more
to shore up GM's customer base than to start a rebate war.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said the $500 coupons were mailed to millions of customers who bought new
GM vehicles and to potential customers who tell the company they're interested
in a GM vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The money can be used toward the purchase of a new vehicle or for extended
service and warranty plans. The offer expires Feb. 29, and applies to all GM
products except Saturns, Saabs, Chevrolet Corvettes, AM General Corp. Hummers
and several full-size sport utility models.
</P>
<P>
	   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said the coupons did not mean GM was spending
more on incentives; several year-end programs, including one for employees,
recently expired.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see it as kind of maintaining a balance. We certainly don't see this as
buying the marketplace," he said. "These programs have proven to be very
successful in the past. ... We'd like to continue a solid sales momentum and get
a good start to 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   GM's sales were up 9 percent in 1999, but the automaker finished the year
with a little more than 29 percent of the U.S. market for cars and light trucks.
It was the first time since the 1920s that GM has held less than 30 percent of
the market in a year without a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Ballew, GM's director of industry analysis, said the company was making
the moves to stay competitive, and was not a signal for a new round of price
cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see it as a disconnect over what we've been packaging in the past
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Lache, an industry analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, said GM
probably made the move only after sales started to appear sluggish toward the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they were hoping the product would sell itself, and they could gain
market share without having to resort to this," he said. "I don't think it's a
significant escalation over last year."

<HEADLINE> In a new era, New Jersey politicos say 'liberal' not a dirty word  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It seems "liberal" might not be a dirty word
anymore.
<P>
	   The advent of a new decade, new century, new millennium heralds a time when
tired words of the past year can be redefined or discarded.
</P>
<P>
	   And one political word due to be recast is "liberal." Or, more to the point,
political candidates are exhibiting less fear of being branded as such when they
propose ambitious and costly spending programs.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey has played a big role in America's new flirtation with liberal
ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider:
</P>
<P>
	   "Amidst historic prosperity, society is doing far too little to secure
fairness, to help the poor, to bring down economic barriers and lift up those
who have been left out," says Year 2000 political hopeful Number One. "The
private sector, and the market's invisible hand, will not always serve the
public interest unless government challenges or requires that it do so."
</P>
<P>
	   A second hopeful says: "We must remember we (government) have done the big
things in the past. We can do the big things in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   And "If you want to help working families in America today you have to start
with unions. We must end child poverty. We must raise the minimum wage and
expand the earned income tax credit."
</P>
<P>
	   Liberal sentiments in full.
</P>
<P>
	   The first is from Jon Corzine, the self-financing newcomer seeking the
Democratic nomination to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Frank
Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
	   The second set belongs to Bill Bradley. The former New Jersey senator is
giving Vice President Al Gore fits in the fight for the Democratic nomination
for president.
</P>
<P>
	   "In good economic times, being a liberal is not necessarily a bad thing,"
said Rider University political analyst David Rebovich. "There seems to be money
to go around, and people are willing to at least entertain what would in the
past seem like overly generous or overly expensive programs."
</P>
<P>
	   Said Steve Goldstein, Corzine's campaign manager for policy: "I don't know
if you call it a resurgence of progressivism, but it seems pretty close to that.
People are talking about a pro-active government the way people have not talked
about it for decades."
</P>
<P>
	   But this liberal ideal for the 2000s is a new variety. It comes with limits,
price tags and a quest for earthy credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Emma Byrne, a senior adviser in the Bradley campaign, was on former Gov. Jim
Florio's staff when the public reacted furiously to his tax increases in the
early '90s. She said the difference today with Bradley is the origin of his
so-called liberal ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is living rooms and community centers and town meetings," she said.
"When you find ways to touch people directly and look them in the eye, there's
no room for labels to get in the way."
</P>
<P>
	   Rebovich said, "Candidates can afford to be more liberal-sounding now in
general because there is public recognition that there is a balance of power in
Washington. We recognize that the liberals are not going to go haywire, they are
not going to run away with everything."
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone thinks the new liberal impulse will prove terribly durable.
</P>
<P>
	   Former U.S. Rep. Dick Zimmer, who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate as a
Republican in 1996, said money issues will come home to roost with things like
Corzine's promises of universal health care and federal spending on education.
He said both parties now regard a balanced budget as sacred.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was ticking in my head the costs of the universal this and the universal
that that Corzine was proposing, and it sounded to me like a trillion-dollar
speech," Zimmer said. "He is a Wall Street mega-millionaire who can propose,
pardon the expression, liberal programs. The fact that he has proposed some
incredibly expensive programs will hurt him."
</P>
<P>
	   "They are out-liberalizing each other," said Republican lobbyist Roger
Bodman.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the Democratic primaries are decided, "I think you will see them
sprinting to the center of the political spectrum," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is any great sea change, millennium or not, among the
American people," he added. "I think moderation will rule."

<TEXT>
    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, settled
in Wednesday for their first meal and overnight stay in their new $1.7 million
home in this well-to-do hamlet north of New York City.
<P>
	   "Like any new homeowners, they're excited," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart after the couple arrived. Joining them was the president's
mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend who also lives in Westchester County and has vacationed with the
Clintons in Martha's Vineyard brought over home-cooked food for dinner. The
house near the bottom of a cul-de-sac was blocked off; reporters and onlookers
were kept behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
	   While some of the 17,000 residents in the upscale suburb have complained
about the attention drawn by the Clintons, many seemed eager to greet them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's been some disturbance for the people" on the Clintons'
street, said Wilma Rapp. "Other than that, people feel pretty good about the
Clintons. You tell somebody you live in Chappaqua and they say, 'Oh! Hillary!"'
</P>
<P>
	   The town already has had its share of the famous: actor Chevy Chase, Tony
Award-winning actress Glenn Close, New York Yankees center fielder Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, Mrs. Clinton - who needs a New York address to run for the U.S.
Senate - was scheduled to arrive alone to unpack. An unexpected break in the
president's schedule allowed him to accompany the first lady, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' furniture and other goods arrived Tuesday afternoon in two
moving vans. The president has said they both plan to live in Chappaqua after he
leaves office in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The president planned an early Thursday return to Andrews Air Force Base,
although it was not known if he then would go to the White House or back to the
Mideast peace talks in Shepardstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before their arrival, the Clintons had caused several minor stirs.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, protesters upset by U.S. policy in East Timor marched outside
the home - even though it was still vacant. In November, the government quashed
plans to sell T-shirts reading "Secret Service, Chappaqua Bureau, Presidential
Detail," saying use of the Secret Service label was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Local officials soon made parking on the Clintons' cul-de-sac illegal to
spare neighbors any imposition from the media. Authorities also approved
installation of an 8-foot fence and a guard booth on the Clintons' property;
neither is yet in place.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican
opponent in this year's U.S. Senate race, played on the "carpetbagger" theme he
has used against Mrs. Clinton in offering a backhanded welcome to her and the
president.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very, very proud of the fact that people from around the country
want to come to New York, including people from Arkansas," Giuliani said. "We
welcome all newcomers, and recognize the fact that they are newcomers."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar sentiments were offered by Gov. George Pataki, another Republican,
during his state of the state address in Albany: "Why, even people from Hope,
Arkansas, understand that New York is the best state to live in."

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Family of 22 Slain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Gunmen killed 22 members of one family, 14 of them
children, in an isolated hamlet in Peru's central Andes, officials said
Wednesday. A relative blamed the attack on neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Three generations of the Caqui family were slain in Monday night's violence,
but an 8-year-old boy and an elderly man survived, said police in the department
capital of Huanuco. They said the motive was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   But a relative of the victims said a neighboring family attacked over a land
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have been after our land. They have killed my father and my entire
family,'' a sobbing Fidel Caqui told Lima's Radioprogramas. ``They always said
they would eliminate us,'' said Caqui, who was not at the scene when the attack
occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   But Manuel Tello, deputy prefect of the Huamalies province, said more than
just land was at the heart of the conflict, suggesting the motive was revenge
for the killing of a female member of the Amante Valverde family last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Caqui family lived in three houses grouped together in Queropata, an
isolated hamlet of 400 peasant farmers about 180 miles northeast of the capital,
Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   The hamlet lies more than 11,000 feet above sea level, and getting there
involves a 20-hour drive from Lima over mountainous roads and several hours of
hiking from the last road.
</P>
<P>
	   Hernan Romero, a neighbor, said eight gunmen forced the victims out of their
homes and stood them together before opening fire. Most of those killed were
between 1 and 16 years old, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Romero said the boy who survived was shot in the neck and foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Land disputes often are settled with bloodshed in the isolated reaches of
Peru's high Andes, where local police are scarce.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Auto Sales Set Record  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- American consumers flush with the rewards of a high-revving
economy set a new record for auto sales in 1999, buying 16.9 million new
passenger cars, pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Every major automaker, from giant General Motors Corp. to Korea's Daewoo
Motor Co., sold more vehicles last year in the United States than they did in
1998, as industry sales went up 9 percent. The year also ended on a high note,
with overall sales for December up 4 percent, helped by a stronger demand for
trucks.
</P>
<P>
	   However, some automakers had reasons to be concerned. GM ended 1999 with
about 29 percent of the market -- the first time it has ended a year free of
strikes with less than 30 percent market share since the 1920s. Ford Motor Co.
saw its sales up 4 percent for the year though its slice of the market shrunk
more than any other manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   And while GM, Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG still
sold more than two-thirds of all the new vehicles in the United States in 1999,
European and Asian automakers added buyers at a fast clip.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, GM's sales were up 6 percent, with a surprising 21 percent
jump in light truck sales -- pickups, vans, minivans and SUVs -- more than
compensating for a 7 percent decline in car sales. GM's results do not include
the Saab brand, of which it owns 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our recovery in December (from a weak November) was because we had the
correct product, sufficient inventory and the right value," said Paul Ballew,
GM's director of industry analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rod Lache, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, suspected that
incentives played a large role in GM's sales increases.
</P>
<P>
	   "In October and November, you saw GM's market share sliding down. They
became alarmed and piled incentives back on," Lache said. "What's unclear is
what is the cost and whether its sustainable."
</P>
<P>
	   Ballew acknowledged that special incentives for company employees that
expired at the end of the month did help sales; many of GM's truck and SUV
models that had blockbuster months had also been the target of several
incentives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our efforts were to address some areas of the market where other companies
had changed the equation on us, and those efforts we took in December I would
view as a normal response to the marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many GM car lines posted big losses for the month; Oldsmobile was down 25
percent, Buick was down 19 percent and Cadillac was down 13 percent. Cadillac
ended the year with a small decline, a result Ballew said was due to the launch
of a new DeVille and a highly competitive market for luxury cars
</P>
<P>
	   GM said earlier this week that it would bring back its "loyalty coupons," a
$500 incentive for millions of GM vehicle owners. But Ballew said the coupons
were not an attempt to start a rebate or incentive war with other automakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Wednesday, Ford said that December sales were down slightly from the
previous period, due to strong December 1998 sales of its Ranger pickup,
Explorer and Expedition SUVs and Windstar minivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's car sales, excluding Volvo and Jaguar, were up 5.5 percent, thanks in
large part to strong demand for its Focus compact. And Ford also once again
claimed the title of best-selling truck and best-selling vehicle, selling
869,001 F-Series pickups.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, GM, Ford and Chrysler saw sales rise 6 percent. Asian
automakers posted a 13 percent gain, and European automakers had a 27 percent
sales increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of those increases came at the extreme ends of the market. Asian
automakers Kia and Hyundai, along with German automaker Volkswagen, made huge
gains in markets for smaller cars. And continued prosperity drove demand for
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and other luxury automakers to new sales heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Lache said part of the shift could be pinned on better vehicles from foreign
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the long-term, if you don't have innovative products, you won't be
gaining share," Lache said.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to this year's lineups, "I think Ford is in a reasonably good
situation," Lache said. "GM and DaimlerChrysler might have to tap the incentive
can a little more."
</P>
<P>
	   While some industry observers had been forecasting a moderate slowdown this
year, the sales estimates for 2000 have been creeping closer to 1999 totals.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syria Get Down to Business  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Under close U.S. supervision, Syria began
Wednesday to outline its proposal for peace to Israel in their first
face-to-face negotiations in nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Daylong talks also were held in the seclusion of a U.S. government retreat
on new security measures for their tense border, State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is expected to yield all or most of the strategic Golan Heights as
the price for peace with the Arab country, with which it has fought three wars.
</P>
<P>
	   But before making a final commitment to give up the border high ground,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has insisted Syrian President Hafez Assad spell out
his offer of peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin, reporting on the deliberations of a mixed committee of Israeli,
Syrian and American officials, said: ``The content of peaceful relations and
what that entails in some detail'' emerged from the discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said a separate security committee, at a daylong meeting, took up
establishment of a demilitarized zone and an early warning system.
</P>
<P>
	   He gave no indication, however, that agreements were reached on any of the
knotty issues in the path of a fledgling pursuit of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans mediators, he said, were trying to determine ``how we go from
chugging along to a fast track.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin added: ``We obviously are going to have some ideas of our own.''
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiators met at a hotel shielded by barricades and police cars just
beyond this 239-year-old town, the oldest in West Virginia. Left for later
discussion were terms of an Israeli pullback on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseeing the talks was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Her military
aide, Army Lt. Gen. Donald Kerrick, was at the security committee sessions and
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk engaged in peace terms discussions.
</P>
<P>
	   American, Israeli and Syrian legal experts participated in preparation for a
landmark treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   If the negotiations succeed -- and no one is making any such claim at this
preliminary stage -- Israel would surrender the Golan Heights, a security buffer
zone along the border, and Syria would establish diplomatic relations with its
longtime adversary.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton was in West Virginia for the first two days. But on
Wednesday he kept away for a meeting with Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota,
the Senate Democratic leader, and the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, on this year's congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton then headed for an overnight trip to Chappaqua, N.Y., where he and
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were moving belongings into a new home as she
pursues a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said Clinton probably would return,
but would not make a decision until Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The meetings of the peace-terms and security committees are to be followed
by the convening of committees on the prospective Golan Heights retreat and
apportioning scarce water resources.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the first face-to-face negotiations between the two sides in
nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Shlomo Yamai of Israel and Gen. Ibrahim Omar of Syria headed their
governments' delegations in the security talks, while Zvi Shtauber and Walid
Muallem were the Israeli and Syrian delegation leaders, respectively, in the
negotiations on peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright met over lunch with Barak, then with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa, and, at day's end, with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, Haim Ramon, minister for Jerusalem affairs, told The Associated
Press that ``the atmosphere of the talks is very serious, to the point.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Americans are trying to bridge the gaps and are working hard for
that,'' Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli official said his government would not compromise on Israeli
security and that concluding a treaty would require at least a few months of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the convening of the working
groups was a sign of progress. He said Assad was being updated on all
developments in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The atmosphere for peacemaking remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday night, Clinton and Albright were the hosts of an informal
gathering of six Israeli and six Syrian officials. Nonalcoholic drinks were
served. ``It was very informal; I believe Barak talked in Arabic during some of
the discussions,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday, Syrian reporters objected to the seating of a Jerusalem
Post reporter at their desk in the media center. Janine Zacharia, an American
who is the newspaper's correspondent in Washington, was moved by State
Department officials to another part of the room at Shepherd College.

<HEADLINE> Limits Eased on Supplement Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government eased some restrictions on dietary
supplements Wednesday, saying the products can legally claim to treat a variety
of symptoms -- from morning sickness to memory loss -- that are considered
common passages of life.
</P>
<P>
	   The final regulation by the Food and Drug Administration surprised consumer
advocates, who say it weakens patient protections.
</P>
<P>
	   The new rule ``allows supplement manufacturers to make claims regarding
serious health conditions without any pre-market review by the FDA,'' said Bruce
Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That means consumers at the beginning of the 21st century are about the
same place as consumers at the end of the 19th century,'' Silverglade said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grocery Manufacturers of America said the rule ``makes strides which
will allow beneficial health information'' to be conveyed to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue are the $6 billion worth of dietary supplements that Americans buy
each year -- pills, capsules and teas that do not undergo any government
scrutiny for safety or effectiveness before selling.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law allows the products to make truthful claims that they maintain
the healthful ``structure or function'' of the body -- but they may not claim to
treat diseases. Actual treatments must undergo rigorous scientific study not
required for supplements.
</P>
<P>
	   The question was where to draw the line -- what is a real disease and what
is just a symptom or annoyance that supplements could legally claim to ease?
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA proposed in 1998 that supplements cannot even imply that they
diagnose, treat, prevent or cure a disease or definitive disease symptom. But
the agency received thousands of letters, from the supplements industry and
consumers, complaining that was too strict.
</P>
<P>
	   So Wednesday, the FDA relented a little: Supplements will be allowed to
claim to help ``common conditions'' associated with ``passages of life'' such as
pregnancy, menopause, adolescence and aging -- but clear diseases and serious
symptoms are still off-limits.
</P>
<P>
	   That means supplements could claim to ease ordinary morning sickness or the
common leg swelling of late pregnancy, but not toxemia or other serious
pregnancy complications. They could claim to treat teen-age acne and menopausal
hot flashes. They could claim to treat muscle pain -- but not joint pain because
that's a classic symptom of arthritis, clearly a disease. They could claim to
treat ``mild memory loss associated with aging'' -- but not real dementia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents supplement makers,
did not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Silverglade said the FDA's decision means more confusion for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   How can consumers distinguish mild memory loss from the beginnings of
Alzheimer's disease, he asked. How does a pregnant woman know if her morning
sickness was ``normal'' or a warning of a serious condition, he added. Plus, he
said, allowing pregnancy-related claims opens the way to more use of supplements
that have not been tested for fetal safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a difficult line to draw,'' acknowledged FDA associate policy chief
Peggy Dotzel. But ``if it's a symptom you encounter in the context of stages of
everyday life, that's not a disease.''

<HEADLINE> Legislative leaders agree to act on raises for themselves, judges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Legislative leaders have reached an agreement to
advance a bill that would increase lawmaker pay by 40 percent and allow hefty
raises for the governor, state judges and other public officials.
<P>
	   Lawmakers in both houses of the state Legislature on Wednesday said a deal
has been worked out to advance the pay raise legislation in the waning days of
the lame-duck session. That means the bill will get a hearing in the Senate and
Assembly budget committees on Thursday, and advance to the floor of both houses
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have an agreement," said Sen. Joseph Kyrillos, R-Monmouth. "Now the
process will play out."
</P>
<P>
	   Kyrillos said the legislation would mirror the recommendations of the Public
Officers Salary Commission, which was set up last year by lawmakers who were
skittish over public reaction to giving themselves a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission says New Jersey lawmakers should get a $14,000 a year raise
to $49,000, which would make them one of the highest paid in the country. The
part-time lawmakers haven't had a pay raise since 1990, and if this one passes,
it wouldn't take effect until 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not many jobs go 12 years without a pay increase," said Assemblyman Michael
Carroll, R-Morris. "If you take a poll and ask people should you raise the
salary of, and fill in the blanks, it would always come out 90 percent no. But
the fact of the matter is no one ever loses an election on pay increases."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, however, have continually feared they would be hurt in elections
if they raised their own pay. That was one reason they set up the commission to
review the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the lawmaker pay, the commission suggested big raises for the
governor, judges, county prosecutors, cabinet positions, and members of the
Casino Control Commission, the State Commission of Investigation and the Board
of Public Utilities.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey governors have been allowed to take a $130,000 salary since 1990,
but former Gov. Jim Florio and Gov. Christie Whitman have accepted an $85,000
salary. The pay commission recommendation suggests a $175,000 maximum. That
would make New Jersey's governor the second highest paid in the nation, trailing
only New York, which pays its governor $179,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, state judges and county prosecutors would earn $141,000, up nearly 23
percent from $115,000. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, Deborah Poritz,
would earn $164,250. Cabinet-level positions in the state would be capped at
$141,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyrillos said lawmakers "are more comfortable with the process" because the
pay commission looked at their jobs and other jobs in state government. He said
"there was a sense that these issues were aired well."
</P>
<P>
	   Chuck Leitgeb, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, said "this
time around, there's a good many members who feel the pay raise is warranted."
Leitgeb noted that lawmakers would not actually see any extra money in their
paychecks until after the 2001 election because the state Constitution requires
they stand before the voters before receiving a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
	   However, pay commission member Sam Perelli, a taxpayer advocate, objected to
the raise proposal last month, calling it "Christmastime in New Jersey for
salary increases."
</P>
<P>
	   The pay raise issue stood dormant as no lawmaker introduced a bill during
the lame-duck session that followed Election Day and will end Tuesday. Since the
state Senate will remain the same and only four of the 80 Assembly members will
leave on Tuesday, there was little opportunity to have outgoing lawmakers act on
the pay raises to give cover for those who will remain.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, lawmakers at the last minute decided to rid themselves of the
pay raise issue in the legislative session's waning days. Thus, legislation
introduced early last year calling for various pay raises for public officials
will be amended in the committees to include the recommendations of the pay
raise commission, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said he believed the pay raise effort would also include raising the
salaries of county surrogates, sheriffs and clerks to a minimum of $105,750.
These salaries were not considered by the pay commission. Kyrillos, however,
said he did not believe this proposal would be "part and parcel" of the pay
raise bill. There is, however, another bill that would cover these pay raises,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talk of county official pay raises drew the wrath of Mercer County Executive
Robert Prunetti, who called it "a slap in the face to property taxpayers in this
state who should have a say regarding the salaries of their local officials."

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A protege of Sean "Puffy" Combs was indicted Wednesday on
an attempted murder charge stemming from a nightclub shooting last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamal "Shyne" Barrow, 21, was part of the rap mogul's entourage and
allegedly wounded three people at Club NY after a dispute, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, who is charged with illegal possession of a gun, and girlfriend
Jennifer Lopez, whom prosecutors declined to charge, testified before the grand
jury. Both reportedly said Combs was unarmed when he entered and left the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides attempted murder, Barrow is charged with assault, reckless
endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon. The attempted murder charge is
punishable by up to 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrow's lawyer, Murray Richman, said he expected Barrow to be indicted and

<HEADLINE> Algerian Held on Immigration Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Algerian suspected of having links to a countryman charged
with trying to smuggle explosives into the United States was ordered held
without bond Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, is charged with illegally entering the country and
eluding federal officers at the Canadian border. He was arrested Dec. 24 at the
border crossing at Blaine, about 100 miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha was to appear before a federal magistrate Wednesday, but his
attorney declined to challenge a government motion to detain him.
</P>
<P>
	   No link has been made in court between Tizegha and Ahmed Ressam, who has
pleaded innocent to federal charges accusing him of having bomb-making materials
in his rental car as he entered the country on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   But newspaper reports have said that Tizegha is linked to Ressam and that
Tizegha and another man investigated in the case, Abdel Ghani, are longtime
friends. Ghani was arrested Thursday and charged with helping Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth man, Abdel Majid Dahoumane, is believed to have stayed with Ressam
at a motel in British Columbia before Ressam was arrested. Warrants have been
issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   According to former CIA counterterrorism chief Vincent Cannistraro, all four
are part of a terrorist splinter group in Algeria that is supported by Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile believed to have masterminded last year's attack on two
U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannistraro, citing French counterterrorism officials, said Wednesday the
men belong to a faction that broke with the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria,
known by its French acronym GIA, over its practice of targeting fellow Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   French investigators have said Ressam has links to Fateh Kamel, who has been
jailed in Paris since April and is suspected of being the leader of an Islamic
militant group. Cannistraro said Kamel is the leader of the GIA splinter group
to which Ressam and the others belong, again citing French counterterrorism
sources.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Clash on Health Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley accused Al
Gore Wednesday night of deliberately distorting his plan to expand health care
coverage, but the vice president shot back in the first election year debate
that his rival's plan is ``entirely inadequate'' for the poor and others.
</P>
<P>
	   Prodded by moderator Peter Jennings to say whether Gore had ever taken a
quote or vote out of context, Bradley instantly replied, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, Bradley said, ``offended me'' by claiming he would hurt
African-Americans and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, standing a few feet away on University of New Hampshire stage,
paraphrased Harry Truman's famous utterance: ``I'm not giving him hell. I'm just
telling the truth and they thinks it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore held aloft a card that he said characterized Bradley's health plan and
contended the people of New Hampshire ``would be left out, left high and dry''
by Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me tell you how the private sector works,'' Bradley shot back, adding
that companies would quickly try to fashion coverage to meet the new demand.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange came about one-third of the way through the 60-minute debate,
the first in a series of confrontations in which Democrats and Republicans will
take turns debating in the run-up to the first balloting of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national frontrunner by far, but Bradley has mounted a
surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, and is even or
ahead in the polling in advance of the first primary set for Feb. 1 in New
Hampshire. That prompted the vice president to allude to his ``underdog''
status.
</P>
<P>
	   Wryly, Bradley said, ``your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Gore: ``I hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes on Feb. 1.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley launched a sharp attack on the Clinton-Gore administration's
handling of relations with Russia, saying the United States had not pushed hard
enough in the last eight years to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and
had agreed to send international aid to Russia ``knowing that corruption was
rampant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore issued a defense, saying, ``I think that in spite of the problems there
have been some successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were given the chance to pose questions to one another, and Gore
used his turn to ask Bradley whether he believed he had made a mistake on any of
three votes: Ronald Reagan's budget cuts in 1981, authorization for the ground
war against Iraq in 1990 and the welfare reform law that President Clinton
signed into law. Bradley defended them all.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, ``I think all three were mistakes.'' The vice president voted
against the budget cuts, in favor of using force in Kuwait and supported the
welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was worried that Bradley had refused to own up to any mistakes,
and was worried about that in a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley broke in to cite what he said was an error: his vote in 1987 against
confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. ``Now that was a
mistake,'' he said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley said Gore was guilty of campaign distortions, Gore said he
wouldn't level that charge against his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't accuse him of that. If you want a no, I'll give you a no,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley argued all the way to the debate, as the pace of their
battle quickened with the new year.

<HEADLINE> Abandoned Babies Program Launched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HASTINGS, Minn. (AP) -- A new program hopes to ease the problem of abandoned
babies by allowing parents to leave them anonymously at hospitals without fear
of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, dubbed ``A Safe Place for Newborns,'' involves three hospitals
in Dakota County and the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, county
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It will test whether eliminating the fear of prosecution or harsh judgment
will discourage women from abandoning their infants or intentionally killing
them.
</P>
<P>
	   A mother who anonymously brings in a newborn will be asked to volunteer
medical information about the baby. She will be given an identity bracelet
proving that she is the mother in case she wants to reclaim her child later.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital then contacts social services to arrange for foster care and
eventual adoption.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, the program is expected to expand throughout the state. Mobile,
Ala., has a similar program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I view this as an innovative program to prevent crime,'' Dakota County
Attorney James Backstrom said. ``We're looking for solutions to a potentially
serious problem before it occurs.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Americans Protest Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Touching off angry protests by hundreds of Cuban-Americans, the
U.S. government decided Wednesday to send 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba
because ``this little boy ... belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of an international tug-of-war since he was
found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his mother,
stepfather and eight others died while trying to reach Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been living with relatives in Miami, who have insisted they could
give Elian a better life than his father could back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American
immigration law and U.S. practice,'' Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner said at a news conference in Washington. ``This
little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ``made it very clear that he
wants Elian returned to him as soon as possible.'' Even though the boy's parents
were divorced, the INS found that Elian had a ``close and continuous
relationship'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency ruled that Elian must return to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the boy's relatives asked Attorney General Janet Reno to reverse
the decision and also planned to ask a federal judge for a restraining order.
They said the INS was violating its own rules by not allowing the boy to apply
for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was surprised because I always thought this was a place of liberty and
they are not letting him keep that liberty,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, the
boy's cousin. ``It's always about the father. What about the mother? That was
his mother's will.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department officials in Washington told The Associated Press that
Reno was consulted about the decision and could have intervened before the
ruling was issued.
</P>
<P>
	   The father could not be located for comment Wednesday. He and Elian's four
grandparents had dinner Tuesday in Havana with Fidel Castro, said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who went to Cuba to help
reunite father and son.
</P>
<P>
	   After the INS decision, several hundred people linked arms, shouted
``Liberty!'' and sang the Cuban national anthem in front of the house where
Elian has been staying with his paternal great-aunt and great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   In front of the Miami INS office, several hundred protesters waved Cuban and
American flags and shouted anti-Castro slogans.
</P>
<P>
	   The protests were emotional but peaceful, and paled in comparison to the
huge government-staged rallies in Havana demanding the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're using him as if he were a toy and Fidel Castro is saying, `He's
mine, not yours,''' said 28-year-old Norisbel Almeida, a mother of two young
children at the protest outside the home. ``Why did they show him the good life
so he could go back to Cuba and have nothing?''
</P>
<P>
	   Some argued that the Cuban-American community wrongly turned the boy's
plight into a political issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To them, this is about fighting Castro, this isn't about the well-being of
the boy,'' said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of
Miami. ``They turned him into a tool knowing they had no legal case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since he was rescued, Elian has been flooded with toys, visited Disney
World, celebrated his first Christmas in the United States and started attending
first grade.
</P>
<P>
	   He also been in the constant glare of TV cameras. Reporters and
photographers staked out the home Wednesday as TV helicopters hovered above the
house and tracked Elian's movement as he left school, dressed in his uniform of
blue pants and white shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members tried to shield Elian from the protests and media attention,
hustling him from school to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't know what is going on. We don't want to make him feel bad,''
Marisleysis Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said he was disappointed by the INS' decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian's mother gave her life for the freedom of her son,'' Bush said.
``Today's decision ... violates her desires for Elian and instead delivers him
to country where an oppressive dictator does not allow hope and where people
lack the most basic human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, the communist government warned its citizens to guard against
``excessive optimism'' about the U.S. government's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said he had honored a pledge to keep politics out of the
decision over the boy. ``The INS followed the law and the procedure and made the
decision that they made after an exhaustive review of the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has asked the Cuban government to let the father
escort the boy back home. Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, had said Cuba would not stop the father from going to the United
States as long as American officials first agreed to let the boy return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban adults who reach the U.S. mainland are routinely allowed to stay, but
the boy's age created diplomatic problems. Many Cuban exiles have insisted that
his mother's death in a bid to live in a free country was enough to allow Elian
to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a crime to send him back to Cuba,'' said Melba Roses, 56, who moved
to the United States from Cuba nearly 50 years ago. ``There is food here and in
Cuba there is none. The child has a right to stay.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what the boy has been saying, Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the
Miami family, said: ``He cares for his father but he would like his father to be
here with him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Cubans in Florida sympathized with the father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He should be with his father,'' Louis Bolivar, 32, said outside a shop
near Miami's Little Havana section. ``They're doing the right thing.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Union's 'Sickout' Blocked  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the union of
Northwest Airlines' flight attendants to stop its members from staging a
"sickout" over stalled contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Donovan Frank said officials of Teamsters Local 2000 must immediately
take "all reasonable steps within their power" to prevent flight attendants from
falsely calling in sick.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest had sought the decision, characterizing a higher-than-normal
illness rate around the holidays as "guerrilla warfare" by the attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said it has had to cancel more than 300 flights since Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Local 2000 President Billie Davenport said the union had told its members
not to participate in any illegal job action, but Frank wasn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
	   "The union's public posture may be one of denial, but the evidence indicates
that its private strategy is one of advocating a concerted 'sickout,"' Frank
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling specifically named Davenport and fellow union leaders Danny
Campbell, Andrew Damis and Jose Ibarra. Frank ordered them and "other people
acting in concert with them" to take all reasonable steps to prevent attendants
from calling in sick when they're not.
</P>
<P>
	   His order was to remain in effect until a hearing on a preliminary
injunction, which wasn't immediately scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest is based in Eagan, Minn.
</P>
<P>
	   Davenport and Northwest spokesman Jon Austin did not immediately return
phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing earlier Wednesday, Northwest attorney Timothy Thornton told
Frank that job action by members of Teamsters Local 2000 was "in the nature of
guerrilla warfare in labor relations" and must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   But union attorney Michael Bloom denied that Local 2000 had sanctioned any
job action and said there is no justification for a temporary restraining order
against the union or its officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where is the evidence that these flight attendants were not sick?" Bloom
asked. "The numbers do not speak for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Northwest said the flight attendants were
trying to pressure the airline in contract talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton said the sickout had slowed but was continuing. He said that more
than 650 flight attendants called in sick on Tuesday, compared with a daily sick
average of 381.
</P>
<P>
	   The Railway Labor Act prohibits sickouts and other job actions against
employers before the National Mediation Board has declared negotiations at an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   Although mediated talks between Northwest and its flight attendants have
been recessed since Dec. 7 and no talks are scheduled, the board has not
declared an impasse to trigger a 30-day countdown to a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton said Northwest intends to discipline flight attendants who stayed
away from work when they weren't sick. He said 12 union members would be
questioned on Thursday and said hundreds of flight attendants could lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 Northwest flight attendants has been seeking a new
contract since September 1996. In late August, Local 2000 members overwhelmingly
rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed by union negotiators.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Warned Against Elian Optimism  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's communist government warned citizens on Wednesday to
guard against ``excessive optimism'' after the United States announced a Cuban
boy rescued at sea must be returned to his father on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   Cubans have limited access to American news, but often learn of news events
through relatives in the United States, then pass the news on to others. A small
percentage of Cubans work in hotels or other places frequented by foreigners and
have access to CNN and other international media.
</P>
<P>
	   The combination of American media statements, rumors and speculation could
create ``excessive optimism or confusion in public opinion'' about the Elian
Gonzalez case, a statement on government television said.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said the government station would be extremely careful in its
reporting on the case ``so as not to affect the course of the battle under way
to achieve the boy's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government has in recent weeks turned its demands for the boy's
return into a national campaign, complete with huge public rallies. Despite the
news from Washington, a pro-Elian rally of Cuban scientists went ahead as
scheduled Wednesday afternoon, with President Fidel Castro in attendance.
</P>
<P>
	   Hassan Perez, president of the government's University Student Union, called
on the international community to help ensure that anti-Castro exiles in Miami
didn't block the boy's repatriation with legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing is certain concerning Elian's return to Cuba,'' Perez said.
``That's why we must not stop mobilizing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the shortage of information sources in Cuba, word spread quickly of
the noontime declaration by the INS that Elian ``belongs with his father,'' and
must be returned to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The news reached Elian's hometown of Cardenas, a two-hour's drive east of
Havana, by government broadcast. But residents said they were guarding their
enthusiasm until they were sure the boy was really coming back.
</P>
<P>
	   At Elian's school, built of weathered wooden planks, a handful of children
peered inside a window to look at Elian's empty school desk, which has been
transformed by communist officials into a symbol and reminder of the boy's
absence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This desk is untouchable,'' reads a handwritten sign.
</P>
<P>
	   Found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida in late November,
Elian has been the subject of an international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother died trying to get Elian and herself to the United States. The
boy's father lives in Cuba and wants him back. But Elian's relatives in Miami
have fought to keep the boy permanently, saying they could provide him with a
better life than he would have on the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, could not be located for comment on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He was not at his home in Cardenas, east of Havana. A woman answering the
phone at the house said she did not know where he and Elian's four grandparents
were.

<HEADLINE> New Beanie Baby Line Announced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Days after an Internet vote saved Beanie Babies from
extinction, the creator of the plush toy has introduced a new line of slightly
larger beanbag animals called Beanie Buddies.
</P>
<P>
	   Ty Inc. also announced on its Web site a line of pastel-colored, terry cloth
toys called Baby Ty, that are primarily for babies and very young children. In
addition, the company said new Beanie Babies will be introduced at toy shows
later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beanie Buddies will come in three sizes, up to 48 inches tall, according
to Mary Beth Sobolewski, editor of Mary Beth's Bean Bag World Monthly, which has
a business connection to Oak Brook-based Ty.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, Ty said it would "retire" the immensely popular line of bean bag
animals, but later announced it would let consumers decide via an online vote
whether the company should continue to produce them.
</P>
<P>
	   In what few would consider a surprise, 91 percent of the consumers who
logged onto Ty's Web site voted in favor of saving Beanie Babies, the company
announced Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Petersen Buys Sports Afield  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former publishing magnate Robert Petersen is getting
back into the magazine business with the purchase of the Hearst Corp. monthly
Sports Afield.
</P>
<P>
	   Petersen was publisher of such titles as Guns &AMP; Ammo, Petersen's Hunting and
Petersen's Bowhunting before selling his magazine empire, Petersen Publishing
Co., in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Purchasing Sports Afield is like a personal homecoming," Petersen said in a
news release. "It is a wonderful feeling to be back in the industry that I love
and at the helm of the oldest and most prestigious outdoor title in the
business."
</P>
<P>
	   Petersen plans to move Sports Afield's headquarters from New York to Los
Angeles. Plans also include returning the magazine to its traditional focus on
hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
	   Sports Afield was founded in 1887 and was acquired by Hearst in 1953.

<HEADLINE> Home Work Safety Rules Withdrawn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers and
corporate America, the Labor Department withdrew an advisory letter Wednesday
that had said companies have the same safety responsibilities for employees
working at home as in the office.
</P>
<P>
	   However, angry Republicans in Congress said they still plan to investigate
the circumstances surrounding the department's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Workforce Committee's panel
on employer-employee relations, said he wants Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to
give Congress all memos and other documentation relating to the advisory letter
sent to a company regarding at-home workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a fine line separating big government from Big Brother,'' Boehner
said. ``Americans deserve to know the full extent of this intrusive scheme.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., chairman of the House Workforce Committee's
investigations panel, has promised a hearing as early as this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans had already pledged to scrutinize the department over
regulations proposed in November that would require employers to minimize
everyday physical -- or ``ergonomic'' -- stresses of certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Herman said Wednesday that the advisory on at-home workers was an informal
response to questions from a single company and was not intended as a statement
of policy for all businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The letter, however, caused widespread confusion and unintended
consequences for others,'' she said in an interview. ``As a result of those
unintended consequences, I have made a decision to withdraw the letter today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the controversy has raised important questions about what
protections Americans working at home can expect from the government, Herman
said, so she will convene a conference of business and labor leaders and set up
an interagency task force to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We acknowledge ... that employers are responsible for employee safety and
health, but we don't know what that means and how that applies to these new work
arrangements in the home today. That is why we need a national dialogue on this
subject,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey issued a blunt response.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Based on the overwhelming outrage these regulations sparked, I'd say this
will be a short, one-sided conversation,'' the Texas Republican said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversial letter was written by officials at Labor's Occupational
Safety and Health Administration in response to a Texas-based credit services
company that had sought advice about moving some sales executives into home
offices.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA provided specific examples in an area of law that has remained unclear,
even as the number of Americans regularly working at home has swelled to almost
20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Such ``interpretation'' letters to individual companies often are made
public, and other businesses look to them for guidance. This one, dated Nov. 15,
was posted on the Labor Department's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   Once business groups noticed, they called attention to it, sparking news
reports early this week and strong condemnation from Republicans on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA officials insisted Tuesday there had been no change in policy and that
there would be no government inspections of home offices.
</P>
<P>
	   The criticism continued, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Cleary, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
applauded Herman's retraction Wednesday, but said, ``The call for a national
dialogue seems a little late and, frankly, seems timed to the news cycle with a
view to killing an embarrassing story. ... Better late than never, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO's director of safety and health, Peg Seminario, said, ``If
you're moving into an area here that has such broad application, you want to do
this in a considered way. So, we're glad to be a part of this dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The now-retracted OSHA letter said, ``All employers, including those which
have entered into 'work at home' agreements with employees, are responsible for
complying with ... safety and health standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   It described how an employer could be liable if it knew or reasonably should
have known about home workplace hazards -- such as computers that overload home
electrical circuits, creating a fire hazard, or rickety stairs leading to a
basement office.
</P>
<P>
	   And it suggested companies should train people to set up safe home offices
and periodically inspect at-home workers' quarters.

    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, settled
in Wednesday for their first meal and overnight stay in their new $1.7 million
home in this well-to-do hamlet north of New York City.
<P>
	   "Like any new homeowners, they're excited," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart after the couple arrived. Joining them was the president's
mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend who also lives in Westchester County and has vacationed with the
Clintons in Martha's Vineyard brought over home-cooked food for dinner. The
house near the bottom of a cul-de-sac was blocked off; reporters and onlookers
were kept behind a barricade.
</P>
<P>
	   While some of the 17,000 residents in the upscale suburb have complained
about the attention drawn by the Clintons, many seemed eager to greet them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's been some disturbance for the people" on the Clintons'
street, said Wilma Rapp. "Other than that, people feel pretty good about the
Clintons. You tell somebody you live in Chappaqua and they say, 'Oh! Hillary!"'
</P>
<P>
	   The town already has had its share of the famous: actor Chevy Chase, Tony
Award-winning actress Glenn Close, New York Yankees center fielder Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, Mrs. Clinton - who needs a New York address to run for the U.S.
Senate - was scheduled to arrive alone to unpack. An unexpected break in the
president's schedule allowed him to accompany the first lady, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons' furniture and other goods arrived Tuesday afternoon in two
moving vans. The president has said they both plan to live in Chappaqua after he
leaves office in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The president planned an early Thursday return to Andrews Air Force Base,
although it was not known if he then would go to the White House or back to the
Mideast peace talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before their arrival, the Clintons had caused several minor stirs.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, protesters upset by U.S. policy in East Timor marched outside
the home - even though it was still vacant. In November, the government quashed
plans to sell T-shirts reading "Secret Service, Chappaqua Bureau, Presidential
Detail," saying use of the Secret Service label was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Local officials soon made parking on the Clintons' cul-de-sac illegal to
spare neighbors any imposition from the media. Authorities also approved
installation of an 8-foot fence and a guard booth on the Clintons' property;
neither is yet in place.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican
opponent in this year's U.S. Senate race, played on the "carpetbagger" theme he
has used against Mrs. Clinton in offering a backhanded welcome to her and the
president.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very, very proud of the fact that people from around the country
want to come to New York, including people from Arkansas," Giuliani said. "We
welcome all newcomers, and recognize the fact that they are newcomers."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar sentiments were offered by Gov. George Pataki, another Republican,
during his state of the state address in Albany: "Why, even people from Hope,
Arkansas, understand that New York is the best state to live in."

<HEADLINE> Seattle's WTO Bill Hits $9 Million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Five days of rioting during the World Trade Organization
meeting raised the city's cost of hosting the conference to $9 million,
surpassing the city's worst-case projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Broken windows, graffiti and trash littered the streets after some of the
45,000 protesters demonstrating against the WTO meeting turned violent. Police
overtime bills were higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The city had hoped the federal government and the private group that
arranged the WTO conference, which began Nov. 29, would help pay for security
for WTO delegates and their staff, but most of that funding has dried up.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Host Committee had planned to reimburse the city up to $1.5
million for security, but Director Ray Waldmann said the city will be lucky to
get $100,000. He said the organization had barely raised enough money to cover
its own expenses, much less offset the city's costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The final bill to taxpayers may be even higher once the city adds the cost
of public defenders for protesters who plan to fight their arrests in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials had estimated the conference would cost the city $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we had known the costs would be this large in the beginning, would we
have agreed?'' said Councilwoman Jan Drago.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the city's costs, downtown Seattle businesses lost an
estimated $20 million in property damage and lost sales during the conference.

<HEADLINE> Norway Rescue Effort a Disaster  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- It was a rescue worker's nightmare. Intense heat from
the burning trains. Freezing cold of a Norwegian winter. Trapped, tortured
victims almost within arm's reach yet impossible to save.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The worst thing to experience is to stand there and watch people burn,''
said Ola Sunderaal, one of the first rescuers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The head-on collision between two passenger trains on Tuesday was one of the
worst in Norwegian history, with 20 believed dead. The exact number remained
unclear a day after the crash because of uncertainly about precisely how many
people -- about 100 -- were on board.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-speed crash was so savage that several rail cars were compressed
into a pile of metal the length of a single car. A 100-ton locomotive lay on its
side, which rescuers hope to move Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires blazed for about six hours hampering initial rescue efforts. Five
bodies were pulled from the wreckage before darkness fell Wednesday. Twelve in
all have been recovered with at least four more bodies are on the train.
</P>
<P>
	   Police late Wednesday adjusted the number of missing and presumed dead to 4,
from about 20 earlier in the day. They gave no reason for the downward revision,
but said there was no hope of finding more survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 30 passengers and crew who were injured, 12 remained in the hospital,
some with broken bones.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident happened at Rena, Norway, about 110 miles north of the capital
Oslo.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the high-pitched scream of cutting tools ripped through the
forest silence and tangled wreckage of the trains to pry loose bodies, many
burned beyond recognition. The process could take days to complete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very hard work because (the bodies) are so stuck in the wreckage.''
said Trond Simarud, a rescue specialist. ``We have to work millimeter by
millimeter (inch by inch) to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, three busloads of friends and relatives of the dead and
missing arrived to place flowers, light candles and seek solace. Young soldiers,
many of whom had spent the freezing night in tents, cordoned off the wreck site.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, family members, some crying, joined rescue workers and police in
uniform for memorial services in nearby churches, where torches burned outside
in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, bulldozers, army tanks and workers felled tall pine trees to
improve access to the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering stink of smoke from the burned-out wreckage was a pungent
reminder of the chaos, terror and frustration of the previous day.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunderaal, an ambulance crewman, recalled he had entered wrecked cars trying
to help. The fire drove him back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the worst thing I have experienced, going through the train seeing
people who were alive and conscious who we couldn't help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An express train, with 83 people aboard, was headed south for the city of
Trondheim. A local train, at first said to have 17 people aboard, was headed
north. The state railroad NSB on Wednesday said that number was no longer
certain.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash has not been determined. The trains raced at each
other at about 55 mph around a corner. The engineers had no chance to stop,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad directorate said it was investigating media reports that
traffic managers, who remotely monitor trains, had been unable to warn the
trains because they had the wrong cellular phone numbers for the engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference in Oslo Wednesday evening, Steinar Killi, the head of
the directorate, said there had not been contact between the traffic managers
and the engineers just before the crash, although it was not clear why. He also
said no technical faults were found on the line Wednesday, so one of the trains
apparently missed a stop signal.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from Wednesday's debate in Durham, N.H., between Democratic
presidential candidates Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, as
transcribed by Federal Document Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On Gore's behavior during President Clinton's impeachment:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think that that was a very trying time for the country. I'm glad
it's over. The vice president I think was vice president, which means that he
was not critical of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   I personally believe that any time a public official, a president, lies, he
undermines his own authority and squanders the people's trust. I said that from
the beginning of this. It's a sad period of our history, and I'm glad it's over.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: As an American who was serving as vice president, I was critical of
the president. As an American, I also defended the office of the presidency
against an effort by partisan Republicans in the House and Senate to deliver a
thoroughly disproportionate penalty for a serious and reprehensible personal
mistake on the part of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   He should not have been removed from office for that offense. In fighting
against their effort to remove him from office and undo the act of the American
people in twice electing him, I think I was serving the public interest well.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On discussions of religion in political campaigns:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I strongly support the separation of church and state. I strongly
support the First Amendment, the establishment clause. I oppose, for example,
the teaching of creationism in the public schools, I think that violates that
provision of our Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   .... Do you think that a public official who is asked whether or not he is a
believer has an obligation to dodge the question and not answer the question? I
think that we should be free and open about what our beliefs are. But that's my
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   I respect Senator Bradley's decision to handle that question differently.
And I think that all of us should answer it for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: In 1978, I was running for the Senate. I was running against a
Republican. And in the general election campaign he converted to Catholicism,
and New Jersey is a highly Catholic state.
</P>
<P>
	   I had a lot of people come to me in my circle and say you should go after
this. And I said stay away from that as far as you can. A person's religious
faith belongs to them.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a new decision on my part, not to discuss religion in the middle
of a political campaign. This is a decision that I've held throughout my public
life because I think religious faith is the deepest, most personal, most
intimate belief system that any individual has.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On China and Russia policy under the Clinton-Gore administration:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I think that in spite of the problems there have been some
successes. Russia just has a new president committed to reform, in spite of the
brutal war in Chechnya, in spite of the corruption they have, the uneven rule of
law and the other problems. They have a free press. Not as free as ours, but
it's certainly an improvement over what they had. They have free elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In China, I think that we need to demand the respect for human rights and
religious freedom. But bringing China into the community of nations, fostering
peace between China and Taiwan, and engaging them in a way that furthers our
values, I think that's in our interest.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I look at our relations with Russia over the last eight years and I
think we've had a missed opportunity. They came; they wanted to know what to do.
I think that we have not pushed hard enough for a reduction in strategic nuclear
weapons, destruction of nuclear stockpiles. I believe that we sent IMF money to
Russia, knowing that corruption was rampant.
</P>
<P>
	   We need to be very clear about condemning the war in Chechnya, which is, I
think, politically irresponsible and morally reckless.

<HEADLINE> Testimony begins in trial of accused Camden cocaine cartel leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A businessman accused of masterminding a cocaine
cartel in Camden served as the "advisor to virtually every drug dealer in the
city," a prosecutor alleged in opening arguments Wednesday in his drug
conspiracy trial.
<P>
	   Jose "J.R." Rivera and co-defendant Luis "Tun" Figueroa went on trial in
what some observers consider the biggest drug prosecution in Camden history.
</P>
<P>
	   The two were among 14 defendants charged in 1998 for their alleged roles in
a cocaine ring that prosecutors say used threats, intimidation and violence to
control a lucrative market in the city for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one killing - the execution of a rival drug dealer in 1993 - has
been blamed on the drug ring. Figueroa, an alleged enforcer, is charged in that
killing.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officials have described the organization, which ran a $21
million-a-year business, as the most entrenched and significant drug cartel in
Camden's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera and Figueroa - the only defendants charged in the case to go to trial
- maintain their innocence. The remaining defendants pleaded guilty and are
expected to provide incriminating testimony detailing the organization's
operations, including murder, money laundering and drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
	   Their attorneys began laying the groundwork Wednesday for the likely defense
strategy to attack the credibility of drug dealers-turned informants who struck
deals in exchange for lighter sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter how you dress up a rat, he brings up with him the stench of the
sewer," attorney Marc Neff, who represents Rivera, told the jury. "Each of you
has the right to be offended by that stench."
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, 40, a businessman who owned an auto parts store and a gym, was the
financier for the organization and often presided at meetings, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Sally Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said drug dealers brought their profits - thousands of dollars in
small bills stuffed in paper bags and duffel bags - to Rivera to convert into
assets.
</P>
<P>
	   At one city location, the ring sold two kilos of cocaine weekly, netting
$80,000, Smith said. One dealer who bought cocaine from the ring said he "could
sell as many kilos as he could get his hands on," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera purchased cars, houses, boats and businesses for the dealers - in his
name - to avoid attracting the attention of law enforcement, Smith said. The
dealers, with no legitimate sources of income, could not make large cash
transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   A self-made millionaire, Rivera began selling drugs in the 1980s in a Camden
housing development, Smith said. By 1991, Rivera was no longer directly involved
in the distribution, but was still profiting from drug-dealing, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't have to touch the drugs to make a profit from them," Smith told
the jury of 13 women and four men. "Other people do that."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Smith, Rivera used his law enforcement contacts to obtain
information on investigative techniques to help dealers avoid arrest. At least
one police officer - a former bodyguard for Mayor Milton Milan has been
implicated and admitted selling the ring an illegal assault weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan has said in published interviews that he received campaign
contributions from Rivera, his boyhood friend. Milan has not been charged with
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The ring imported large amounts of cocaine from New York and Puerto Rico and
distributed it in the 9-square mile city of 87,000 in bulk and street-level
quantities, authorities allege.
</P>
<P>
	   Figueroa worked his way through the ranks from a lowly bagger to one of the
biggest kilo distributors in the city, Smith said. He used his connections in
his native Puerto Rico to import hundreds of kilos of cocaine, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the organization primarily supplied drugs for two locations
in the city: the alley, behind Morse and Boyd streets and the "33rd Street Set"
at 33rd Street and Westfield Avenue.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury is expected to hear from Saul Febo, a former top associate in the
organization who admitted his role in the execution-style killing of a rival
drug dealer and implicated Figueroa as the actual triggerman.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial before U.S. District Judge Joseph Rodriguez is expected to last up
to three months. If convicted on drug conspiracy charges, Rivera and Figueroa
face life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Shooter Was Ex-Employee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The man arrested on suspicion of killing two people in a
shipyard shooting in November that set Seattle on edge admitted that he owned a
backpack that contained the murder weapon, a prosecutor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin William Cruz, 30, was a former employee of Northlake Shipyard who lost
his disability pay for faking the extent of his injuries, the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer reported.
</P>
<P>
	   He was arrested late Tuesday after a passer-by found a weathered backpack
containing a gun, ammunition and camouflage clothing in a blackberry thicket a
few hundred yards from the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
	   Bail was set at $4 million Wednesday for Cruz, 30, of SeaTac. He did not
speak during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Prosecutor Tim Bradshaw said the Washington State Patrol confirmed
the gun, a Glock 9mm semiautomatic, was used in the Nov. 3 shootings of Peter
Giles, 27, of Seattle, the shipyard bookkeeper, and Russell James Brisendine,
43, of Lynnwood, a marine engineer. Two others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The high bail ``speaks to the gravity of the crime,'' Bradshaw said after
the hearing before Superior Court Judge Mark Chow.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradshaw said Cruz acknowledged ownership of the backpack after he was read
his rights by arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is some indication he has been in possession of the gun before,''
the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chow denied requests from Public Defender Lorraine Roberts for lower bail,
citing Cruz's criminal record of assault, domestic violence and escape.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz was being held for investigation of homicide and attempted murder. His
next court date is Friday. If he is charged, he will be arraigned at that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Capt. John Diaz said after the arrest that the shooting ``was in fact
a workplace violence issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz left the shipyard because of an injury and received disability payments
for a time from a private insurer, said spokeswoman Jeannine Lupton at the U.S.
Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some point, the private insurer stopped paying. The file says there
wasn't medical evidence to support his alleged disability,'' Lupton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Local media reported the payments were cut off due to a videotape that
showed an able-bodied Cruz.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradshaw confirmed the tape exists and indicated it may have been made by a
private detective.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz let his hair and beard grow to make it harder for former co-workers to
recognize him during the attack, then shaved and cut his hair afterward, the
Post-Intelligencer reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The backpack was found Sunday by a bicyclist about 10 feet off a bike path.
</P>
<P>
	   The backpack also contained such things as an Army-surplus camouflage
jacket, a pair of sneakers, a toiletry bag, a holster and a leather cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
	   Diaz said the backpack may have escaped notice during a police search that
followed the shooting because foliage was thicker at the time.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Union's 'Sickout' Blocked  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the union of
Northwest Airlines' flight attendants to stop its members from staging a
"sickout" over stalled contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Donovan Frank said officials of Teamsters Local 2000 must immediately
take "all reasonable steps within their power" to prevent flight attendants from
falsely calling in sick.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest had sought the decision, characterizing a higher-than-normal
illness rate around the holidays as "guerrilla warfare" by the attendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said it has had to cancel more than 300 flights since Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Local 2000 President Billie Davenport said the union had told its members
not to participate in any illegal job action, but Frank wasn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
	   "The union's public posture may be one of denial, but the evidence indicates
that its private strategy is one of advocating a concerted 'sickout,"' Frank
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling specifically named Davenport and fellow union leaders Danny
Campbell, Andrew Damis and Jose Ibarra. Frank ordered them and "other people
acting in concert with them" to take all reasonable steps to prevent attendants
from calling in sick when they're not.
</P>
<P>
	   His order was to remain in effect until a hearing on a preliminary
injunction, which wasn't immediately scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Jon Austin, a spokesman for Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest, said company
officials regretted it was necessary to seek the court order.
</P>
<P>
	   "The vast majority of our flight attendants continue to professionally
fulfill their obligations to our customers. We are proud of their
professionalism and dedication in the face of difficult circumstances," Austin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Davenport, the union local president, sent a letter to flight attendants
late Wednesday afternoon again denying allegations made by Northwest in its
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must not let the company tactics pull us apart and, at the same time, we
cannot let a handful of individual flight attendants determine their own
strategy separate and apart from the majority," Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that is determined to have happened in this case it may be a costly
lesson for those individuals and will have given Northwest the opportunity to
distract us from negotiating where our time and energy should be today," she
added.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing earlier Wednesday, Northwest attorney Timothy Thornton told
Frank that job action by members of Teamsters Local 2000 was "in the nature of
guerrilla warfare in labor relations" and must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   But union attorney Michael Bloom denied that Local 2000 had sanctioned any
job action and said there is no justification for a temporary restraining order
against the union or its officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where is the evidence that these flight attendants were not sick?" Bloom
asked. "The numbers do not speak for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Northwest said the flight attendants were
trying to pressure the airline in contract talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton said the sickout had slowed but was continuing. He said that more
than 650 flight attendants called in sick on Tuesday, compared with a daily sick
average of 381.
</P>
<P>
	   The Railway Labor Act prohibits sickouts and other job actions against
employers before the National Mediation Board has declared negotiations at an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   Although mediated talks between Northwest and its flight attendants have
been recessed since Dec. 7 and no talks are scheduled, the board has not
declared an impasse to trigger a 30-day countdown to a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton said Northwest intends to discipline flight attendants who stayed
away from work when they weren't sick. He said 12 union members would be
questioned on Thursday and said hundreds of flight attendants could lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 Northwest flight attendants has been seeking a new
contract since September 1996. In late August, Local 2000 members overwhelmingly
rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed by union negotiators.

<HEADLINE> Solitary confinement ordered for inmate who confessed to killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge has ordered solitary confinement for a drug
dealer who calmly recounted participating in killing six men - a confession that
apparently convinced the judge the accused was too dangerous to talk to other
inmates.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum questioned Peter Rollock about
each of his murders during a lengthy guilty plea Tuesday, a deal Rollock agreed
to in order to avoid a possible death sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   By Wednesday, Rollock - nicknamed "Pistol Pete" - was in solitary
confinement awaiting a March 24 sentencing for his role in the murders carried
out by the Sex, Money and Murder gang he led from 1990 through 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his plea agreement, Rollock was required to agree to restrictive
conditions of confinement, including solitary, with no contact from other
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Rollock admitted participating in six murders, two conspiracies to murder,
witness tampering by murder, drug distribution and using and carrying firearms
in connection with crimes of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   He faces life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   During the plea, Rollock described each of the killings, demonstrating his
role as leader of the group most vividly with his description of a former
associate's murder.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was in prison in North Carolina when he gave his gang permission
to murder the former associate, someone who had helped him murder others in the
past.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did you agree to it or did you order it?" Cedarbaum asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "I approved it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did they need your approval?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes. I don't think they would have acted if they didn't get my approval,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeatedly, Rollock admitted his role as a gang leader with deadly
intentions, beginning with the August 1993 killing of a man in Manhattan who
Rollock thought had a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're telling me this was self defense?" the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Rollock explained that he actually wanted to kill the man because he
viewed him as a threat to other members of his drug operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was your regular practice as the leader of this group to carry a gun?"
the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes," he said.

<P>
	   On campaign finance reform and possible 1996 fund raising:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I think that the Democratic National Committee in the 1996
campaign pressed the limits. Although there were no legal violations, it was
wrong. And I think that the phone calls that I made were a mistake. I think that
we need campaign finance reform, because almost everybody who has been involved
in this process has run up against the kind of problems that it causes. I think
that ultimately we're going to have to have a system of full public financing.
</P>
<P>
	   And the single-most effective immediate reform we could cause is for the
both of us to agree to eliminate the majority of the money that goes for these
30-second, 60-second TV-radio ads and just debate twice a week. And I'm willing
to do that only in New Hampshire if Bill thinks that is a disadvantage to him
nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Well, let me tell you. If you are not known by as many people in
the country as Al is -- I'm not known by as many people -- my only opportunity
to get known is through a 30-second television commercial, which, quite frankly,
if you know what you believe, is really not a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain and I stood on a place in Claremont not so long ago and said
that if we were the nominees of our party, we would not take soft money in this
election. We need public financing of elections. We spend $900 million a year
promoting democracy abroad. For about the same amount of money we could take --
we could take the special interests out of democracy.

	   GORE: Well, I think that it's -- I think that it's a natural development in
a country that's free. And we represent the virtues of freedom in the world. I
believe that it's incumbent upon national policymakers who try to make the right
decisions to understand the interaction of public policy and what happens in the
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the biggest issues in this campaign is whether or not we will have a
president with the experience to keep our prosperity going, and avoid a kind of
economic blueprint that either blows the whole surplus on a risky tax scheme or
blows the whole surplus on an unwise plan and doesn't leave room for investing
in the future in the kind of investments that have helped to contribute to this
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: There's no question that we are moving to a new world. It is driven
by technological change and globalization. Our productivity in this country has
increased 2.75 percent over the next -- over the last two years. That's a
percent more than any previous time in the last 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   That means we have more money. Now some of that money goes to people who've
made investments.
</P>
<P>
	   But the challenge for leadership in this country is to take what is a
national problem and convert it into a public issue and then engage the idealism
of the American people in support of that public issue. And this time in our
country's history, at this time of unprecedented prosperity, the challenge is to
take this unprecedented prosperity and turn it to the benefit of those who have
been left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: You know, some -- sometimes it seems a little -- Bill gets a little
out of sorts just talking -- when I talk about the substance of the policy. I
certainly do not want to talk about him as a person, especially not in a
critical way. I respect Bill, I really do. I'm not just saying that as a ploy. I
think he's a genuinely good person.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Do you agree with him?
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I agree with what he said, yes, I think I'm a generally good
person.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On gun control:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Al, I have proposed registration and licensing of all handguns, all
65 million handguns in America. President Clinton has said he is for that. We're
in the midst of this tremendous rash of gun violence in America. Thirteen
children are killed every day on the streets of this country, that's a Columbine
every day. Eight-hundred-thousand kids took a gun to school at least once last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Registration and licensing is what we do for automobiles. Why can't we do it
for handguns in America and why don't you support it?
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I do support licensing of the purchase of all new handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: New handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: And what the president said was that, yes, he supports that idea but
it doesn't have a prayer of ever becoming law and it's much more sensible to try
to get the maximum gun control that we possibly can.
</P>
<P>
	   Let me tell you, I know about fighting for gun control. I helped to pass the
toughest new gun control measure in a generation. I cast the tie-breaking vote
to take on the NRA and close the gun show loophole. It took a hard fight to pass
the Brady bill and make it the Brady law, to establish the three day waiting
period.
</P>
<P>
	   I want to go farther and completely ban Saturday Night Specials and junk
guns and assault weapons, and have what's called super tracing so that when a
gun is used in any kind of crime, it can be immediately traced.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Debate in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley accused Al
Gore Wednesday night of deliberately distorting his proposal to expand health
coverage, but the vice president shot back in the first debate of the election
year that his rival's plan would leave many New Hampshire residents ``high and
dry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prodded by debate moderator Peter Jennings to say whether Gore had ever
taken a quote or vote out of context, Bradley instantly replied, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, Bradley said, ``offended me'' by claiming he would hurt
African-Americans and Latinos'' and by saying his health care plan would
shortchange many Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, standing a few feet away on a University of New Hampshire stage,
paraphrased Harry Truman's famous utterance: ``I'm not giving him hell. I'm just
telling the truth and he thinks it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore held aloft a card that he said characterized Bradley's health plan and
contended the people of New Hampshire ``would be left out, left high and dry''
by Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me tell you how the private sector works,'' shot back Bradley, a
former New Jersey senator, adding that health insurance companies would quickly
try to fashion coverage to meet the new demand.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange came one-third of the way through the 60-minute debate, the
first in a series of confrontations in which Democrats and Republicans will take
turns debating in the run-up to the first balloting of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national frontrunner by far, but Bradley has mounted a
surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, and is even or
ahead in the polling in advance of the first primary set for Feb. 1 in New
Hampshire. That prompted the vice president to allude to his ``underdog''
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes,'' Bradley said wryly.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Gore: ``I hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes on Feb. 1.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two men agreed on some issues, citing a need for stricter gun control
laws and saying they would make appointments to the Joint Chiefs of Staff only
if they would implement a policy of permitting gays to serve openly in the
military.
</P>
<P>
	   But the two rivals came prepared for battle, clashing on local issues --
including development within the White Mountain National Forest in northern New
Hampshire -- as well as national concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley launched a sharp attack on the Clinton-Gore administration's
handling of relations with Russia, saying the United States had not pushed hard
enough in the last eight years to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and
had agreed to send international aid to Russia ``knowing that corruption was
rampant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore issued a defense, saying, ``I think that in spite of the problems there
have been some successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were given the chance to pose questions to one another, and Gore
used his turn to ask Bradley whether he believed he had made a mistake on any of
three votes he had cast: in favor of Ronald Reagan's budget cuts in 1981,
opposed to authorizing the ground war against Iraq in 1990 and against the
welfare reform law that President Clinton signed into law. Bradley defended each
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, ``I think all three were mistakes.'' While serving in Congress,
Gore voted against the budget cuts and in favor of using force in Kuwait and as
vice president supported the welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was worried that Bradley had refused to own up to any mistakes,
and was worried about that quality in a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley broke in to cite what he said was an error he had made: his vote in
1987 against confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. ``Now that
was a mistake,'' he said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley said Gore was guilty of campaign distortions, Gore said he
wouldn't level that charge against his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't accuse him of that. If you want a no, I'll give you a no,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening question referred to Clinton and his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that anytime a president or public official lies, he undermines
his authority. But he offered no criticism of Gore's behavior during the
year-long impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said he thought he had served ``the national interest
well'' during that period, making plain his disapproval of Clinton's actions,
yet defending him against what he said was an unwarranted Republican attempt to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, despite a candidacy that boasts of time spent out of public
life, Bradley said politics is a ``noble profession. I don't think it's corrupt
or deceitful ... The only way you are going to achieve something is through
politics,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hartford's improved test scores may be enough to meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Higher scores on the 1999 Connecticut Mastery
Test are part of the broader process of improving the Hartford public schools,
the schools superintendent says.
<P>
	   Hartford students improved more in a single year than in the past four years
combined on the standardized tests given to students in fourth, sixth and eighth
grades.
</P>
<P>
	   "These scores signify a beginning, not an end," said Matt Losak, a spokesman
for Superintendent of Schools Anthony S. Amato. "We have a lot more work to do.
We have every reason to be proud that we're on the right track."
</P>
<P>
	   Losak also credited the schools' board of trustees, teachers and the
teachers' union with improving the scores.
</P>
<P>
	   Math scores among fourth graders increased 13 percent and reading and
writing scores rose 7 percent from 1998 to 1999. Writing scores among sixth
graders rose by 7 percent; reading scores by 11 percent and math scores by 21
percent. Eighth-grade math scores improved by 11 percent; reading scores by 12
percent and writing scores rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   When he took the helm of Hartford's troubled schools on April 1, Amato, a
former district superintendent in New York City, promised Hartford parents that
their children would "never be last again" on a statewide scoring index.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford ranks 164th out of 164 school districts statewide. Although a new
index has not been calculated officially, sources told The Hartford Courant on
Tuesday it appears Hartford's double-digit gains in math and reading would be
enough to lift the city out of last place.
</P>
<P>
	   "Superintendent Amato is more interested in how we did against ourselves
than any other district," Losak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The district has not said that the scores would raise Hartford from the
bottom of the index, Losak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford's index score of 41.1 last year was 4.9 points behind New Haven and
5.3 points behind Windham. Although New Haven's test scores improved in most
categories, the city did not see the significant gains that Hartford did.
</P>
<P>
	   In math, four percent more New Haven fourth- and sixth-graders scored above
the state goal, while scores for eighth-graders held steady. Fourth- and
eighth-graders showed improvement in reading, but scores for students in sixth
grade fell slightly. In writing, seven percent more eighth-graders scored above
the state goal and sixth-graders also improved, but fourth-graders' scores
dipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've seen some progress that I'm very, very happy about," said New Haven
Schools Superintendent Reginald Mayo. "I believe in slow, sustained growth for
test scores and that's basically what we're doing in New Haven."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayo credited improvements on revamped teacher training and several programs
established last year, including providing mentors for young readers.
</P>
<P>
	   Official scores for all Connecticut cities and towns will be released in
February.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Address African Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and former South African
President Nelson Mandela will brief the U.N. Security Council this month as part
of a U.S. campaign to showcase African problems.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the Security Council's new president,
invited the contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to be the
kickoff speaker at the first event Monday on the impact of the AIDS epidemic on
peace and security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting will mark the first time a health issue is discussed by the
Security Council and the first time a U.S. vice president will preside, said
Holbrooke, who has been touted as a possible secretary of state if Gore is
elected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``AIDS is far more than a health issue in Africa,'' Holbrooke said in his
statement Wednesday. ``It is also a security issue. Vice President Gore will
address the changing nature of security threats around the globe including,
specifically, the security threat presented by AIDS in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela, meanwhile, is scheduled to brief an open meeting of the council on
Jan. 19 on the situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela has just taken on the job of trying to facilitate talks between
rebels and the government to end Burundi's civil war. Violence in the country
has escalated in recent months following the stalemate in peace talks and the
illness and death of the previous mediator, former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
	   A major focus of Holbrooke's month on Africa will be the Congo, where the
government and rebel forces have accused each other of breaking a cease-fire
they signed during the summer. He has set aside five days from Jan. 24-28 for
council meetings on Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata will brief the council on
Jan. 13 on the plight of more than 4 million African refugees on the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a
vociferous campaigner for U.N. reform, has accepted an invitation to address the
Security Council on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the Senate passed the Helms-Biden bill which will pay millions
of dollars in U.S. back dues to the United Nations, provided the world body
meets specific reform targets.

<HEADLINE> Europe Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left interest rates
unchanged at its regular board meeting today, but the bank's top official warned
inflation still could heat up.
</P>
<P>
	   ECB president Wim Duisenberg skirted direct mention of boosting interest
rates, but said inflation was rising, mainly as a result of increasing energy
costs, and would peak early this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is essential that the immediate upward movement does not translate into
general inflationary pressures," he said. "Indeed, stability-oriented behavior
is urgently required."
</P>
<P>
	   While economists expected the ECB to hold its main rate for lending to
commercial banks steady at 3 percent today, most feel an interest rate increase
was in the works -- perhaps as early as March -- to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank kept rates steady today mainly to avoid shocking investors, said
Michael Schubert, an economist with Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will want to prepare the markets for their moves," he said. "They have
to first assess the aftermath of Y2K and carefully consider money growth in
December and January."
</P>
<P>
	   One sign that the ECB wants to keep tight control over money supply came
early today, when the bank announced it would buy back the excess money it had
dispersed as a precaution against a run on banks over New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   But attention was mainly on interest rates, which the ECB carefully
regulates to keep inflation below 2 percent in the 11 countries using Europe's
common currency, the euro. Forecasts put this year's inflation rate at 1.5
percent, but that is likely to increase as the European economy improves.
</P>
<P>
	   Any sign that inflation is on the rise could pressure the ECB to raise
interest rates, as it did Nov. 4 when it boosted the rate by half a point.
</P>
<P>
	   Schubert said an initial increase of quarter of a percentage point is likely
in the spring, and that another quarter-percentage-point raise could follow in
the fall -- especially if the European economic recovery takes hold.
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg said economies in Europe were on the mend and poised for further
growth thanks to more job creation, increased consumer spending and greater
industrial productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, the euro zone economy is expected to grow by 3 percent, up from
an estimated 2.1 percent last year. Exports and consumer spending are expected
to fuel the expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Also putting pressure on the ECB were German unemployment figures released
today. While the number of Germans out of work rose above 4 million mark in
December, the Federal Labor Office said the increase was due mainly to seasonal
factors such as holiday closings and winter weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployment rate rose to 10.3 percent in December from 10 percent in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   Duisenberg warned that it is important for wages not to outpace productivity
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve is expected to review its U.S. rate policy in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Expectations for higher interest rates across the board hammered stock
markets around the world this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet investors also appeared to be taking profits amid the perception that
some shares ended last year overvalued, and Duisenberg downplayed the role of
interest rate jitters in the recent plunge.
</P>
<P>
	   "A strong boom with a quick correction afterward is not at all unusual," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mob Associate Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Reputed Rhode Island mob associate Robert DeLuca on Wednesday
pleaded guilty to gambling and extortion charges.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLuca's lawyer, Randy Gioia, had said his client would plead guilty to
parts of a wide-ranging 1995 racketeering indictment that brought down other
alleged mobsters, including Francis ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme and confessed
hitman John Martorano.
</P>
<P>
	   Alleged mob boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger was also indicted, but remains a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLuca -- who is already serving prison time on other federal charges --
agreed to a deal that will get him out of jail by around 2005, Gioia said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the five years since Bulger bolted on word that he was the subject of a
massive racketeering indictment, the net has closed around his cohorts. But
there's still no sign of Whitey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's as important as ever, and we are as committed as ever to getting
Whitey Bulger,'' said FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkiewicz, who noted that Bulger
was put on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in August. ``He may not be
participating in criminal acts right now but he still is accountable for that
activity in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bulger fled just after his 1995 indictment on gambling, loansharking and
drug charges. Prosecutors claim he ran a criminal organization for 30 years from
the city's South Boston neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> Norway Rescue Effort a Disaster  </HEADLINE>
   By NILS MYKLBOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENA, Norway (AP) -- It was a rescue worker's nightmare. Intense heat from
the burning trains. Freezing cold of a Norwegian winter. Trapped, tortured
victims almost within arm's reach yet impossible to save.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The worst thing to experience is to stand there and watch people burn,''
said Ola Sunderaal, one of the first rescuers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The head-on collision between two passenger trains on Tuesday was one of the
worst in Norwegian history, with 20 believed dead. The exact number remained
unclear a day after the crash because of uncertainly about precisely how many
people -- about 100 -- were on board.
</P>
<P>
	   The high-speed crash was so savage that several rail cars were compressed
into a pile of metal the length of a single car. A 100-ton locomotive lay on its
side, which rescuers hope to move Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fires blazed for about six hours hampering initial rescue efforts. Five
bodies were pulled from the wreckage before darkness fell Wednesday. Twelve in
all have been recovered with at least four more bodies are on the train.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen bodies have been recovered. Police late Wednesday adjusted the
number of missing and presumed dead to 4, from about 20 earlier in the day. They
gave no reason for the downward revision, but said there was no hope of finding
more survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 30 passengers and crew who were injured, 12 remained in the hospital,
some with broken bones.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident happened at Rena, Norway, about 110 miles north of the capital
Oslo.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the high-pitched scream of cutting tools ripped through the
forest silence and tangled wreckage of the trains to pry loose bodies, many
burned beyond recognition. The process could take days to complete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very hard work because (the bodies) are so stuck in the wreckage.''
said Trond Simarud, a rescue specialist. ``We have to work millimeter by
millimeter (inch by inch) to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, three busloads of friends and relatives of the dead and
missing arrived to place flowers, light candles and seek solace. Young soldiers,
many of whom had spent the freezing night in tents, cordoned off the wreck site.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, family members, some crying, joined rescue workers and police in
uniform for memorial services in nearby churches, where torches burned outside
in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day, bulldozers, army tanks and workers felled tall pine trees to
improve access to the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering stink of smoke from the burned-out wreckage was a pungent
reminder of the chaos, terror and frustration of the previous day.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunderaal, an ambulance crewman, recalled he had entered wrecked cars trying
to help. The fire drove him back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the worst thing I have experienced, going through the train seeing
people who were alive and conscious who we couldn't help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An express train, with 83 people aboard, was headed south for the city of
Trondheim. A local train, at first said to have 17 people aboard, was headed
north. The state railroad NSB on Wednesday said that number was no longer
certain.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash has not been determined. The trains raced at each
other at about 55 mph around a corner. The engineers had no chance to stop,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad directorate said it was investigating media reports that
traffic managers, who remotely monitor trains, had been unable to warn the
trains because they had the wrong cellular phone numbers for the engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference in Oslo Wednesday evening, Steinar Killi, the head of
the directorate, said there had not been contact between the traffic managers
and the engineers just before the crash, although it was not clear why. He also
said no technical faults were found on the line Wednesday, so one of the trains
apparently missed a stop signal.

<HEADLINE> School To End Foreign Pilot Training  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) -- The State Department ordered a private school to stop
training foreign military pilots in jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen pilots, whose governments paid up to $500,000 each, started
classes at the National Test Pilot School at Mojave Airport on Monday, but they
were grounded the next day after the State Department said the school lacked a
license, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots are from Australia, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, Singapore
and South Korea, said Greg Lewis, the school's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
	   The same day the students started their 11-month military course, the school
received a State Department letter dated Dec. 20 ordering it to cease and desist
from training foreign students until the department decides whether to grant a
permit, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shorter civilian courses for about 35 other students were to start as
scheduled next week, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis said the school applied for the license on Dec. 6 after years of being
told informally that it didn't need one. He did not know when the permit might
be granted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We anticipated easy approval, because everything we're teaching is in the
public domain,'' Lewis said. ``We have no classified material. You can go to the
bookstore and get the book.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Wednesday's Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from Wednesday's debate in Durham, N.H., between Democratic
presidential candidates Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, as
transcribed by Federal Document Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On Gore's behavior during President Clinton's impeachment:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think that that was a very trying time for the country. I'm glad
it's over. The vice president I think was vice president, which means that he
was not critical of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   I personally believe that any time a public official, a president, lies, he
undermines his own authority and squanders the people's trust. I said that from
the beginning of this. It's a sad period of our history, and I'm glad it's over.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: As an American who was serving as vice president, I was critical of
the president. As an American, I also defended the office of the presidency
against an effort by partisan Republicans in the House and Senate to deliver a
thoroughly disproportionate penalty for a serious and reprehensible personal
mistake on the part of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   He should not have been removed from office for that offense. In fighting
against their effort to remove him from office and undo the act of the American
people in twice electing him, I think I was serving the public interest well.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On discussions of religion in political campaigns:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I strongly support the separation of church and state. I strongly
support the First Amendment, the establishment clause. I oppose, for example,
the teaching of creationism in the public schools, I think that violates that
provision of our Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   .... Do you think that a public official who is asked whether or not he is a
believer has an obligation to dodge the question and not answer the question? I
think that we should be free and open about what our beliefs are. But that's my
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   I respect Senator Bradley's decision to handle that question differently.
And I think that all of us should answer it for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: In 1978, I was running for the Senate. I was running against a
Republican. And in the general election campaign he converted to Catholicism,
and New Jersey is a highly Catholic state.
</P>
<P>
	   I had a lot of people come to me in my circle and say you should go after
this. And I said stay away from that as far as you can. A person's religious
faith belongs to them.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a new decision on my part, not to discuss religion in the middle
of a political campaign. This is a decision that I've held throughout my public
life because I think religious faith is the deepest, most personal, most
intimate belief system that any individual has.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On China and Russia policy under the Clinton-Gore administration:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I think that in spite of the problems there have been some
successes. Russia just has a new president committed to reform, in spite of the
brutal war in Chechnya, in spite of the corruption they have, the uneven rule of
law and the other problems. They have a free press. Not as free as ours, but
it's certainly an improvement over what they had. They have free elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In China, I think that we need to demand the respect for human rights and
religious freedom. But bringing China into the community of nations, fostering
peace between China and Taiwan, and engaging them in a way that furthers our
values, I think that's in our interest.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I look at our relations with Russia over the last eight years and I
think we've had a missed opportunity. They came; they wanted to know what to do.
I think that we have not pushed hard enough for a reduction in strategic nuclear
weapons, destruction of nuclear stockpiles. I believe that we sent IMF money to
Russia, knowing that corruption was rampant.
</P>
<P>
	   We need to be very clear about condemning the war in Chechnya, which is, I
think, politically irresponsible and morally reckless.
</P>
<P>
	   On campaign finance reform and possible 1996 fund-raising abuses:	   GORE:
Well, I think that the Democratic National Committee in the 1996 campaign
pressed the limits. Although there were no legal violations, it was wrong. And I
think that the phone calls that I made were a mistake. I think that we need
campaign finance reform, because almost everybody who has been involved in this
process has run up against the kind of problems that it causes. I think that
ultimately we're going to have to have a system of full public financing.
</P>
<P>
	   And the single-most effective immediate reform we could cause is for the
both of us to agree to eliminate the majority of the money that goes for these
30-second, 60-second TV-radio ads and just debate twice a week. And I'm willing
to do that only in New Hampshire if Bill thinks that is a disadvantage to him
nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Well, let me tell you. If you are not known by as many people in
the country as Al is -- I'm not known by as many people -- my only opportunity
to get known is through a 30-second television commercial, which, quite frankly,
if you know what you believe, is really not a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain and I stood on a place in Claremont not so long ago and said
that if we were the nominees of our party, we would not take soft money in this
election. We need public financing of elections. We spend $900 million a year
promoting democracy abroad. For about the same amount of money we could take --
we could take the special interests out of democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On a shift in power ``from Washington to Wall Street'':
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I think that it's -- I think that it's a natural development in
a country that's free. And we represent the virtues of freedom in the world. I
believe that it's incumbent upon national policymakers who try to make the right
decisions to understand the interaction of public policy and what happens in the
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the biggest issues in this campaign is whether or not we will have a
president with the experience to keep our prosperity going, and avoid a kind of
economic blueprint that either blows the whole surplus on a risky tax scheme or
blows the whole surplus on an unwise plan and doesn't leave room for investing
in the future in the kind of investments that have helped to contribute to this
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: There's no question that we are moving to a new world. It is driven
by technological change and globalization. Our productivity in this country has
increased 2.75 percent over the next -- over the last two years. That's a
percent more than any previous time in the last 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   That means we have more money. Now some of that money goes to people who've
made investments.
</P>
<P>
	   But the challenge for leadership in this country is to take what is a
national problem and convert it into a public issue and then engage the idealism
of the American people in support of that public issue. And this time in our
country's history, at this time of unprecedented prosperity, the challenge is to
take this unprecedented prosperity and turn it to the benefit of those who have
been left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: You know, some -- sometimes it seems a little -- Bill gets a little
out of sorts just talking -- when I talk about the substance of the policy. I
certainly do not want to talk about him as a person, especially not in a
critical way. I respect Bill, I really do. I'm not just saying that as a ploy. I
think he's a genuinely good person.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Do you agree with him?
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I agree with what he said, yes, I think I'm a generally good
person.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On gun control:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Al, I have proposed registration and licensing of all handguns, all
65 million handguns in America. President Clinton has said he is for that. We're
in the midst of this tremendous rash of gun violence in America. Thirteen
children are killed every day on the streets of this country, that's a Columbine
every day. Eight-hundred-thousand kids took a gun to school at least once last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Registration and licensing is what we do for automobiles. Why can't we do it
for handguns in America and why don't you support it?
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I do support licensing of the purchase of all new handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: New handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: And what the president said was that, yes, he supports that idea but
it doesn't have a prayer of ever becoming law and it's much more sensible to try
to get the maximum gun control that we possibly can.
</P>
<P>
	   Let me tell you, I know about fighting for gun control. I helped to pass the
toughest new gun control measure in a generation. I cast the tie-breaking vote
to take on the NRA and close the gun show loophole. It took a hard fight to pass
the Brady bill and make it the Brady law, to establish the three day waiting
period.
</P>
<P>
	   I want to go farther and completely ban Saturday Night Specials and junk
guns and assault weapons, and have what's called super tracing so that when a
gun is used in any kind of crime, it can be immediately traced.

<HEADLINE> Iams To Be Sold in Grocery Stores  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN NOLAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is taking a risk with its plan to
sell Iams premium dog and cat food in grocery stores and mass merchandise
outlets, rather than just specialty stores, industry analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The worldwide consumer products company, which paid $2.05 billion to buy
Iams Co. in September, hopes to reach the majority of shoppers who don't buy pet
foods in specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Procter is biting the hand that fed them," said John McMillin, an
analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. "What made this business grow in the
past is the specialty distributors."
</P>
<P>
	   McMillin said P&AMP;G runs the risk of angering the pet food specialty
retailers, who might move the Iams brand products to less-desirable locations in
the stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's a little bit of a risk that they could cheapen the brand,"
said William Leach, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. "It'll lose a
bit of its mystique."
</P>
<P>
	   But P&AMP;G feels good about market research that Dayton-based Iams Co. began
before it was bought, P&AMP;G spokesman Don Tassone said. That research found that
sales of Iams continued to increase in pet stores within five miles of grocery
stores that also carried the products, Tassone said. The Iams pet food was sold
in 200 grocery stores for the market testing.
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G management concluded that Iams premium pet food can sell well in stores
where other P&AMP;G products are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   Iams products have been sold only in pet supply stores, veterinary offices
and clinics, feed and farm stores, and pet grooming and boarding outlets. But
P&AMP;G officials said 70 percent of pet food buyers in the United States never shop
for it in specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
	   The premium Eukanuba dog and cat food brand will continue to be sold in
specialty stores. The Iams expansion into grocery stores will be done only in
North America, officials said. Iams and Eukanuba brands also are sold in Europe,
Asia, Japan and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble sells more than 300 product brands, including Crest
toothpaste, Tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers and Pringles snack chips, in
more than 140 countries.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Yeltsin Visits Holy Land  </HEADLINE>
   By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin said Wednesday he felt ``like a saint''
after arriving in the Holy Land on a Christmas pilgrimage that afforded the pomp
and security befitting the head of state he was until last week.
</P>
<P>
	   He was greeted at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv by Education Minister
Yossi Sarid, one of the highest ranking ministers currently in Israel, in an
informal welcome ceremony organized by the Foreign Ministry's protocol
department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a private visit, but he will get the reception accorded to a figure
of his stature -- `ex' or not,'' said Yaffa Ben-Ari, a spokeswoman for the
Foreign Ministry. Israel's prime minister and foreign minister are in the United
States holding peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin appeared pleased to be in the Holy Land at Orthodox Christianity's
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On holy land, I feel like a saint,'' he joked to the crowd of reporters
who met him and his wife at the Jerusalem Hilton. He seemed ruffled, though,
after an hour-long drive in an armored Russian limousine through driving sleet
and rain.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Russian president's official schedule hints at the health
problems he says prompted his resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   It includes frequent rest stops at his hotel, and significantly omits an
appearance at the midnight Mass in Bethlehem on Thursday night -- apparently
because the service is a grueling three-plus hours, much of it standing up,
although Christmas is ostensibly the reason for Yeltsin's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has invited the leaders of seven European
nations where Orthodox Christianity predominates to attend Christmas services in
Bethlehem on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a rehearsal of the presidential duties Arafat hopes to assume when he
declares statehood by the end of this year, as he has pledged to do.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin was invited as president weeks ago, and although he relinquished
that role to Vladimir Putin last week, he understood that the attention he was
getting was linked in part to Arafat's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have supported and we shall further support'' the peace process, he
said. ``We have had numerous meetings with Arafat and we shall support him in
order to hasten the process of two countries coming together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia hopes to re-establish the influence it once wielded in this region, a
prospect that appeals to Palestinians, who see Russia as a counter to what they
perceive as pro-Israel American policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin will have private meetings with Arafat, Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Mordechai during his 72 hours here.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian church is acting as Yeltsin's host in the Holy Land, and is
staying at the Hilton -- the newest and most expensive of Jerusalem's luxury
hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   Hilton deputy manager Guy Klaiman said the Yeltsins would stay in the same
room occupied by President Clinton and his wife a year ago during a critical
juncture in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   Klaiman said the Yeltsins would eat all meals at the hotel, noting that the
Russians had forwarded 1,100 pounds of Russian delicacies to satisfy the palates
of the 150-member entourage, including the Russian foreign minister and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hilton was forced to turn away the food, Klaiman said, because it was
not kosher -- blessed by rabbis according to Jewish religious ritual. The church
donated the food to Jerusalem's poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Also banned -- this time on Russian orders -- were the traditional pile of
sweets the Hilton leaves for its guests. Officials were worried that Yeltsin
would be tempted by foods that would hurt his ailing system.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Klaiman said, ``We will offer him a wide array of fruit,''
including cherries imported from France.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Debate in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley accused Al
Gore Wednesday night of deliberately distorting his proposal to expand health
coverage, but the vice president shot back in the first debate of the election
year that his rival's plan would leave many New Hampshire residents ``high and
dry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prodded by debate moderator Peter Jennings to say whether Gore had ever
taken a quote or vote out of context, Bradley instantly replied, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, Bradley said, ``offended me'' by claiming he would hurt
African-Americans and Latinos'' and by saying his health care plan would
shortchange many Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, standing a few feet away on a University of New Hampshire stage,
paraphrased Harry Truman's famous utterance: ``I'm not giving him hell. I'm just
telling the truth and he thinks it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore held aloft a card that he said characterized Bradley's health plan and
contended the people of New Hampshire ``would be left out, left high and dry''
by Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me tell you how the private sector works,'' retorted back Bradley, a
former New Jersey senator, adding that health insurance companies would quickly
try to fashion coverage to meet the new demand.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange came one-third of the way through the 60-minute debate, the
first in a series of confrontations in which Democrats and Republicans will take
turns debating in the run-up to the first balloting of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national frontrunner by far, but Bradley has mounted a
surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, and is even or
ahead in the polling in advance of the first primary set for Feb. 1 in New
Hampshire. That prompted the vice president to allude to his ``underdog''
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes,'' Bradley said wryly.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Gore: ``I hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes on Feb. 1.''
</P>
<P>
	   Predictably, the reaction of voters in the audience was mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Akeley, a University of New Hampshire art student, said she arrived a
Gore a supporter and was leaving a Gore supporter, although she conceded ``I can
see now why a lot of people support Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Mayer, 35, a radio talk-show producer from Randolph, said he had been
undecided, but was walking out whole-heartedly behind Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The two contenders agreed on some issues, citing a need for stricter gun
control laws and saying they would make appointments to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff only if they would implement a policy of permitting gays to serve openly
in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   But the two rivals came prepared for battle, clashing on local issues --
including development within the White Mountain National Forest in northern New
Hampshire -- as well as national concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who likes to boast of a candidacy of big ideas, said that Gore was
``in a Washington bunker.'' That's understandable, he said, given the Republican
Congress, the Democratic fund-raising scandals and impeachment. ``But the
reality is, the Democratic party shouldn't be in the Washington bunker with
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore responded, ``I'm proud that I stayed and fought against the Gingrich
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley launched a sharp attack on the Clinton-Gore administration's
handling of relations with Russia, saying the United States had not pushed hard
enough in the last eight years to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and
had agreed to send international aid to Russia ``knowing that corruption was
rampant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore issued a defense, saying, ``I think that in spite of the problems there
have been some successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were given the chance to pose questions to one another, and Gore
used his turn to ask Bradley whether he believed he had made a mistake on any of
three votes he had cast: in favor of Ronald Reagan's budget cuts in 1981,
opposed to authorizing the ground war against Iraq in 1990 and against the
welfare reform law that President Clinton signed into law. Bradley defended each
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, ``I think all three were mistakes.'' While serving in Congress,
Gore voted against the budget cuts and in favor of using force in Kuwait and as
vice president supported the welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was worried that Bradley had refused to own up to any mistakes,
and was worried about that quality in a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley broke in to cite what he said was an error he had made: his vote in
1987 against confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. ``Now that
was a mistake,'' he said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley said Gore was guilty of campaign distortions, Gore said he
wouldn't level that charge against his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't accuse him of that. If you want a no, I'll give you a no,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening question referred to Clinton and his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that anytime a president or public official lies, he undermines
his authority. But he offered no criticism of Gore's behavior during the
year-long impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said he thought he had served ``the national interest
well'' during that period, making plain his disapproval of Clinton's actions,
yet defending him against what he said was an unwarranted Republican attempt to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, despite a candidacy that boasts of time spent out of public
life, Bradley said politics is a ``noble profession. I don't think it's corrupt
or deceitful ... The only way you are going to achieve something is through
politics,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Held on Immigration Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Algerian suspected of having links to a countryman charged
with trying to smuggle explosives into the United States was ordered held
without bond Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, is charged with illegally entering the country and
eluding federal officers at the Canadian border. He was arrested Dec. 24 in
Bellevue, a suburb east of Seattle. He allegedly crossed the border at Blaine,
about 100 miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha was to appear before a federal magistrate Wednesday, but his
attorney declined to challenge a government motion to detain him.
</P>
<P>
	   No link has been made in court between Tizegha and Ahmed Ressam, who has
pleaded innocent to federal charges accusing him of having bomb-making materials
in his rental car as he entered the country on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   But newspaper reports have said that Tizegha is linked to Ressam and that
Tizegha and another man investigated in the case, Abdel Ghani, are longtime
friends. Ghani was arrested Thursday and charged with helping Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth man, Abdel Majid Dahoumane, is believed to have stayed with Ressam
at a motel in British Columbia before Ressam was arrested. Warrants have been
issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   According to former CIA counterterrorism chief Vincent Cannistraro, all four
are part of a terrorist splinter group in Algeria that is supported by Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile believed to have masterminded last year's attack on two
U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannistraro, citing French counterterrorism officials, said Wednesday the
men belong to a faction that broke with the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria,
known by its French acronym GIA, over its practice of targeting fellow Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   French investigators have said Ressam has links to Fateh Kamel, who has been
jailed in Paris since April and is suspected of being the leader of an Islamic
militant group. Cannistraro said Kamel is the leader of the GIA splinter group
to which Ressam and the others belong, again citing French counterterrorism
sources.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Consul Calls For Boycott  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Mexican consul in Atlanta took an unusual step for a
diplomat and called for Latinos to use their economic might by boycotting
Georgia companies that mistreat or ignore Hispanic customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Consul Teodoro Maus was interviewed on WPLO-AM, a Spanish-language radio
station in suburban Lawrenceville. His comments were reported Wednesday in the
Mexico City daily newspaper Reforma.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If in some area, in some zone, in some place, in some business they are
not being treated with dignity, with the respect they need, well, we begin to
deal with an economic boycott,'' Maus said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maus, who is responsible for helping Mexican citizens in Georgia, was in
Mexico City for a diplomatic conference Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>

	   The press attache for the Mexican Consulate in Atlanta, Bernardo Mendez,
said Wednesday that Maus did not want to organize a boycott. Instead, he wants
Hispanic community leaders to apply ``economic pressure'' on businesses that
treat Latinos unfairly.
</P>
<P>
	   Political scientists said it's unusual for a consul to take such a strong
stand on an issue that does not directly affect his government. Maus, however,
has been a vocal supporter of the entire Hispanic community in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   He criticized a local law that made it illegal for store signs to be in
foreign languages and supported measures that would make it easier for Hispanic
students to be admitted to Georgia colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Han Park, director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the
University of Georgia, said Maus' boycott comments were ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``His office is designed to protect, not Mexican-Americans, but Mexican
citizens,'' Park said. ``Advising them to boycott some products, that really is
not protecting or promoting their interests. It's a political retaliation ...
he's not there in Atlanta to do that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Without naming specific companies, Maus complained about businesses that
exploit immigrant workers. He also suggested a national boycott of shops that do
not offer services in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists estimate Hispanic buying power in Georgia more than doubled this
decade to $3.7 billion. Estimates of the number of Hispanics in Georgia range
from 220,000 to 481,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The economic force, that is what we have now,'' Maus told Reforma for a
story about his Dec. 31 radio interview. ``Simply because of the number of
people, we now have an economic force we are not understanding, which we are not
capturing and we are not using.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Disagree on Logging Limit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential rivals Bill Bradley and Al Gore
disagreed Wednesday night over President Clinton's executive order to
unilaterally limit logging in national forests.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is highly controversial in New Hampshire -- the site of the
nation's first primary on Feb. 1 -- because it put more of the sprawling White
Mountain National Forest in northern New Hampshire and western Maine off limits
to logging. Many area residents earn a living in nearby logging, forest and
paper and pulp-mills.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore defended the proposal, saying it ``was a preliminary statement of
intention to protect this land, and then have a process of consultation with the
communities and the individuals who live near the areas to be protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley disagreed with Gore, saying, ``I don't think a president should
pre-empt in the White Mountains the local planning process.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the forest for many years has been used for recreation and
timber cutting and that, ``I think mixed use is the proper way to proceed in the
White Mountains. And therefore, I think local decision-making is important and
mixed use is the way it should be.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-husband of slain quad mom charged in federal, state courts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A Texas businessman was charged Wednesday with
arranging the murder of his ex-wife, who was found slain in her Florida home in
1997, her 2-year-old quadruplets tracking through her blood.
<P>
	   Allen Blackthorne, 44, allegedly hatched a plot with a golfing buddy and
others to harm his ex-wife, Sheila Bellush. One man allegedly involved in the
case said he paid a hit man $14,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors would not elaborate on a motive other than to say Blackthorne
was angry. Blackthorne and Mrs. Bellush, who had two daughters together, went
through a bitter divorce and custody battle before she moved to Florida with the
girls, her new husband and their quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal grand jury indicted Blackthorne on charges of conspiracy to use
interstate commerce in a murder for hire, which can bring the death penalty. He
also was charged with interstate domestic violence, which carries a possible
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Blackthorne was led away in handcuffs Tuesday night after a round of golf at
a country club in San Antonio. He appeared before a federal magistrate Wednesday
and was ordered held without bail. He did not enter a plea but has said he is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the federal charges, Blackthorne was indicted on a murder
charge Wednesday by a Texas grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bellush, 35, was shot and stabbed in her Sarasota, Fla., home about six
weeks after moving to Florida. The quadruplets were found wandering in blood
near her body but were not physically harmed. Her husband, James Bellush, and
Mrs. Bellush's two daughters were not home at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Blackthorne, who acquired his wealth through a medical equipment company,
had been under scrutiny since the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his attorneys, Richard Lubin, said Blackthorne looked forward to the
chance to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a terrible tragedy, what happened here, but Allen Blackthorne had
nothing to do with it," Lubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed said Blackthorne conspired with
three men - Daniel Rocha, Sammy Gonzales and Jose Luis Del Toro.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said that Rocha, a golfing friend of Blackthorne, approached
Gonzales about hurting Mrs. Bellush and that Gonzales hired Del Toro. Gonzales
has said in a plea bargain that he paid Del Toro $14,000 to kill Mrs. Bellush.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocha and Gonzales, both in prison, are cooperating with Texas authorities
and are expected to testify against Blackthorne, Ms. Reed said. Del Toro is
awaiting trial in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, James Bellush said the quadruplets still remembered the scene
when their mother died. "I tell Timmy, Joey, Frankie and Courtney that Mommy is
in heaven with Jesus," he said. "They ask me if she is still bleeding."
</P>
<P>
	   Bellush has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Blackthorne.
</P>
<P>
	   James Bellush moved to Hampton Township in Sussex County, N.J., with the
children after his wife was killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A county prosecutor acted unethically when he used
his office to initiate personal relationships with women, an investigator said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Benton County Prosecutor Brad Butler apparently committed no crime,
said Special Prosecutor John Everett in a Dec. 1 report.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Butler had a sexual relationship with a woman who came to
him on a criminal complaint and an inappropriate personal relationship with
another woman his office used as an informant in a capital murder case.

	   Everett said he referred his findings to the state Supreme Court Committee
on Professional Conduct, which has the authority to reprimand lawyers and revoke

planned to remain prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing in this report affects my ability to serve the voters of Benton
County who have elected me for three terms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Butler said his sexual relationship with one of the women happened long
after he was professionally involved with her. He denied having sexual relations
with the other woman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This report contains a lot of information about my personal life and
things I am not proud of,'' Butler said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Debate in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley accused Al
Gore Wednesday night of deliberately distorting his proposal to expand health
coverage, but the vice president shot back in the first debate of the election
year that his rival's plan would leave many New Hampshire residents ``high and
dry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prodded by debate moderator Peter Jennings to say whether Gore had ever
taken a quote or vote out of context, Bradley instantly replied, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, Bradley said, ``offended me'' by claiming he would hurt
African-Americans and Latinos and by saying his health care plan would
shortchange many Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, standing a few feet away on a University of New Hampshire stage,
paraphrased Harry Truman's famous utterance: ``I'm not giving him hell. I'm just
telling the truth and he thinks it's hell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore held aloft a card that he said characterized Bradley's health plan and
contended the people of New Hampshire ``would be left out, left high and dry''
by Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me tell you how the private sector works,'' retorted back Bradley, a
former New Jersey senator, adding that health insurance companies would quickly
try to fashion coverage to meet the new demand.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange came one-third of the way through the 60-minute debate, the
first in a series of confrontations in which Democrats and Republicans will take
turns debating in the run-up to the first balloting of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national frontrunner by far, but Bradley has mounted a
surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, and is even or
ahead in the polling in advance of the first primary set for Feb. 1 in New
Hampshire. That prompted the vice president to allude to his ``underdog''
status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes,'' Bradley said wryly.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Gore: ``I hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes on Feb. 1.''
</P>
<P>
	   Predictably, the reaction of voters in the audience was mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Akeley, a University of New Hampshire art student, said she arrived a
Gore a supporter and was leaving a Gore supporter, although she conceded ``I can
see now why a lot of people support Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Mayer, 35, a radio talk-show producer from Randolph, said he had been
undecided, but was walking out whole-heartedly behind Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The two contenders agreed on some issues, citing a need for stricter gun
control laws and saying they would make appointments to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff only if they would implement a policy of permitting gays to serve openly
in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   But the two rivals came prepared for battle, clashing on local issues --
including development within the White Mountain National Forest in northern New
Hampshire -- as well as national concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who likes to boast of a candidacy of big ideas, said that Gore was
``in a Washington bunker.'' That's understandable, he said, given the Republican
Congress, the Democratic fund-raising scandals and impeachment. ``But the
reality is, the Democratic party shouldn't be in the Washington bunker with
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore responded, ``I'm proud that I stayed and fought against the Gingrich
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley launched a sharp attack on the Clinton-Gore administration's
handling of relations with Russia, saying the United States had not pushed hard
enough in the last eight years to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and
had agreed to send international aid to Russia ``knowing that corruption was
rampant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore issued a defense, saying, ``I think that in spite of the problems there
have been some successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were given the chance to pose questions to one another, and Gore
used his turn to ask Bradley whether he believed he had made a mistake on any of
three votes he had cast: in favor of Ronald Reagan's budget cuts in 1981,
opposed to authorizing the ground war against Iraq in 1990 and against the
welfare reform law that President Clinton signed into law. Bradley defended each
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, ``I think all three were mistakes.'' While serving in Congress,
Gore voted against the budget cuts and in favor of using force in Kuwait and as
vice president supported the welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was worried that Bradley had refused to own up to any mistakes,
and was worried about that quality in a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley broke in to cite what he said was an error he had made: his vote in
1987 against confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. ``Now that
was a mistake,'' he said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley said Gore was guilty of campaign distortions, Gore said he
wouldn't level that charge against his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't accuse him of that. If you want a no, I'll give you a no,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening question referred to Clinton and his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that anytime a president or public official lies, he undermines
his authority. But he offered no criticism of Gore's behavior during the
year-long impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said he thought he had served ``the national interest
well'' during that period, making plain his disapproval of Clinton's actions,
yet defending him against what he said was an unwarranted Republican attempt to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, despite a candidacy that boasts of time spent out of public
life, Bradley said politics is a ``noble profession. I don't think it's corrupt
or deceitful ... The only way you are going to achieve something is through
politics,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex N.J. Police Chief Gets 4 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A former police chief was sentenced to four years in
prison Wednesday for leading a band of rogue officers in what prosecutors say
was the most corrupt department in New Jersey history.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired West New York Police Chief Alexander V. Oriente ``represented a
nightmare scenario in law enforcement,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Oriente and members of his 140-officer department took
hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks from 1989 to 1997 to
shield prostitutes, illicit liquor sales and illegal gambling operations in the
town of 50,000 just across the Hudson River from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente, 67, said the corruption began almost as soon as he joined the
force. He retired in 1997 after a 40-year career in West New York.
</P>
<P>
	   In court on Wednesday, he apologized, adding ``I know that the things I did
in the police department were not correct, but I have started a new life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente struck a deal with federal prosecutors after a 69-count racketeering
indictment returned in January 1998 named him and nine current or former West
New York police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Oriente pleaded guilty to a single count each of racketeering and conspiracy
to defraud the IRS by failing to report $80,000 in bribes on his income tax
returns.
</P>
<P>
	   He received a reduced sentence for testifying against four officers, the
only defendants to go to trial among more than 30 charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the chief of police is corrupt who is going to police them?'' U.S.
District Judge Jerome Simandle said Wednesday during Oriente's sentencing.
``When the chief goes bad, a great deal suffers. It was not a pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the 4-year sentence, the judge ordered Oriente to pay a
$50,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Magnate Probed in Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A probe into allegations that Israeli President Ezer
Weizman improperly accepted gifts took an unexpected turn Wednesday with reports
that a newspaper magnate accused in a murder conspiracy was behind making the
accusations public.
</P>
<P>
	   Quoting sources close to the president, the Haaretz daily said former Maariv
publisher Ofer Nimrodi played a role in getting the accusations publicized to
avenge Weizman's refusal to help him with his own legal problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has acknowledged meeting Nimrodi and his father, Yaakov, a few
months ago and rejecting their pleas to pardon Ofer, who was convicted of
illegal wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
	   But the director of Weizman's office, Aryeh Shumer, told Israel's Channel
Two TV that he could neither confirm nor deny reports that the Nimrodi's tried
to blackmail the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Haaretz did not say how the Nimrodis were involved in disclosing allegations
that Weizman took $453,000 from a French millionaire while serving as a lawmaker
and government minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was revealed last week by an Israeli journalist who does
freelance work for Maariv.
</P>
<P>
	   Ofer Nimrodi, who is in jail pending trial on allegations of murder
conspiracy and obstruction of justice, issued a statement Wednesday denying any
role in the Weizman scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Prosecutor's office is investigating the allegations, including
whether the millionaire, Edouard Sarousi, might have received any favors in
return for the gifts. The president is a ceremonial figure but still wields
tremendous influence in business, political and social circles.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has admitted that he did not report or pay taxes on the cash,
received between 1988 and 1993, but has said the law does not require him to
report personal gifts. He also faces allegations of embezzling funds earmarked
for a small party he once headed.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman's lawyer acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that his client
had spent part of the money since becoming president in 1993. The lawyer, Yaakov
Weinroth, emphasized that Weizman used no more than dlrs 2,000 of the money
since that time.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he would prove that Weizman had used the money for private
purposes and did not grant any favors in return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am sure anyone who will know the full details will know there is no
problem at all,'' Weinroth said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli media have reported that Weizman used part of the money to care for
his son, Shaul, who was seriously injured during fighting with Egypt in 1970.
Shaul died in an automobile accident in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   He told The Associated Press that the information on the financial
transactions, revealed by journalist Yoav Yitzhak, came from files stolen from
Weizman's lawyers' office.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the scandal was announced, there have been growing calls in parliament
for Weizman's resignation. His term expires in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Health Plan Debated in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, dismissing Bill Bradley's health
care proposals in their latest debate as a ``little $150 a month voucher,''
notably understated how much federal support families would get under the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bradley fumbled the details of the 1996 welfare reforms he
voted against as a senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential rivals did not go as far off course in the
University of New Hampshire debate Wednesday night as they did in earlier
matchups. But here and there, truth was a casualty and complex ideas were boiled
down into barely recognizable form.
</P>
<P>
	   As usual, the main point of contention was Bradley's signature health care
plan and especially his proposal to replace Medicaid with subsidies to enable
people to buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left viewers with the impression that the subsidy would be capped at a
measly $150 a month, while Bradley says the figures in play are weighted
averages, not caps.
</P>
<P>
	   But beyond that, $150 a month is Bradley's figure for individuals -- the
average subsidy for a family of four would be more than $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's dismissal of the plan as minimal also was difficult to square with
another criticism he has made -- that it is so expensive it could drive the
country into a recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore tried to put Bradley on the defensive for opposing the welfare reforms
that are generally considered a success and, in the course of fighting back, the
former senator muddled legislative history.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley suggested the welfare restrictions he voted against were harsher
than those that became law, when in fact there was little substantive
difference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said at the time that you'd spend the next four years correcting that
bill,'' Bradley said. ``But remember this bill came in October of 1996. October
of 1996 -- who knew if Bill Clinton was going to win? Maybe it would have been
Bob Dole. If it had been Bob Dole, there would have been a long time before
there were any changes made in that welfare reform bill.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the welfare reforms became law in August 1996. Moreover, President
Clinton's defeat of the Republican Dole in the 1996 election was widely expected
by October, if not earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore took credit in the debate for helping to pass what he called the most
significant gun-control legislation in a generation, with his tie-breaking vote
in the Senate on a bill to require instant background checks at gun shows. He
neglected to mention that the bill did not become law.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices fell moderately in early trading
Thursday, pushed down by selling of high-technology issues. The dollar was
higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 89.42 points, or 0.48
percent, to 18,453.13 in the first hour of trading Thursday. On Wednesday, the
key average plunged 460.31 points, or 2.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 104.02 yen, up 0.82 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo, but
below its late New York level of 104.35 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, sell orders for technology-related issues, which had
posted significant gains over the past few weeks, were stacking up.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the biggest decliners in early trading were high-tech giants Sony
and Kyocera. Also hit by profit-taking were Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu,
Matsushita Electric Industrial, Sharp and TDK.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until price fluctuations of information technology shares stabilize,
investors will shift to biotechnology-related issues," said Kunihiro Hatae,
general manager at Tokyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.72, or 1.1
percent, to 11,122.65 on Wednesday. The blue-chip index had risen as much as 216
points in earlier trading. It plunged 359.58 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index ended a highly volatile session
Wednesday with a loss of 24.09 points, or 0.6 percent, at 3,877.60. On Tuesday,
it suffered its worst point loss, declining 229.46 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section shed 14.95 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,636.89. The TOPIX closed down
65.63 points, or 3.82 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, investors were keen to take profits from the dollar's
gains following intervention buying by the Bank of Japan to stem the yen's rise
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   An excessively strong yen hurts the income of export-based industries, which
repatriate profits earned overseas in dollars back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 107.64 yen, up from 107.24 yen
late in Tokyo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was at 1.7150,
up from 1.6950 Wednesday. Its price stood at 101.57, down 0.17 point from
101.74.

<HEADLINE> McCain Denies Ties To TV License  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Running for president on a promise to rid the nation
of big money politics, Sen. John McCain repeatedly denied on Wednesday trying to
influence a federal agency by prodding it to approve a TV license request by one
of his financial benefactors.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he did urge the Federal Communications Commission to make a
decision on Paxson Communications' application for a license two years after the
company submitted it. But he told reporters that he did not tell the FCC which
way to vote and that he rightly pressed for a decision in his capacity as Senate
Commerce Committee Chairman, not in exchange for the company's contributions or
the use of its private jet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't tell them to approve it; I told them to act,'' the Arizona
senator said. ``I think it's entirely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issue gave GOP front-runner George Bush a chance to criticize McCain for
the second time in as many days as Republican contenders fought for advantage in
this first-in-the-nation primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's really important for people who are advocating reforms to
live up to the spirit of reforms they are advocating,'' Bush, campaigning in
Iowa, told reporters. Later, in Manchester, N.H., he said, ``I respect John
McCain'' and acknowledged that ``I haven't seen the facts.'' But he also said,
``I think somebody who makes campaign financing an issue has got to be
consistent and walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's place in the polls here and his strong fund raising haven't
threatened Bush's front-runner status nationally. But Bush has shown his
determination to prevent that from happening, going after McCain Monday on tax
cuts in their first major policy dispute and inspiring McCain to release details
of a tax plan he hadn't intended to put out until Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain appeared at one point Wednesday with William Bennett, the former
education secretary and presidential drug adviser who has written widely on
morality. And he delivered a speech calling for presidential candidates to
refrain from personal attacks and distortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please do not think I claim some special virtue among the candidates,''
McCain told the Boys and Girls Club of Manchester. ``If we accomplish anything
in this campaign, let those of us who seek the highest office in the land help
turn the practice of politics toward a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
	   Disputes over issues and the candidates' performance in public office are
fair game, however, McCain has said. He added that the tax cut tiff and the new
talk of improperly acting on behalf of a contributor are only to be expected as
a candidate becomes more of a threat in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said his high-profile role as a proponent of campaign finance
reform makes him additionally vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's suspicion about all of us as a result of these huge amounts of
money that wash around political campaigns,'' McCain said. ``With me, being the
'reformer,' obviously those stories are more relevant. I expect more of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is chairman of the Commerce Committee, which oversees the FCC. He
urged the agency in a Dec. 10 letter to act quickly on a matter involving Paxson
Communications, a company that owns 73 family-oriented TV stations and has
legally provided a private jet for McCain's use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe first reported the story Wednesday, saying company
officials coordinated $20,000 in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   Company chairman Lowell (Bud) Paxson, wife Marla and daughter Nicole each
gave the maximum $1,000 last March 23.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's letter to FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, released by the campaign
Wednesday, said: ``The sole purpose of this request is to secure final action on
a matter that has now been pending for over two years. ... I emphasize that my
purpose is not to suggest in any way how you should vote -- merely that you
vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said late Wednesday that there was no urgency to
the senator's letter to the FCC, since Paxson could have simply reapplied if its
application expired.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not unusual for members of Congress to send letters to the FCC about
transactions that are under review. In fact, nine other lawmakers also sent
inquiries to the commission about the Pittsburgh television station. Among those
were Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and a number of
Pennsylvania lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC's Kennard called McCain's request for information -- the last
one received by the commission from a member of Congress -- ``highly unusual.''
Kennard noted that the letter came at ``a sensitive time in the deliberative
process.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am concerned that inquiries concerning the individual deliberations of
each commissioner could have procedural and substantive impacts on the
commission's deliberations and thus on the due process rights of the parties,''
Kennard wrote in a Dec. 14 reply to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign released a fact sheet saying that the company's planes are
available to all 535 members of Congress when they're not being used for the
firm's business. It also said that 80 percent of U.S. business activity falls
under Commerce Committee jurisdiction and ``there is no evidence that John
McCain has taken inappropriate action on behalf of a contributor.''

<HEADLINE> Presidential Debate Notebook  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Political activists may be thick-skinned but they still
have to bundle up against the cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Shivering mixed with shouting as a small group of Vice President Al Gore's
supporters set up outside the hall for the Democratic presidential debate
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Afternoon temperatures were a little under freezing, with winds making it
feel much colder, as two dozen Gore activists gathered outside the University of
New Hampshire venue. ``I've got my scarf, a shirt, a sweater, earmuffs, hat and
a double layer of socks,'' said Michael Dempsey, 19. ``It's kind of cold, but we
enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group had just begun chanting ``We want Gore! We want Gore,'' when a
door opened across the street and out walked his rival, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, with his wife Ernestine by his side wearing fluffy blue earmuffs,
smiled and briefly waved before climbing into a van.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore supporters quickly changed their tune. ``Politics, not
basketball!'' they shouted to the former New York Knicks star. ``Leadership, not
celebrity!''
</P>
<P>
	   Melinda Mills, 20, came from the University of Arizona to work as an intern
with the Gore campaign in New Hampshire during her winter break.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a great experience for anyone interested in politics,'' she said.
``New Hampshire is the place to be in January and February.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Half an hour before Gore and Bradley met onstage, their supporters outside
started shoving.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 mostly college-aged supporters clustered on a hill across from the
debate hall, equally divided between the two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, their jostling for position propelled the crowd into a plastic
barrier blocking off the sidewalk, sending half a dozen people crashing to the
ground. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   From the testing of the microphones before the debate to an exchange halfway
through it, the candidates and even moderator Peter Jennings made sure to pay
homage to the University of New Hampshire's top-ranked hockey team.
</P>
<P>
	   The audience chuckled when Bradley tested his microphone by deadpanning
''1,2,3. 1,2,3. This is New Hampshire. It's warm.''
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd laughed a moment later when an audience member clapped for Gore's
simple ''1,2,3,4.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Jennings won enthusiastic applause when it was his turn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Testing, testing, testing,'' he said. ``Wildcats hockey. Wildcats
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wait a minute,'' Bradley interrupted. ``Who's running for office here?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats, 14-2-1, are ranked No. 1 in the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   With classes not resuming until Jan. 18, many shops on the edge of campus
closed this week. But one store was ready to make an exception for the right
sort of visitor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sorry, we are closed for restocking,'' said a sign outside the Durham Book
Exchange. Under it hung a sign adding, ``Of course, presidential candidates are
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   Manager Lorraine Mechem especially hoped Bradley would stop by.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just seems like a really nice guy who really cares about people,'' she
said. ``No matter how Al Gore tries, he just doesn't come off natural.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The words ``Bill Bradley'' and ``excitement'' don't appear together often.
</P>
<P>
	   But such was the case in a large, red ``Bill Bradley for President'' sign on
the window of the Hair Excitement salon on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
	   A receptionist said the staff agreed to hang the sign for a group of Bradley
people ``just to show our support for them being in town,'' but was having
second thoughts and might take it down. ``We don't want to offend anyone who
really doesn't like him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   No word from the salon on which candidate has the most exciting hair.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Health insurance isn't just a sticking point between Bradley and Gore. It's
apparently a bit of a bone between Bradley and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   On a pre-debate tour of the Lamprey Health Center, Bradley asked Priscilla
Shaw, director of community affairs, whether the clinic had a dental facility.
Told it did not, Bradley commiserated, ``We don't have dental insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   To that, Mrs. Bradley, a university professor who's now a full-time
campaigner for her husband, replied almost jokingly: ``We used to.''

<HEADLINE> Cubans Warned Against Elian Optimism  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Touching off angry protests by hundreds of Cuban-Americans,
the U.S. government decided Wednesday to send 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back to
Cuba because ``this little boy ... belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of an international tug-of-war since he was
found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his mother,
stepfather and nine others died while trying to reach Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been living with relatives in Miami, who have insisted they could
give Elian a better life than his father could back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American
immigration law and U.S. practice,'' Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner said at a news conference in Washington. ``This
little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ``made it very clear that he
wants Elian returned to him as soon as possible.'' Even though the boy's parents
were divorced, the INS found that Elian had a ``close and continuous
relationship'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency ruled that Elian must return to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the boy's relatives asked Attorney General Janet Reno to reverse
the decision and also planned to ask a federal judge for a restraining order.
They said the INS was violating its own rules by not allowing the boy to apply
for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was surprised because I always thought this was a place of liberty and
they are not letting him keep that liberty,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, the
boy's cousin. ``It's always about the father. What about the mother? That was
his mother's will.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department officials in Washington told The Associated Press that
Reno was consulted about the decision and could have intervened before the
ruling was issued.
</P>
<P>
	   The father could not be located for comment Wednesday. He and Elian's four
grandparents had dinner Tuesday in Havana with Fidel Castro, said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who went to Cuba to help
reunite father and son.
</P>
<P>
	   After the INS decision, several hundred people linked arms, shouted
``Liberty!'' and sang the Cuban national anthem in front of the house where
Elian has been staying with his paternal great-aunt and great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   In front of the Miami INS office, several hundred protesters waved Cuban and
American flags and shouted anti-Castro slogans.
</P>
<P>
	   The protests were emotional but peaceful, and paled in comparison to the
huge government-staged rallies in Havana demanding the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're using him as if he were a toy and Fidel Castro is saying, `He's
mine, not yours,''' said 28-year-old Norisbel Almeida, a mother of two young
children at the protest outside the home. ``Why did they show him the good life
so he could go back to Cuba and have nothing?''
</P>
<P>
	   Some argued that the Cuban-American community wrongly turned the boy's
plight into a political issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To them, this is about fighting Castro, this isn't about the well-being of
the boy,'' said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of
Miami. ``They turned him into a tool knowing they had no legal case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since he was rescued, Elian has been flooded with toys, visited Disney
World, celebrated his first Christmas in the United States and started attending
first grade.
</P>
<P>
	   He also been in the constant glare of TV cameras. Reporters and
photographers staked out the home Wednesday as TV helicopters hovered above the
house and tracked Elian's movement as he left school, dressed in his uniform of
blue pants and white shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members tried to shield Elian from the protests and media attention,
hustling him from school to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't know what is going on. We don't want to make him feel bad,''
Marisleysis Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said he was disappointed by the INS' decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian's mother gave her life for the freedom of her son,'' Bush said.
``Today's decision ... violates her desires for Elian and instead delivers him
to country where an oppressive dictator does not allow hope and where people
lack the most basic human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, the communist government warned its citizens to guard against
``excessive optimism'' about the U.S. government's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said he had honored a pledge to keep politics out of the
decision over the boy. ``The INS followed the law and the procedure and made the
decision that they made after an exhaustive review of the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has asked the Cuban government to let the father
escort the boy back home. Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, had said Cuba would not stop the father from going to the United
States as long as American officials first agreed to let the boy return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban adults who reach the U.S. mainland are routinely allowed to stay, but
the boy's age created diplomatic problems. Many Cuban exiles have insisted that
his mother's death in a bid to live in a free country was enough to allow Elian
to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a crime to send him back to Cuba,'' said Melba Roses, 56, who moved
to the United States from Cuba nearly 50 years ago. ``There is food here and in
Cuba there is none. The child has a right to stay.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what the boy has been saying, Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the
Miami family, said: ``He cares for his father but he would like his father to be
here with him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Cubans in Florida sympathized with the father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He should be with his father,'' Louis Bolivar, 32, said outside a shop
near Miami's Little Havana section. ``They're doing the right thing.''

<HEADLINE> Tougher emissions test may be suspended if lines grow too long  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's motor vehicle inspection stations may
be allowed to pull the plug on the state's tougher auto emissions test on days
when lines grow too long, state and federal officials said Wednesday.
<P>
	   The Whitman administration has asked federal environmental officials to
allow officials to suspend the new test and send cars through the old tailpipe
tests when inspection stations become clogged with cars. The old test doesn't
look for as much pollution, but is up to five times faster.
</P>
<P>
	   Other ways to cut down on lines - including suspending the inspection
deadlines for all motorists - were also discussed but are not part of the
state's formal proposal to the federal Environmental Protection Agency,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The temporary plan, which is expected to be approved by the EPA, would buy
time while Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, the private vendor operating
the inspection stations, attempts to hire more workers to staff the lanes.
Parsons has announced it intends to increase its work force by 300 in response
to motorist fury over long lines ever since the tougher test began on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman, keeping up her criticism of the contractor her
administration hired, said Parsons "has, thus far, performed dismally ... the
contractor has seriously underestimated its own need for manpower and has
experienced practical and technological glitches, all of which could have been
anticipated."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said she believes Parsons "is committed to making the system work"
and that "some flexibility" by the EPA could give the firm enough time to work
out the bugs. The new test is part of New Jersey's effort to conform with the
federal Clean Air Act. It looks for asthma-causing smog in a state with the
nation's second worst air pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA spokeswoman Mary Mears said the federal agency will likely be flexible
with New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "What they're looking at are temporary stopgap measures to shorten the
lines," Mears said. "Other states have had very similar problems to New
Jersey's. They all seemed to work them out within about six months."
</P>
<P>
	   Mears said the EPA has approved other states' requests to have some cars
take the old tailpipe test if the lines for the enhanced test become too long.
The new test uses a treadmill-like device to simulate driving conditions. The
old test simply looks for carbon monoxide while the car idles.
</P>
<P>
	   Mears stressed, however, that the EPA does not want the option to become
permanent. She said states that took this option generally did it for no more
than six months. "We're going to watch this situation very closely," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mears also said the EPA generally does not oppose a state's request to
suspend the inspection deadlines for motorists, which would mean cars would have
to be inspected later in the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Under this circumstance, the cars are ultimately getting inspected," Mears
said. However, Jayne O'Connor, spokeswoman for Whitman, said such a proposal is
not being advanced by the administration. State and federal officials began
talks Monday to try to appease motorists and lawmakers who are pledging
legislation that would exempt more cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman has come under increasing criticism for the auto inspection
problems. Senate Democratic Leader Richard Codey on Wednesday urged the governor
to invalidate the contract with Parsons, which last year signed a seven-year,
$400 million deal with the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Golden, a spokesman for Parsons, said the firm would welcome a deal
between the EPA and the Whitman administration that could help reduce lines.
Parsons, however, would stand to lose money in cases when the old test is used.
The contract calls for the firm to get paid about $5 less for each inspection
made with the old, less complicated test. The firm has already had at least
$300,000 deducted because of long wait times at the inspection stations.

<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A man wanted for the murder of a Harvard University student 24
years ago was arrested Wednesday by Canadian immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   James Anthony Martin, 51, was arrested in Montreal, said FBI Special Agent
Barry Mawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin and Gordon Brown were indicted in 1976 on charges of first-degree
murder for the killing that year of Edward Paulson, 28, during a botched drug

</P>
<P>
	   Brown was convicted in 1982 and sentenced to life in prison; Martin fled to
California and then Canada, FBI officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin was arrested after an investigation by the Cambridge Police
Department and the FBI-Boston Fugitive Task Force found he had been living
illegally in Canada under several aliases.

<HEADLINE> Health Plan Debated in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, dismissing Bill Bradley's health
care proposals in their latest debate as a ``little $150 a month voucher,''
notably understated how much federal support families would get under the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bradley fumbled the details of the 1996 welfare reforms he
voted against as a senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential rivals did not go as far off course in the
University of New Hampshire debate Wednesday night as they did in earlier
matchups. But here and there, truth was a casualty and complex ideas were boiled
down into barely recognizable form.
</P>
<P>
	   As usual, the main point of contention was Bradley's signature health care
plan and especially his proposal to replace Medicaid with subsidies to enable
people to buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left viewers with the impression that the subsidy would be capped at a
measly $150 a month, while Bradley says the figures in play are weighted
averages, not caps.
</P>
<P>
	   But beyond that, $150 a month is Bradley's figure for individuals -- the
average subsidy for a family of four would be more than $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's dismissal of the plan as minimal also was difficult to square with
another criticism he has made -- that it is so expensive it could drive the
country into a recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore tried to put Bradley on the defensive for opposing the welfare reforms
that are generally considered a success and, in the course of fighting back, the
former senator muddled legislative history.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley suggested the welfare restrictions he voted against were harsher
than those that became law, when in fact there was little substantive
difference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said at the time that you'd spend the next four years correcting that
bill,'' Bradley said. ``But remember this bill came in October of 1996. October
of 1996 -- who knew if Bill Clinton was going to win? Maybe it would have been
Bob Dole. If it had been Bob Dole, there would have been a long time before
there were any changes made in that welfare reform bill.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the welfare reforms became law in August 1996. Moreover, President
Clinton's defeat of Republican Dole in the 1996 election was widely expected by
October, if not earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a strange explanation,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, who
analyzes campaign debates and ads for their veracity. ``There was not a point in
which Clinton was not leading Dole in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore took credit in the debate for helping to pass what he called the most
significant gun-control legislation in a generation, with his tie-breaking vote
in the Senate on a bill to require instant background checks at gun shows. He
neglected to mention the bill did not become law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's claim that Republicans proposed slashing Medicare when they took over
Congress marked the return of what Jamieson called ``that standard old
deception'' from the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans did not propose a net cut, but rather a slowing in the rate of
growth, she noted. Democrats at one point also proposed cutting the rate of
growth of Medicare, but more modestly.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamieson also was baffled by Bradley's comment, when asked about taking
campaign money from the pharmaceutical industry as a senator, that he never did
anything against the interests of his constituents or his country.
</P>
<P>
	   Considering that pharmaceutical companies were major constituents of his in
New Jersey, that claim was essentially meaningless, she said.

    	   COLLINGSWOOD, N.J. (AP) - At a Teamsters union local ringed by police in
riot gear, the union opened a hearing Wednesday on the ouster of embattled
Philadelphia local chief John P. Morris.
<P>
	   Teamsters president James P. Hoffa signed an emergency order in November
removing the 73-year-old Morris as secretary-treasurer of Local 115 for charges
including alleged weapons purchases with union money and intimidation of members
he considered disloyal.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris attacked his ouster as head of the 2,700-member local as a political
payback because he backed Hoffa rival Ron Carey for the union presidency. He won
a federal court ruling last week that no emergency existed to justify removing
him without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   No crowds gathered outside the union hall, and during a lunch break in the
closed-door proceedings, Morris scoffed at "all these storm troopers and people
on roofs with rifles."
</P>
<P>
	   Collingswood Police Chief Thomas Garrity said 100 officers were at the
scene, in part because some of the allegations against Morris involved weapons
and in part to avoid a repeat of an earlier confrontation at the Local 676
building in Collingswood.
</P>
<P>
	   Police had been forced to close U.S. 130 at one point in the fall of 1998
while dispersing angry members of Local 115 and Local 676 who confronted one
another during the union election campaign. Local 676 supported Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
	   Though there were no arrests at that time, Garrity said, "There were verbal
confrontations and it was a tense situation. We were non-prepared for that. We
want to be prepared."
</P>
<P>
	   Garrity said the full force of police would remain in place throughout the
hearing, scheduled to last two to three days.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 officers wearing riot helmets and batons lined the union hall
parking lot, and those entering the building passed through a metal detector.
Two officers, one with a rifle and one with field glasses, stood on a rooftop
across from U.S. 130, and two mounted police patrolled the union hall parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
	   A block away, more than 20 police cars and vans, a food truck and a Camden
County Department of Corrections bus were parked in a lot fenced off with yellow
police tape.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a riot squad. That's a SWAT team. We're not John Dillinger," Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Rainville, a spokesman for the Teamsters international union, noted
that the accusations against Morris included using Teamster funds to buy and
stockpile weapons including shot guns and stun guns as well as combat fatigues
and other clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris said the combat gear was for warmth on cold picket lines, and stun
guns might be needed to defend against antiunion violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Rainville disagreed with that.
</P>
<P>
	   "My union doesn't own any guns," Rainville said. "It is not an appropriate
use of union funds to purchase weapons and it is not an appropriate response on
a picket line to use a stun gun."
</P>
<P>
	   Rainville said the panel of Teamsters officials - Charles Byrnes, secretary
treasurer of Local 926 in Pittsburgh; Denis Taylor, president of Local 355 in
Baltimore; and Ron McClain, president of Local 147 in Des Moines, Iowa - would
hear two or three days of testimony from union investigators and Morris and his
backers.
</P>
<P>
	   The three will send a letter to Hoffa within 60 days recommending whether a
trusteeship should be imposed, Rainville said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the international union began presenting its case Wednesday, Morris said,
"Statements have been made in there making us look like we were putting up some
kind of paramilitary. They want you to believe we were raising an army."
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't wait for our side to get the truth out," said Dennis Travis, a
Local 115 member backing Morris.

<HEADLINE> So. Calif. Draws Detroit's Attention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Long recognized as a world center for auto marketing and
design trends, Southern California is again attracting Detroit's attention, this
time thanks to Hollywood's computer animation magic.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to tap into show biz expertise in sophisticated computer animation,
General Motors Corp. plans to open a new Los Angeles design studio later this
month. GM was expected to make the announcement Wednesday night during a charity
event tied to the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, which holds its media preview
Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   GM's salute to Hollywood isn't the only recent acknowledgment of Southern
California's influence on the global auto industry.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 new cars will debut during the preview, a record for a
gathering long overshadowed by the prestigious North American International Auto
Show in Detroit. Last year, LA snared six debuts, including Honda's S2000
roadster.
</P>
<P>
	   And Ford Motor Co. is thinking about moving the U.S. headquarters of its
Volvo, Jaguar and Aston Martin brands from New Jersey to Southern California.
They would join Lincoln-Mercury, which moved its corporate offices to Irvine in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The increased attention reflects automakers' recognition that Southern
California, with its diverse, immigrant-laden population, provides a window to
world markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're looking for fresh perspective. They're becoming global and global
is not always viewed from the perspective of Detroit," said Thad Malesh,
director of North American forecasting at J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Southern California has long been a center for auto design. The region is
home to an estimated 20 design studios, including independent contractors and
shops operated by automakers such as Ford, Volvo, DaimlerChrysler and
Volkswagen, Mazda, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the designers working in those studios are graduates of the Art
Center College of Design in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got a pool of talent. It's becoming a kind of Silicon Valley of auto
design. There's a critical mass that maybe can't be duplicated in Detroit,"
Malesh said.
</P>
<P>
	   The GM center's 30 or so employees will include computer-assisted design
experts recruited from Hollywood animation and special effects companies, GM
spokesman Scott Fosgard said.
</P>
<P>
	   GM plans to use computer techniques such as three-dimensional imaging to
replace tedious clay modeling in the early stages of new car design. The goal is
to reduce the time needed to bring a new car to market from about four years to
two, Fosgard said.
</P>
<P>
	   During 2000, the company will unveil about a dozen concept cars -- as many
as seven could eventually go into production.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood, which has pioneered the use of computer graphics to create
stunning special effects in recent years, is considered ground zero for the new
technology, Fosgard said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking to tap into this pipeline. That's why we're here," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company already has a significant presence in Southern California.
General Motors operates a technical research center in Torrance and is
developing new onboard navigation and Internet systems through its Hughes
Electronics Corp. subsidiary, said David Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's auto transportation studies program
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty clear that if you're trying to stay in the forefront of design
in the world, you'd better pay attention to California," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, carmakers are planning world debuts of seven new production models
and 14 concept cars this year, shifting from Detroit in an attempt to stand out.
</P>
<P>
	   "You get a lot better bang for your buck if you spread these introductions
across the country," Cole said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lineup will include several new-generation sport utility vehicles
designed to combine the ruggedness of the SUV with car-like handling such as
Pontiac's Aztek and the Mazda Tribute.
</P>
<P>
	   In the luxury car category, Rolls Royce will unveil a pricey new model
identified by Automotive News as a new version of the Corniche convertible that
was discontinued in 1995. A Rolls Royce spokesman declined to confirm the
report, but noted that California would be a key market for such a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles show opens to the public on Saturday and continues through
Jan. 16.

<P>
   HILLSBORO, N.H. (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes told supporters Wednesday that
discussing abortion with dignity and compassion is the best way to persuade
people that it is wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes was asked during an event with supporters at the Dutton Club

</P>
<P>
	   ``Here we have profoundly different views on the meaning of freedom,'' the
Republican presidential candidate told the group of about 200 people. ``To me,
it's the freedom to be born. To you, it's the mother's right to choose.

the issue with dignity and compassion it could be an issue that inspires, not
divides, our country.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Soldiers Clash With Locals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Residents trying to gain entrance to an abandoned town
near an active volcano clashed with soldiers Wednesday, leaving several people
injured, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 people, many armed with rocks and clubs, confronted soldiers at a
military checkpoint outside the town of Banos, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Ignacio Vargas of the Tungurahua province said there had been shots
fired and people injured in the melee.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have warned that the 16,553-foot Tungurahua volcano could erupt
within days or weeks, as it has done at least a dozen times since 1534.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between the
townspeople and soldiers guarding the restricted area, which lies about 75 miles
southeast of the capital, Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend, hundreds of people confronted soldiers, Banos Mayor Camilo
Espinoza said. Two people were lightly injured in the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, about 2,000 Banos residents bypassed the military and
reached the town and are now refusing to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities evacuated the town's 17,000 people in October, after the volcano
awoke from a 79-year slumber. Another 8,000 people from nearby villages and
scattered hamlets also were ordered out of the area.

<HEADLINE> American Recounts Hostage Experience  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For eight harrowing days aboard Indian Airlines Flight
814, hijackers kept hostages too hot or too cold, made them sit motionless for
hours on end, and constantly had them fearing for their lives, recalled Jeanne
Moore, the only American aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   And then, in an instant, the nightmare was over.
</P>
<P>
	   With one of them shouting, ``We love you all,'' the band of terrorists
bounded out of the plane they had hijacked en route to India from Nepal, and 155
people suddenly had their freedom back.
</P>
<P>
	   For Moore, 53, the sudden turn of events ended a near-sleepless eight days,
a time during which she said she lived constantly with the threat of death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Feeling moment to moment, glad to be actually there or anywhere in that
moment because it meant that there was a chance for another moment,'' she said
Wednesday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Many times during the ordeal, the hijackers changed the temperature from hot
to cold, ordered their captives to sit still for hours and put guns to their
heads if they cried, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other times, she said, they were playful, even joking and singing songs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hijackers wanted to be highly entertaining when they weren't being
threatening,'' she said. ``They were doing jokes, they were leading prayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the only American among the 155 passengers and crew held hostage, Moore
said she felt there was a chance she would be used as a bargaining chip. She
slept only a few hours so she wouldn't miss any changes in the situation, and
several times she believed she would be killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I kind of wished it would be quick and painless,'' she said. One passenger
was killed at the beginning of the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bakersfield resident, who teaches special education students, was on
vacation when she was taken hostage. Her freedom was won on New Year's Eve when
India released three Kashmiri activists from its jails.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite that, Moore said she doesn't believe in exchanging hostages for
prisoners and worries that other groups may now attempt similar hijackings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, I'm glad to be here,'' she said. ``But even at the time, I was aware
that people shouldn't be reinforced positively for their bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, who returned to the United States exhausted and suffering from
pneumonia and stomach problems, joked occasionally during the news conference.
But she choked up when she told of a mother forced to decide whether her
1-year-old or 4-year-old would be released early from the plane.

Solar Winds Could Wreak Havoc During Next 18 Months
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Save those sighs of relief at having survived the Y2K bug,
another menace looms: a surge in solar winds that could wreak havoc with
pipelines, pagers and power grids.
</P>
<P>
	   No one is urging a rerun of Y2K hysteria, but the coming peak in the sun's
sunspot cycle is getting lots of attention in the scientific world. Some have
dubbed it the Year 2001 Problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Solar winds associated with sunspots can disrupt Earth's magnetic shield,
causing problems for many modern technologies, says David Kendall of the
Canadian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the sunspots peak there are more eruptions on the sun, these
eruptions are more violent, and there is more material which is ejected into
space, and we feel the effects,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1994, a geomagnetic storm destroyed circuits in the $286-million
Anik E-1 satellite, leaving the craft unable to focus signals on Earth and
causing chaos in Canadian TV, radio and data transmissions.
</P>
<P>
	   On March 13, 1987, a magnetic storm caused the collapse of the Hydro-Quebec
power system, leaving six million people without electricity for hours. Many
other incidents have been blamed on rough space weather.

Cabinet Ministers Promise Aid for Churchill Residents
</P>
<P>
	   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Residents of Churchill, Manitoba, already one of
the most isolated towns in the province, faced a fourth full day without
long-distance phone service today but help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Two northern Manitoba cabinet ministers promised aid and comfort Wednesday
and the province's phone company assured residents they'll get some
long-distance service back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As early as next week there will be a system put in place using satellite
uplink,'' said Government Services Minister Steve Ashton, joined by Northern
Affairs Minister Eric Robinson who represents Churchill in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It won't be fully comparable but they're talking about numbers such as 85
percent access.''
</P>
<P>
	   The community of about 1,000, located 990 miles north of Winnipeg on the
shore of Hudson Bay, has been without long-distance service since Sunday when a
communications tower crumpled, apparently the victim of ice buildup and high
winds the week before.
</P>
<P>
	   Manitoba Telecom Services said it could take three months before a
replacement can be put in place but the temporary system should be working next
week.

Freight Moving As British Columbia Rail Ends Lockout
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Rail cars trundled and freight yards
bustled with renewed activity Wednesday as British Columbia Rail revived its
operations after an eight-day lockout.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Freight will begin to move today,'' Alan Dever, spokesman for Canada's
third-largest railway, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Unionized employees were called back to work early Wednesday morning, just
hours after an all-night round of mediated bargaining produced a tentative
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the agreement, retroactive to Dec. 31, 1997, were not to be
disclosed until 1,600 members of seven British Columbia Rail unions have a
chance to see it. Ratification votes are to take place over several days.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the three-year deal does include a wage package with no increases
in the first two years and two percent in the final year.
</P>
<P>
	   British Columbia Rail is a Crown corporation and subject to the government's
public-sector wage guidelines. The railway had demanded productivity gains and
cost cutting to pay for the wage increase.

Clark Won't Crack Whip on Tories Who disagree
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Conservative Leader Joe Clark says he won't bring down the
disciplinary hammer on any Tory MPs who break ranks and support Liberal-inspired
ground rules for the next Quebec referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I certainly hope to be able to persuade them of the wisdom of the position
that I'm putting forward,'' Clark said in an interview. ``But if I can't
persuade them, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clark has denounced legislation tabled last month by Prime Minister Jean
Chretien's government setting tough terms for any secession negotiations in the
event of a future referendum victory by Quebec sovereigntists.
</P>
<P>
	   At least five Conservative MPs, including deputy leader Elsie Wayne, have
publicly differed with him and said they may vote in favour of the bill.

	   He has been living with relatives in Miami, who have insisted they could
give Elian a better life than his father could back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both American
immigration law and U.S. practice,'' Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner said at a news conference in Washington. ``This
little boy, who has been through so much, belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ``made it very clear that he
wants Elian returned to him as soon as possible.'' Even though the boy's parents
were divorced, the INS found that Elian had a ``close and continuous
relationship'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency ruled that Elian must return to Cuba by Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the boy's relatives asked Attorney General Janet Reno to reverse
the decision and also planned to ask a federal judge for a restraining order.
They said the INS was violating its own rules by not allowing the boy to apply
for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was surprised because I always thought this was a place of liberty and
they are not letting him keep that liberty,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, the
boy's cousin. ``It's always about the father. What about the mother? That was
his mother's will.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department officials in Washington told The Associated Press that
Reno was consulted about the decision and could have intervened before the
ruling was issued.
</P>
<P>
	   The father could not be located for comment Wednesday. He and Elian's four
grandparents had dinner Tuesday in Havana with Fidel Castro, said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who went to Cuba to help
reunite father and son.
</P>
<P>
	   After the INS decision, several hundred people linked arms, shouted
``Liberty!'' and sang the Cuban national anthem in front of the house where
Elian has been staying with his paternal great-aunt and great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   In front of the Miami INS office, several hundred protesters waved Cuban and
American flags and shouted anti-Castro slogans.
</P>
<P>
	   The protests were emotional but peaceful, and paled in comparison to the
huge government-staged rallies in Havana demanding the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're using him as if he were a toy and Fidel Castro is saying, `He's
mine, not yours,''' said 28-year-old Norisbel Almeida, a mother of two young
children at the protest outside the home. ``Why did they show him the good life
so he could go back to Cuba and have nothing?''
</P>
<P>
	   Some argued that the Cuban-American community wrongly turned the boy's
plight into a political issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To them, this is about fighting Castro, this isn't about the well-being of
the boy,'' said David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of
Miami. ``They turned him into a tool knowing they had no legal case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since he was rescued, Elian has been flooded with toys, visited Disney
World, celebrated his first Christmas in the United States and started attending
first grade.
</P>
<P>
	   He also has been in the constant glare of TV cameras. Reporters and
photographers staked out the home Wednesday as TV helicopters hovered above the
house and tracked Elian's movement as he left school, dressed in his uniform of
blue pants and white shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members tried to shield Elian from the protests and media attention,
hustling him from school to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't know what is going on. We don't want to make him feel bad,''
Marisleysis Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said he was disappointed by the INS' decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian's mother gave her life for the freedom of her son,'' Bush said.
``Today's decision ... violates her desires for Elian and instead delivers him
to a country where an oppressive dictator does not allow hope and where people
lack the most basic human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, the communist government warned its citizens to guard against
``excessive optimism'' about the U.S. government's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said he had honored a pledge to keep politics out of the
decision over the boy. ``The INS followed the law and the procedure and made the
decision that they made after an exhaustive review of the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has asked the Cuban government to let the father
escort the boy back home. Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, had said Cuba would not stop the father from going to the United
States as long as American officials first agreed to let the boy return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban adults who reach the U.S. mainland are routinely allowed to stay, but
the boy's age created diplomatic problems. Many Cuban exiles have insisted that
his mother's death in a bid to live in a free country was enough to allow Elian
to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a crime to send him back to Cuba,'' said Melba Roses, 56, who moved
to the United States from Cuba nearly 50 years ago. ``There is food here and in
Cuba there is none. The child has a right to stay.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what the boy has been saying, Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the
Miami family, said: ``He cares for his father but he would like his father to be
here with him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Cubans in Florida sympathized with the father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He should be with his father,'' Louis Bolivar, 32, said outside a shop
near Miami's Little Havana section. ``They're doing the right thing.''

<HEADLINE> IRA Wants Quick Army Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army, under pressure to disarm,
accused British authorities Wednesday of straining Northern Ireland's peace
agreement by delaying military cutbacks in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   In its traditional new year's message, the outlawed IRA said the British
government had ``no excuse'' for failing to publish a schedule of troop
withdrawals and army-base closures in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any failure on their part to rapidly implement a program of
demilitarization can only have a negative impact on the potential for political
progress,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, the IRA is expected to completely
disarm by May 2000, and the British government pledged to publish a schedule of
its plans for troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the peace accord was realized last month when local
politicians formed the new Protestant-Catholic government, which includes the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. At the same time, the IRA began meeting with a
Belfast-based disarmament commission, but no weapons have been turned in yet.
</P>
<P>
	   In the wake of the advances last month, the British government said it would
publish a withdrawal report this month detailing the planned military cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   But its failure to do so thus far has agitated the IRA, which is demanding
urgent action by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein has insisted no IRA disarmament moves will happen unless the
British side offers equivalent gestures beforehand. The province's major
Protestant party, meanwhile, pledged to collapse the new Belfast administration
if the IRA didn't begin its disarmament by February.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the IRA confirmed that it would continue discussions begun
last month with a Belfast-based disarmament commission -- but gave no hint it
would destroy any of its hidden weapons stockpiles as a result.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA, rooted in the most militant Catholic areas of Northern Ireland, has
been observing a cease-fire since 1997. Previously it waged a 27-year campaign
of bombings and shootings designed to abolish the Protestant-majority province,
which was founded in 1920 shortly before the rest of Ireland won independence
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government deployed soldiers in Northern Ireland in 1969 to
quell street violence, particularly Protestant attacks on Catholic homes in
Belfast. Instead, the deployment triggered the rise of the modern IRA.
</P>
<P>
	   British authorities already have withdrawn a half-dozen battalions and
dismantled several key army installations in response to the IRA's 1997
cease-fire. British troops currently number 15,000, including several thousand
members of a mostly Protestant local regiment.

<HEADLINE> Co. Fined in Trade Secrets Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- A Taiwanese corporation was fined $5 million and
two of its former executives were sentenced Wednesday in the first case tried
under the 1996 Economic Espionage Act.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Peter C. Economus fined Four Pillars Enterprises Ltd.
for stealing trade secrets from its competitor Avery Dennison Corp., an
adhesive-maker based in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say the Yangs received secrets about adhesives used in products
such as self-stick postage stamps, name labels, diaper tape and battery labels.
</P>
<P>
	   Pin Yen Yang, 73, the company's former chief executive, received six months
of home confinement and a $250,000 fine. He also was placed on probation for 18
months.
</P>
<P>
	   His daughter, Hwei-Chen "Sally" Yang, 41, a former Four Pillars executive,
was fined $5,000 and received one year of probation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The imposition of the statutory maximum fine of $5 million should make it
perfectly clear that corporate espionage is unlawful and will be aggressively
investigated, prosecuted and punished," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jim
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   The key witness in the Four Pillars trial was Victor Lee, an Avery Dennison
research scientist from Taiwan who testified that he provided Four Pillars with
confidential information until 1997, when he was caught. Lee pleaded guilty to
wire fraud and began cooperating with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial evidence included a secret video the FBI made of a meeting between
Lee and the Yangs, in which Sally Yang cut the "confidential" stamp off an Avery
Dennison report. Pin Yen Yang then instructed Lee to dispose of the clipping.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yangs in April were acquitted of mail fraud but were convicted of
violating the industrial espionage act.
</P>
<P>
	   Pin Yen Yang apologized at his sentencing and said it was not his intention
to steal trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm deeply sorry for what I've done," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors objected that no prison time was imposed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is the message, 'If you steal information from your competitor, you'll be
given a probationary term?"' Assistant U.S. Attorney David Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for both company's declined to comment because Avery Dennison's
civil lawsuit against Four Pillars is scheduled for trial Monday in U.S.
District Court in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mob Associate Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Reputed Rhode Island mob associate Robert DeLuca on Wednesday
pleaded guilty to gambling and extortion charges.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLuca admitted to racketeering, extortion and other offenses in U.S.
District Court, but he did not acknowledge being a member of the mafia or
participating in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor did he agree to cooperate with prosecutors, as have some of his
co-defendants in a wide-ranging 1995 racketeering indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't look at it like a deal,'' said defense attorney Randy Gioia.
``He's not being asked to give the government anything in return for his plea.''
</P>
<P>
	   DeLuca, 54, was charged in a 1995 indictment along with Francis ``Cadillac
Frank'' Salemme, confessed hitman John Martorano, Stephen ``The Rifleman''
Flemmi and alleged mob boss James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger. Salemme and Martorano
have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Bulger is a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLuca -- who is already serving prison time -- agreed to a deal that,
provided it's approved by a federal judge, would not require him to do any
additional time. He has served about half of a 126-month sentence for a federal
extortion conviction in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
	   In the five years since Bulger bolted on word that he was the subject of a
massive racketeering indictment, the net has closed around his cohorts. But
there's still no sign of Whitey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's as important as ever, and we are as committed as ever to getting
Whitey Bulger,'' said FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkiewicz, who noted that Bulger
was put on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in August. ``He may not be
participating in criminal acts right now but he still is accountable for that
activity in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bulger fled just after his 1995 indictment on gambling, loansharking and
drug charges. Prosecutors claim he ran a criminal organization for 30 years from
the city's South Boston neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices fell Thursday morning on hefty selling
of high-technology issues, despite Wall Street's rebound. The dollar was higher
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the morning session down
197.36 points, or 1.08 percent, to 18,345.19. On Wednesday, the key average
plunged 460.31 points, or 2.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 104.36 yen, up 1.18 yen from 103.18 yen posted late
Wednesday in Tokyo, but below its late New York level of 104.35 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, traders taking profits sold high-tech issues which had
posted significant gains over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the morning's biggest decliners were high-tech giants Sony and
Kyocera, with Sony shares closing the morning off $19 at $247. Shares of
Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Matsushita Electric Industrial, Sharp and TDK
also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is under a correction phase after rallies late last year in high
technology and information shares," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the market's fundamentals are not bad," he said, citing steady buying
interest from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   In a market dominated by sell orders, pharmaceutical issues rose as
investors shifted away from high-tech into domestic demand-related issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until price fluctuations of information technology shares stabilize,
investors will shift to biotechnology-related issues," said Kunihiro Hatae,
general manager at Tokyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 124.72 points, or 1.1
percent, to 11,122.65. The Dow had risen as much as 216 points in earlier
trading. It plunged 359.58 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index ended a highly volatile session
Wednesday with a loss of 24.09 points, or 0.6 percent, at 3,877.60. On Tuesday,
it suffered its worst point loss, declining 229.46 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section shed 23.78 points, down 1.44 percent, to 1,628.06. The TOPIX closed down
65.63 points, or 3.82 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, investors were keen to take profits from the dollar's
gains after the Bank of Japan bought the currency to stem the yen's rise earlier
in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's vice finance minister, Haruhiko Kuroda, told reporters earlier in
the day that the yen was still too strong against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of fundamentals, (the yen's strength) is still clearly excessive,"
Kuroda said.
</P>
<P>
	   Too strong a yen hurts the income of export-based industries, which
repatriate profits earned overseas in dollars back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 107.82 yen, up from 107.24 yen
late in Tokyo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was at 1.7150,
up from 1.6950 Wednesday. Its price stood at 101.57, down 0.17 point from
101.74.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Leave More of West Bank  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The handover was quick and unemotional. An Israeli officer
shook hands with Palestinian officials and muttered ``Bye, folks'' before he led
a convoy of jeeps out of an Israeli army base in the West Bank on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli pullback from a small slice of land was one of the last before
Israel and the Palestinians draw their final borders in a September peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal ended a seven-week deadlock between the two sides over a
relatively minor issue -- whether the Palestinians would have a say in sketching
the maps of the partial troop withdrawals. Israeli and Palestinian officials
were mum about how the dispute was resolved, but both sides said privately the
other gave in.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians held up a November handover of 5 percent of the West Bank,
complaining about the type of land being offered, and demanding more populated
land closer to east Jerusalem, their hoped-for capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians said they were trying to establish the principle that
Israel cannot dictate the withdrawal maps. Israel resisted, and now denies
reports that it eventually relented and promised the Palestinians some of the
desired areas in the next scheduled withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank
on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who is believed to be involved in
backchannel talks with the Palestinians, said the Palestinians looked a gift
horse in the mouth when they held up the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians ``didn't receive a `tempting offer' because they don't need
a `tempting offer' to receive territory,'' Beilin told Israel radio on
Wednesday. ``There is a limit to absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Once the partial pullbacks are completed, the Palestinians will have full or
partial control over 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's withdrawal began around midday when several trucks loaded with
furniture and mattresses pulled out of the Yosef army base east of the West Bank
town of Nablus. Braving driving rain, Israel troops lowered their flag.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli lieutenant colonel shook hands with Palestinian officials waiting
at the gate, and left with a quick ``bye, folks.'' A convoy of Israeli jeeps
drove away and the Palestinians rushed in and hoisted their own banner.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the army said it transferred six bases and camps in the northern and
southern West Bank, giving 3 percent of the land to Palestinian civil rule and 2
percent to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said however
that the 2 percent, mostly areas north of the town of Ramallah, would only be
officially turned over Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in charge of the withdrawal were
meeting Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   By Feb. 13, the two sides are to reach agreement on the framework for a
final peace treaty, which would include an outline of a future border between
Israel and the Palestinian entity. Negotiators have reported some progress, but
it was uncertain whether they could meet the self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track came at a time when Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was engaged in intensive peace talks with Syria. The
withdrawal appeared to back Barak's claim that it was possible to move ahead on
both tracks simultaneously, and that he would not focus on one at the expense of
the other.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Israeli and Syrian negotiators met in Shepherdstown, W.Va.
in their face-to-face talks in nearly four years. Israel is expected to yield
all or most of the strategic Golan Heights as the price for peace with the Arab
country, with which it has fought three wars.

	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Larry Ashcraft, a radio programmer who expanded the reach
of Xavier University's public radio station WVXU-FM and the Riders Radio Theater
program, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashcraft brought the Riders in the Sky cowboy performing group to Cincinnati

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thomas G. Butson, a former editor at The New York Times and
other newspapers who went on to become part owner and editor of a Greenwich
Village community newspaper, died Monday of pneumonia. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Butson began his journalism career in his native New Zealand, and was
assistant managing editor of The Toronto Star at 28. He joined The Times in 1968
as an editor and retired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Butson and his wife, Elizabeth, bought The Villager, a money-losing weekly

Louis A. Fisher
</P>
<P>
	   GROSSE POINTE SHORES, Mich. (AP) -- Louis A. Fisher, the son of auto
industry pioneer William A. Fisher, died Monday of pneumonia. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
	   William Fisher was one of seven brothers who formed Fisher Body, which later

Karl Strauch
</P>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Karl Strauch, a prominent physicist and professor emeritus at
Harvard University, died Monday of pneumonia. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1970s, while director of the Cambridge Electron Accelerator, he

Record Patriot and the north and south Westshore Shopping Guides.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to his wife, Jennifer, survivors include his mother, two
brothers and a sister.
Robert C. Wilson
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert C. Wilson, a former war correspondent for The
Associated Press who parachuted out of a burning plane behind enemy lines during
World War II, died Tuesday. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson spent 41 years as a journalist, including 13 years with the AP and 23
years as a reporter and editor for U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson had volunteered to cover air operations over Germany when the troop
carrier plane he was aboard was shot down in March 1945. He parachuted from the
plane and sought refuge with British troops in a farmhouse, which later came
under German attack. Wilson's first-person account of his escape was featured in
newspapers across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   He retired in 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson is survived by his wife, Huguette Vallier; his son, Stephen, who is
AP's London-based European sports editor; and his grandson, Peter.

<HEADLINE> Riot Police Guard Union Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    COLLINGSWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Police in riot gear ringed a hearing Wednesday
into whether the head of a Teamsters chapter in Philadelphia should be removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Union president James P. Hoffa ordered in November that John P. Morris, 73,
be removed as secretary-treasurer of Local 115 over accusations of weapons
purchases with union money and intimidation of members.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris attacked the ouster as political payback because he backed Hoffa
rival Ron Carey for the union presidency. Morris won a federal court ruling last
week that no emergency existed to justify removing him without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   During a lunch break in the closed-door proceedings, Morris scoffed at "all
these storm troopers and people on roofs with rifles."
</P>
<P>
	   A panel of union officials is hearing testimony from investigators, Morris
and his backers. The panel will then send a letter to Hoffa within 60 days
recommending whether a trusteeship should be imposed, said Brian Rainville, a
spokesman for the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials said they chose to conduct the hearing at a hall across the
state line in New Jersey because it was neutral territory and was large enough
for the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Collingswood Police Chief Thomas Garrity said 100 officers were at the
scene, in part because some of the allegations against Morris involved weapons.

<HEADLINE> Japan Chief Resigns Amid Scandals  </HEADLINE>
   By JOJI SAKURAI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top police chief resigned Thursday after allegations
of drug abuse and sexual harassment stained the force's image and prompted calls
for closer monitoring of officers.
</P>
<P>
	   National Police Agency chief Yuko Sekiguchi, 60, told reporters he would
quit to restore public trust in Japanese law enforcement, an agency spokesman
said on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very sorry about the scandals,'' Sekiguchi was quoted as saying by
Kyodo News agency. He added, however, that his resignation did not imply that he
was taking responsibility for any wrongdoing in the force.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese police's relatively benign image was cracked last year by a
scandal in a Tokyo suburb centering on allegations that senior officials had
covered up drug abuse by an agent.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers in Kanagawa prefecture, or state, were also allegedly involved in
sexual harassment and bullying of colleagues. The prefectural police chief and
several other officials have been arrested in the drug cover-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Those scandals -- and accusations of sexual harassment in another
prefectural police force -- have triggered criticism of Japan's lack of a strong
system to keep watch over law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sekiguchi recently proposed a plan to bolster the National Public Safety
Commission, the body that supervises Japan's police forces. He said he is
stepping down now that the plan has been completed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We now have various countermeasures in place to deal with the scandals,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki was quoted as saying by Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
	   Sekiguchi's resignation is expected to be approved this week at a Cabinet
meeting, the police spokesman said. He is likely to be replaced by the agency's
deputy chief, Setsuo Tanaka, 56.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandals have received national attention -- and criticism. Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi said late last year that the crimes were ``beyond
description'' because they involved a systematic cover-up.
</P>
<P>
	   The main scandal centers on allegations that the Kanagawa police covered up
drug abuse by Yoshihisa Sakayori, 37, a former assistant inspector.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakayori had confessed in December 1996 to using amphetamines --
increasingly common in Japan. Despite a positive urine test for drugs, however,
he was not immediately arrested. He was later fired for having an extramarital
affair.

<HEADLINE> McCain Denies Ties To TV License  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Running for president on a promise to rid the nation
of big money politics, Sen. John McCain repeatedly denied on Wednesday trying to
influence a federal agency by prodding it to approve a TV license request by one
of his financial benefactors.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he did urge the Federal Communications Commission to make a
decision on Paxson Communications' application for a license two years after the
company submitted it. But he told reporters that he did not tell the FCC which
way to vote and that he rightly pressed for a decision in his capacity as Senate
Commerce Committee Chairman, not in exchange for the company's contributions or
the use of its private jet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't tell them to approve it; I told them to act,'' the Arizona
senator said. ``I think it's entirely appropriate.'' Late Wednesday, McCain
cancelled a fund-raiser scheduled for this weekend that was to be held by Lowell
``Bud'' Paxson, saying it would be inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue gave GOP front-runner George Bush a chance to criticize McCain for
the second time in as many days as Republican contenders fought for advantage in
this first-in-the-nation primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's really important for people who are advocating reforms to
live up to the spirit of reforms they are advocating,'' Bush, campaigning in
Iowa, told reporters. Later, in Manchester, N.H., he said, ``I respect John
McCain'' and acknowledged that ``I haven't seen the facts.'' But he also said,
``I think somebody who makes campaign financing an issue has got to be
consistent and walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's place in the polls here and his strong fund raising haven't
threatened Bush's front-runner status nationally. But Bush has shown his
determination to prevent that from happening, going after McCain Monday on tax
cuts in their first major policy dispute and inspiring McCain to release details
of a tax plan he hadn't intended to put out until Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain appeared at one point Wednesday with William Bennett, the former
education secretary and presidential drug adviser who has written widely on
morality. And he delivered a speech calling for presidential candidates to
refrain from personal attacks and distortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please do not think I claim some special virtue among the candidates,''
McCain told the Boys and Girls Club of Manchester. ``If we accomplish anything
in this campaign, let those of us who seek the highest office in the land help
turn the practice of politics toward a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
	   Disputes over issues and the candidates' performance in public office are
fair game, however, McCain has said. He added that the tax cut tiff and the new
talk of improperly acting on behalf of a contributor are only to be expected as
a candidate becomes more of a threat in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said his high-profile role as a proponent of campaign finance
reform makes him additionally vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's suspicion about all of us as a result of these huge amounts of
money that wash around political campaigns,'' McCain said. ``With me, being the
'reformer,' obviously those stories are more relevant. I expect more of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is chairman of the Commerce Committee, which oversees the FCC. He
urged the agency in a Dec. 10 letter to act quickly on a matter involving Paxson
Communications, a company that owns 73 family-oriented TV stations and has
legally provided a private jet for McCain's use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe first reported the story Wednesday, saying company
officials coordinated $20,000 in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   Company chairman Lowell (Bud) Paxson, wife Marla and daughter Nicole each
gave the maximum $1,000 last March 23.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's letter to FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, released by the campaign
Wednesday, said: ``The sole purpose of this request is to secure final action on
a matter that has now been pending for over two years. ... I emphasize that my
purpose is not to suggest in any way how you should vote -- merely that you
vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said late Wednesday that there was no urgency to
the senator's letter to the FCC, since Paxson could have simply reapplied if its
application expired.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not unusual for members of Congress to send letters to the FCC about
transactions that are under review. In fact, nine other lawmakers also sent
inquiries to the commission about the Pittsburgh television station. Among those
were Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and a number of
Pennsylvania lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC's Kennard called McCain's request for information -- the last
one received by the commission from a member of Congress -- ``highly unusual.''
Kennard noted that the letter came at ``a sensitive time in the deliberative
process.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am concerned that inquiries concerning the individual deliberations of
each commissioner could have procedural and substantive impacts on the
commission's deliberations and thus on the due process rights of the parties,''
Kennard wrote in a Dec. 14 reply to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign released a fact sheet saying that the company's planes are
available to all 535 members of Congress when they're not being used for the
firm's business. It also said that 80 percent of U.S. business activity falls
under Commerce Committee jurisdiction and ``there is no evidence that John
McCain has taken inappropriate action on behalf of a contributor.''

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Duke 109, Virginia 100, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN POPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Chris Carrawell had 25 points Wednesday night
as No. 8 Duke rallied from a 10-point second-half deficit for a 109-100 overtime
victory over Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 23rd consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference win for the Blue
Devils (10-2, 1-0) and their 10th straight against the Cavaliers (9-4, 0-1).
</P>
<P>
	   But Virginia, which lost to Duke three times last season by an average of 43
points, gave the Blue Devils all they could handle as they opened defense of
their league title.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke led 89-87 with 11 seconds remaining in regulation, but Mike Dunleavy
kept the door open for Virginia by missing the second of two free throws. That
allowed Virginia's Adam Hall to force overtime with a driving acrobatic layup
with 5.1 seconds reaming that sent the University Hall crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the magic that led the Cavaliers back from a nine-point first-half
deficit and helped them take back the momentum after several big Duke runs
evaporated in overtime. Jason Williams of Duke hit an open 3-pointer just 10
seconds into overtime and the Blue Devils opened with an 8-2 run.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Williams led the Cavaliers with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia led 74-64 after Roger Mason's 3-pointer with 7:40 remaining. But
Duke rallied, moving ahead 85-82 on a dunk by Shane Battier with 2:15 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 3-pointer by Mason with 50 seconds left gave the Cavaliers a
one-point lead before Duke went ahead on Dunleavy's free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by nine points early in the first half, Virginia fought back with
several big runs for a 43-43 halftime tie, nearly missing a lead when Keith
Friel's halfcourt shot rimmed out at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia jumped to a 50-47 lead on Donald Hand's second 3-pointer of the
half with 17:30 left, then went ahead by five on Mason's layup with 16:52 to go.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Fall Again  </HEADLINE>
    By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Adding to the red ink from Asia's massive stock slide, the
Tokyo and Hong Kong markets suffered more big losses early Thursday as traders
shrugged off a calmer performance on Wall Street and dumped high-tech shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Smaller Asian exchanges were mixed in the wake of Wednesday's selloff that
hit some places so hard it brought back memories of the way prices had plunged
more than two years ago as the financial crisis spread through the region.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index lost almost 3 percent of its value
Thursday morning, adding to Wednesday's sharp 7.2 percent dive -- its worst
one-day drop since late October 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   After a little more than an hour of trading, the Hang Seng had fallen 457.98
points, or 2.9 percent, to 15,388.74 on Asia's second-biggest market.
</P>
<P>
	   On Asia's top market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, early losses were not so
steep, but investors were busy bailing out of high-tech companies that have
taken a beating globally.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5.6 percent drop in the U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday sparked the
selloffs, and although the Nasdaq held its losses Wednesday to just 0.6 percent,
traders figured many high-tech companies were still too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the big decliners in early Tokyo trading were high-tech giants Sony
and Kyocera. Also hit were Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Matsushita Electric
Industrial, Sharp and TDK.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless Nasdaq and Internet shares stabilize, we'll see some more
corrections in Japan," said David Shirt, a stock salesman at investment house
Jardine Fleming in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   By the midday break, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues was
down 197.36 points, or 1.1 percent, at 18,345.19. The Nikkei lost 2.4 percent on
Wednesday, after falling as much as 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities,
said foreign investors were showing interest in some stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market's fundamentals are not bad," Karaki said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips in Australia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia showed modest
rebounds early Thursday, while prices in Singapore and the Philippines were down
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwanese stocks continued to buck the trend, with blue chips adding another
1.4 percent early Thursday -- on top of a 1.1 percent gain that made the Taipei
Stock Exchange the region's only winner on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> National Geographic Sued Over CD-ROM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some writers and photographers have sued the National
Geographic Society, claiming the not-for-profit organization is unfairly
reproducing and selling their work in a CD-ROM compilation.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal lawsuit, filed Dec. 27 in Manhattan, calls for a permanent
injunction to block the sale of the ``The Complete National Geographic, 110
Years of National Geographic Magazine on CD-ROM'' and its DVD version. It also
seeks unspecified damages for writers and photographers whose work is displayed.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Washington offices of National Geographic did not return
calls seeking comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, many of the writers' and photographers' contracts
specifically limited the reproduction of their photographs or words to the
magazine. Others said their work cannot be reproduced electronically without
permission of the author.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These plaintiffs did not intend to have their work used for profit and
commercial purposes on CD-ROM and in DVD formats for the price that they
negotiated,'' the lawsuit says. ``It is believed that there are hundreds of
writers and photographers in this situation.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley allies cast doubt on Gore's abortion-rights commitment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW MARKET, N.H. (AP) - Abortion-rights activists speaking at a Bill
Bradley rally Wednesday said Vice President Al Gore's commitment to such rights
cannot be trusted. "I have always been pro-choice and I always will," Bradley
said by way of contrast.
<P>
	   At the noontime rally before the two Democratic presidential candidates met
in debate, activists said that as a Tennessee congressman 20 years ago Gore
voted with the National Right to Life Committee 84 percent of the time -
including votes against Medicaid coverage of abortion and for amending the 1984
Civil Rights Act to protect "unborn children from the moment of conception."
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's more recent views and votes are in line with
abortion-rights supporters, a core Democratic constituency, and his campaign
spokesman said Wednesday that Gore's support was unwavering.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore has always been pro-choice throughout his career," spokesman Chris
Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And more than that, he stayed and fought against the Republican Congress to
protect women in America - whether it was on choice, equal pay, child care and
other family issues, while Senator Bradley declared the system broken and went
home."
</P>
<P>
	   Lehane dismissed Gore's 1984 vote as a procedural one on a bigger set of
civil rights issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who retired from the Senate in 1996, always voted with
abortion-rights activists during his 18-year tenure, said Concord attorney and
Planned Parenthood member Lucy Karl.
</P>
<P>
	   Of Gore, Karl said: "We do not need fair-weathered friends."
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Rauh, former president of Planned Parenthood of New England, said it
was "appalling" that Gore says he has always supported abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's OK to change your mind, but if you don't trust us enough as a leader
to tell us the truth and tell us why, I'm not interested in electing you," Rauh
said.
</P>
<P>
	   She and Karl were two of four women introducing Bradley to the 200 or so men
and women gathered in New Market Town Hall, where campaign aides distributed the
names of nearly 600 New Hampshire women backing Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   In his brief remarks, Bradley did not speak directly of Gore, but he did
say, "This is an issue that you cannot straddle."
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled the words of an Iowa woman who said that before the Supreme
Court made abortion legal the "anesthesia" given by back-room abortion providers
"was a gun at the head of the woman, urging her not to scream."
</P>
<P>
	   "We must never return to those days. I have been a strong pro-choice
advocate throughout my public life. I always have and I always will," Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He made a tactical decision to try and undermine Gore's advantage with women
voters by painting him as unreliable on abortion rights. It was a strategy that
caught by surprise some in Bradley's audience who know Gore by his more recent,
solid abortion-rights position.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll have to research that myself," said Bradley supporter Shirley Murty, a
retired medical technician visiting from Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was the first time I'd heard it. I was really surprised. I mean, I
know Al Gore is a trustworthy man but on abortion, I guess I don't know," said
retired Exeter teacher Cindy Baer, a new volunteer for the Bradley campaign.

<HEADLINE> Bradley accuses Gore of deliberately distorting his health care  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DURHAM. N.H. (AP) - Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley accused
Al Gore Wednesday night of deliberately distorting his proposal to expand health
coverage, but the vice president shot back in the first debate of the election
year that his rival's plan would leave many New Hampshire residents "high and
dry."
<P>
	   Prodded by debate moderator Peter Jennings to say whether Gore had ever
taken a quote or vote out of context, Bradley instantly replied, "Yes."
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, Bradley said, "offended me" by claiming he would hurt
African-Americans and Latinos and by saying his health care plan would
shortchange many Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, standing a few feet away on a University of New Hampshire stage,
paraphrased Harry Truman's famous utterance: "I'm not giving him hell. I'm just
telling the truth and he thinks it's hell."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore held aloft a card that he said characterized Bradley's health plan and
contended the people of New Hampshire "would be left out, left high and dry" by
Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let me tell you how the private sector works," retorted Bradley, a former
New Jersey senator, adding that health insurance companies would quickly try to
fashion coverage to meet the new demand.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange came one-third of the way through the 60-minute debate, the
first in a series of confrontations in which Democrats and Republicans will take
turns debating in the run-up to the first balloting of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore is the national frontrunner by far, but Bradley has mounted a
surprisingly strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, and is even or
ahead in the polling in advance of the first primary set for Feb. 1 in New
Hampshire. That prompted the vice president to allude to his "underdog" status.
</P>
<P>
	   "Your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes," Bradley said wryly.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Gore: "I hope my upset victory brings tears to your eyes on Feb. 1."
</P>
<P>
	   Predictably, the reaction of voters in the audience was mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Laura Akeley, a University of New Hampshire art student, said she arrived a
Gore a supporter and was leaving a Gore supporter, although she conceded "I can
see now why a lot of people support Bill Bradley."
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Mayer, 35, a radio talk-show producer from Randolph, said he had been
undecided, but was walking out whole-heartedly behind Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The two contenders agreed on some issues, citing a need for stricter gun
control laws and saying they would make appointments to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff only if they would implement a policy of permitting gays to serve openly
in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   But the two rivals came prepared for battle, clashing on local issues -
including development within the White Mountain National Forest in northern New
Hampshire - as well as national concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who likes to boast of a candidacy of big ideas, said that Gore was
"in a Washington bunker." That's understandable, he said, given the Republican
Congress, the Democratic fund-raising scandals and impeachment. "But the reality
is, the Democratic party shouldn't be in the Washington bunker with you," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore responded, "I'm proud that I stayed and fought against the Gingrich
Congress."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley launched a sharp attack on the Clinton-Gore administration's
handling of relations with Russia, saying the United States had not pushed hard
enough in the last eight years to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and
had agreed to send international aid to Russia "knowing that corruption was
rampant."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore issued a defense, saying, "I think that in spite of the problems there
have been some successes, including a new leader committed to reform, a free
press and free elections."
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were given the chance to pose questions to one another, and Gore
used his turn to ask Bradley whether he believed he had made a mistake on any of
three votes he had cast: in favor of Ronald Reagan's budget cuts in 1981,
opposed to authorizing the ground war against Iraq in 1990 and against the
welfare reform law that President Clinton signed into law. Bradley defended each
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, "I think all three were mistakes." While serving in Congress,
Gore voted against the budget cuts and in favor of using force in Kuwait and as
vice president supported the welfare law.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he was worried that Bradley had refused to own up to any mistakes,
and was worried about that quality in a president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley broke in to cite what he said was an error he had made: his vote in
1987 against confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. "Now that
was a mistake," he said to laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley said Gore was guilty of campaign distortions, Gore said he
wouldn't level that charge against his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   "I won't accuse him of that. If you want a no, I'll give you a no," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening question referred to Clinton and his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that anytime a president or public official lies, he undermines
his authority. But he offered no criticism of Gore's behavior during the
year-long impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said he thought he had served "the national interest
well" during that period, making plain his disapproval of Clinton's actions, yet
defending him against what he said was an unwarranted Republican attempt to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, despite a candidacy that boasts of time spent out of public
life, Bradley said politics is a "noble profession. I don't think it's corrupt
or deceitful ... The only way you are going to achieve something is through
politics," he said.

homosexuals in the Armed Forces.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Races Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Two semifinal races in the America's Cup
challenger series were postponed Thursday on the Hauraki Gulf due to light wind.
</P>
<P>
	Races matching AmericaOne against Nippon and Prada against Le Defi Francais
will be held Friday, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes syndicate had been given a day off Thursday
to repair its boat after a collision with Le Defi Francais on Wednesday, and was
reported to be asking the committee for another day to make the repairs.
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether Stars and Stripes will race Friday and its opponent was
expected to be made later Thursday during a meeting which will also consider
possible action against Le Defi Francais over the collision.
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes' scheduled race against America True, which should have been
sailed Thursday, was to have been staged at the end of the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes leads the semifinals with three victories to remain the only
unbeaten boat.
</P>
<P>
	Prada is under pressure to win all its remaining matches after their mast
snapped in its race against AmericaOne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	Italy's challenge now has just one victory in three races and trails three
rivals in the contest to be one of the two cup finalists vying to race Team New
Zealand in the America's Cup next month.
</P>
<P>
	Nippon and AmericaOne are tied for second with two victories each, while Prada
and America True have one point. The French have no points and their chances of
reaching the finals are fading.

<HEADLINE> S. Calif. Draws Detroit's Attention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Long recognized as a world center for auto marketing and
design trends, Southern California is again attracting Detroit's attention, this
time thanks to Hollywood's computer animation magic.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to tap into show biz expertise in sophisticated computer animation,
General Motors Corp. plans to open a new Los Angeles design studio later this
month. GM made the announcement Wednesday night during a charity event tied to
the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, which holds its media preview Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   GM's salute to Hollywood isn't the only recent acknowledgment of Southern
California's influence on the global auto industry.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 new cars will debut during the preview, a record for a
gathering long overshadowed by the prestigious North American International Auto
Show in Detroit. Last year, LA snared six debuts, including Honda's S2000
roadster.
</P>
<P>
	   And Ford Motor Co. is thinking about moving the U.S. headquarters of its
Volvo, Jaguar and Aston Martin brands from New Jersey to Southern California.
They would join Lincoln-Mercury, which moved its corporate offices to Irvine in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The increased attention reflects automakers' recognition that Southern
California, with its diverse, immigrant-laden population, provides a window to
world markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're looking for fresh perspective. They're becoming global and global
is not always viewed from the perspective of Detroit," said Thad Malesh,
director of North American forecasting at J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Southern California has long been a center for auto design. The region is
home to an estimated 20 design studios, including independent contractors and
shops operated by automakers such as Ford, Volvo, DaimlerChrysler and
Volkswagen, Mazda, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the designers working in those studios are graduates of the Art
Center College of Design in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got a pool of talent. It's becoming a kind of Silicon Valley of auto
design. There's a critical mass that maybe can't be duplicated in Detroit,"
Malesh said.
</P>
<P>
	   The GM center's 30 or so employees will include computer-assisted design
experts recruited from Hollywood animation and special effects companies, GM
spokesman Scott Fosgard said.
</P>
<P>
	   GM plans to use computer techniques such as three-dimensional imaging to
replace tedious clay modeling in the early stages of new car design. The goal is
to reduce the time needed to bring a new car to market from about four years to
two, Fosgard said.
</P>
<P>
	   During 2000, the company will unveil about a dozen concept cars -- as many
as seven could eventually go into production.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollywood, which has pioneered the use of computer graphics to create
stunning special effects in recent years, is considered ground zero for the new
technology, Fosgard said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking to tap into this pipeline. That's why we're here," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company already has a significant presence in Southern California.
General Motors operates a technical research center in Torrance and is
developing new onboard navigation and Internet systems through its Hughes
Electronics Corp. subsidiary, said David Cole, director of the University of
Michigan's auto transportation studies program
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty clear that if you're trying to stay in the forefront of design
in the world, you'd better pay attention to California," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, carmakers are planning world debuts of seven new production models
and 14 concept cars this year, shifting from Detroit in an attempt to stand out.
</P>
<P>
	   "You get a lot better bang for your buck if you spread these introductions
across the country," Cole said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lineup will include several new-generation sport utility vehicles
designed to combine the ruggedness of the SUV with car-like handling such as
Pontiac's Aztek and the Mazda Tribute.
</P>
<P>
	   In the luxury car category, Rolls Royce will unveil a pricey new model
identified by Automotive News as a new version of the Corniche convertible that
was discontinued in 1995. A Rolls Royce spokesman declined to confirm the
report, but noted that California would be a key market for such a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles show opens to the public on Saturday and continues through
Jan. 16.
