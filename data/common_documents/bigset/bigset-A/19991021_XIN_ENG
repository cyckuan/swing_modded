<HEADLINE> S.Africa Urged to Combat Money Laundering by Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Afrinkaanse
Handelsinstituut (AHI), an influential economic organization here,
 Wednesday urged South African lawmakers to combat money
laundering by legislation.
</P>
<P>
A deficiency still exists in South Africa's effective financial
 regulatory framework, namely the fact that legislation to combat
money laundering has not yet been passed, the AHI said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past few years money laundering has dramatically
increased all over the world," it warned.
</P>
<P>
The enormous progress that has been made in the field of
electronic banking also plays into the hands of unscrupulous money
launderers, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that experience in other countries indicated that it
was not only financial institutions that become the victims of
money launderers.
</P>
<P>
Countries worldwide have adapted their financial legislation to
 combating the problem, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is, to an extent, protected against money
laundering by the Prevention of Organized Crime Act.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the necessary legislation be put in place
urgently, as experience with regard to money laundering abroad
indicates that money launderers prefer countries without
legislation," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> UK to Launch Major Project to Identify Cancer Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- British Scientists said
Wednesday they were setting a major initiative aimed at
identifying the genes that cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
The Cancer Genome Project, with a fund of 10 million pounds
(11.69 million U.S. dollars) from Britain's Wellcome Trust, the
world's largest medical research charity, will try to use data
from the Human Genome Project to unlock cancer secrets.
</P>
<P>
"The data emerging from the Human Genome Project will give us
the normal blueprint against which we can then compare the DNA
sequence in cancers and so work out which genes are abnormal,"
said Professor Michael Stratton, one of the researchers leading
the project, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Stratton, from the Institute of Cancer Research sited at the
Sanger Center, England, hoped the project could enable them to
develop approaches to systematically examine the whole genome of
cancers and thus detect as many of the abnormal genes as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, identification of these genes will highlight the
weak points in cancer cells with which we can interfere and treat
the disease." he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sanger Center forms part of an international consortium
working on the Humane Genome Project which is scheduled to
complete sequence the human genetic blueprint containing
approximately 100,000 genes in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Former Nazi Collaborator Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Papon, former French Nazi
collaborator and the only surviving French citizen convicted of
crimes against humanity, is believed to have fled to Spain to
escape justice in his home country.
</P>
<P>
The French government is apparently embarrassed by the escape,
which is considered to be a slap on the face of the French
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that the government
would resort to all means necessary to catch Papon and make him
pay his dues.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 89, issued a communique from an unidentified place on
Wednesday, claiming that he would rather live in exile than
spending the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
He was condemned to 10 years in prison in April 1998 by a court
in Bordeaux for complicity in the Holocaust when he sent 1,560
Jews to Nazi death camps during his term as the secretary general
of Gironde in southwest France from 1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
The French supreme court, the Cour de Cassation, will make the
final decision on an appeal by Papon on Thursday. Observers said
the court decision will be simple and pure: Papon should serve his
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
However, Papon seemingly tried to take advantage of a dispute
between the French judicial system and the European Court of Human
Rights over whether an accused should present himself as a
prisoner on the eve of the supreme court judgement.
</P>
<P>
Papon refused to pose himself as a prisoner, citing the stand
of the European Court of Human Rights, to which he has appealed.
</P>
<P>
Along with a letter he published on Wednesday in the
Bordeaux-based newspaper Sud Ouest, in which he explained why he
refused to pose himself as a prisoner, Papon also published a
latest photo of his on the front page of the daily.
</P>
<P>
The photo showed Papon wearing summer clothes and having a
Spanish language magazine on a table by him.
</P>
<P>
The French authorities had offered Papon the exceptional
measure of letting him live in his residence in Seine-et-Marne
outside Paris as a free man pending court trials and appeals,
which has lasted two years.
</P>
<P>
Papon is believed to have quit his residence on October 11 for
the destination of his exile.
</P>
<P>
The leniency toward Papon has been severely criticized by
Jewish and civil groups of France and the Simon Wiesenthal Center
of Israel which is also known as "Nazi hunter."
</P>
<P>
Simon Wiesenthal Center has asked the International Police
organization to launch an international mandate of arrest against
Papon.
</P>
<P>
The center also said that it believes Papon is living in Spain,
as it has been informed by a source in the Basque region that he
had driven across northern Spain.

<HEADLINE> IDB Supports Clean-up of Tiete River in Sao Paulo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 200
million U.S. dollars in loan for the second stage of a massive
clean-up project to improve the environmental quality in the Tiete
River watershed that drains the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo,
the industrial heartland of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The resources will enable the Companhia de Saneamento Basico do
Estado de Sao Paulo to continue to make investments in sewer
systems, pumping stations, piping, and water treatment, as well as
continuation of the plan to reduce pollution in the Tiete River
caused by industrial waste, the Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the resources will enable the company to make
operational improvements, applying new technologies, and a
strategy for the state's sanitation sector will be developed that
is expected to provide for greater private sector investments.
</P>
<P>
An environmental education program will be launched to raise
the awareness of residents in the metropolitan area as to the need
of proper garbage disposal in the effort to clean up the Tiete
River, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDB, the first stage of the Tiete River
cleanup project, supported by 450 million dollars in IDB financing
approved in 1992, reduced organic industrial discharges by 61
percent and inorganic industrial loads by 77 percent, among other
improvements.
</P>
<P>
Stage II of the project, in addition to other benefits, is
expected to raise the amount of treated sewage in the metropolitan
area from 48 percent to 55 percent and to hook up an additional
400,000 households to the sewer system.
</P>
<P>
The IDB loan is for a 25-year term, with a three-year grace
period, at the variable annual interest rate, now 6.84 percent.
Local counterpart funds total 200 million dollars.

BAGHDAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Armenia will make efforts to
strengthen its economic and trade cooperation with Iraq, said a
visiting Armenian official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
David Honhanisyan, an Armenian foreign ministry commissioner
told reporters that Armenia will soon open a commercial
representative office in Baghdad to activate commercial and
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Armenia have not established formal diplomatic
relations yet.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian official, who arrived here Monday evening with his
delegation, said his visit to Iraq was successful and fruitful,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with Iraqi officials means of expanding
industry and economic cooperation as well as preparations for an
upcoming visit by Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Honhanisyan said that his country is exploring new markets in
Iraq through bilateral economic and trade cooperation under the
U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the humanitarian program now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to export limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under harsh U.N. economic sanctions since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Barak Vows to Evacuate Illegal Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Angered by Jewish settler
leaders' slow action in the evacuation of illegal settlements,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday that the evacuation
should be carried out as agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak's decision
regarding the evacuation of outposts will be implemented in
accordance with what was agreed," Barak's office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after militant Jewish settlers
blocked the dismantling of a settlement outpost on a hilltop near
the West Bank city of Ramallah Tuesday. Scrapping the outpost is
part of a compromise deal reached between the government and
settler leaders last week.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Yesha Council, the settler leadership
body in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, should begin Tuesday to
dismantle by themselves 10 of the 42 settlements built without
government approval last year.
</P>
<P>
But scores of young settler activists, who belong to a
newly-established movement called Dor Hemshech, or the Second
Generation, blocked the access road to Hill 804, the first
outpost slated for evacuation. A water tower was dismantled at a
nearby hilltop instead.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, about 30 activists blocked a road to an outpost
of four mobile homes near the Sussiya settlement south of the
West Bank city of Hebron to stop trucks from moving in to carry
out the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
But the trucks did not show up, and only a water tower and a
container was removed from a hilltop near the settlement of Eli
north of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Apparently unhappy with the delay, Barak said in the statement
he expected the Yesha leadership to "uphold the agreements reached
with them in their entirety."
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, minister in the prime minister's office, warned
that the army or police might have to intervene if the Yesha
Council failed to carry out the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined that those illegal settlements should be
evacuated as soon as possible...If they wouldn't do it by
themselves, then the government would do it," he told Israel
Channel One television.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regard Jewish settlement activity in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip illegal and hurdles to the peace process.
They demand that all the 144 Jewish settlements scattered in these
areas be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said, however, large blocs of settlements would not
be removed even if Israel and the Palestinians have reached a
final peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Raps Kuwait for Seizing Dhows in Its Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday accused
Kuwaiti authorities of seizing three dhows of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) with their cargoes in Iraqi territorial waters, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The three dhows, namely, Nawaf, al-Mousgy and al-Anwar were
detained by Kuwaiti authorities on October 3 when they left the
southern Iraqi harbor of Khor al-Zubair, INA quoted an unnamed
official source at the Iraqi Customs Office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Nawaf dhow was carrying 150 tons of dates, al-Mousgy
carrying 64 tons of wool and 11 tons of clover seeds while
al-Anwar was carrying some 300 tons of seeds, said the source.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Kuwait has released the UAE dhows,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Baghdad accused Kuwait of intercepting an
Indian ship carrying contracted items under the U.N. oil-for-food
program in Iraqi territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 which triggered the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Volcanoes Come to Life Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The volcano Guagua Pichincha has
registered subsurface explosions and its seismic activity
increased, said the Geophysical Institute of the National
Polytechnic School(EGEPN) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It stated that since Sunday, they have registered more than 200
seismic activities, culminating in the subsurface explosion
produced on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign technicians have arrived in Quito, and are
using aerostatical baloons to monitor the volcano, which is 10
kilometers to the east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the volcano Tungurahua continues to give signs of
its intense activity. According to the IGENP, in the last few
hours, the volcano has emitted columns of gases which reached an
altitude of over 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Tangurahua, or "Throat of Fire" in the Quecha Indian language,
has rumbled and rained ash since Tuesday, raising fears of an
eruption in the near future.
</P>
<P>
It sits 4,590 meters above sea level and is one of ecuador's 31
active volcanoes. Tungurahua has erupted 81 times in the past
3,000 years. Scientists say the volcano erupts about every 100
years.
</P>
<P>
Vulcanologists from the EGEPN believe that the present activity
of the volcano could be the lead up to a large explosion, although
they cannot give a precise date for the eruption.
</P>
<P>
Due to the "Orange" alert of the volcano Tungurahua, in the
province with the same name and 125 kilometers to the south of
Quito, over 20,000 inhabitants of nearby villages have been
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the Civil Defense have taken preventative
measures which include surveillance of the dangerous zones by
military personnel to prohibit entry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Withdraw Armed Forces From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Defense Ministry
Wednesday assured that the country's defense forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will be withdrawn once
invading forces stop fighting there.
</P>
<P>
In its latest bulletin on the DRC war, the ministry said it is
naive to expect the defense forces in the DRC to withdraw before
they consummate the political purpose that saw them there in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal needs to be well calculated and phased, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for peace in the DRC and in the Great Lakes
Region at large have never been so bright ever since Rwanda and
Uganda invaded the country on August 2, 1998, said the ministry in
the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
It said Zimbabwe remains committed to the peace agreement in
spite of the constant provocations by the invaders and their
proxies.
</P>
<P>
No matter how valid the rebels' grievances against the DRC
government might be, Zimbabwe strongly believes that armed
rebellion is not the best way of democratizing a post-colonial
African state, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The opposing forces were expected to immediately break
tactical contact and then to withdraw, as a matter of goodwill or
under supervision of the Joint Military Commission," it said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop New Explosive Detector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. researcher has developed
a laser-based detector that may act as an "electronic dog" to
sniff out single molecules of target substances, Britain's New
Scientist magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Pipino, at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology, claimed that his new device, which distinguishes
samples by analyzing the light absorbed, is about a hundred times
more sensitive than rival techniques.
</P>
<P>
As different molecules absorb different amounts of light of a
given wavelength, the new detector can analyze samples over a
range of wavelengths to get a distinctive "fingerprint" for each.
</P>
<P>
Pipino believed his system can be refined to achieve an
additional 100-fold improvement in sensitivity and might be used
in single-molecule detection.
</P>
<P>
Pipino is planning to work out a commercial prototype of the
new detector in the next two years, which he hoped would detect
the minuscule explosives emissions from landmines, offering an
alternative to more dangerous methods such as sniffer dogs.
</P>
<P>
"Next we want to go after chemical and biological weapons
detection," he told the magazine.

WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States stored
some 12,000 nuclear weapons and components in at least 15 other
countries and regions, at U.S. Pacific bases and on Navy ships
during the Cold War, a U.S. scientific journal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said in a report that
U.S. nuclear bombs and missiles were in Canada, Cuba, Iceland,
Japan, Morocco, the Philippines, Spain, South Korea, China's
Taiwan and a half dozen NATO countries at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The report by authors William Arkin, Robert Norris and
William Burr was based largely on a tightly-edited official
Pentagon history of the custody and deployment of U.S. nuclear
arms between mid-1945 and September 1977.
</P>
<P>
The authors said the United States stored 38 types of nuclear
weapons systems at American or allied bases abroad. The weapons
were stationed in some countries, including Iceland, without the
knowledge of officials there, they said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department officials declined to comment on the
article, noting that the United States traditionally refuses to
neither confirm nor deny U.S. nuclear deployments overseas.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Talks Adjourn without Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Crucial talks chaired by U.S.
mediator George Mitchell to break Northern Ireland political
impasse adjourned Wednesday with no sign of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Delegates have left the American ambassador's residence in
London where intense negotiations had been taking place. It is
reported that talks to salvage the Good Friday Agreement will
resume in Belfast on Friday and continue over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was asked by the British government to chair the
review of the N.Irish peace process in July after the pro-British
Ulster Unionists refused to form a government with Sinn Fein
because the IRA would not start decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
For seven weeks, Mitchell has been struggling to break the
impasse over disarmament which has stalled the implementation of
the Good Friday Agreement signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
This week's talks are believed to be the final session.
</P>
<P>
After intensive discussions on Monday and Tuesday between
leaders of Sinn Fein, the political arm of IRA, and the Ulster
Unionist Party, Wednesday's full plenary session, which was joined
by smaller pro-Agreement parties, failed to result in any
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Later on Wednesday, in his first appearance in parliament as
Britain's new Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Mandelson said
that Unionists had every right to require certainty from
republicans that they were committed exclusively to peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
"The key to peace is persuading republican and other
paramilitaries to engage exclusively in democratic politics and to
renounce violence now and forever." he said.
</P>
<P>
Using an interview with a British national newspaper on
Wednesday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned republican
guerrillas that Britain was prepared to act if there was any
return to violence.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a return to violence we will defend that position
against the forces of violence," Blair told The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that a "battle" is going on within the republican
movement over whether it should abandon the Northern Ireland peace
process and return to violence.
</P>
<P>
But he said he believed leaders of the IRA's political ally,
Sinn Fein, were sincere in wanting progress towards lasting peace
in the province.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Part in Sub-Regional Drug Control Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China has actively taken
part in U.N. initiated sub-regional drug control program, a
Chinese delegate told a U.N. session on international drug control
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It has also engaged in substitute crop development in the
traditionally opium-planting areas in the so-called Golden
Triangle linking Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, said Li Sangu, the
Chinese delegate to the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has given a boost to the social and economic
development in the border areas and effectively reduced the areas'
dependence on the drug economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that drug consumer, producer and transit countries
should all shoulder their respective responsibilities and the
international cooperation in this field should be based on full
respect for sovereignty without interfering into internal affairs
of other countries on the excuse of drug control.
</P>
<P>
She said China has made more efforts in drug control since the
U.N. Special Session on the subject last year, with the formation
of a new national committee for drug control and the establishment
of the China Anti-drug Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the International Narcotic Control Board, China
has succeeded in frustrating several cases of chemical precursor
smuggling, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Government is preparing for the creation of "Drug-Free
Communities" and will devote more human and financial resources to
the anti-drug campaign, Li added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright Wednesday praised Nigeria's ongoing
reforms and pledged U.S. support for the country's newly restored
civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
"President (Olusegun) Obasanjo has already done much to restore
Nigeria' s democratic institutions," Albright said in a speech at
the headquarters of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) in Nigeria's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
She said Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, was quickly
becoming a regional powerhouse and "signpost for others in search
of freedom" .
</P>
<P>
"The steps still to come include the repeal of the last
repressive laws, the return of Nigeria's judiciary to its former
renown and the consolidation of civilian control of the military.
These are the long-term changes which will ensure that, this time,
democracy has come to stay," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated that she would persuade the U.S. Congress
to triple or quadruple the amount of U.S. aid to Nigeria, which
stands at about 27 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
On regional security issues, she said the U.S. will vote this
week for the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping force in
Sierra Leone "to help relieve the burden you have carried so
long". Nigeria-led west African intervention force have toppled
the military junta and restored Sierra Leone's elected president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy's Mission to Cyprus Not Resultful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Presidential emissary
Alfred Moses obviously has not managed to achieve the expected
result in his mission to Cyprus, said a Cyprus government
spokesman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Michalis Papapetrou said that at the end of meetings Moses had
on the island, the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash still
insists on his unacceptable conditions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Moses arrived here Monday night for talks with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in a bid to get the two sides to the negotiating table in
search of a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Moses arrived in Cyprus from Athens where he had talks with
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou. Prior to that, he was in
Ankara to meet Turkish government officials.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon and on Wednesday, Moses met Clerides
twice and had discussions with Denktash three times.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side said it is ready to participate in
talks based on U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Denktash reiterated his firm view that talks can only take
place once his breakaway state in northern Cyprus is recognized
as a separate state.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the U.N. chief Kofi Annan should call peace
talks and if the Turkish side refuses to participate it should
bear the blame.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of the U.S. envoy
returning to Cyprus sometime soon.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia-Israel Ties Normalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali Wednesday conditioned his country's
normalization of ties with Israel on the progress in the Middle
East peace progress.
</P>
<P>
"We have reiterated our stance on several occasions on the
normalization with Israel, which is linked with the progress of
Israeli peace talks with Arab countries," the president said in an
exclusive interview with Lebanon's prominent magazine Al Hawadis.
</P>
<P>
He said this principle complies with Tunisia's longstanding
policy to support the peace progress and encourage Israel to make
steps forward in the implementation of signed agreements with
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia and Israel announced to establish low-level ties in
1996, but Tunisia never followed through with the move under the
pressure from other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Ali stressed that Tunisia will support every effort to achieve
a fair, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region on the
formula of land-for-peace and the return of all occupied Arab
lands captured by Israel during the past Mideast wars.
</P>
<P>
The president called on international community to urge Israel
to abide by all international laws.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his support for Lebanese government's efforts to
restore its lost land and exercise power on all its territory.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been demanding Israel to implement the United
Nations Resolution 425, which calls for unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel conditioned the pullout on an advanced agreement with
the Lebanese government in order to provide guarantee for the
security of its north and its allied South Lebanon Army after the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the Israeli demand and asked it to withdraw
without any conditions.

WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Former President of U.S. Red

"The bottom line is money," she said. "It would be futile to
continue," Dole, who had hoped to make history as the nation's

Her departure leaves front-runner George W. Bush, Arizona
Senator John McCain and conservative millionaire Steve Forbes in

candidate to drop out this year.

Four other candidates are also vying for conservative voters,
including Pat Buchanan, who is planning to leave the Republican
Party to seek the Reform Party nomination.

CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China is satisfied with the close
cooperation with Egypt since the two countries established
diplomatic ties 43 years ago, a visiting Chinese parliamentary

</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab and African country to set up
diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, said Tian
Jiyun, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The joint efforts exerted by the two countries have

</P>
<P>
Tian spoke highly of Egypt's adherence to the "One China" policy
and its stance not to forge official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sorour expressed appreciation for the Egyptian-Chinese friendly
ties, saying that Egypt pays tribute to the great achievements
made by the Chinese people in all fields.
</P>

The Egyptian government attaches great importance to the
friendly ties with China and hopes that they will be further

<HEADLINE> Over 5600 Multinational Troops Deployed in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The buildup of the
international force in East Timor (INTERFET) will continue through
the end of October, with an aim to reach 7500 personnel, according
to a report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bi-weekly report covering the period from September 29 to
October 12 was distributed by the U.N. Security Council after it
was presented to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by Australia's
Permanent Representative to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The Australia-led INTERFET now numbering 5,650 troops, has been
composed of contingents of a dozen countries, with more forces
from Canada, Germany, Ireland and South Korea to be in East Timor
in coming weeks, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With the presence of INTERFET, residents in East Timor's
capital of Dili have increased their sense of safety despite the
"very poor state" of the infrastructure, the report continued.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 64,000 displaced persons have returned to the
capital and the market there reopened on October 12.
</P>
<P>
Half of the territory's 800,000 inhabitants were reported to
have fled their homes after the August 30 referendum which turned
to be in favor of independence.
</P>
<P>
The chaos led to the dispatch of the INTERFET beginning
September 20, with a mandate by the Security Council to restore
peace and security in East Timor. Its lifespan is limited to a
takeover "as soon as possible" by a U.N. peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
The report said INTERFET forces have exchanged fire with local
armed militia groups on four occasions since its deployment began
close to West Timor. On one occasion, 116 militia were detained
and a number of weapons confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The report reiterated its call for urgent U.N. steps to address
the absence of effective civil administration in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed a two-to-three year
U.N. transitional authority in East Timor (UNTAET), which includes
a peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
The transitional body is expected to help rebuild the
infrastructure and set up new civil institutions.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the People's Consultative Assembly of Indonesia
declared void the 1978 decree integrating East Timor into
Indonesia, further paving the way for East Timor's transition to
independence.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the move, Annan said the U.N. secretariat has
initiated a number of preliminary steps to ensure the prompt
establishment of UNTAET.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Borrow 552 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
have borrowed more than 21 billion Zimbabwean dollars (552
million U.S. dollars) by the end of the year against a targeted
budget deficit of 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars (263 million U.S.
dollars), Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in Parliament, the minister said the high
interest and inflation rates, at more than 55 percent and 70
percent respectively and resulting from the devaluation of the
Zimbabwean dollar, had increased the costs of imports.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry and the World Bank were discussing the
possibility of transferring the domestic debt which, at 51
billion Zimbabwean dollars (1.34 billion U.S. dollars), was very
high to external financing through concessionary funds.
</P>
<P>
This would reduce stocks of domestic debt and the impact of
interest payments, he said.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Wednesday urged his people to buy Kenyan-made goods in a bid
to protect and boost Kenya's weak economy.
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism to our country should move us to take pride in and
buy what is our own, " he said at this year's celebrations of
Kenyatta Day, which reminds Kenyans of hard struggle in winning
independence from the British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"Preference for goods from outside will only build the
economies of other people. We must buy Kenyan-made goods, so that
we can build our economy and our country," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Moi told the gathering that his government would continue to
monitor all imports and ensure that Kenya will not become a
dumping ground for cheap and sub-standard imports.
</P>
<P>
"However, local manufactures should also realize that the
business environment is fast changing," the head of state noted.
</P>
<P>
"Quality and competitiveness are the new catchwords in the
modern business environment. Local manufactures should ensure
production of high quality products at competitive prices," Moi

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
have borrowed more than 21 billion Zimbabwean dollars (552
million U.S. dollars) by the end of the year against a targeted
budget deficit of 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars (263 million U.S.
dollars), Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in Parliament, the minister said the high
interest and inflation rates, at more than 55 percent and 70
percent respectively and resulting from the devaluation of the
Zimbabwean dollar, had increased the costs of imports.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry and the World Bank were discussing the
possibility of transferring the domestic debt which, at 51
billion Zimbabwean dollars (1.34 billion U.S. dollars), was very
high to external financing through concessionary funds.
</P>
<P>
This would reduce stocks of domestic debt and the impact of
interest payments, he said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Troops Conquer Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops have
captured both political and military headquarters of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in a
month-long offensive, an official communique announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bailundo and Andulo, where the UNITA political and military
headquarters were respectively located, have been under control of
UNITA he armed forces of
Angola, the police and the civilian defense forces, launched an
attack named "mission of sovereignty" in mid-September and
"conquered parts of the territory illegally occupied by the
military forces of Jonas Savimbi", the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The government troops have seized a lot of UNITA strongholds in
Angola's central plateau during the all-out offensive, including
Andulo and Kalussinga in Bie Province, Bailundo and Lunduimbale in
Huambo Province, Kalandula in Malanje Province, Luacano, Luau and
Lumbala-guimbo in Moxico Province, and Mussende in Kwanza-sul
Province.
</P>
<P>
There is no report of the whereabout of the UNITA leaders and
the militants.
</P>
<P>
UNITA was established in March 1966 to fight against the
Portuguese colonial rule. Then 32-year-old Jonas Savimbi, who
obtained the doctorate in politics in Switzerland in 1965, became
leader of the organization.
</P>
<P>
After the country's independence in 1975, the People's
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), the current ruling party,
UNITA and the Angolan National Liberation Front (FNLA) formed an
interim government, which was dissolved soon after the burst of
the civil war among the three main parties.
</P>
<P>
After being driven out of the cities by MPLA, UNITA forces
scattered to the rural areas and conducted guerrilla war against
the government of MPLA.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
signed in Lisbon the Bicesse Accord, which suggested a multi-party
general election in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
But UNITA quit and refused to accept the result of the 1992
elections when MPLA led in the poll, accusing MPLA of being
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Angolan government and UNITA signed the Lusaka
Protocol in the capital of Zambia. But the peace agreement
collapsed in late1998 when the civil conflicts resumed.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Turkey Urged to Reduce Arms Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nikos Constantopoulos, president
of Greece's Coalition of the Left, Wednesday called on both Greece
and Turkey to cut their arms spending.
</P>
<P>
Constantopoulos made the appeal in Athens while he was
addressing a meeting entitled "Greece-Turkey, commencement of
dialogue on a proportional, balanced reduction of armaments and
armed forces."
</P>
<P>
The time had come for the two neighboring countries to agree to
curtail arms spending and take a mutual step towards peace, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The party leader presented a "framework agreement" which could
constitute the basis for a bilateral accord for the reduction of
armaments.
</P>
<P>
His proposals include a reciprocal, sharp, balanced and
immediate reduction of armaments spending, the mutual proportional
and substantial reduction of the two countries' armed forces and
avoiding activities and actions which both countries consider to
be provocations.
</P>
<P>
Constantopoulos said that when the two neighboring countries
had such enormous need in vital sectors such as infrastructure and
urgently needed to implement economic, social and environmental
development programs, it was utterly absurd to spend huge amounts,
among the highest in the world in relation to gross domestic
product (GDP), on the military.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said Wednesday that Athens' belief in reducing armaments
was a matter of principle, for it contributed to development and
social justice.
</P>
<P>
He urged Turkey to demilitarize Cyprus and thus contribute to
the reduction of armaments.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Search Netanyahu Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEMhu here as part of an investigation into alleged
fraud charges, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The police conducted the four-and-half-hour search after
receiving a tip-off that Netanyahu might have been illegally
keeping gifts he received he search, the radio said. These
gifts should have been returned to the state after Netanyahu left
office.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's wife, Sara, was questioned in the police station
in Jerusalem after the search, Israeli television said.
</P>
<P>
The search was part of the ongoing investigation over
allegations that Netanyahu billed the government for private house
services carried out by contractor Avner Amadi in the three years
of Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported that Amadi conducted a
string of services for Netanyahu and then presented a bill worth
104,000 U.S. dollars to the prime minister's office only after
Netanyahu lost the election in May.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Amadi helped polish floors and repair
electricity utilities in Netanyahu's private home in addition to
moving furniture between his private and official residence.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Sara have been questioned by the fraud
police but no charges have been brought against them.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was almost forced from office in early 1997 when he
was involved in a political scandal. Police recommended then that
he be charged with fraud and breach of trust in an alleged
attempt to influence a corruption investigation of Aryeh Deri,
then chairman of the powerful religious party Shas.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors finally dropped that case citing
insufficient evidence.

This was stated on Wednesday by the Afrikaanse Handels

present upward pressure in the gold price," the AHI said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty with regard to the potential influence of the
y2k-factor will push up the gold price," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Investors could have doubts about the effect that the turn of
the century could have on their existing investments. If the
possibility of computer chaos indeed takes place at the turn of
the century, it could make sense to convert part of existing
portfolios into some real assets," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also named other factors that could favor the
strengthening of the gold price and make the prospects for
marginal mines brighter.
</P>
<P>
"The moratorium placed on gold sales by a group of
international banks clearly affected the gold price positively,
and this influence could also have a positive effect in the longer
term," it said.
</P>
<P>
Another factor, it noted, is the role globalization will play
in the financial sector. In the process of globalization, factors
such as time, space and distance are fading. This means that
prices -- also commodity prices -- are much more fickle in the
short term, and expectations are discounted much more rapidly in
the markets.
</P>
<P>
"The gold price could therefore also move upward quickly,
should warning lights start flickering in the financial markets.
It is widely expected for example that a correction of the
American stock exchange must take place sometime, and this
uncertainty in the U.S. economy possibly also strengthened
confidence in gold," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is because of these reasons that confidence in the metal
could continue even into the new year. It indicates an
entrenchment against uncertainties of the future. It is in this
regard that gold over many years, played an important stabilizing
role in the monetary markets of the world," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Up 10.4 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
registered 10.4 percent rise year-on-year in September 1999, the
fifth consecutive expansion since its gyration from negative to
positive growth five months ago, Singapore Trade Development Board
announced in a press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase brought the total trade value in September to
34.07 billion Singapore dollars (20.28 billion U.S. dollars) from
32.47 billion Singapore dollars (19.33 billion U.s. dollars) in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same period of last year, the Non-oil domestic
exports (NODX) rose by 9.0 percent in September, while the non-oil
re-exports registered a milder decline of 0.8 percent and non-oil
imports continued to post a hefty growth of 14.2 percent growth in
the month.
</P>
<P>
The NODX increase was underpinned by the strong growth of 17.3
percent in non-electronics and 19.8 percent in integrated circuits
(IC) as well as 25.2 percent in the telecommunication equipment.
However the strong growth was offset by the weakness in exports of
disk drives and printed circuit boards and assembled PCBAs with
disk drives dipping by 6.1 percent in the month due to the
downward pressure of prices resulting from keen competition in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The growth in non-electronic products continued to come from
domestic exports of pharmaceuticals and intermediate compounds to
the EU and disc media products to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The growth in non-oil imports came mainly from strong increase
in imports of ICs, parts of semiconductors, capacitors, printed
circuits, cellular phones and radio phones.
</P>
<P>
NODX to all top five markets, via U.S., EU, Malaysia, Japan and
Hong Kong, registered positive growth during the months. In
particular, domestic exports to Hong Kong turned positive after 16
month of consecutive declines.
</P>
<P>
NODX to the emerging markets continued to record a moderate
growth of 4.3 percent in the month, with domestic exports to Latin
America and India growing strongly and that to China inching up in
a slower growth.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges U.S. to Implement 1994 Nuclear Framework Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Wednesday urged the United States to
implement as soon as possible and in earnest a bilateral nuclear
framework agreement they signed in 1994 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Marking the fifth anniversary of the signing of the accord, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman in a statement criticized Washington
for having taken an "insincere" approach towards the accord, which
"serves as a fundamental groundwork for the development of
relations between the DPRK and the U.S."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. has only paid "lip service" to its promised
construction of a 2,000 megawatt light-water reactor nuclear power
plant.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also failed to deliver on time the 500,000 tons of
heavy oil it agreed to offer the DPRK each year as substitute
energy until the nuclear power plant project is completed before
2003.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. failure to fulfill its commitment has brought about
difficulties to the DPRK's economy, he noted, adding that the U.S.
now said it could not complete the nuclear power plant project as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has done all it need do to improve bilateral relations
in line with the framework accord. Now it is time for the U.S. to
take concrete steps in carrying out what was agreed upon, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Wahid Elected Indonesia's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday congratulated Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid to be
elected Indonesia's president.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, a moderate Islamic leader, was elected president by
the People's Consultative Committee after B.J. Habibie was
rebuffed with a no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the election was
conducted "fairly, openly and transparently," and said the
United States was looking forward to working with the new
president.
</P>
<P>
"We congratulate Wahid on his election. I think the people of
Indonesia deserve an enormous amount of credit for this peaceful
change of government," Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said that Wahid is "someone the United States
can work with."
</P>
<P>
Roth said, however, a vice president has not been selected
and that the public reaction to the change in government was
still to be received.
</P>
<P>
"The next 24 hours are quite critical," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Buying Local Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Wednesday urged his people to buy Kenyan-made goods in a bid
to protect and boost Kenya's weak economy.
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism to our country should move us to take pride in and
buy what is our own, " he said at this year's celebrations of
Kenyatta Day, which reminds Kenyans of hard struggle in winning
independence from the British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"Preference for goods from outside will only build the
economies of other people. We must buy Kenyan-made goods, so that
we can build our economy and our country," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Moi told the gathering that his government would continue to
monitor all imports and ensure that Kenya will not become a
dumping ground for cheap and sub-standard imports.
</P>
<P>
"However, local manufactures should also realize that the
business environment is fast changing," the head of state noted.
</P>
<P>
"Quality and competitiveness are the new catchwords in the
modern business environment. Local manufactures should ensure
production of high quality products at competitive prices," Moi
said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Troops Conquer Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops have
captured both political and military headquarters of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in a
month-long offensive, an official communique announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bailundo and Andulo, where the UNITA political and military
headquarters were respectively located, have been under control of
UNITA since the civil war broke out in 1975 soon after Angola's
independence from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The government troops, consisting of the armed forces of
Angola, the police and the civilian defense forces, launched an
attack named "mission of sovereignty" in mid-September and
"conquered parts of the territory illegally occupied by the
military forces of Jonas Savimbi", the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The government troops have seized a lot of UNITA strongholds in
Angola's central plateau during the all-out offensive, including
Andulo and Kalussinga in Bie Province, Bailundo and Lunduimbale in
Huambo Province, Kalandula in Malanje Province, Luacano, Luau and
Lumbala-guimbo in Moxico Province, and Mussende in Kwanza-sul
Province.
</P>
<P>
There is no report of the whereabout of the UNITA leaders and
the militants.
</P>
<P>
UNITA was established in March 1966 to fight against the
Portuguese colonial rule. Then 32-year-old Jonas Savimbi, who
obtained the doctorate in politics in Switzerland in 1965, became
leader of the organization.
</P>
<P>
After the country's independence in 1975, the People's
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), the current ruling party,
UNITA and the Angolan National Liberation Front (FNLA) formed an
interim government, which was dissolved soon after the burst of
the civil war among the three main parties.
</P>
<P>
After being driven out of the cities by MPLA, UNITA forces
scattered to the rural areas and conducted guerrilla war against
the government of MPLA.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
signed in Lisbon the Bicesse Accord, which suggested a multi-party
general election in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
But UNITA quit and refused to accept the result of the 1992
elections when MPLA led in the poll, accusing MPLA of being
fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Angolan government and UNITA signed the Lusaka
Protocol in the capital of Zambia. But the peace agreement
collapsed in late1998 when the civil conflicts resumed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Borrow 552 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
have borrowed more than 21 billion Zimbabwean dollars (552
million U.S. dollars) by the end of the year against a targeted
budget deficit of 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars (263 million U.S.
dollars), Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in Parliament, the minister said the high
interest and inflation rates, at more than 55 percent and 70
percent respectively and resulting from the devaluation of the
Zimbabwean dollar, had increased the costs of imports.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry and the World Bank were discussing the
possibility of transferring the domestic debt which, at 51
billion Zimbabwean dollars (1.34 billion U.S. dollars), was very
high to external financing through concessionary funds.
</P>
<P>
This would reduce stocks of domestic debt and the impact of
interest payments, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the export sector had not performed well despite the
re- introduction of export incentives. This, he said, was a
result of the high cost of money.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on whether the ministry was taking any
steps to limit luxury imports like some food stuffs to reduce
pressure on the currency, he said the market solution was to
change the tariff set-up.
</P>
<P>
"There is a commission looking into these tariffs. If you say
certain goods are prejudicing Zimbabwean products, they should
increase or decrease the tariffs as necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that Zimbabwe traded with other countries which
could also prohibit the entry of Zimbabwean goods.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe held preferential trade discussions with South Africa
which Murerwa believed would translate into an opening up of the
South African markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the Southern African Development Community trade
protocol had been concluded and would come into effect in January
2000, pointing to a future where it would be unnecessary to enter
into trade wars with neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Meets Chinese Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Great changes have taken
place in recent years in China and China will definitely play a
more important role in world affairs in the days to come, said
Israeli President Ezer Weizman here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian at
his residence, Weizman also said that the Chinese government is
managing to run the country toward modernization and has made
remarkable achievements in all aspects, including the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
China is a great and important country in the world now, and it
will contribute a great deal to maintaining world peace and
stability in the next century, he added.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to China last April, Weizman said his
meetings with the Chinese state and government leaders were very
fruitful, which laid a solid foundation for further strengthening
the Israeli-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Chinese guest on the developments in the Middle
East peace process, Weizman said that during the last 50 years,
Israel had spent many years fighting wars with its neighbors, but
Middle East peace process has really been moved forward in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Israel has already signed peace treaties with Egypt and
Jordan, and peace talks are going on with the Palestinians, he
said, adding that one day Israel will definitely restart peace
negotiations with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also hoped China to play a more active role in helping
solve the Middle East problems.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a state councillor and vice-chairman of the Central
Military Commission, said China strongly supports and Middle East
peace process and hopes that the parties concerned will resolve
their differences through peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the U.N. Security Council, China will, as
always, continue to make efforts in realizing a comprehensive,
just and lasting peace in the Middle East, together with the
international community," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-Israeli relations have been developing
smoothly and the armies of the two countries also engaged in
friendly exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He believed that with joint efforts, the cooperation between
the two sides will be further strengthened in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chi arrived here Tuesday from Syria for a four-day visit. He
will also visit Jordan and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> UAE Urges U.S. to Help in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Wednesday urged the United States to use its influence to
push forward the Middle East peace process so that security and
stability could prevail in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ways should be found to overcome the difficulties hindering
talks between the Palestinians and Israel to reach a final
solution in accordance with agreements concluded between the two
sides, said Sheikh Muhammad Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai Crown
Prince and UAE Defense Minister in a meeting with visiting
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
As a major sponsor of the peace process, the U.S. can exercise
its influence to achieve a tangible progress in building
confidence and peace in the Middle East, Sheikh Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed with Cohen ways to enhance relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Dubai Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day,
he met with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan and
his eldest son in the capital Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are close to concluding a deal on UAE's
buying of 80 U.S. F-16 war planes, a deal worth more than 7
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is the fourth leg of Cohen's Middle East tour which has
taken him to Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. He is expected to
leave for Cairo on Thursday morning for a visit to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commander Explains Military Aid to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military
help is focussed on the fight against drugs, not rebels, the top
U.S. commander in Latin America was quoted on Wednesday here on
the local radio.
</P>
<P>
U.S. South Command chief Gen. Charles Wilhelm made the
statement here on Tuesday in the midst of criticism from the
Colombian congress. He is to leave the country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. policy has been very direct, and there has been no
ambiguity. Our focus has been uniquely aimed at the fight against
drugs", said Wilhelm to reporters at a military camp, after
meeting with military chiefs.
</P>
<P>
"The insurgency, on the other hand, we consider as an internal
problem of Colombia, which must be resolved by the authorities and
Armed Forces of Colombia", said the U.S. commander.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.S. commander said that the anti-drug
intelligency center only has equipment, training and technological
assessment by U.S. personnel, but that it is not run by United
States.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a U.S. operation. The intelligence organization is
purely Colombian", he added.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez explained that
when there is mention of a "joint center", this is due to the fact
that there are units from the military, navy and police force, "in
a coordinated action using the different forces, including the
police, in the fight against drugs".
</P>
<P>
The center will be in Colombia's Tres Esquinas (three corners)
air base, in the Caqueta department.
</P>
<P>
This year Colombia has received close to 300 million dollars
from United States, the majority being received by the police
force, making Colombia the third highest receiver of U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian military has requested Washington to provide 500
million dollars over the next few months.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves Largest Financing Operation Ever for Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 800
million U.S. dollars in financing to strengthen the autonomy and
administrative and management capacity of state and municipal
governments in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The financing, the largest ever for a single operation by the
IDB in Mexico, will support national policy reforms to improve
administration and local government capacity in two areas: the
system for transferring federal funds to state and municipal
governments, and the credit market that provides financing for
local public investments.
</P>
<P>
The IDB resources will support the introduction of a newly
introduced budgeting mechanism that will strengthen the autonomy
of local governments and provide them with greater resources. The
regulatory framework will be modernized to establish a more
transparent and reliable system of guarantees for the federal
revenue-sharing program.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes a line of credit, to be administered
by Banobras, to support investments by states and municipalities
and to encourage local governments to adopt sound financial
management practices.
</P>
<P>
Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos, SNC, (Banobras)
the public source of credit for local governments, will be
modernized and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is 1.2 billion dollars. Local
counterpart funds total 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IDB will support the policy reform component of the program
with a fast-disbursing loan of 400 million dollars, which has a
15-year term and a five-year grace period. In addition, the bank
will provide a 400-million-dollar line of credit, with a 25-year
term and a four-year grace period, to support the investment
operations that will assist municipalities and states in carrying
out the program.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's variable interest rate, now 6.84 percent, will apply
to both loans.

<HEADLINE> Annan's Letter to Libya Summarizes Accords on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. spokesman said
Wednesday that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently wrote a
letter to Libya, and the letter had an annex which summarized
agreements reached with the Libyan Government on the issue of the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, made the statement in
response to a question about reports that three U.S. lawmakers in
Washington D.C. were demanding copies of the letter.
</P>
<P>
The annex summarized agreements reached with the Libyan
Government clarifying certain aspects of the details of the
hand-over of the suspects that had been negotiated by the South
African and Saudi envoys, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was a need to put on paper precisely what was agreed,
and that was primarily for the Americans and the British, who were
shown that letter," Eckhard said, adding that consultations had
been held with both governments on what had been acceptable to
them.
</P>
<P>
"So it was a condition of what everyone agreed -- the Libyans,
the Americans and the British -- which was then sent off as an
annex to this letter," he said. "There was nothing mysterious or
secret about the letter, but there was the matter of
confidentiality of correspondence."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that he would check on the letter's exact
status.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. senators have sought assurances from U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright that no promises had been made to
shield Libyan leaders from complicity during the Lockerbie bombing
trial, according to their release on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan's letter was among the last documents given to Libya
before Tripoli last April handed over fro trial before a Scottish
Court in the Netherlands two suspects accused of planting a bomb
on the American airliner that blew up over Lockerbie. A total of
270 people were killed in the December 1988 air disaster.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Denies Charges in McDonnel Douglas-CATIC Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Company Wednesday
categorically denied the charges brought by the U.S. Attorney's
Office that McDonnel Douglas Corp. conspired to violate U.S.
export laws in the sale of aerospace equipment to a Chinese
company.
</P>
<P>
"McDonnel Douglas does not believe that anybody commited any
criminal violations. These charges are not true from Mcdonnel
Douglas' standpoint," Boeing's spokesman Larry McCracken told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
McCracken said that the McDonnel Douglas Corporation, a
subsidiary of the Boeing Co., would go to court and vigorously
defend against the charges. "we plan to successfully defend
ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the prosecutors have apparently not
taken the time to learn the facts and gain a full understanding of
a rather complicated matter," a statement issued by the Boeing Co.
said.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing spokesman said he does not believe that this case
would affect America-China relations and the two companies'
cooperation with Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"I'm always very optimistic about the future relations between
the two countries," McCracken said, adding that Both McDonnel
Douglas and Boeing would continue their cooperation with China in
the future.
</P>
<P>
McDonnel Douglas Corp., after obtaining the requisite export
licenses from the U.S. government, sold certain equipment
including some machine tools to China Aero-Technology Import and
Export Corporation (CATIC) in 1994, according to the Boeing
statement.
</P>
<P>
A Federal grand jury Tuesday indicted the McDonnel Douglas
Corp. on charges of conspiracy, false statements and
misrepresentations in the 5.4 million dollars deal. The
indictment also contained 12 charges against the CATIC, alleging
that the buyer intended to divert the equipment to a military
plant.
</P>
<P>
CATIC also denied any wrongdoings in the deal. The Washington
Post quoted Barbara Van Gelder, a Washington attorney representing
CATIC, as saying that the indictment misrepresented an innocent
commercial transaction.
</P>
<P>
"The government's position that this is a criminal or national
security case is absurd... CATIC has never intentionally violated
U.S. laws, as will be proven at trial." Barbara said.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- One man and three
girls were drowned Wednesday after a river in Colombia's eastern
province of Caldas broke its banks, said local authorities.

<P>
Firemen rescued the bodies of the victims from the waters of

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombian government
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) will resume
peace talks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have agreed to peace talks in the locality of
La Uribe, in the province of Meta. There will be no logistical
deployment or publicity, as there was in the January 7 peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks will not count on the participation of either
Colombian president Andres Pastrana, or the FARC leader, Manuel
Marulanda Velez. The FARC are the largest rebel group in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks will be begun by Fabio Valencia Cossio, Juan
Gomez, Gonzalo Forero and the High Commissioner for Peace, Victor
G. Ricardo, on behalf of the government, and Joaquin Gomez, Raul
Reyes and Fabian Ramirez, on behalf of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government representatives will be coordinated by Interior
Minister Nestor Humberto Martinez and Director of Planning
Mauricio Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, Latin America's largest surviving 1960s rebel army,
fiercely opposed the creation of a so-called international
verification commission and suspended talks indefinitely in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
President Andres Patrana in mid-September backed down on
previous demands that an international monitoring team should
oversee the talks aimed at ending the country's long-running war
that has claimed more than 35,000 lives in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Election of Wahid as Indonesian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday welcomed Indonesia's selection of Muslim leader
Abdurrahman Wahid as its president and the endorsement of East
Timor's independence.
</P>
<P>
"The events of the last two days should give us all hope that a
very great country that the world needs very much is on the way
back, and that's what I'm hoping will happen," Clinton told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
He called the selection of Wahid and the decision of East
Timor's independence "a very hopeful development for the world."
But he said there are still a lot of hurdles for Indonesia to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the election
was conducted "fairly, openly and transparently," and said the
United States was looking forward to working with the new
president.
</P>
<P>
"We congratulate Wahid on his election. I think the people of
Indonesia deserve an enormous amount of credit for this peaceful
change of government," Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for Asian and
Pacific affairs, said that Wahid was "someone the United States
can work with."
</P>
<P>
Roth said, however, a vice president had not been selected and
that the public reaction to the change in government was still to
be received.
</P>
<P>
"The next 24 hours are quite critical," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Businesses Urged to Prepare for Changing Trade System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai businesses should better
prepare themselves for changing world trade system in the new
millennium when electronic commerce (e-commerce) and freer trade
practices will be pursued, Minister to the Prime Minister's Office
Abhisit Vejajiva said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abhisit said that prospects and trends of world trade in the
next century would be inevitably influenced by liberalization
rules and practices, resulting from a new round of multilateral
trade talks of the World Trade Organization (WTO) next month.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when giving a special lecture entitled
"Preparation for the Year 2000" organized here Thursday to
commemorate the National Marketing Day.
</P>
<P>
The new trends and prospects would force business firms, be
them large, medium or small-sized, to adjust themselves to comply
with the new world standard, he warned.
</P>
<P>
As for Thailand, the minister said, not only private firms but
also the public sector needed to adjust and keep pace with the
changing situation as the country was obliged to comply with both
regional and global trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
Thai firms should also keep pace with the development of
rapidly expanding e-commerce and find out marketing strategies to
make best use of the new trade practice, aimed at enhancing and
strengthening competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Political, educational and social welfare systems should also
be adjusted and improved to cope with the changing situation, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Lauds Conservatives' Contribution to Sino-British Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Thursday expressed appreciation of the long-time
contribution made by Britain's opposition Conservatives to the
promotion of Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Monday for a five-day state visit, met
with Conservative Party leader William Hague on Thursday, saying
the Conservative Party, in power or not, has for a long time
contributed to promoting relations between Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Jiang mentioned the Joint Declaration on the
Question of Hong Kong, which was signed when the conservatives
were in power, and described it as a milestone in the history of
Sino-British relations, as well as a good example for handling
historical problems between countries through peaceful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, held in Buckingham Palace where President
Jiang is staying, Hague warmly welcomed Jiang's visit and
expressed his pleasure over the continuous development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the Conservatives are now in opposition, its position
in favor of better ties with China shows no difference to that of
the Labor Party government, Hague said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday morning, President Jiang met Charles Kennedy,
leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, and answered
his questions about China's domestic situation and bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he hoped that the Liberal Democrats would play a
positive role in further developing relations between China and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President later held talks with members of the All
Party China Group in the parliament, praising the group members
for their sustained efforts in promoting Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
Ben Chapman, chairman of the All Party China Group, told Jiang
that the group consists of 150 members of parliament from all the
parties in the House of Commons and is the second largest group in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Hong Kong, Jiang said that Sino-British relations
have enjoyed good momentum of development since Honk Kong's hand-
over.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang voiced confidence in an inspiring prospect of
bilateral cooperation, saying China will cooperate with Britain in
all fields to make the mutually beneficial cooperation more
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen attended all the three
meetings.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Defend ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday introduced
a draft resolution to the First Committee of the 54th General
Assembly session, saying the draft, which is "not of a
confrontational nature, "is aimed to win the broadest international
support for the effort in the preservation of and compliance with
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM).
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Antonov, Russia's deputy representative in the First
Committee, told the plenary meeting of the Committee that China
and Belrus had decided to join Russia in co-sponsoring the draft
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"First, the draft is not of a confrontational nature, it is
based on the language of the Treaty itself and joint statement of
the Presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States on
the topic," Antonov said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not targeted against any country and does not infringe
upon anybody's interests," he said. "It has a clearly declared and
unambiguously constructive objective -- to guarantee the
preservation and strengthening of the ABM Treaty through its
strict and full-scale compliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, "it would be a delusion to consider the problem of
preservation and strict compliance with the ABM Treaty as a purely
bilateral affair, and that nobody besides the Parties to the
Treaty should interfere therein," he said.
</P>
<P>
For already more than a quarter of a century, the ABM Treaty
has been a cornerstone of strategic stability and international
security, providing conditions for the process of nuclear arms
reduction.
</P>
<P>
"It is the ABM Treaty that created fundamental strategic
prerequisites for the conclusion of a number of treaties: the INF
Treaty, START I and START II, and nuclear disarmament, that had
been an abstract idea before, acquired the status of one of the
priority practical objectives of international community," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, "Undermining or liquidation of the ABM Treaty would
make both, the fulfillment of the START I and START II, as well as
continuation of the process of strategic offensive weapons
reduction impossible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More than that, the whole system of international agreements
in the sphere of arms control would collapse," he said. "The
regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and means of
their delivery would be undermined."
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, "our draft resolution follows the mainstream of
agreements" between the Presidents of Russia and the United States
reached in Cologne in June 1999, regarding strategic offensive and
defensive weapons and further strengthening of stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, "it's a false notion that the Russian Party is ready
to discuss review of the ABM Treaty, much less its core provision
-- Article 1 -- according to which the Parties undertake not to
deploy AMB systems for a defense of the territory of their
countries and not to provide a base for such a defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We, of course, do not request the General Assembly to give any
instructions to the Russian Federation or the United States as to
the current dialogue between them," he said. "Both we and our
co-sponsors only wish that the General Assembly would confirm
the importance of preserving and strengthening the ABM Treaty
through its strict and full compliance," he added.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, foreign ministers of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, following a meeting with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, issued a joint statement, which
"called for continued efforts to strengthen the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty and to preserve its integrity and validity, so that
it remains a cornerstone in maintaining global strategic stability
and world peace and promoting further strategic nuclear arms
reductions."

OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd

<P>
The Canadian embassy, however, "will not resume a normal

<HEADLINE> Thai Leaders Pledge to Support Indonesia New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai leaders have expressed
their support to Indonesia's newly elected president Abdurrahman
Wahid, saying they believe that the new president will bring
Indonesia back on track politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Thursday that Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai sent a letter to Wahid Wednesday
congratulating him on his election victory.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Wahid, Prime Minister Chuan pledged that
Thailand was ready to continue to closely cooperate with Indonesia
to promote bilateral and regional ties.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he did not believe that Wahid's health problem would
be an obstacle to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Chuan said, he believed that Wahid would be able to
bring about national reconciliation in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Half-blind and very frail, 59-year-old Wahid is unable to move
without assistance.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin also sent a message of
congratulation to Wahid through Thai Embassy to Jakarta, in which
he said Wahid, "though apparently frail", will soon be able to
bring Indonesia back on track politically and socio-economically
and retain its leading role in the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi also said that he hoped the new Indonesian
government led by Wahid would play an important role at the
upcoming ASEAN summit, to be held in Manila next month.
</P>
<P>
Wahid was sworn in as Indonesia's fourth president in more than
50 years Wednesday after winning over opposition leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri with 373 votes against 313.

JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian new vice president
Megawati Soekarnoputri took an official oath at the plenary
meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) here Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of Allah, I hereby swear that I will fulfill my

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Megawati, general chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Party

CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Speaker of the Shura

<P>
Both Egypt and China are countries with ancient civilizations
and they have made great contributions to the progress of
mankind, Helmy said while meeting with Tian Jiyun, vice chairman

<P>
He expressed admiration for the great achievements made by
China during the past 50 years, saying that China has succeeded in
preserving its cultural tradition in its rapid social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Tian, who arrived in Cairo on Wednesday on a six-day visit,
shared Helmy's view that China and Egypt are both ancient
countries with long history and civilization.

Under the leadership of President Hosni Mubarak, the valiant

in developing national economy and raising people's living
standards, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China attaches great importance to the further
development of existing friendly ties with Egypt.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts Investigation into FIFA Rule on Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- European Commission said
Thursday that it has undertaken a detailed investigation into the
FIFA (Federation Interantionale de Football Association) rules
concerning players' agents.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive branch said its decision
was in response to a number of complaints and two petitions from
the European Parliament and it has officially informed FIFA that
world's football body considers the rules amount to anti-
competitive agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has sent a statement of objections to FIFA,
considering that the relevant FIFA rules infringe basic laws of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"They prevent or restrict natural or legal persons with the
necessary skills and qualifications from having access to this
activity," the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said in a statement that it also takes the
view at this stage that the benefits of the rules identified by
FIFA are not sufficient to offset the anti-competitive effects.

EU Commissioner for competition Mario Monti said this is merely
the start of the procedure. "However, if this initial opinion is
confirmed, FIFA will have to amend its rules on players' agents. I
am not against the establishment of rules applicable to players'

said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Chief Denies Plan to Storm Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Thursday denied alleged plans to capture Grozny,
capital of the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Grozny might be attacked, but only if such a
move is necessary to attain the priority of eliminating terrorists,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev's statement came shortly after his deputy, Vladimir
Toporov, said that federal troops would enter the Chechen capital
Grozny "sooner or later."
</P>
<P>
Toporov, however, said there will be no "all-out attack" to
seize Grozny and that federal troops will fight in "small units."
</P>
<P>
He said Defense Ministry units are not required "to restore
full military control over Chechen territory."
</P>
<P>
Following Moscow's announcement of the completion of the first
stage of military campaign against Chechen rebels, which resulted
in the control of over one-third of Chechen territory by federal
troops, Russian and foreign media have speculated about whether
the troops might try to storm Grozny itself. Such an attack would
risk large losses.
</P>
<P>
The federal military campaign came after two waves of armed
incursions into Daghestan led by Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev
and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last name. The
incursions were subsequently repelled by federal troops.
</P>
<P>
Basayev and Khattab have also been accused of masterminding a
series of apartment building explosions that killed about 300
people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 196 troops of the Russian Defense Ministry have
been killed in fighting with the militants in Daghestan and
Chechnya since August 2, Interfax reported Thursday, citing a
source in the ministry's press center. Five hundred servicemen
have been wounded.

<HEADLINE> Indian Truckers Go On National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Trucks were off the roads all
over India Thursday as operators "indefinitely suspended
operations" from 6 a.m. protesting against increase of diesel
prices.
</P>
<P>
Truck operators, led by All India Motor Transport Congress
(AIMTC), said the hike in diesel price would increase their
operational cost thus crippling the sector already hit by
recession.
</P>
<P>
The government announced on October 5 an unprecedented 40
percent hike in diesel prices effective the next day to partially
neutralize the 60 percent increase of diesel prices in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
AIMTC, representing 32 federations and operating over 2.2
million trucks in the country, failed to reach any agreement or
understanding with the government in its efforts to press for a
roll-back of diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
Truck operators in the south stopped operations since Wednesday
night while those in other regions joined the strike this morning,
AIMTC President O. P. Agarwal told the press here, adding they
would continue the strike till the government withdraws its
decision.
</P>
<P>
The government maintained that there were economic reasons for
the hike of the diesel prices and ruled out any change of the
increase.
</P>
<P>
S. Narayan, petroleum secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum
and Nature Gas, said the oil pool deficit would shoot up to a
staggering 100 billion rupees (approximately 2.33 U.S. dollars) by
the end of the fiscal year next March "if the diesel prices are
not brought in line with the international prices import parity".
</P>
<P>
Due to the increase of the diesel prices, commuters in the
Indian capital have had to pay double bus fares effective last
Saturday following the decision of the Delhi government to revise
the bus charges.
</P>
<P>
Commuters now should pay two rupees (one U.S. dollar is
currently for 43 rupees) for the first four km as against one
rupee earlier, four rupees between four and eight km, six between
eight and 12 km, eight between 12 and 16 km, and a flat fare of 10
rupees beyond 16 km, according to a press release by Delhi
Transport Corporation (DTC).
</P>
<P>
Prices of essential commodities particularly fruit and
vegetables soared in the city today as over 150,000 truckers kept
off roads.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Transport Minister Parvez Hashmi urged the central
government to roll back the revised prices immediately.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Predicts Failure for N. Irish Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams is
warning that the review of the Northern Ireland peace deals by U.S.
mediator George Mitchell may be doomed, according to a BBC report
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was asked by the British government to chair a review
of the Good Friday Agreement in July after the pro-British Ulster
Unionists refused to form a government with Sinn Fein, the
political arm of IRA, because the IRA would not start
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The review adjourned Wednesday in London with both the
unionists and nationalist politicians preparing to brief their
parties on the state of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Although the talks are expected to resume in Belfast on Friday
and continue over the weekend, Sinn Fein already appears to be
starting to write the review's obituary.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a fund-raising dinner for his party in New York,
Gerry Adams said that he believed that the Mitchell review will "
probably not succeed."
</P>
<P>
"I would be misleading you, if I didn't also tell you that the
unionists have implacably and dogmatically stuck with their
position," Adams was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"And in fairness to them they have made it clear that whatever
suggestions we're making, whatever initiatives we're taking, it
isn't good enough." he added.
</P>
<P>
Adams was making the remarks amid warnings to Northern Ireland'
s police chief that dissident republican guerrillas are planning a
major attack.
</P>
<P>
Police in the Irish Republic also reported on Thursday that
they have arrested 10 people, including a 14-year-old boy, after
the discovery of a real IRA training camp near Dublin.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday he is prepared to be present at the
High Court here as a witness in the sodomy trial of his former
deputy Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
"I will be there as a witness. It's nothing at all, " Bernama
news agency quoted Mahathir as saying in Yan in the northern State

</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur High Court issued subpoenas on Monday against

<TEXT>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission, China's top official
planning department for economic and social developments, which is
formulating the country's mid- and long-term economic and social
development program for the next 15 years, has been paying close
attention to integrating development and environmental protection
and ecological conservation in line with the recommendations,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, the commission will also increase
resources for pollution control and ecological conservation,
improve the environment of key regions, cities and coastal areas,
and prevent and control industrial pollution through current
economic restructuring, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 65,000 polluting factories have been closed during
the past three years, and proposals for construction projects will
not be approved by governments at any levels unless they meet the
environmental requirements set by the government.
</P>
<P>
Punitive measures will be taken against other polluting
factories whose waste discharge does not meet state environmental
requirements.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to limit the production of cement and plate
glass and gradually phrase out the production and use of
traditional earthen brick.
</P>
<P>
Based on the recommendations, China has also banned logging in
virgin forests and is promoting clean production and use of clean
fuel.
</P>
<P>
China will also take into account the proposal to adjust water
prices, as proposed by the council, when it revises the Law on
Water Resources in a bid to set up "a pricing mechanism that
reflects true costs and is able to regulate water supplies and
demand effectively and flexibly", Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The newly promulgated Regulation on the Price of Urban Water
Supplies takes account of the waste-water treatment cost as a
factor in determining water prices.
</P>
<P>
Last year China invested 72 billion yuan (about 9 billion U.S.
dollars), or 0.91 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), in
environmental protection and pollution control.
</P>
<P>
This figure represents an increase of 43 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, also chairman of
the council, said the country will attach greater importance to
environmental protection and pollution control when formulating
economic and social development plans.
</P>
<P>
He said China faces a tough environmental situation and long-
term concerted efforts are required to reverse this situation.

<HEADLINE> China's First Two Tourist Joint Ventures Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China's National Tourism
Administration has given the green light to two tourist joint
ventures in this capital city of south China's Guangdong Province,
signaling a bolder step in opening up the profitable tourist
sector, it was announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Wing On International Travel Service Co. Ltd. of Guangdong
is jointly funded by the China International Travel Agency and
Hong Kong's Wing On Travel Service Co. with a registered capital
of five million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The other tourism joint venture, called the Hong Thai
International Travel Service Co. Ltd. of Guangzhou, is between the
Guangzhilu International Travel Service Co. and Hong Kong's Hong
Thai Travel Service Agency, also with five million yuan in
registered capital.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong investors will each hold 49 percent of their
respective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the National Tourism Administration and the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation jointly issued
interim procedures for the trial establishment of joint venture
travel agencies between Chinese and overseas enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weixiong, director of the Guangdong Tourism Bureau, said
here today that this introduction of overseas capital is Guangdong
's second experiment in reform of the tourist sector, following
the privatization and shareholding reforms of tourist agencies.
</P>
<P>
He said that Guangdong now has 26 of China's top 100
international travel agencies and 22 of the country's 100 best
domestic travel agencies. The province's revenue from the domestic
travel agencies reached 170 million yuan last year, accounting for
56 percent of the total of the country's domestic travel agencies.

<HEADLINE> Complete Standardization System Set up in China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China has been catching up with
the countries at the forefront of standardization by establishing
its own standardization system, an area in which China used to
take the lead, a Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Li Chuanqing, director of the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision, who is attending the ongoing 22nd
Conference of the International Standardization Organization (ISO)
in Beijing, said the number of Chinese National Standards
established had increased to around 19,000 by the end of September
from only 1,250 in 1978.
</P>
<P>
ISO President Giacomo Elias said about 4,100 of the standards
issued by the Chinese government, representing more than one-fifth
of the total, are adoptions of ISO standards, or internationally
accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
The application of these standards has been helpful in
promoting agricultural and industrial production and trade as well
as improving the life of the people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Looking back on China's history, Elias said, "in fact, the
first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, who died in the year 210 B.
C., must have understood very well the importance of technical
standards."
</P>
<P>
"The emperor was the first to unify the various states of the
Han Chinese people to form a single empire. In order to reinforce
unity, encourage trade and movement, and promote prosperity, the
emperor promulgated uniform technical standards for weights and
measures, water conduits, road construction, and on the axle and
wheel bases of transport vehicles, which, in turn, led to
standards for the width of town gates."
</P>
<P>
"So for those of us who 'discovered' quality systems with the
publication of ISO 9000 in 1987, we now know that China was
actually laying the foundation of ISO 9000 with standardized
management procedures more than 2000 years ago!"
</P>
<P>
China has lagged behind other countries in the past several
centuries in standardization and other sciences in which it once
led the way, mainly because of the country's long history of
feudalism which looked down on science and technology, and the
many years of wars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, when China began to shift its focus to economic and
social development, China has made rapid progress in
standardization required for mass production and trade, Li
explained.
</P>
<P>
The national standards cover not only traditional farming and
industrial products, but also areas involving information
technology, environmental protection, and health and safety
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the national standards for the country's
key industries were adopted from those of the ISO and advanced
standards used by other countries in order to improve the
competitiveness of China's products on the world market.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech to the conference, Chinese Vice Premier Wu
Bangguo said on Wednesday that an important element of the country
's economic and technical policy is the adoption of international
technical standards and advanced standards in order to improve
Chinese products and services and boost international trade.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Rejects Deal With U.S. on Missile Treaty Revision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Thursday reiterated Moscow's rejection of a revision of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) in exchange for compensation
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
No talks on a compensation package for overcoming Russia's
opposition to changes in the 1972 treaty are being held, Ivanov
said in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais.
</P>
<P>
"Such talks are absolutely ruled out," the Interfax news agency
quoted Ivanov as saying in the interview.
</P>
<P>
The minister said without ABM, the three stages of the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) would lose their meaning.
Moscow and Washington have already signed the START I and START II
and are holding talks on START III to further cut their stockpile
of strategic nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is categorically against violating the 1972 ABM Treaty
which has helped prevent large-scale nuclear catastrophes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also voiced "immense disappointment" at the U.S. Senate'
s refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and the United States have drafted this document
together. It's a bad signal for those who would like to possess
weapons of mass destruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we attach great importance to U.S. President Bill
Clinton's statements to the effect that the current moratorium
will remain in force," Ivanov said.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Shows No Sincerity Towards Talks With Central Government: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dalai Lama has never showed
sincerity towards negotiating with the central government and he
should be held fully responsible for failure to achieve
substantial progress in previous talks.
</P>
<P>
Xu Mingyang, an executive vice-chairman of the People's
Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, made this remark here
today while talking to a group of Beijing-based foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
The official reiterated the consistent central government
policy towards the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the door for negotiations remains open if the Dalai
Lama ends his position of "Tibet independence," stops all
activities aimed at splitting the motherland, and makes public his
recognition that Tibet is an inalienable part of China, that
Taiwan is a province of China, and that the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China.
</P>
<P>
The channel for contacts between the two sides has never been
blocked, according to the official. In the 1970s, the central
government received many delegations sent by the Dalai Lama and
tried various ways to make it a success, but the Dalai Lama has
always made trouble for the talks, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official went on to recall that in 1989 the Dalai Lama
clique made a wrong assessment of the international and domestic
situation, halted its contacts with the central government, and
published an autobiography of the Dalai Lama with a map that
blatantly separates Tibet from China.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Dalai Lama pondered the changing situation and
appealed for a resumption of contacts with the central government,
Xu said.

However, the Dalai Lama unilaterally halted the contacts while
spreading rumors through the international community saying that
the central government showed no sincerity towards the
negotiations. Since then, the Dalai Lama has masterminded a series
of separatist activities including a "Peaceful March" in foreign
territory and explosions and assassinations in Tibet, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the deputy head of the regional
government also answered questions on religion, policies on ethnic
people, and economic and social development in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Questioned on an abortive explosion at the Potala Palace Square
in August, Xu denied some foreign reports claiming that the man
who attempted the explosion was killed in a local prison.
</P>
<P>
The criminal, a farmer from the suburbs of Lhasa, the regional
capital, is still alive and has confessed all his criminal
activities, showing willingness to correct himself, according to
the official.

<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have cracked
three illicit publication cases in which the outlawed Falun Gong
organization did 130 million yuan of business and gained 38.86
million yuan in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
Government departments concerned pointed out that these illicit
activities further prove that Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong,
and his Research Society of Falun Dafa, have made fool of Falun
Gong practitioners by advocating "truth, kindness and forbearance.
" In fact, Li and his society had taken advantage of practitioners
' sincerity to amass an illicit fortune for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources have disclosed that in the 1993-1996 period,
Li Hongzhi plotted and arranged the publication of eleven kinds of
Falun Gong books in some 2.18 million volumes, gaining a total
sales volume of more than 17.44 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that except for small number of books which were
distributed through official channels, the great majority of them
were illegally sold or distributed through the Falun Gong network.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guirong, an accountant for Li Hongzhi, confessed that in
1997 she once squared accounts for Li Hongzhi and found a total
income of more than 10 million yuan. She gave these accounts to Li
who then burned all of them to destroy the evidence of his illicit
income and tax evasion.

<HEADLINE> PML Decides That Sharif Would Remain It's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League
(PML) Thursday decided at a meeting that the deposed prime
minister, Nawaz Sharif, would remain as the party's president, PML
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The PML central leadership also decided at the meeting to avoid
confrontation with the armed forces and constituted a coordination
council to review the situation on daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting described as "unjustified" the action last week by
the armed forces which topped the PML-led government, and demanded
Sharif's immediate release.
</P>
<P>
This was the first PML high level meeting since the military
coup on October 12.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was chaired by PML's Senior Vice President
Raja Zafar-ul Haq, was held at former interior minister Chaudhry
Shujat Hussain's residence in Islamabad and was attended by about
30 former ministers and members of the suspended parliament, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The PML also decided to convene a meeting of the members of the
suspended parliament and a special session of the PML's Central
Working Committee in the last week of this month.
</P>
<P>
Talking to media after Thursday's meeting, Zafar-ul Haq said
the planned coordination council of the PML will chalk out future
course of action and organize the Muslim League.
</P>
<P>
He said that the council will also deal with the challenges the
party is facing since the dismissal of the Sharif government.
</P>
<P>
Zafar-ul Haq said that the PML is not afraid of accountability
because former prime minister Sharif himself initiated the
process.
</P>
<P>
"We support accountability but there should not be no
victimization under the excuse of accountability," he said, adding
the PLM will not accept accountability if it is only against the
PML.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the PML will challenge the dismissal of the Sharif
government in the Supreme Court, Zafar-ul Haq said it will be
decided by the coordination council.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sees 3-4 Pct Agricultural Output Hike Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government hopes
to raise the growth rate of agricultural output from its
historical average of 1.9 percent a year over the 1990-1997 period
to a steady growth rate of 3-4 percent yearly until 2004.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's 25th Philippine Business Conference held in
Manila, Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said this growth is
expected to improve the living conditions not only of the poor but
also of urban workers.
</P>
<P>
Citing government figures, Angara said of the country's 70
million population, 40 percent depends on agriculture for a living
which accounts for over two-thirds of the Filipino poor.
</P>
<P>
He said the expected growth is seen to generate jobs in the
rural sector, which could increase average individual incomes from
11,300 (282.5 U.S. dollars) pesos in 1999 to 16,000 pesos (400
dollars) in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output hike is also expected to reduce the
proportion of the rural population considered poor from 53 percent
in 1998 to 42 percent in 2004, he added.
</P>
<P>
For farming and fishing, Angara said the Department of
Agriculture will promote community-sized irrigation systems and
provide certified seeds and postharvest facilities to the farmers
and fisher folk.
</P>
<P>
While Angara admitted these are ambitious targets, considering
the depth of rural poverty and government's limited resources, he
said this can still be achieved through careful planning to
maximize program effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Angara said these undertakings could be
carried out through private sector's support -- its financial
resources, its managerial skills and its technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
Angara identified some areas for private investments including
irrigation, certified seeds, inland fish-farming, post-harvest
facilities, contract farming and the export sector.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong's Illicit Publication Cases Cracked by Chinese Police (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1996, when the illicit income had increased rapidly and
Falun Gong books were banned by the government, Li Hongzhi decided
that the Research Society of Falun Dafa should not directly deal
with the publication of Falun Gong books and the sales of other
Falun Gong items, and established new Falun Gong book publishing
bases mainly in the cities of Wuhan and Jinan for large-scale
underground business operations.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations show that Wang Hansheng, board chairman
of the Shenshen Group in Wuhan, and his wife Xu Xianglan, head of
the general teaching center of Wuhan, under the guidance of Li
Hongzhi sold 4.29 million volumes of Falun Gong books, 580,000
related video and audio products, more than 40,000 sets of
practitioners' uniforms, and large amounts of other items through
illegal channels in 80 cities and counties in 26 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities between July 1996 and April
1999, with total sales topping 91 million yuan and illicit profits
reaching 27 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In another major case, Yu Changxin, a core member of the Falun
Gong cult, authorized Zhu Jiasheng and several other book dealers
to publish Falun Gong books. They adopted an illicit means to
distribute more than 3.51 million volumes of books in over 40
cities and counties across China, with more than 15 million yuan
of sales volume and more than 3.11 million yuan in illicit profits.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Shandong Province, Li Hongzhi and Yu Changxin
arranged for and authorized Xu Jinliang, a major criminal suspect,
to publish Falun Gong audio and video products. Latest
investigative results show that Xu sold more than 4.3 million such
products in more than 70 cities and counties across the country,
with total sales volume surpassing 23.65 million yuan and illicit
income reaching 8.3 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong's Illicit Publication Cases Cracked by Chinese Police (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These three cases prove that major organizers of these illicit
publication activities are core members of the Falun Gong cult,
and Li Hongzhi and his core members amassed large fortunes from
these illicit activities.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments in Beijing and the provinces of Hubei and
Shandong have disclosed that Li Hongzhi and the major organizers
of the three illicit publication cases all evaded large amounts in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that while advocating "truth, kindness and
forbearance" among Falun Gong practitioners, Wang Hansheng and his
collaborators dodged more than 2.93 million yuan in tax payments
of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned indicate that the three illicit
publication cases are only the tip of the iceberg. In one of the
examples, Xu Yinquan, deputy head of the general teaching center
in Jilin Province, northeast China, and his collaborators
illegally obtained more than 1.3 million yuan in profits from
illicit publication activities, over 200,000 yuan of which went to
Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations show that Li Hongzhi and his core members
have profiteered from those illicit publication activities, and
their prey were Falun Gong practitioners.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Questioned Over Illegally-Kept Valuables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police on Thursday
questioned former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over dozens
of valuable items he was suspected of keeping illegally after
leaving office, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and his wife Sara were questioned at a police station
in a Tel Aviv suburb, one day after the police searched their
residence and his office and seized dozens of boxes filled with
expensive paintings, gold and silver wares.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli law, the presents given to Netanyahu while he
was in power from 1996 to 1999 should have been returned to the
state after he lost the national election in May.
</P>
<P>
The search is part of the ongoing investigation over
allegations that Netanyahu billed the government for private house
service for him by contractor Avner Amadi in the three years of
his office.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Yedioth Ahronoth disclosed last month that
Amadi carried out a string of services for Netanyahu and then
presented a bill worth 104,000 U.S. dollars to the prime
minister's office only after Netanyahu was oust by Ehud Barak in
the election.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Amadi, who was arrested recently on
suspicion of bribing, has helped polish floors and repair
electricity in Netanyahu's private home in addition to moving
furniture between his private and official residence.
</P>
<P>
In a plea bargain with the state prosecutor, Amadi agreed to
cooperate with the police in the investigation against Netanyahu
in exchange for a light sentence of six months of community
service. Local media said he told the police about the valuables
in Netanyahu's home and office.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Sara were questioned last month by the fraud
police, but no charges have been brought against them.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was almost forced from office in early 1997 when he
was involved in a political scandal. Police recommended then that
he be charged with fraud and breach of trust in an alleged attempt
to influence a corruption investigation of Aryeh Deri, the then
chairman of the powerful religious party Shas.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors finally abandoned that case, citing
insufficient evidence.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks in Albania Total 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government Thursday
approved the opening of a Greek commercial bank in its territory,
bringing the total number of foreign banks operating in Albania to
11 since 1992 when it began an economic overhaul.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, Albania offers very preferential
terms to attract foreign banks in a bid to promote capital inflow.
</P>
<P>
Albania allows a foreigner or foreign business to open banking
services with a minimum registration capital as low as 5.3 million
U.S. dollars, and operate as a comprehensive bank, given the
endorsement of Albania's central bank.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign banks must be subordinate to the monitor and
management of a central bank supervision committee in the
interests of the stability of Albania's banking system.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that so far foreign banks in Albania, of
which some are joint ventures, are all second-class banks, with
their capital coming from the United States, Italy, Greece,
Malaysia and some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the banks are located in capital, Tirana.

disposition of troops for the three major battles which led to
final victory in the War of Liberation.
</P>
<P>
The courtyard where Mao and other CPC leaders worked together
in Xibaipo is known as "the Zhongnanhai during the War of
Liberation" and has already been turned into a museum under state-
level protection. The pictures of Mao and other revolutionary
leaders, and the documents, oil lamps, pencils and guns which they
used all on display as historic artifacts.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to have 300,000 people visit our museum this year,"
said Zhang Zhiping, director of the Xibaipo Museum.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Wan Gang, former deputy director of the
Beijing-based Chinese Revolutionary Museum, the number of such
modern historic sites and artifacts available to the public is
still too limited. There are only 134 modern history museums among
750 key museums under state protection nationwide.
</P>
<P>
China's modern history began with the Opium War in 1840. To
date, China has collected 400,000 historic items from this period,
4,000 of which are of high value.
</P>
<P>
Wan said that many museums of modern history have only a small
number of artifacts, and most of them do not concern themselves
with collecting items which reflect economic, scientific and
cultural progress and the development of national defense,
education, health care, sports and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Experts recently inspected a research center used for China's
first atomic bomb in Haibei Mongolia Autonomous Prefecture of
Qinghai Province in northwest China. They agreed that it is a very
important historic site that needs intensive protection.
</P>
<P>
"Along with archeological finds, we should try to collect and
preserve modern items of daily use in our everyday lives," said
Wan, "as some of them may become precious cultural relics in
future years."

<HEADLINE> Macao Security Forces to Hold Exercise in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Macao's security forces will
conduct a large-scale exercise in early December to guarantee the
safety of activities related to Macao's handover from Portugal to
China, sources with the Portuguese Macao government said.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will be staged around the three sites to be used
for the handover ceremony, the farewell party of Portuguese
officials and guests, and the inauguration of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
The drill has to be held after relevant construction or
renovation projects at these sites are completed. Local public
security police, marine police, firefighters and special police
forces are expected to take part in the comprehensive exercise.
</P>
<P>
A government security office also announced earlier this month
that the area surrounding the venue of the handover ceremony will
be closed in late November. Those who live or work in the area
have to apply for passes in advance.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal attach great importance to security matters
as top leaders of both countries will be present at the handover
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Tian Qiyu, Chinese vice-minister of public security, paid a
visit to Macao on October 11 and 12 to seek coordination from the
Portuguese Macao government on security-related affairs.

<HEADLINE> Power Sales Will Be No Problem in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We do not worry about the power market for the Three Gorges
Project as China has huge market potential. Instead we plan to
build more new hydro-electric power stations at the upper reaches
of the Yangtze to meet the demand for the rapid economic growth in
the Yangtze River Valley," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
He said what has most hindered the marketing of electricity has
been the country's existing backward power management system and
limited power transmission capacity.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, for instance, the country sold less power, which made
it hard to raise funds for the Three Gorges Project and sparked
concern about the need to build the mammoth project. Twenty
billion kwh of electricity generated by Gezhouba Power Plant alone
was wasted.
</P>
<P>
But the problems that worry Yuan are being solved. Information
from the China National Power Corporation shows that by treating
the Three Gorges Project as an opportunity, China has been able to
restructure its power industry, reform the existing power
management and operation mechanisms, and speed up the construction
of power transmission facilities in the country's rural and urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
This year and in the future, construction of minor power
projects will be postponed, but priority will go to building of
regulating hydro-electric and thermal power projects, projects
designed to help send power from western areas to eastern areas,
as well as projects capable of improving the environment and power
and heating supplying conditions in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Power departments in east China are under reform, separating
government administrative and corporate functions, and power
plants and power transmission organizations will operate as parent
companies and subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
The measures will remove obstacles preventing the power
generated by the Three Gorges Project to enter the east China
market.
</P>
<P>
The existing power transmission structure in China, featuring a
province-wide system of self-balance, will be replaced by a giant,
comprehensive national power transmission network with the Three
Gorges Project power transmission works as the center, supported
by more new trunk power transmission projects.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, 9.1 billion yuan was spent on
construction and improvement of power grids in the country's rural
and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 260 billion yuan will be used to upgrade
China's power grids in the next three years, and the shortage of
power transmission systems that may affect the successful
marketing of electricity from the Three Gorges Project will be
greatly alleviated.

<HEADLINE> Power Sales Will Be No Problem in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An official responsible for
China's Three Gorges Project in Hubei Province, central China,
said that there will be no problem selling the electricity the
project generates.
</P>
<P>
From January to June of this year, China had a 5.6 percent
increase in power output from the same period last year. Yuan
Guolin, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Project Development Corporation told Xinhua that the
increase in power output was brought about by the country's robust
demand and its effort to restructure its power projects.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project has an estimated cost of 200 billion
yuan. Construction work began in 1993. It will have a designed
installed generating capacity of 20.9 million kw and yearly output
of more than 100 billion kwh of electricity upon its completion in
2009.
</P>
<P>
The project, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the
country's longest, is under the second phase of construction,
which began in 1998 and will end when the first group of
generating units are operating in 2003. During this phase, 18
million cu.m. of concrete will be poured. To ensure safety,
quality control is being given unprecedented attention and
specialists are being employed to give advice.
</P>
<P>
The dam behind the project is expected to play a major role in
controlling floods on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, in
addition to providing power. Profits from the Gezhouba Power Plant,
which is the currewnt largest hydro-electric power projoect on the
Yantze and is now operating, are one of the main sources of
financing for the project.
</P>
<P>
When the first four generating units are operating in 2003,
profits from the sale of electricity will be used to fund the
project's third phase, which will last for 6 years beginning from
2004. When that project is completed in 2009, the developer, which
is in charge of both the Three Gorges and Gezhouba, will send much
of the electricity to central and eastern parts of China, and
income will be used to repay the loans.
</P>
<P>
China's power plants can not fully meet its power demands. At
present, the world's annual average power consumption per capita
is well over 2,200 kwh, but China's annual consumption per capita
is 780 kwh, or just a tenth of that in developed countries. In
Hubei Province the annual average consumption is around 700 kwh
per person, or below the Chinese national average. Even when the
project is finished, Hubei's per capita annual consumption will be
just 50 percent of that of the world average.

<HEADLINE> British Firms to Invest 100 MLN Dollars in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Two leading British firms, the
CGU Plc and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) have
signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly invest 100 million
U.S. dollars in the form of private equity investment in China,
the CGU representative office in Beijing said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum signed Wednesday, the two firms
would establish a China investment joint venture to be
provisionally called "The CGU-CDC China Partnership."
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the arrangement, CGU and CDC agree to
finalize details of the joint venture and its investment policy by
April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will commence its operations next year.
</P>
<P>
CGU is one of the world's largest international insurance and
fund management groups with premium income of 18 billion pounds
sterling and assets under management of over 120 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
The group has applied to Chinese authorities for a license to
sell life insurance in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its insurance education and training commitments
in China, CGU launched the China Index Fund in 1997 to enable
investors to participate in China's B share market.
</P>
<P>
CDC is one of the leading private equity investors in emerging
markets and has been investing throughout Asia for over 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, CDC was granted approval by the British
government to invest in China and in July this year, both the
British and Chinese governments gave their formal support to CDC's
decision to begin operations in China.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the memorandum, CGU Group Chief Executive Bob
Scott said China would continue to be one of the most significant
emerging markets with both strong growth and investment potential.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that CGU's investment and asset
management expertise combined with CDC's unparalleled knowledge of
investing in emerging markets throughout the Asia Pacific region
provided a sound base for the joint venture.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- About 40 tones of white powder
spilled at the scene of a train derailment in Sydney's south-west
on Thursday was a herbicide, emergency services said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews initially feared some of the National Rail
cargo which spilled onto tracks at Douglas Park might have been
the hazardous chemical sodium cyanide.
</P>
<P>
The area within 250 meters of the spill was immediately
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
However, chemical analysts moved quickly to account for all
containers, which were still intact on board the train.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigades spokesman Ian Krimmer said that some of the
material has been identified as herbicide by crews wearing
protective clothing and breathing apparatus.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage we are looking at a long and protracted
operation because we have some 40 tones of herbicide to remove
manually," he said.
</P>
<P>
Krimmer said some unidentified substances were still being
analyzed and it was likely to be several more hours before the
area could be declared safe.
</P>
<P>
About six carriages of the 1.2 kilometer long freight train
derailed near a level crossing at Station Street in Douglas Park
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
North and south bound passenger trains between Campbelltown and
Picton in Sydney were canceled and replaced by buses.

Konka now holds about 20 percent of the color TV market in
China, Chen said, adding "Today's color TV market will be tomorrow
's mobile phone market."
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, China's color TV market was nearly monopolized
by multinationals such as Sony and Panasonic. But today, most of
the market share has fallen into the hands of Chinese producers.
</P>
<P>
China's mobile phone market has developed rapidly in recent
years. The number of mobile phone subscribers grew at an annual
rate of 93 percent in 1997 and 78 percent in 1998. So far this
year, the number of mobile phone users has increased by 11 million.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put the increase at an annual rate of 12
million mobile phone users in the coming years to a total of 150
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the Chinese market is occupied by Motorola, Nokia,
Ericsson and other foreign brands.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21(Xinhua)-- A tubby surfing penguin, the logo
of the XteamLinux Software Company, marked the premiere ceremony
of the newest Linux operating system today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based software company swept the Chinese Linux-
using market with its April launch of "XteamLinux1.0 Chinese
Version" by selling 100,000 units in four months, easily claiming
market leadership. The first major customer was the Beijing
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Linux operating systems in Chinese has
also drawn the close attention of the Chinese government, and was
listed in August in the "Major Scientific Development Projects" to
enjoy governmental support for the next two years, according to
XteamLinux executives.
</P>
<P>
Due to its free and open nature, Linux can expect an even
greater market in China, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The company presented the XteamLinux2.0 Chinese Version
software to the Ministry of State Security and the Beijing
municipal government at Thursday's debut ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Taoism Well Developed In New Era: Senior Taoist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The founding of the People's
Republic of China, especially the reform and opening-up since 1978,
has given traditional Taoism a new life, said Zhang Jiyu, vice
president of the China Taoist Association.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the irresponsible comments on religious affairs
in China by the U.S. State Department in its recent "Annual Report
on International Religious Freedom for 1999", Zhang said that this
is in essence a wanton interference in China's internal affairs
under the pretext of religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
"We Taoists are strongly indignant at and resolutely opposed to
such unfounded and unreasonable accusations," he said.
</P>
<P>
A native religion of China, Taoism has a history of nearly 2,
000 years. However, in modern times it was declining until it
began to thrive again after the founding of new China in 1949,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Currently there are some 1,600 Taoism temples throughout the
country, with more than 25,000 Taoists, whose income and religious
activities are well protected by law."
</P>
<P>
He said that in Baiyun (White Cloud) Temple in Beijing,
thousands of Taoists go to worship twice a month, and in some
places, such as Wudang Mountain, the number of worshipers can
reach hundreds of thousands during temple fairs.

<HEADLINE> WHO Talks With Warring Parties on Immunization in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said on Thursday it is still negotiating with the warring
parties in Angola to have children in the country immunized
against polio.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement has not been reached to grant us days of
tranquility so that we can be able to immunize children against
polio," a spokesperson for WHO's Expanded Program on Immunization
in the Southern Africa region said in an interview with the
Zimbabwe News Agency in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Polio is a contagious disease which would spread in other
countries of the region if it was not eradicated.
</P>
<P>
The initiative by WHO was successfully implemented in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) last year when the rebels
had already unleashed the war against the government of President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said polio cases in Angola were high but
refused to say the exact number as it was the responsibility of
the health ministry of the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.N. agency had the vision to eradicate polio in
Africa by the year 2000, WHO director Gro Harlem Brundtland said
indications were that the disease might be eradicated by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Expanded Program on Immunization has proved to be a
success as it had no polio cases reported recently. Its national
polio vaccination campaign started three years ago, the news
agency reported.

<HEADLINE> China's Mobile Phone Producer Plans Recovery of Lost Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese authorities have given approval to nine domestic
enterprises to produce their own mobile phones, including consumer
electronics big names such as Konka, TCL and Hai'er.
</P>
<P>
In fact, made-in-China mobile phones have been on the market
for some time, but market response has been far from warm. It is
estimated that all the domestically-made mobile phones hold a mere
five percent of the market share.
</P>
<P>
But Konka remains confident. Chen said Chinese mobile phone
enterprises are technically disadvantaged, as they depend on their
foreign competitors for key technologies and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
However, they do have some advantages. For example, he said,
Chinese enterprises have lower labor costs and know the local
market environment better than their foreign competitors
Enterprises such as Konka, Hai'er and TCL are already name brands
for Chinese shoppers and have established their own strong sales
and service networks.
</P>
<P>
As for Konka's technical support, Chen said it has started its
own telecommunications development center and entered into a
technical cooperation agreement with the US-based Lucent
Technology Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Konka has developed a mobile phone with its own intellectual
property right and its products would be technically equal to big
names in the industry in the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Konka is to launch an advertising campaign to
let its mobile phone known by every Chinese.
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone has faith in Konka's ambitious plan, at
least in its time frame for success.
</P>
<P>
An independent research report by the underwriter of Konka's
new A shares, the China International Capital Corporation,
estimates that Konka can only expect a market share of five
percent by the year 2004, instead of its projection of 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Okays Class-Action Suit Against Coke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli court has given
go-ahead to a class-action suit against the Coca Cola company for
failing to honor its pledge to award prizes to people collecting
award-bearing bottle caps, a local daily said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv District Court ruled Wednesday that in a contest
in 1997, the world-leading soft drink company failed to inform
consumers in a timely manner of all the conditions to win a free
trip to the United States, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the class-action suit, which was filed by the
Israeli Consumer Council and several individual consumers in 1998,
could continue, according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
In the contest two years ago, the Coca Cola company promised to
award "a trip to the U.S. with two friends" to anyone who managed
to collect the necessary combination of letters for the Hebrew
word "Tiul" (meaning "Trip") from pop-tops and bottle caps of its
beverage containers.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs complained that after they succeeded in finding
all the four letters, the company refused to award them the trip
and said an additional symbol was needed.
</P>
<P>
They argue that the new condition was not mentioned in
the company's advertisements for the contest until it was
nearing its end, when they had already fulfilled the other
contest conditions.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the company's notification was provided
too late to benefit those consumers who had invested their money,
time and effort collecting the beverage tops in accordance with
the contest rules.
</P>
<P>
It also decided that, as there were to be a maximum of
25 prize winners, the class-action suit would be transferred to
the Magistrate's Court, which has the authority to discuss
financial claims up to one million shekels (nearly 250,000 U.S.
dollars).

PARIS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French supreme court, the Cour de Cassation, is expected
to issue a warrant of arrest against Maurice Papon, former Vichy
official convicted of complicity in crimes against humanity who
has fled France. He was seen hiding in a hotel in Switzerland
until last Friday and then headed for an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
-- Japanese ambassador to France Koichiro Matsuura was elected
on Wednesday the new chief of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the third round
of voting. According to most observers, this round of voting was
preceded by "intensive solicitings" of the 58 members of the
UNESCO executive council who have the right of vote.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The decision made by former Vichy official and Gaullist
minister Maurice Papon to choose exile on the eve of a judgment to
be made by the supreme court on his appeal has pushed the
government into action. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that the
government will do everything to search for, arrest and jail him.
The Simon-Wiesenthal Center said Papon could be in Spain.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1952, at the darkest time of the Cold War, the United
States under President Harry Truman decided to deploy nuclear
bombs in Morocco, then a French protectorate, said a newly de-
classified document of the Pentagon. From 1954 to 1963, the U.S.
armed forces ran from one to three Strategic Air Command bases in
Morocco which sheltered nuclear bombs ready to attack targets in
Europe and sub-marines in the Atlantic ocean.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Send More Peacekeepers to E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia may send a
peacekeeping force of between 1,500 and 1,700 personnel to East
Timor under the U.N. command, Defense Minister Abang Abu Bakar
Mustapha said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations might request Malaysia to send a large
contingent as part of the U.N. Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET) team and this is being discussed in New York by
Malaysia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Hasmy
Agam and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, the minister told
reporters in Port Dickson, some 90 kilometers south of here,
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia currently has a force of 50 personnel in the
International Force in East Timor commanded by Australia, of whom
them 30 are observers and 20 liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
On whether Malaysia would lead the peacekeeping force in East
Timor by sending such a large contingent, Abang Abu Bakar said
this would depend on the discussions being held in New York.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N. wants Malaysia to take command of UNTAET, we will
comply with the request," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility that some East Timor leaders might not agree
to Malaysia being in command of the peacekeeping force, he said
such objections would be inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's track record in serving in previous U.N.
peacekeeping missions has shown that its peacekeepers have always
been fair and impartial, he said, adding, "In fact, because of
this the U.N. has been asking Malaysia to provide peacekeepers and
observers in every peacekeeping mission the U.N. has been called
upon."
</P>
<P>
To a question on when the Malaysian contingent would depart for
East Timor, he said, "We were told to get ready within one week."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said here Thursday that it is Malaysia's hope that East
Timor will no longer be a problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
Through participation in the Australia-led International Force
in East Timor, he said, "We have taken on a role in the
peacekeeping mission in East Timor, and surely what we want to see
in the future is an East Timor which will not be a problem in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The majority of East Timorese chose independence from Indonesia
in a referendum held by the United Nations in August.

<P>
GENEVA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Roche has priced the sale to the
public of 20 million shares of common stock of Genentech Inc. at a
price of 143.5 U.S. dollars per share, the Swiss pharmaceuticals
manufacturer announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this offering, Roche's ownership interest in
Genentech, which is based in south San Francisco, California of
the United States, will be reduced from approximately 82 percent
to approximately 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
The underwriters for the offering have also been granted an
option to purchase up to 2,000,000 additional shares, to covet
over-allotments, according to Roche. If the underwriters purchase
the additional shares, Roche's ownership in Genentech will be
reduced to approximately 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
The successful offering will nearly double the float of
Genentech's shares in the public market and increase the liquidity
of the shares with no dilution impact, as no new shares have been
issued by Genentech.
</P>
<P>
Roche said that the relationship between Roche and Genentech is
unchanged by this transaction. They will continue all agreements
covering products and marketing rights outside the United States,
both on the market and in development.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's new domestic
airline, Phnom Penh Airways, is set to begin operation Friday.
</P>
<P>
An inaugural ceremony was held Thursday and attended by Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and his wife, Princess Marie.
</P>
<P>
The carrier, owned by Prince Norodom Chakrapong, will fly to
Siem Reap, Battambang, Stung Treng, Ratanakkiri and Koh Kong. The
airline, so far, has only one old Soviet-made An-24 airplane, but
plans to have one more later.
</P>
<P>
Prince Chakrapong expressed his thanks for Prime Minister Hun
Sen's approval of the airline and Prince Ranariddh's support at
the ceremony. He also said the new airline is aimed at
strengthening links between the big cities and remote areas to
promote the development and prosperity of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The new airline is the third of its kind in the country, with
other two being President Airlines and Royal Air Cambodge.
</P>
<P>
Prince Chakrapong is a son of King Norodom Sihanouk and
half-brother of National Assembly President Prince Norodom
Ranariddh. In July 1994, he was sentenced in absentia to 20 years
in prison for his role in a failed uprising and was allowed to
flee the country. He returned to Phnom Penh in March this year
after receiving a pardon from the king.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The long-delayed disarmament
program, under the July 7 Lome peace accord signed by the Sierra
Leonean government and the rebels, finally kicked off in Freetown
Wednesday, according to reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rebels including child soldiers handed in their
weapons at a ceremony attended by United Nations Special Envoy
Francis Okelo, Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, rebel
leaders Foday Sankoh and Johnny Paul Koroma as well as General
Gabriel Kpamber, commander of the Nigerian- led west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony held at a barracks in Freetown, Okelo said that
the process of disarming the estimated 45,000 fighters could last
for two months.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to the crucial stage where all stakeholders
should demonstrate their commitment, including the U.N. and the
international community," said Okelo.
</P>
<P>
"Let's forgive and join together to build our nation," Kabbah
said, urging fellow Sierra Leoneans to welcome the disarmed and
demobilized fighters back into society.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, both Sankoh and Koroma, who returned to
Freetown three weeks ago, reiterated their commitment to the July
peace deal signed in Togolese capital Lome.

<HEADLINE> Safety Expert Warns of Nuclear Accident in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- India is likely to face a
serious nuclear accident in the not too distant future, a nuclear
safety expert warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A. Gopalakrishnan, former chief of the Atomic Energy Regulatory
Board (AERB), said a report prepared by AERB in 1995 which listed
130 defects in various nuclear installations in the country "did
include some identified problems related to reprocessing plants."
</P>
<P>
"I am not permitted to discuss the specifics openly, but
suffice to say that the degree of automation and cross-checks on
safety in our older plants are very minimal and one can not assert
at all that an accident like the on which occurred in Japan (last
month) will not happen in India," the expert told the Press Trust
of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has so far not made the
AERB report public in spite of legal pressure from the People's
Union of Civil Liberties.
</P>
<P>
Gopalakrishnan said in Hyderabad, 1,500 kilometers south of
here, that excessive secrecy in DAE and inability of AERB to
function independently compromised the safety of nuclear
installations in India.
</P>
<P>
A human error caused one containment door in the reactor
building of one of India's six nuclear power stations off its
hinges on September 30, forcing authorities to shut down the
plant.
</P>
<P>
There was no radiation leakage at the plant when the five-ton
inner door came off its hinges due to "insufficient locking of the
pins" because of human error as the locking was not properly
checked.

<HEADLINE> China Plans for Massive Gas Production Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China expects to develop an
annual gas output of 100 billion cubic meters by the year 2020,
equivalent to 100 million tons of crude oil, and usher in a peak
gas production period, energy experts said today.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
estimate that China's proven natural gas reserve will increase by
an annual average 120 billion cubic meters between 2001 and 2020,
with gas utilization accounting for eight percent of China's
energy consumption, up from the present two percent.
</P>
<P>
China has started a nationwide gas pipeline construction, in a
bid to speed up gas development and use, said a CNPC source.
</P>
<P>
Priority has been given to laying gas pipelines extending from
major gas production bases in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region,
Sichuan province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to the
developed areas in northern and northeastern parts of China, as
well as to the Yangtze River and Zhujiang River deltas. Major
pipelines for gas supply to these areas are under construction.
</P>
<P>
So far, a long-distance gas pipeline running from Shaanxi to
Beijing has been completed and put into operation.

<HEADLINE> Senior Priest Says Foreigners Can Enjoy Religious Freedom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Shi Zesheng, vice-chairman of
the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Protestant Churches
in China, said that foreign visitors can enjoy religious freedom
in China. The "three-self" principles are self-administration,
self-support and self-propagation.
</P>
<P>
Responding to recent religious criticisms from the U.S. State
Department, Shi said that U.S. accusations were nothing but rumors
fabricated out of thin air. Shi added that some issues regarding
religious services attended by foreigners in China have been
distorted by the U.S. State Department Report.
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of religious services held at churches in China are
open to the public, including foreigners. Some churches even have
headphones that provide simultaneous translation."
</P>
<P>
"Some foreigners are baptized or are married in churches in
China. Many foreigners, including foreign clergymen have visited
churches in China."
</P>
<P>
Shi added that in Beijing some foreigners even organize their
own Sunday morning religious services. Neighborhood gatherings of
Christian followers do not need to register with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Religious gatherings that meet at fixed times and places on a
certain large scale are required to register for their own
protection. Registration does not mean interfering in the
religious freedom of these gatherings, he said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Megawati Soekarnoputri, New Indonesian Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Dyah Permata Megawati Setyawati
Soekarnoputri won the vice presidential election at a voting
conducted by the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
here on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Megawati is the eldest daughter of Soekarno, the late founding
president of the Republic of Indonesia, and general chairman of
the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI Perjuangan), the
largest party in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Megawati was born in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, on January
23, 1947. After finishing her primary and secondary education in
Jakarta from 1954 to 1963, she studied agriculture at the
Padjadjaran University in Bandung, West Java, from 1965 to 1967.
Then she studied philosophy at the Indonesian University in
Jakarta from 1970 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
Nurtured in the political atmosphere of her family, especially
the influence of her farther, Soekarno, Megawati was very
interested in politics when she was young. However, she had not
been able to be engaged in political activities for about 20 years
after Soeharto replaced her farther as the second president of
Indonesia in 1967. Megawati shot into fame when she helped the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to obtain votes in the 1987
general election. In 1993, she was elected general chairman of the
PDI.
</P>
<P>
However, Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership by a
government-backed group in 1996 at a congress held in Medan, North
Sumatera. The move led to riots in Jakarta later that year and
helped secure her position as a leading proponent of reform.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, Megawati was elected general chairman of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle when most PDI members
separated from the government-backed PDI led by Budi Hardjono.
</P>
<P>
Megawati was nominated by her party as presidential candidate
for the 1999/2004 period.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential election conducted by the MPR on Wednesday
afternoon, Megawati lost to Abdurrahman Wahid, the general
chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama.

<HEADLINE> China Red Cross Says Aid Offerings to Taiwan Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of China
(RCSC) said today it has not abandoned earthquake-relief efforts
for the people of Taiwan, even though neither materials nor
personnel have been permitted to enter the stricken area.
</P>
<P>
A RCSC official today announced a 500,000-U.S.-dollar donation
to its Taiwan counterpart, following offerings of 300,000 dollars
and 500,000 yuan-worth of relief materials.
</P>
<P>
Su Juxiang, secretary-general of the RCSC, said at a press
conference that the RCSC will "contact the Taiwan Red Cross
society to discuss further rescuing issues, and will spare no
efforts to provide help."
</P>
<P>
She hoped that about 30 million yuan (3.6 million dollars)
raised on the Chinese mainland will eventually reach and benefit
Taiwan people through the Red Cross organizations across the
Taiwan straits.
</P>
<P>
"The RCSC will be as always fully prepared for offering help,
although rescue personnel and materials cannot enter into the
island temporarily," said Su.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC said their efforts since a strong earthquake hit
Taiwan on September 21 have been recognized internationally.
George Weber, Secretary General of the International Federation of
the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said Tuesday in a letter
to the RCSC: "I appreciate the flexibility and sympathy manifested
by the Red Cross Society of China during this period."
</P>
<P>
The RCSC is helping some mainlanders reestablish contact with
relatives and friends in Taiwan. More than 200 people have asked
for the assistance.
</P>
<P>
Nine medical teams have been on standby since the tremor took
place, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su stressed that the Taiwan Red Cross organization is welcome
to dispatch medical personnel to the mainland to discuss epidemic
prevention and medical treatment issues "if they think it
necessary."

<HEADLINE> Estrada Describes Financial Crisis as "Wake-Up Call" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada described here Thursday the two-year-old financial crisis
as a "wake-up call" for Asia and called on countries in the region
to learn lessons from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a key-note speech at the 13th General Assembly of the
Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), which opened here
Thursday morning, Estrada said: "The difficulties of the past two
years served as a wake-up call not only for here but for the whole
world."
</P>
<P>
"The Asian region, which until the crisis was being cited --
and envied -- as a model for rapid economic growth, turned out to
be vulnerable to new shocks brought about by changing global
realities," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are at least two important lessons to be learned from the
recent crisis, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The first is the indispensability of reform, or structural
adjustments that prepare individual and regional economies for
globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial crisis highlighted the lack of
transparency, accountability and integrity as a major cause of the
collapse," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The second is that as the state withdraws from interventionism
and controls and gives way to market freedom, its role is not
reduced but redefined, he said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the structures we need to establish is a new global
financial architecture, with adequate supervision and surveillance
mechanisms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the global community should move toward closer
financial cooperation and work to develop internationally
agreed-upon code and standards for banking and financial systems.
</P>
<P>
The three-day PECC meeting will discuss various issues
concerning the development of the Asia-Pacific economy in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
According to the conference agenda, key issues to be discussed
at the meeting include a new global economic architecture,
challenges of governance and leadership, infrastructure and the
information revolution, sustainable cities and inter-regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
About 700 delegates from 23 PECC members and international
organizations are attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
The PECC is a unique partnership of senior individuals from
business, government and research, who work in a non-official
capacity, on practical policy issues to increase trade, investment
and economic development in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The PECC members include China, the United States, Japan,
Australia, Thailand, Peru, Russia and Chinese Taipei and Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Supports Bank Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu expressed Thursday his full support for the move
of some banks to merge among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said in a statement that the merger would strengthen
the banks' financial capability to compete with big foreign banks
that are actively operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu's statement came in response to the latest move of
Ayala Corporation and BPI Capital Corporation to acquire about 95
percent of the outstanding shares of Far East Bank and Trust
Company a few days earlier, which sent the market moving upward.
</P>
<P>
He said the merger is expected to boost bank capitalization
like what other foreign banks are currently doing worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Espiritu stressed, local banks, particularly those
saddled with liquidity problems due to an abnormal rise in
non-performing loans, will be reduced to small rural banks whose
resources are limited.
</P>
<P>
If this situation happens, the financial market will suffer and
so will many of the local businessmen who regularly borrow money
from these banks to sustain their business operations in order to
keep employment intact, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that with mergers, banks will tend
to closely compete among themselves in the market by offering
reasonable interest rates that are attractive to the millions of
depositors and borrowers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Such merger moves are in line with the recent order of the
Monetary Board, the highest policy-making body of the Central Bank
of the Philippines, which requires banks to meet certain capital
requirements in order to maintain their liquidity in the market.
</P>
<P>
The order of the central bank said those who fail to meet the
capital infusion requirements would be directed to either merge or
close their operations.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged to Abide By Nuclear-Free Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the Japanese
government will continue to abide by the three principles of non-
possession, non-production and non-importation of nuclear weapons,
said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the statement at a regular press conference when
asked to comment on the remarks by Japanese Vice Defense Minister
Shingo Nishimura that Japan should arm itself with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China was "greatly shocked" by the Japanese
official's remarks and has taken note of the handling of the issue
by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear policy, as known to all, has always been a sensitive,
major issue that has a great bearing on the future development of
Japan, Zhang noted, adding that the adherence to the three
principles of non-possession, non-production and non-importation
of nuclear weapons is a solemn commitment made by the Japanese
government to its people and the international community.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Japanese government will take concrete
measures to diffuse the negative reaction caused by Nishimura's
remarks and continue to honor the three principles so as to regain
the confidence of the international community, the spokeswoman
said.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania held a state
funeral Thursday for the founding father of the nation Julius
Nyerere at the National Stadium where foreign dignitaries paid
last respects to him.
</P>
<P>
A minute of silence was observed as President Benjamin Mkapa
lowered his head and the military band played the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
VIPs from more than 60 countries, including a dozen of heads of
state, lined up to pay last respects to Nyerere whose body lies in
state in a house constructed on a lawn.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Finland, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Burundi,
Malawi, Zambia, Rwanda, Nigeria and other countries, as well as
Princess Anne, daughter of British Queen Elizabeth II, were
present at the funeral, which was attended by tens of thousands of
Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Tanzanian National Assembly, Pius Msekwa,
recalled the life of Nyerere, praising his great achievements in
the liberation of Africa by offering shelter to freedom fighters
from other countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
A religious leader said at the funeral ceremony that Nyerere
should be remembered for his efforts in maintaining national
unity, peace and stability, as well as his spirit of showing care

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
planning to swap two senior diplomats dealing with the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Martin Indyk
is to return to Israel for a second stint as ambassador, while
current Ambassador Edward Walker is to replace Indyk in
Washington, the Jerusalem Post has learned.
</P>
<P>
The swap, confirmed by political sources, is seen as adjusting
to the specialization of each diplomat and to the new realities
and style of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak said this week that the date for pulling the Israeli
Defense Forces out of Lebanon is flexible, adding the withdrawal
might occur several months before schedule, or several months
afterward. He said he believes the army can withdraw within the
framework of an agreement with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Senior diplomatic sources in Israel and the U.S. predict that
the Lebanese issue will top the agenda of negotiations on the
Israeli-Syria channel, which are expected to resume within a
month or two.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Police Wednesday raided the home and office of former prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu on suspicion that he illegally kept
gifts presented to him while he was in office. Scores of valuable
items including pictures, gold and silver wares were seized.
</P>
<P>
The search was part of the ongoing investigation into the
allegation that Netanyahu had billed the government for private
house services a Jerusalem contractor provided him while he was
in power.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Settlement leaders continued with the dismantling of illegal
outposts Wednesday by taking down a water tower and a transport
container from a hilltop north of Ramallah. But defiant activists
erected a wooden synagogue at another outpost. Barak urged the
settler leaders to continue the evacuation as agreed upon last
week.

<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign
exchange reserves rose by 51.9 million U.S. dollars to 16.1
billion dollars as of October 15, from 16.04 billion dollars in
the previous week, Bank Indonesia said.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post Thursday quoted the central bank as saying in
its weekly report that the increase was attributed to revenues
from the country's oil exports and a disbursement of foreign
loans.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves level was above the 14-billion-dollar
adjusted net international reserves target set by the
International Monetary Fund, the weekly report said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia also said the country's gross international
reserves, which are net foreign exchange reserves plus outstanding
foreign exchange contracts, had risen to 27 billion dollars by
October 15 from 26.94 billion dollars in the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Reverses Decision to Close 3 Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Malawi has rescinded its
decision to close its diplomatic missions in Kenya, Namibia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Malawi said that its missions in Nairobi,
Windhoek and Tokyo would be closed by the end of 1999 due to
financial hardship, The Post said.
</P>
<P>
But after thorough consideration, the Malawian government has
realized that the "end justifies the means," Secretary for Foreign
Affairs Ziddy Medi was quoted as saying by a Zambian newspaper
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"From the resources we have, we looked where we could get
maximum benefit and representation in the world," the Malawian
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we realized we do get a lot of benefits from these
 countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Medi said his government scrutinized the Japan mission, which
is the most expensive to run, and discovered that the returns from
it are more than the expenditure.
</P>
<P>
He said when the Malawian authorities initially notified their
Japanese counterparts of the decision to close down the office,
the Japanese responded:"You must be out of your mind."
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign ministry official said that the Malawian
government has instructed its missions aboard to cut down on their
expenditure by scaling down on staff and asking staffers to live
modestly.

Loyalist Movement.
</P>
<P>
Workers arriving at ARM's inner-city Park Street offices

KUNMING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Tourism in China's northwest
Xinjiang Ugyur Autonomous Region has developed rapidly in the past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang had 1.92 million overseas tourists from 1978 to 1998,
with an annual average increase of 47.4 percent. Its foreign
exchange earnings from tourism were worth 531 million U.S. dollars,
an average increase of 45.4 percent. This information was reported
at the '99 Kunming International Horticulture Exposition, which is
still going on.
</P>
<P>
More than 6.15 million Chinese tourists visited Xinjiang last
year and provided 5.5 billion yuan in earnings. Tourism as a
proportion of the region's GDP went from 0.1 percent in 1978 to 5.
6 percent in 1998 and the regional government has listed tourism
as a pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has an abundance of tourism resources, with its vast
deserts, snowy mountains, lakes, and convenient transportation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Faces Food Shortage amid Drought, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-eight out of the 45
districts in Uganda are facing severe food shortages due to
drought and insurgency.
</P>
<P>
The national government needs a total of 44 billion shillings
(15 million U.S. dollars) to avert the shortage, Ugandan Minister
of Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Tom Butime said in a
statement submitted to parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the country have been suffering from drought
since March, the New Vision daily Thursday quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Insecurity in some districts where rebels are active is also
held responsible for the chronic lack of food there.
</P>
<P>
Though having so many lakes, Uganda often suffers from drought
due to lack of irrigation works. Most farmers have to rely solely
on rainfalls for the food crops.
</P>
<P>
The districts worst hit by food shortages are Kabale, Nebbi,
Arua, Moyo, Kitgum, Lira, Kisoro in western and northern Uganda,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The northern districts have been subject to rebel attacks since
1986 when the ruling National Resistance Movement came to power.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Oilfield Exploits Offshore Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Shengli Oilfield, China's
second largest, has pumped 6.6 million tons of crude oil from the
Bohai Sea over the past six years, making the area the largest
offshore oilfield in the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this is a major breakthrough in the national effort
to use offshore oil reserves to balance a drop in inland
production.
</P>
<P>
Shengli was set up in 1964 at the mouth of the Yellow River and
has since produced 640 million tons of crude oil, or more than a
fourth of the country's total since 1949. In recent years, its
annual output has been dwindling because of shrinking oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Explorations indicate that there is an oilfield with geological
reserves of 310 million tons under the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Shengli began offshore operations ten years ago and has since
built 50 drilling platforms and laid more than 50 km of pipelines.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Grottos of Tang Dynasty Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered four Buddhist grottos which can be dated back to the
Tang Dynasty (618-970) near the famous Longmen Grottos in Luoyang,
central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Four Buddhist statues were found in the grottos which were
carved out of a 260-meter-high cliff, according to the
archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
Also discovered were gutters and a drain spout, the first of
the kind ever found in China and believed to be used to prevent
water from seeping into the grottos.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists said that the newly-discovered grottos will
enrich the Longmen Grottos and benefit the study of statue carving
and grotto protection.
</P>
<P>
The Longmen Grottos, one of China's three most renowned
collection of rock carvings, were completed over a period of years
from the Northern Wei (386-534) and running through the Sui (581-
618), Tang (618-970), Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368)
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The grottos feature more than 2,100 niches, some 40 Buddhist
pagodas, 100,000 statues of Buddha, and 3,600 inscribed tablets.

<HEADLINE> Renowned Lebanese Singer to Stand Trial for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Renowned Lebanese composer and
singer Marcel Khalife next month will face trial on charges of
"defaming" Islam by putting a Koranic verse to music, the Daily
Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khalife, who might be sentenced to six months to three years in
prison if found guilty, will be tried on November 3, the paper
quoted a judicial announcement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I will be there to express my view. The trial will be open and
I urge all intellectuals and journalists to attend," Khalife told
the paper.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready for all possibilities. I'll go to prison if I have
to. But I insist that I did not do anything wrong."
</P>
<P>
Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Qabbani, Lebanon's highest Sunni
community leader, was behind the lawsuit that was originally filed
in 1996, a year after Khalife issued the song "I am Yussef, oh
Father."
</P>
<P>
The lyrics of the song, published by Palestinian poet Mahmoud
Darwish in 1992, end with a quote from the Koranic account of the
plight of biblical figure Joseph.
</P>
<P>
The poem compares the oppression of Palestinians in some Arab
states to Joseph's suffering from mistreatment by his brothers as
was told in both the Koran and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
After triggering a wave of denunciations by intellectuals in
1996, the judicial proceedings were stopped a short time later,
reportedly on orders by the then-prime minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Islam dictates that verses from the Koran can be read or
chanted only according to traditional style known as "Tajweed."
Any improvisation is considered blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
The case was brought up again by Chief Beirut Investigating
Magistrate AbdelRahman Chehab on October 1, the first day of the
judicial year.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 lawyers have volunteered to defend Khalife, a
source at the Bar Association said.

<HEADLINE> HK Hutchison Accepts Offer From German Mannesmann AG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based Hutchison
Whampoa LTD Thursday announced that it has agreed to accept a
conditional offer to be made by the German company Mannesmann AG
for all the shares in Orange plc.
</P>
<P>
Mannesmann will acquire over 537 million shares of Orange owned
by Hutchison, representing 44.81 percent of the issued capital of
Orange, for about 113 billion HK dollars (14.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in cash, notes and shares of Mannesmann, if the offer
becomes unconditional, a spokesman for Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison is expected to be the single largest shareholder of
Mannesmann upon completion of this transaction with a total 10
percent of the pro forma enlarged issued share capital of
Mannesmann by receiving as part of the consideration for the offer,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the offer, Hutchison will receive 16.29
pounds (211.43 HK dollars) per Orange share, consisting of 9.89
pounds (128.34 HK dollars) in Mannesmann shares, 3.20 pounds (41.
53 HK dollars) in cash and 3.20 pounds (41.53 HK dollars) in notes.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stocks surged 3 percent to close at 12,498.56 points
Wednesday at the news of a potential purchase for Hutchison
Whampoa LTD's 44.81 stake in Orange plc.
</P>
<P>
The directors of Orange considered the terms of the offer to be
fair and reasonable and agreed unanimously to recommend that
Orange shareholders accept the offer, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"This landmark transaction will, if Mannesmann's offer becomes
unconditional, create a powerful partnership between two of the
strongest wireless network operators in Europe," the Hutchison
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison, a conglomerate headquartered in Hong Kong, is
engaged in five core businesses, including port and related
services, telecommunications, property development and holdings,
retail, manufacturing and other services, and energy and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the company's consolidated turnover was over 51.3
billion HK dollars (6.6 billion U.S. dollars) and after-tax
earnings were some 8.7 billion HK dollars (1.1 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Orange has been an excellent investment for Hutchison, and
this transaction will allow us to realize a portion of our
investment in Orange, but more importantly, give us a meaningful
position in a much larger telecommunications platform," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mannesmann, based in Duesseldorf, Germany, is one of the
strongest companies in Europe, and has one of the largest
telecommunications footprints in the continent, covering Germany,
France and Italy.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Law to Protect Marital Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A draft of a new Marriage and
Family Law discussed at a China Law Symposium recently in east
China's Jiangxi Province will deal with the controversial matter
of extra-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
The term "spousal rights" has been adopted as an important
measure to protect families and right of the husband and wife.
Spousal rights is a personal right of both husband and wife,
explained Prof. Wu Changzhen of the China University of Political
Science and Law who co-drafted the new law.
</P>
<P>
According to the new draft, spousal rights include the right to
choose your surname and personal name, the right to personal
freedom, the right to bear child and rights of both parents.
</P>
<P>
The Marriage Law currently in force includes some contents of
the "spousal rights" although the term "spousal rights" does not
appear.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, extra-marital affairs will be illegal
because they violate the rights of the spouse. The injured party
is entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Li Zhongfang of the Procurators' College, said that
providing guidance is an importance part of the law. But, Wu
Xiaofang, a judge in the Supreme People's Court insisted that
loyalty is a moral matter and not a legal one. This reflects ideas
common among some young people.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Yang Dawen of the People's University of China said that
it is absolutely necessary that the law provides rules on property
ownership because incomes and economic relations are becoming
increasingly complex. Those drafting the law said they hope that
people will make property ownership clear when they register to
marry. Most Chinese did not talk openly about property ownership
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Some young couples in China now go to notaries before they
marry to make these matters clear, but many others are still
opposed to this.
</P>
<P>
According to Prof. Yang, the revised Marriage and Family Law
Draft will shed new light on marital relations.

The number of the elderly has been increasing at an annual rate

It could shoot up to as high as 400 million by the middle of

China began setting up special institutions since the early

institutes have contributed a great deal to the treatment and
prevention of diseases among the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Effective Actions to Be Taken to Prevent AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua)-- Beijing-based newspapers quoted
doctors and health officials here Wednesday that China must
educate its people about limiting the spread of AIDS, as the fatal
disease gains ground now.
</P>
<P>
The officials spoke to 16 Beijing-based media outlets in a
symposium about public AIDS prevention and control as well as
public communication.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Health indicate that in the
first half of the year 13,913 people in China were infected with
HIV-the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, or
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Some 241 people died of AIDS
in the first six months of this year in China.
</P>
<P>
In all,experts estimated, China now has as many as 400,000 HIV
carriers, among which some 70 percent contracted the virus through
intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
The experts also predict that the number may exceed 1 million
by year 2000, unless China takes effective actions to prevent the
spread of the incurable disease.
</P>
<P>
Liu Kangmai, an official of the Health Ministry and an expert
on HIV/AIDS, said most confirmed victims of the disease were
reported to be farmers living in Yunnan and Henan provinces and
Xinjiang Uygar and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Although the incidence of HIV in China is low compared with
other countries, it could turn into a huge sarcomata of the
society if the government fails to take immediate precautions, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
A swift increase in the number of patients with sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) indicates that HIV/AIDS could spread
more quickly in China.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that prevention was the best way to control the
disease since there were no effective treatments for or vaccines
to prevent HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Dr Wang Liqiu, who is also an official of UNAIDS, said
traditionally the topic of sex is still regarded as a taboo in
this country, so education should be positive, focus on safer sex
and give publicity to the AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
Some media complained that it is hard for them to interview
AIDS victims, because local governments always think the exposure
of such cases will damage their images.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Melting glaciers on the Tibetan
Plateau caused by global warming are threatening the ecology of
the Tibet Autonomous Region, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has 27,400 sq. km. of glaciers, accounting for 46.7
percent of the country's total glaciers' area. The melting has
caused the evaporation of surface water, increasing rainfall and
raising the level of rivers during the flood season and increasing
water and soil erosion in parts of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, global temperatures have been rising.

<HEADLINE> Giving More Tibetans Access To TV And Radio Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven out of every ten people in
northwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region will have access to
radio programs and 63.6 percent will have access to TV programs
when some transmitters are completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, only 65 percent of the Tibetans had access to radio
broadcasts and 55 percent had access to TV, according to Li Yongfa,
the director of the autonomous region's broadcast department.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of Tibetans are farmers and herdsmen, mostly
living in remote areas and China's Central Government wants to
give all villages access to broadcasts within five years. It has
spent 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) on the
project and four million yuan has been allocated to subsidize five
poverty-stricken counties in Tibet, Li says.
</P>
<P>
Broadcasts have played an important role in helping Tibet's
economic development and in maintaining social stability over the

<HEADLINE> Building Forest Belt Along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Qinghai Province has
spent 20 million yuan building a 153,000-hectare forest belt along
the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River starts in Qinghai and three of its main
tributaries run through Qinghai, watering a total area of 160,000
square kilometers, or a fifth of the province's total territory.
But, because of its high elevation, low temperatures, and harsh
climate, its forest coverage is a mere 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
To protect the environment at the river'd source, the province
began building a forest belt in 1989 to raise the forest coverage
along the river to 2.5 percent. It has built a 40-hectare nursery
and has planted 1.5 million trees. Trees have been planted on 146,
000 ha. of land, according to Bao Yuling, a provincial forestry
official.

<HEADLINE> China Confronts Market-Oriented Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey by the National
Bureau of Statistics indicates 44 percent of Chinese people,
whether urban or rural, now save most for their children's college
education, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
Today parents spend as much as 42.8 percent of their savings on
their children's education, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
This year China carried out a further relaxed enrollment quota
system to satisfy people's growing demand for college education,
and some colleges raised tuition to obscene heights and some
colleges lowered admission scores only to collect more money from
unqualified students.
</P>
<P>
The unqualified students have to pay as much as an extra 100,
000 yuan (US$12,000), up from the 3,000 yuan (US$360) paid by
normally admitted students.
</P>
<P>
Current tuition are still too low and that students can afford
more, a college official was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
But according to the 1998 edition of China Almanac, the per
capita disposable income for Chinese farmers is 2,090 yuan (US$252)
a year, and actually farmers only have 483 yuan (US$58) left after
deducting annual expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Experts worry that today rural children cannot go to college
not because they fail academically but because they are in poor
families, and these experts also suggest the State help strike a
balance between the interests of individuals and colleges so
college enrollment is based more on merit than money.
</P>
<P>
A professor said, "We cannot go to another extreme and insist
that China's institutions operate like welfare agencies, because
this approach is neither realistic nor sustainable."

<HEADLINE> Muslim Countries Urged to Play Active Role in World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday urged
Muslim countries to launch a concerted effort in playing an active
role in the world economy as the ummah (Muslim communities) cannot
be passive recipients of globalization.
</P>
<P>
In a world that is increasingly becoming dominated by a few
Western countries and corporations, the ummah must stand up and be
counted through the promotion of development and prosperity among
Muslim communities, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said when launching the Islamic Development Bank's 25th
anniversary celebration here.
</P>
<P>
"If we stand by and accept what is forced on us, we will end up
worse off," he said, adding what was required was nothing short of
a revolution in the thinking of Muslim countries as they must
realize that the religion and Islamic civilization would be
threatened if they were shut out from directing the pace of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said while free trade was to be welcomed it could not
be held up at the expense of the well-being of Muslim communities.
</P>
<P>
In order to secure a more equitable world economy, Muslim
countries must encourage free trade among one another and plan for
greater trade cooperation to take advantage of their competitive
advantages, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped to see trade facilitation assistance in the form of
bilateral payment arrangement since such a mechanism could reduce
the burden of trade on the less developed Muslim countries by
exposing them to minimal foreign exchange dealings.
</P>
<P>
He said the IDB could encourage such an arrangement for trading
purposes among member countries.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also urged Muslim countries to work together toward
strengthening the domestic capacity of their respective economies,
saying emphasis must be placed on education and human resource
development because without human capital, physical development
would be meaningless.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Starts Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
started a nationwide dawn-to-dusk hartal (destructive strike)
Thursday morning to protest against "Indian aggression" and press
for the immediate resignation of the government and an early
general election.
</P>
<P>
This is the 12th hartal program of the opposition this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,500 police and Bangladesh Rifles personnel have
been deployed across the capital city for maintaining law and
order during the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The deployment began Wednesday night in certain areas of the
city defined as "trouble spots," The Daily Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
To drum up support for the strike, the alliance comprising the
major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya
Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic
Solidarity Front), organized rallies and processions in the
capital city Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In southeastern Bangladesh's Chittagong district, at least 50
people were injured, 40 vehicles damaged and 16 opposition
activists arrested during a clash between BNP workers and police
Wednesday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance is expected to announce fresh agitation
programs in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the strike at a public meeting on October 11, leader
of the opposition in Parliament and the BNP Khaleda Zia said the
government had "totally failed to make protest" against the
aggression by Indian border security forces in the frontier areas
where many innocent Bangladeshis were shot dead in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Destructive strikes are very common in Bangladesh, where
opposition parties call strikes to oppose the ruling party while
the latter adopts anti-strike activities, often resulting in
clashes and causing heavy economic losses.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Speed up Enforcement of Ban on Long-tail Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Harbor Department of
Thailand announced it will speed up the enforcement of a ban on
long-tail boats plying the Chao Phya River by May 2001, The Nation
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed Monday's capsize of a long-tail boat
in the river, in which five people, including four Singaporean
tourists, died.
</P>
<P>
The ban took effect in May this year but its enforcement was
delayed owing to the economic crisis, Preecha Petchwong, director
of Waterways Transport Inspection, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 500 long-tail boats of the kind
that capsized are operating in the Chao Phya River in Bangkok and
neighboring provinces. Many of the boats serve local and foreign
passengers for tourism purposes but others have been the only
means of transport for people living along the river and its
canals.
</P>
<P>
Citing transport safety, the department imposed rules against
the use of long-tail boats for commuter services in main
waterways.
</P>
<P>
"But the issuing of new rules coincided with the economic
downturn, so the authorities agreed to delay the enforcement for
two years so as not to exacerbate the economic woes," Preecha
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the department had campaigned to raise safety
awareness among boat operators, pending a full ban on their
service.
</P>
<P>
To phase out the long-tail boats, the department would not
renew their operating licenses upon expiry.
</P>
<P>
The locally-modified, long-tail boats, popular for speed and
economy, were considered unsafe for passenger transport in main
waterways because they could easily capsize due to the placement
of a big outboard motor on the slim-bodied, small craft.
</P>
<P>
According to the Harbor Department's regulation, the boat
engine should be placed in the mid-section of the craft to improve
passenger safety.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Nationalized Commercial Banks Burdened With Bad Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's nationalized
commercial banks (NCBs) have been burdened with increasing bad
debts, despite the financial sector's reform program aimed at
reducing the bad debts of the country's ailing banking system, The
Daily Star Business reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The classified loans of the country's four NCBs bloated by 6.60
percentage points to 46.98 percent of their total loans in six
months from December 31, 1998 to June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sonali Bank, the largest NCB, was going through its worst-ever
time with 50.09 percent of the total loans becoming classified,
against 41.1 percent in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Janata Bank had the lowest 41.28 percent classified loans,
despite a rise of 8.53 percentage points during the six-month
period.
</P>
<P>
Agrani Bank had 47.63 percent classified loans, up from 44.13
percent at the end of 1998, and Rupali Bank's classified loans was
45.32 percent, higher than 42.47 percent in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The four NCBs faced a total of 36 billion taka (720 million
U.S. dollars) provision shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
The classified loans of the banking system as a whole increased
by 3.83 percentage points to 43.07 percent during the six-month
period, surging by 10.91 percentage points year-on-year till June
30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The specialized banks, at the same time, had a 4.78
percentage-point rise in their classified loans during the period,
with the classified loans accounting for 67.93 percent of their
total loans as on June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the private commercial banks have improved their
balance sheets through rigorous supervision and caution, reducing
their classified loans from 32.98 percent in December 1998 to
28.98 percent in June this year, while only 4.19 percent of the
total loans of foreign commercial banks have turned classified.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Benefits From Hosting APEC Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- "New Zealand is now in a
great position to capitalize on the massive international media
coverage that meetings of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
generated for New Zealand," NZ Minister for International Trade
Lockwood Smith said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I expect that New Zealand will achieve very significant
long-term tourism benefits from its hosting of APEC," he added in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The past year has seen a series of APEC meetings in New
Zealand, including the 7th informal meeting of APEC leaders, which
was held last month in Auckland, the biggest city in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Smith welcomed a sharp increase of international visitor
arrivals to New Zealand in the year from October 1998 to September
1999.
</P>
<P>
"International visitor arrivals to New Zealand have reached a
new all time high of 1,566,441 arrivals in the year ended
September 1999, an increase of 7.5 percent over the previous
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in international visitor arrivals has important
tangible benefits for New Zealand in terms of jobs and business
opportunities for New Zealanders. Research shows that each
international visitor spends an average of 2,640 NZ dollars (1,372
U.S. dollars) while in New Zealand, meaning that the additional
arrivals over the past year may have contributed as much as 287
million NZ dollar (149 million U.S. dollar) additional foreign
exchange earnings for New Zealand," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He praised New Zealand's tourism industry for making a very
solid contribution to the country's economy.

resolution of problems between the bloc members possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Uruguayan minister, Mercosur economies now
tend to function normally, ending the tendency to decline as
witnessed in the first semester.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Brazil devalued its currency and Mercosur
members struggled to fend off its worst recession in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In late July, Argentina threw Mercosur into a crisis when it
threatened to impose import quotas on shoes, clothes and textiles
from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, a customs union of 200 million people that
encompasses Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and is
associated with Chile and Bolivia, is the world's third largest
trade bloc.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Badminton Team Set For Asia Cup Title Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
are set for a title defense in the Asian Cup badminton team
championship, to be held in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, next month.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will face rivalry from traditionally tough China,
Malaysia and South Korea. China were absent from Jakarta two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to compete in Vietnam with the strongest team,
hoping we can retain the championship," Leo Wiranata, the general
secretary of the Indonesian Badminton Federation, said.
</P>
<P>
"The championship will be a good opportunity for us to gauge
how the players perform against other Asian opponents. Such a test
case has already been programmed ahead of the Thomas Cup next year,
" he was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Leo conceded that China must be a tough team to beat as they
have been showing formidable improvement, especially after the
Thomas Cup last year.
</P>
<P>
Both Malaysia and South Korea's firepower have matched
Indonesia's in the singles and doubles categories.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the inaugural championship at the expense of
Malaysia in the
finals in Jakarta two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming task, according to Leo, will be a bit harder
because, apart from its being held at a neutral venue -- Vietnam --
the participating countries are expected to send their top players.
</P>
<P>
The championship will provide 100,000 U.S. dollars in cash
prizes with the winners earning 50,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The competition will be staged in the Phan Ding Phung indoor
stadium from November 10 to 14.

LHASA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The average per capita income of

The output value of the city's township enterprises for the

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, October 21 (Xinhua) --A Chinese zoology professor says
that new pig breeding methods during the early developmental stage
of the animal will make it possible one day to clone pigs and
transplant their organs into human bodies.
</P>
<P>
Tan Jinghe, a professor at Northeast China Agricultural
University in Heilongjiang Province says that although it was an
arduous task they finally succeeded recently. The next stage is to
implant these somatic cells into sows for reproduction.
</P>
<P>
The somatic cells were implanted in a female hare's oviduct for
further development. This means that it is possible for other
animals to develop a piglet and it also suggests that zoologists
may be able to clone pigs from human genes in the future and to
solve problems that occur in transplanting pig organs into human
beings.

JAKARTA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Golkar Party has
nominated the party's General Chairman Akbar Tandjung to run for
the vice presidency, the party's spokesman Fadel Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Akbar for the vice presidency was an
unanimous decision to fulfill the wish of the party's leadership
meeting, Fadel was quoted by the Antara News Agency Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Another member of Golkar Party faction in the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) Ekky Syahruddin said if Akbar was
elected vice president, he would relinquish his post as house
speaker.
</P>
<P>
Akbar was elected house speaker on October 5.
</P>
<P>
Akbar's bid for the vice presidency had the support of
newly-elected President Abdurrahman Wahid and losing presidential
hopeful Megawati Soekarnoputri, whose Indonesian Democratic Party
of Struggle emerged as the front-runner in the June general
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, I feel that I have enjoyed the high honor to
assume the post of house speaker. But because of a request from my
colleagues and the two national figures, I am prepared to contest
the vice presidential race," Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Wahid's support for his vice presidential
candidacy, Akbar said the support was the result of a series of
informal meetings a few days and a few hours earlier, including
the meeting with Megawati after the new president was sworn in on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Muslim-based United Development Party (PPP)
faction in the MPR gave a mandate to the party's leader Hamzah Haz
to approach the Axis Force to nominate him as the only candidate
for the vice presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"We have granted Hamzah a mandate to do his best to approach
the Axis Force and succeed in contesting the vice presidential
election," PPP executive Ali Hardi Kiyaidemak said.
</P>
<P>
Besides PPP, the Axis Force include the National Mandate Party,
the Justice Party and the Crescent Star Party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Military (TNI) spokesman Maj. Gen.
Sudrajat has said that if the majority of the 11 factions in MPR
wished to nominate Defense Minister General Wiranto for the vice
presidency, the TNI would be ready to give him up for the vice
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
The 700-member MPR will choose a vice president on Thursday
morning.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The daily transit of
175,000 barrels of petroleum by way of the Cano Limon-Covenas oil
pipeline has been interrupted since last Saturday due to guerrilla
activities, said the Colombian Petroleum Company on Wednesday.

Troops from the Colombian Army arriving in the area found the
zone mined and two soldiers injured. Technicians from the
petroleum company have been unable to replace the damaged pipes.

The National Liberation Army, Colombia's second largest rebel
group, said their objective in attacking the pipeline is to oust

<HEADLINE> Russia Suspects Egyptian of Supporting Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian secret services have
exposed an Egyptian man who financed Chechen guerrillas, a source
from the Federal Security Service (FSB) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The man, named Sayed el-Maban, is also suspected by Russian
special services of complicity in terrorist attacks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He has been running a private business in Russia for several
years. He married a Russian woman and has adopted Russian
citizenship. However, "After bombings were committed in Moscow, he
urgently left the country," Federal Security Service Public
Relations Center head Alexander Zdanovich told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Zdanovich said el-Maban attended the Congress of the Peoples
of Ichkeria and Dagestan on December 19, 1998, and gave Shamil
Basayev, leader of the Chechen armed rebels, $200,000 to finance
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Zdanovich said El-Maban wrote off that amount from his company
's accounts as "providing food to fasting Dagestanis."
</P>
<P>
Zdanovich added that Russian Security Services are looking for
el-Maban under the help of Egyptian secret services and making a
great efforts to apprehend him.

<HEADLINE> Peace Sign Appears in Somalia: Italian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Progress has been made toward kick-
starting a peace process in Somalia, an Italian senior official
said here Wednesday, during a meeting of the Inter-governmental
Authority for the Development of African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The situation which has developed in two northern areas of
Somalia, Somaliland and Puntland, opens up new peace prospects for
the country and could be the start of a real turnaround," said
Rino Serri, head of the Authority's Somali division, who is
chairing the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Serri said that the two Somali regions "had emerged from the
state of anarchy and chaos which continue to afflict the rest of
the country and could therefore provide a launching pad for a
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the international community attending the
meeting noted that there appeared to be greater agreement between
some fighting factions in Somalia on the need for a return to
peace, but reiterated that the international community was against
any secessionist demands.
</P>
<P>
Serri announced that a plan of action for launching the peace
process would be drawn up and discussed at the Authority's next
meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the international ban against the selling
of arms to Somali had to be respected.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Lifts Ban on Pig Imports from U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of Commerce
and Industrial Development (SECOFI) of Mexico on Wednesday placed
offset quotas on live pig imports from the United States, and the
measure, adopted after local pig production was threatened, will
take effect next day.
</P>
<P>
The compensatory quotas will be 0.351 U.S. dollar per kilogram,
and will be applied to imports of live pigs weighing between 50
and 110 kilograms. The move indicated that Mexico will resume
imports of pigs from the U.S., which have been banned since
February 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
Mexico imposed punitive taxes on pig imports from the U.S.
following a dumping investigation ending on March 31, 1998, at the
request of the Mexican Council for Pork Products, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
SECOFI explained that the compensatory quotas and tariffs,
covering imports of pigs produced in the U.S. and other countries,
will be implemented by the Finance and Public Credit Secretariat.

<HEADLINE> Italian, Greek FMs Agree On EU Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini and his Greek counterpart, George Papandreou, Wednesday
agreed here on the importance of the recent European Union
decision to begin membership negotiations with countries initially
classed as second-phase candidates and to grant Turkey the status
of official candidate.
</P>
<P>
During the two ministers' talks, Dini underscored the need for
Turkey to be firmly anchored to the EU in such a way that the
union's requirement for changes in certain aspects of Turkish
society, notably in the area of human rights, was not abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who arrived here Wednesday, said that despite his
country's history of tensions with Turkey, Athens supported the
attitude developing in Brussels with regard to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for progress in human rights, in
Turkish-Greek relations and in particular on the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister observed the status of candidate for EU
membership would be an incentive to Turkey to push ahead on all
these issues.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that greater efforts should be made to
strengthen the EU's Mediterranean dimension, principally through
the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation program launched in Barcelona
in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the Balkans, Dini and Papandreou reiterated the need for a
full implementation of the United Nations Security Council
resolution calling for a multi-ethnic Kosovo within the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of the Stability Pact for
southeastern Europe, the ministers also stressed that sanctions
against Serbia would be counterproductive because they would
strike primarily at civilians.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on International Financial System at London Banquet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
spoke here Wednesday of the need to reform the international
financial system so as to promote a stable development of the
international banking business.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the welcoming dinner hosted in his honor by Lord
Mayor of the City of London, Jiang noted the financial crisis that
has hit several countries and regions in recent years has revealed
the salient problems within the international financial structure.
</P>
<P>
"The world situation is undergoing profound and significant
changes. The rapidly developing science and technology and the
growing trend towards economic globalization and multipolarity are
reshaping the economic, cultural and political life of mankind,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that these developments and changes have presented
people all over the world with fresh opportunities of development
as well as new challenges.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is on a state visit to Britain, said
effective measures must be taken to improve the supervision and
regulation of international capital flow, contain the
over-speculation of international hot money and enhance the
capabilities to forecast, prevent, ward off and bail out of
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to discuss how to establish a new
international financial order that conforms to the interest of all
through dialogue and consultations between developed and
developing countries in accordance with the principle of equality
and mutual benefit and on the basis of extensive participation of
the world community," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China is ready to work together with Britain and other
countries to this end.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the economic situation in China, Jiang said China
is steadily advancing its financial reform in an effort to improve
its financial supervision and regulation mechanism, ensure a safe
and stable operation of its banking industry and enhance its
capability to ward off financial risks.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts have played a significant role in maintaining a
good situation in reform, development and stability," he said. The
president said that China will expand financial cooperation with
other countries in accordance with the principle of incremental
progress and equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that by working together we can make even
greater progress in our cooperation in the economic, trade and
financial fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the cooperation between China and Britain in the field of
finance, the president voiced appreciation for the role the City
of London played in the financial cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, there has emerged a good momentum of
development in China-UK relations, with increased contacts and
exchanges and expanded cooperation," he said. "The City of London
has played a positive role in promoting the growth of the
bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
Proposing a toast earlier at the banquet, Lord Mayor spoke
highly of the changes China has undergone in the past 20 years of
reform and opening-up which he called an unprecedented revolution
both in terms of thinking and practice.

<HEADLINE> Bergkamp in no Rush to Agree New Deal with Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Bergkamp has been
prepared to let his Arsenal contract run out before deciding
whether he wants to stay at Highbury for the remainder of his
career or return to the Netherlands and finish where he started
with a top club.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp has just over 18 months left on his deal with Arsenal
on which new terms were negotiated two years ago, giving him a pay
packet of around 30,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
No moves have been made by either the club or the 7.5 million
pounds striker to draw up another fresh agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp admitted: "I'm happy to leave it until the end of the
season or even next season because I really don't know at this
moment what I want to do.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman, who revealed he is likely to quit international
football after the Euro 2000 finals next summer, has found solace
and contentment in England after a nightmare two years in Italy
with Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
He says: "I'm happy here and not sure I would want to go to
another country, or even my home country.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 30 now and not really a player for the future. So I'm not
surprised that Arsenal have not made me another offer yet. It's
too early to decide and you have to keep an open mind.
</P>
<P>
And Arsenal are quite clearly also comfortable with that
situation. Manager Arsene Wenger has confirmed: "It is not a
priority for me to think about players' contracts at this time
when we are playing important matches."

<HEADLINE> UAE Urges U.S. to Help in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Wednesday urged the United States to use its influence to
push forward the Middle East peace process so that security and
stability could prevail in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ways should be found to overcome the difficulties hindering
talks between the Palestinians and Israel to reach a final
solution in accordance with agreements concluded between the two
sides, said Sheikh Muhammad Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai Crown
Prince and UAE Defense Minister in a meeting with visiting
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
As a major sponsor of the peace process, the U.S. can exercise
its influence to achieve a tangible progress in building
confidence and peace in the Middle East, Sheikh Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
He also discussed with Cohen ways to enhance relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Dubai Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day,
he met with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan and
his eldest son in the capital Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are close to concluding a deal on UAE's
buying of 80 U.S. F-16 war planes, a deal worth more than 7
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is the fourth leg of Cohen's Middle East tour which has
taken him to Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. He is expected to
leave for Cairo on Thursday morning for a visit to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Aston Villa Signs Carbone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa completed signing on
Wednesday of Italian striker Benito Carbone from Premiership
rivals Sheffield Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Carbone's initial contract with Villa will run until the end of
June next year, but both Villa boss John Gregory and Carbone
hinted that they could eventually thrash out a longer term
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Villa have paid a nominal fee for the 28-year-old former Inter
Milan ace and further payments will be made when Carbone has made
a set number of appearances for Villa.
</P>
<P>
Carbone is now set to make an immediate debut for Villa against
Wimbledon at Villa Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said: "We have a chance to impress Benito and equally
he has the same chance to impress us.
</P>
<P>
"I have said in the past that we have been lacking a bit of
guile in the final third of the pitch and hopefully Benito's
arrival can help us to overcome this.
</P>
<P>
"He might not be the tallest of players, but he more than makes
up for that with his skill and that is something that we need.
</P>
<P>
Signing him initially on this basis was the best option, but,
if things go well over the next few months, we could be sitting
down to discuss his future before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
"Benito may have had a few problems off the pitch at Sheffield
Wednesday, but he is always fully committed when he plays and that
is how I judge all of my players, he will be as committed as the
rest of the team."
