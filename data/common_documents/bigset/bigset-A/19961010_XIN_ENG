<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is investing
more in high technology to its armed forces, the International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Defense is planning to enhance its
capability in advanced munitions, battlefield surveillance,
strategic mobility and the readiness of reserve forces," the IISS
said in its annual report on the state of the world's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
"The number of U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft capable of
delivering precision-guided munitions has been significantly
increased," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The joint direct attack munition and the joint stand-off
weapon are now being developed and will provide the capability for
virtually all combat aircraft to deliver accurate weapons by day
and by night, and in all weather conditions," it added.
</P>
<P>
Improved guidance technology is being introduced between 1997
and 2003 into the anti-armor capability of the Apache helicopter,
the army tactical missile system and 155mm artillery ammunition,
according to the IISS.
</P>
<P>
"Numerous improvements to command, control, communications,
computers and intelligence for naval, land and air forces will be
implemented," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The concentration on new technology will ensure the U.S. armed
forces remain the most powerful in the world, IISS scholars said.

CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake with a magnitude of
5.7 hit Egypt this afternoon with its epicenter in the
Mediterranean off the southern coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of damage or casualty.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which lasted for nearly one minute, was centered in
eastern Mediterranean, Egyptian Minister of State for Scientific
Research Venus Gouda was quoted by Egypt's news agency MENA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was some 500 kilometers from the Helwan
Observatory, about 30 kilometers south of Cairo, Gouda said.
</P>
<P>
The observatory earlier put the tremor at 5.7 on Richter
scale.
</P>
<P>
Inhabitants in Cairo felt the tremor as it occurred at about
15:15 local time (13:15 GMT), and some frightened people ran out
of buildings onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
The tremor was also felt in Cyprus, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria,

a straigh-set defeat to world number two Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
of Spain in the second round of the 450,000 U.S. dollars
Filderstadt tournament on Wednesday.

ace, which was ruled in by the umpire after the line-judge had
called it out, and an unforced groundstroke error by Capriati.
</P>

UNITED NATIONS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal today urged
industrialized nations to open their markets to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the general debate at the current United Nations
General Assembly, Praksh Chandra lohani, minister of of foreign
affairs of Nepal, said that acceleration of the global economic
integration had failed to narrow down the increasing gap between
the developed and the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The least developed nations are being marginalized because of
unfavorable conditions prevailing in the global market in the
trade of their exportable products, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted, they lack national capacity in terms of
technology and product development capability and also face
various tariff and non-tariff barriers for their exports abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the World Trade Organization ministerial
meeting in Singapore will take into account this reality and
ensure that the products of the least developed countries are
given free and unrestricted access to the world markets so as to
facilitate the integration of these countries in liberalizing and
globalizing the world economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Meets with Arafat, Israeli Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross today met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in an attempt to bridge
differences between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ross held the meetings after Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators failed to achieve any tangible results after three
days of continuous talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides continued the talks today at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip to discuss the implementation
of the long-delayed Israeli troops redeployment from the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Ross and Mordechai discussed the current Israeli-Palestinian
relations, especially the gap between the two sides. Mordechai
made it clear that Israel intended to advance the negotiations
and bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not say whether Israel would back
off its demand for making special security arrangements after
the Hebron redeployment, a demand strongly opposed by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ross traveled to the Gaza Strip where he held
talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Arafat
to discuss ways to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said today
the Palestinian side would seek international arbitration if
the deadlock continued because of Israel's procrastination.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has already made clear his intention for international
arbitration if Israel fails to honor its commitments to the Oslo
agreements, which he said are not only bilateral accords but also
international ones.
</P>
<P>
The current talks, stalled by the bloodshed two weeks ago,
resumed last Sunday as a result of the direct intervention by
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who convened a summit among Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Arafat and Jordanian King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the talks, Clinton sent Middle
East peace coordinator Ross to participate in the negotiations.
Ross is playing a role of a facilitator who will intervene
only when the two sides face a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the prolonged lack of progress
in the talks would lead to larger-scale violence across the
Palestinian territories. Senior Israeli army officials warned
Tuesday that the renewal of new violence could end the peace
process.

JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Agricultural Union today reacted sharply to a statement by
Minister of Agriculture Derek Hanekom calling for land
distribution in the country.
</P>
<P>
The all white union said that Hanekom's statement poses a

</P>
<P>
The South African minsiter made an announcement last week
in which it was made public the government plans to
introduce far-reaching changes in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The measures include redistributing land to redress racially-
based ownership which was developed under apartheid,removing
subsides for white farmers and scrapping agricultural marketing
control boards.
</P>
<P>
The union claimed that the minister's idea is "a recipe for
failure".

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Set to Deteroriate: IISS Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The general situation of the
Russian armed forces will continue to deteriorate in 1997, but
there is little chance of a planned mutiny, according to a
prestigious research report.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in capability in all departments of the Russian
armed forces seems set to continue" in the coming new year, the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)
said in its annual report issued today.
</P>
<P>
"There were no immediate new trends in military developments
following the election of President Boris Yeltsin for a second
term in June 1996," but the decline is somewhat inevitable, the
report on the world armed forces said.
</P>
<P>
Progress in reforming the armed forces has been very limited
because of the country's difficult economic situation and
organizational changes to develop more mobile formations suitable
for operations both within Russia and outside have not been put
into effect, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said, there is widespread speculation about the
future trends of the Russian armed forces and Russian security
chief Alexander Lebed even reportedly predicted last week that
there was a danger of a mutiny in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
However, IISS deputy director Rose Gottemoeller ruled out the
possibility of a planned mutiny in the Russian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces are voting with their feet and troops are
selling their weapons. It is an extremely serious problem, but
there is no signs that the troops will drive into the Kremlin in
tanks and Russia is not facing a planned mutiny," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The best the Russian armed forces can now do is to contain
rebel military action, in particular to try to retain control of
the larger population centers until a long-term political solution
is found," the report said.

JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob said today that six-week strike by workers of the
three gold mines in the Tsumeb district threatens the country's
industrial well-being.
</P>
<P>
Geingob told the parliament that the government is making
efforts in a bid to end the 43-day strike, according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The mining Workers, who demanded a 13.5 percent wage increase,
held the strike since August 22.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian mining authority has agreed to give 10.5 percent
increase to one third of the 2500-strong workforce.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 400 strikers held 45 mining officials, including
the general manager, Tony De Beer, hostages in the administration
building for about 11 hours.
</P>
<P>
The action followed a decision by the mining authority to
separate the black strikers from the white non-strikers, which
they said is an act of racism.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are still going on between the authority and
the miners.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Rocks Middle East Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring
6.2 degree on the Richter scale rocked the Middle East region this
afternoon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the earthquake, located southwest of Cyprus,
is some 300 kilometers away from Israel. The quake struck at 3:10
p.m. local time (1310GMT), and the tremor of the quake was felt
throughout Israel, and in the Palestinian autonomous areas,
Cyprus, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Buildings' shaking reportedly sent people into the streets in
the region, while most residents in Jerusalem, some 70 kilometers
from the Mediterranean Sea, did not feel the quake.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of light injuries and damages in Cyprus,
but so far there has been no immediate report of injuries or
damages in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Gadi Shamir, a seismologist from Israel's Energy Ministry's
Geophysical Institute, told Israel Radio that he doubts there
will be any damages in Israel, because "the earthquake was not
very strong and quite far from Israeli cities."
</P>
<P>
Shamir added that there is no connection between today's
earthquake and last November's earthquake, which killed one
Israeli and wounded seven others in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last year's earthquake, measuring between 5.7 and 6.2 on the
Richter scale, was caused by shifts in the tectonic plates of the
Syrian-African rift, said Shamir, while today's quake was centered
on the southeast edge of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The seismologist said aftershocks are expected in the very
near future, but the aftershocks are going to be small and
probably will not be felt.

<P>
PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- France today threatened to veto
any imposition by the United States in the United Nations Security
Council of a candidate to succeed U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"The right of veto is a right which is not just American, it is
also a French right," said French Minister of Cooperation Jacques
Godfrain on local television.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to veto a second term for
Boutros-Ghali if he is re-elected by the Security Council, while
calling for his replacement by an administratively experienced man
to carry out reform of the global organization.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the United Nations should be an
instrument of development. Now Boutros Boutros-Ghali has shown
that he is very close to the problems of development," said
Godfrain.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is now on a tour of
several African countries to campaign for the establishment of a
pan-African peacekeeping force and the replacement of
Boutro-Ghali, possibly by a black African.
</P>
<P>
"The interest of Africa is to have a man who is very close to
the problems of development," the French minister said, adding
that one of the reasons for Paris to support the re-election of
Boutros-Ghali is that he is "a perfect French speaker."
</P>
<P>
Although most African states support the re-election of
Boutros-Ghali, their priority is that the next U.N. chief should
be an African.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Representative Speaks on Decolonization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- No country has the right
to station forces or establish military bases and installations in
Non-Self-Governing Territories, a Chinese representative said in a
statement delivered at the United Nations here today.
</P>
<P>
Colonial territories could not be used to engage in any
offensive acts or interference against other countries, said He
Yafei, Chinese representative to the Special Political and
Decolonization Committee of the 51st Session of the U.N. General
Assembly on the Question of Decolonization.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the process of decolonization, the Chinese
representative said that a large number of colonial territories
have won independence.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, when the world is about to enter the 21st
century, there are still over a dozen of territories on the list
of Non-Self-Governing Territories.
</P>
<P>
It is an arduous and pressing task to attain the goal of
decolonization, he added. He reiterated the position of the
Chinese government and people who, he said, have all along
sympathized with and supported the efforts of the people of the
Non-Self-Governing Territories for self-determination and
independence.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the rights of the people of such territories to
self-determination and independence.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official also mentioned the necessity to assist
the territories in establishing a sound economic basis and to
protect local resources.
</P>
<P>
The representative urged the administering powers to fully
cooperate with the United Nations to help people of colonial
territories of all the rights to which they are entitled, and,
receive visiting missions of the U.N. in the territories under
their administration.

PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed and
25 injured in recent clashes between Zairean troops and ethnic Tutsi
rebels in the region of Uvira, eastern Zaire, Agence France Presse
quoted Zairean officials as saying today.
</P>
<P>
But the officials in the Zairean city of Goma, which neighbors
Uvira and is also close to Zaire's border with Rwanda and Burundi,

</P>
<P>
Zairean troops have been engaging Tutsi rebels, also called
Banyamulenges who are originally from Rwanda but have long lived in
Zaire, for more than one month.
</P>
<P>
Zaire last month accused Rwanda of trying to destabilize
eastern Zaire by sending 3,000 Banyamulenge infiltrators to the
region. Rwanda denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
International humanitarian groups in Uvira said that about 100
Zairean soldiers were wounded in fighting with the rebels last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Big Canadian banks announced
another drop in their mortgage rates today, the third in less than
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Long-term rates, from three to five years, are down a quarter
point, with shorter terms down a tenth of a point.
</P>
<P>
The new rates dropped a three-year mortgage to 6.6 percent, a
four-year term to 7 percent, a five-year term to 7.4 percent and a
10-year term to 8.60.
</P>
<P>
With this cut, the cost of borrowing to finance a new or resale
home in Canada has been dropped to the lowest level in more than
three decades.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank of Canada was the first to announce the cut
today, which was followed by the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce and the Bank of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Canada Trust, the country's biggest trust company,
lowered rates a quarter point on mortgages ranging from three to
10 years.
</P>
<P>
A strong Canadian dollar, the U.S. reluctance to increase
interest rates, and expected good news on the deficit from
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin are all contributing to
lower rates, analysts here said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission of Ethiopia today called on welfare
organiza- tions, the public and the government to exert their
utmost effort in halting epidemics, natural disasters and
migration.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in connection with the celebration of
the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR),
the commission said ''recurrent flood, epidemic, landslide,
torrental wind and other problems related to migration are
threatening the very existance of people residing in 30 major
towns of the country.''
</P>
<P>
The statement said seeking ways to ensure development and
balanced population distribution is the measure to be taken to
alleviate the problems in the towns.
</P>
<P>
Planting of trees, expansion of roads, installation of
sewerage systems, soil conservation, terracing and the
re-establishment of shanty areas are also the necessary measures
enabling towns at risk to become healthy, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's celebration is ''solution to cities
at risk''. According to statistics released by the commission,
about 15.7 percent of the total population of Ethiopia lives in
towns.
</P>
<P>
From 1973-1994, Ethiopia witnessed three consecutive droughts,
averaging once every ten years. As a result, nearly seven million
people were expsoed to famine. The drought famine in 1974-75
claimed the 250,000 Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
The IDNDR is celebrated every ten years worldwide and every
year in Ethiopia. This is the 11th anniversary of the day in
Ethiopia. enditem

<HEADLINE> EC Urges Policies Against Long-Term Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today urged in a report the pursuit of stability-oriented
macroeconomic policies and preventive policies against long-term
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The book, which is on the employment in Europe in 1996, was
used by the EC to put forward its policy ideas for the future
development of the European employment strategy, in preparation
for the Dublin summit in December.
</P>
<P>
The report noted, "The pursuit of stability-oriented
macroeconomic policies... must be continued without giving in to
technology pessimism, fear of global trade liberalization or
beggar-thy-neighbor attitudes through uncoordinated, stand-alone
action."
</P>
<P>
The EC asked in the report for promotion of increased demand,
addressing of the structural rigidities, respect for solidarity
and social justice and redressal of the distortion against
low-wage and low-skill groups.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate remained stubbornly high at 10.7 percent on
average in mid-1996. And youth unemployment was still twice as

<P>
In the report, the EC also urged reinforcement of the skill

<HEADLINE> Taxi Drivers Strike to Block Traffic in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand taxi drivers
took to the street here today on a general strike, holding off
traffic in Belgrade for several hours in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They demonstrated to demand the cut of income tax and reduction
of customs duties for imported cars.
</P>
<P>
"How can I live if I have to pay high taxes while the prices of
commodities are going up every month," a driver complained to
Xinhua in a jammed street in a new Belgrade suburb.
</P>
<P>
The four-year-long sanctions have devastated the Yugoslav
economy and driven many workers and even professionals to be cab
drivers. There are around 10,000 taxi drivers in Belgrade which
has a population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
During the strike, the drivers were prevented by police from
holding a rally in front of the government building and blocking a
bridge on the Sava river to the city center.
</P>
<P>
There have been strikes on and off this year to protest against
unemployment, inflation and low pay. Yugoslavia's current
inflation rate is about 100 percent a year.

<HEADLINE> One Reportedly Killed in Earthquake Hitting Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- One person was reportedly killed
when an earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale rattled
Egypt this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A three-story house collapsed at a village in Santa, central
Delta, killing a 40-year-old woman, who was the only person inside
the house when the tremor occurred, Egypt's news agency MENA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several buildings developed cracks in Cairo's old
districts because of the quake.
</P>
<P>
There have been no other reports of damage or casualty. But a
survey is being made to assess the damage to properties in all
parts of Cairo, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The tremor, which occurred at about 15:15 (1315 GMT), was
centered off the southwestern coast of Cyprus, an island in
eastern Mediterranean, MENA quoted Egyptian Minister of State for
Scientific Research Venus Gouda as saying.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was some 500 kilometers from the Helwan
Seismological Center, about 30 kilometers south of Cairo, Gouda
said.
</P>
<P>
The Helwan center earlier put the tremor at 5.7 on Richter
scale.
</P>
<P>
Most inhabitants in Cairo felt the tremor, and some frightened
people ran out of buildings into the streets. The tremor was also
felt in other parts of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Telephone contacts were disturbed in several areas following
the quake, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, traffic at the metro lines in Cairo and the railways
throughout Egypt were not affected. Navigation at all ports is
going on normally.
</P>
<P>
Maher Abaza, Minister of Electricity and Energy, was quoted by
MENA as saying that all power generating and transformer
stations are operating normally in all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The tremor was also felt in Cyprus, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria,
Israel, the Palestinian territories and Greece.
</P>
<P>
On November 22, 1995, an earthquake measuring between 5.7 and
6.2 on the Richter scale hit Egypt and a number of other Middle
East countries, such as Jordan and Israel, with its epicenter in
the Gulf of Aqaba. At least eight people were killed and several
buildings damaged.
</P>
<P>
A quake measuring 5.9 shook Cairo on October 12, 1992, killing
more than 450 people and injuring some 4,000. Its epicenter was
in Fayoum, only some 100 kilometers southwest of Cairo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. IFOR Troops Begin to Pull out of Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The first American peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) began to withdraw from Bosnia
Wednesday, reports from Sarajevo said.
</P>
<P>
The first two American units, with a total of 240 troops, are
on their way to the American base in Germany via Hungary, Kevin
Galayda, IFOR spokesman said in Tuzla, a Muslim town in
northeastern Bosnia which has become the headquarters of IFOR's
American troops over the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR spokesman said a number of U.S. troops had been pulled
out of Bosnia during the summer, as part of a reorganization of
the NATO-led international force.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 15,000 Americans serving in the NATO-led
IFOR in Bosnia, accounting for about one-third of IFOR's total
troops which was made up of nearly 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR's one-year mission is supposed to end on December 20.
NATO officials have favored to remain part of the IFOR in Bosnia
next year to safeguard the fragile peace in the country where
three main ethnic groups are still in deep hostility.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the first American troops based in
Germany arrived in Hungary Wednesday to cover the withdrawal of
the U.S. IFOR troops from Bosnia. About 40 soldiers would stop
over in the American base in Hungary and then head toward Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Announces New COPS Grants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
on Wednesday announced 58.3 million dollars in grants for 62
police and sheriff's departments to redeploy 2,400 officers to the
streets, the latest in a series of grants since the passage of the
1994 Crime Act.
</P>
<P>
The new grants will bring the total of officers brought to the
streets since 1994 by Crime Act funding to 48,000, about a half of
the total of 100,000, according to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The jurisdictions involved are in 26 states.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's grants, as opposed to most funding under the
Community Oriented Policing Services program targeted for new
hires, are designed to help departments redeploy officers already
in uniform from behind desks to the streets.
</P>
<P>
The theory behind the COPS program is that police officers on
the streets or taking part in community or housing project affairs
are more effective than those in patrol cars or precinct houses.
</P>
<P>
The new grants provide funding for new equipment or civilian
administrative help to free up uniformed officers.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Palestinians Not to Accept Change to Oslo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has said that the Palestinians will not accept any change to the
Oslo agreements signed with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's weekly magazine Al Mussawar,
Arafat said that he totally rejected during the recent Washington
four-way summit a seven-point American paper calling for
reconsidering the security arrangements included in the Oslo
accords.
</P>
<P>
The interview, to be published by the magazine Friday, was
carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) today.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept changing a sentence or a letter in the Oslo
agreements, even if the price is the failure of the peace
process," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he told U.S. President Bill Clinton that he did not
come to Washington for begging, but rather for asking Israel to
implement its agreements already signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to
reach agreement on any outstanding issues at the two-day summit,
which was also attended by Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein early
this month. They only agreed to resume Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The renewed talks, which opened Sunday at the Erez checkpoint
between the Gaza Strip and Israel, have failed to achieve any
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was apparently pessimistic about the ongoing talks,
which focus on Israel's long-delayed withdrawal from Hebron, the
last West Bank town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israelis want to make progress regarding Hebron, why
didn't they adopt any practical step during the Washington
summit," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current talks will not be able to accomplish
anything unless the Israeli government changes its position and
honors the agreements it has already signed.

one year ago, according to the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS).
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of the dollar, the country's exports in

August to 662 million dollars. But the figure was 19.5 percent
higher than 554 million dollars in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the FBS figures, exports totaled 68.17 billion
rupees (1.87 billion US dollars) during July-September 1996, the
first quarter of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 33.8 percent higher than the 50.97 billion
rupees (1.40 billion dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the FBS, Pakistan's imports in September 1996
amounted to 938 million dollars, up 6.2 percent from 883 million

3.65 percent in September in a bid to boost the country's exports
and generate the much needed hard currency.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserve has reportedly dropped
below one billion dollars, a crucial line to maintain the normal
pace of imports and repayment of debt services as viewed by local
economists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- An EC (European Commission)
official today said he regretted proposals by a committee of the
European Parliament to cut the budget for the EU's peace
initiative in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"To reduce funding for 1997 shows a lack of solidarity," said
Monika Wulf-Mathies, EC Commissioner in charge of regional policy,
referring to the parliament budget committee's veto to reduce
funding for the EU's peace process for Northern Ireland and the
six Irish counties along the border.
</P>
<P>
"We reconfirm our commitment to the peace program which is
carrying out valuable work in difficult circumstances," said
Wulf-Mathies, "Reducing the funding would jeopardize projects that
contribute to peace and reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the European Parliament in its
plenary session would not approve the veto.
</P>
<P>
The EU has planned to grant 70 million ECUs (about 90 million
U.S. dollars) in aid this year to Northern Ireland. A further 28
million ECUs (some 36 million dollars) will be spent in the border
counties of Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Premier's Libyan Visit Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANAP Chairman Mesut Yilmaz urged Erbakan to resign for
harming Turkey's dignity with his visit to Libya, saying that
Erbakan wanted to completely change the path which Turkey had
followed since its foundation.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that since the Libyan leader attacked Turkey's
policy on Kurds 15 days ago, Erbakan's visit was a very big
mistake that could have been easily avoided.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey's ambassador to Libya had sent three
messages home, saying that Erbakan's visit could be a mistake in
view of Gaddafi's recent statements against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
DSP leader Bulent Ecevit told his colleagues in the parliament
that Turkey was not bound to the existing government and that
other government models could emerge from the parliament as well.
</P>
<P>
He said a new government could be founded in one week if other
parties exerted the same efforts which his party had showed
after the elections to hinder an RP-led government.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that Turkey's foreign policy was indicative of
the crisis in the government, adding that Erbakan and the RP wing
were trying to place foreign relations on a religious base.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Erbakan's Libyan visit at a meeting, CHP Chairman
Deniz Baykal said that Turkey has had 53 governments since its
founding as a republic, but none of the previous prime ministers
has been insulted by the head of state of a host country during
trips abroad as Erbakan was in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Baykal pointed out: "There are lessons Erbakan should learn
from both Republican and Ottoman history. Erbakan set out
talking about dignity and honor. And this is the point he has
arrived at. Before departing from Libya, Erbakan thanked the
Libyan head of state Gaddafi for his hospitality."
</P>
<P>
But he added, "The Turkish Foreign Ministry, on the other hand,
recalled the Turkish ambassador to Libya to Ankara. This is
schizophrenic. (Our) Foreign policy has become schizophrenic."
</P>
<P>
Further more, several parliamentary deputies of the junior
coalition partner the True Path Party (DYP) called on DYP
Chairwoman Tansu Ciller to withdraw from the government with the
RP, as Turkey is being pushed towards an uncontemporary
direction.
</P>
<P>
DYP Deputy Mustafa Zeydan said, "I feel very sorry that
Chairman (Chairwoman) Ciller has been defending the RP more than
the RP members do."
</P>
<P>
However, Ciller said: "This is a trap to topple the
cabinet ... ... for the stability of Turkey, there is no other
alternative." She thus hinted at a cooperation with the RP.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources here said that Ciller, by defending Erbakan,
aimed at securing the post of the prime minister, which will be
transferred to the DYP leader within another 21 months in line
with an agreement signed by the RP and the DYP.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani President, PM Discuss Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held another lengthy
meeting here today, the second in two weeks, to discuss the
economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting, Benazir was
accompanied by her economic team, which included Governor of the
State Bank of Pakistan Muhammad Yaqub, advisor to the prime
minister on economic affairs V. A. Jaffery, special assistant to
the prime minister on energy Shahid Hassan Khan.
</P>
<P>
The president and the prime minister held a six-hour-long
meeting on September 29, one day before Benazir started her visit
to the US.
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting between the two top leaders in more
than one month and believed to have defused the tension between
them.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Benazir briefed the president on the talks
between her economic team and senior officials from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in New York earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Local press said Yaqub briefed the president on the economic
picture of the country, the latest position of the financial
reserves, the factors leading to a 3.65 percent devaluation of the
Pakistani rupee last month and its impact on the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Jaffery apprised the president about the outcome of the talks
with the IMF, the conditions imposed by the IMF for continuing
financial assistance to Pakistan and the measures being taken by
the government to restore the financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
The IMF refused to release financial assistance to Pakistan
during the talks and has reportedly put harsh conditions on any
economic help for the country which is facing a series of
financial economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Benazir briefed Leghari on her recent visit to the United
States, where she addressed the 51th UN assembly and held talks
with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
She also explained her government's hope for setting up
selected committees of both the houses of the parliament to modify
and enact laws to root out corruption from the country, as
suggested by the president in his message to the two houses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Newspaper Calls For Ethical and Cultural Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- An editorial in tomorrow's
People's Daily, the country's leading newspaper, is calling for
greater efforts for ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the conclusion of the Sixth Plenum of the 14th CPC
Central Committee, the editorial says that it is of great
immediate and profound historical significance for promoting
socialist ethical and cultural progress and building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The plenum further defined the guidelines, tasks, principles,
and major measures for promoting ethical and cultural progress,
the editorial says, and drew up a programmatic plan for ethical
and cultural progress, especially in ideology, morality, and
culture that will guide China's socialist ethical and cultural
progress in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the editorial says, the 14th CPC National
Congress defined Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics as a guideline for the Party and made a
strategic plan for the country's reforms and opening up and the
socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
From the 3rd to 5th plenum, a series of decisions and
suggestions were made, including the decision on establishing a
socialist market economy, the decision on strengthening the work
of Party building, the suggestion on the Ninth Five-Year Plan for
National Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives
to the Year 2010, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
At the 6th session, it said, the CPC Central Committee has
made a decision on some important matters relating to socialist
ethical and cultural progress, which has improved the CPC Central
Committee's strategic plan of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Party is well aware of the objective laws
of socialist modernization and that the leadership of the CPC
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is
strong. It also shows that the Chinese people are confident in the
prospect of the socialist motherland, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The 6th Plenum has decided that the the Party will hold the
15th CPC National Congress next year, the editorial said, calling
on the Party and the whole nation to rally round the Party's
central committee, adhering to the Party's basic theory and basic
principles, and working hard for the reforms and opening up and
for socialist modernization to greet the opening of the congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The first-stage of a
large-capacity Guangzhou Water Pumping and Power Storage Plant in
south China's Guangdong Province passed state technical checks
today.
</P>
<P>
Work on the 1.2-million-kw first-stage plant, whose purpose is
to ensure the safe operation of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant
and help control power surges in Guangzhou, started in May
1985. It is the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The first-stage project involved an investment of 2.7 billion
yuan for installing four 300,000-kw generating units.
</P>
<P>
The units have been undergoing trials since June 1993, and the
plant's efficiency has exceeded the indices called for in the
design.
</P>
<P>
Engineers say they believe the site is the right one, the
design reasonable, the construction work rapid and good, and the
imported machinery installed well.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the plant paid its domestic and overseas loans and
interest in time, and brought about 62.64 million yuan in taxes to
the state.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Premier's Libyan Visit Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan returned home winding up his seven-day African tour of
Egypt, Libya and Nigeria, but the very trip caused a government
crisis due to the remarks by Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi in
support of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) during
Erbakan's visit.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan came under fire at home for his Libyan visit, during
which Gaddafi made the statements against Turkey, while the prime
minister had to listen as he was at a joint press conference with
the Libyan leader in Tripoli Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the PKK, Gaddafi told reporters that a
"Kurdistan" should be established, adding: "I am talking about the
Kurdish nation. This nation should have its place under the
Middle Eastern sun. We are not happy in general about Turkey's
foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader also said: "Turkey has lost its will.
Turkey's future lies not in (the) NATO, U.S. bases and in
repressing the Kurds but in its nobility and its past."
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Erbakan's visit to Libya, Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller recalled Turkish
Ambassador to Libya Ates Balkan in protest against Gaddafi's
statements, which was viewed as an open support for the
anti-government PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old separatist war for
self-rule, which has claimed the lives of more than 21,000 people
including PKK rebels, civilians and government troops in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Balkan said Wednesday upon his arrival at the Istanbul Ataturk
Airport, "I have come back to Turkey on the instruction of the
(foreign) ministry to have consultations" concerning Gaddafi's
words against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish opposition parties and other circles have been
strongly accusing Erbakan of paying this official visit to
Libya. The prime minister insists on establishing close ties with
the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
On August 10, Erbakan started his first foreign trip on nations
including neighboring Iran since he came to power, despite pressure
from the United Stated.
</P>
<P>
The Motherland Party (ANAP), the Democratic Left Party (DSP)
and the Republican People's Party (CHP) will table three
interpolations in the parliament against the coalition government
led by Erbakan, who is Chairman of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP).

PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Two French cycling racers were
suspended for eight months from competition and were each fined
2,000 Swiss Francs for doping offenses, according to a statement
from the French Cycling Association (FCA) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jacky Durand and Thierry Laurent, representing the same club in
La Creuse of France, flunked drug tests after two different
cycling events in France.
</P>
<P>
Their results in the two events were also stripped and each
will lose 50 points from the standings of the International
Cycling Union.
</P>
<P>
Durand and Laurent, who had been sacked last week by the club
after the positive results were released, appealed the cases but
were denied by the FCA.
</P>
<P>
The club doctor Patrick Nedelec, who gave the banned drugs to
Durand and Laurent, was also suspended by the FCA for three years
from sports-related activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper today
accused the United States of encouraging Iraq's neighbors to
interfere with its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra, organ of Iraq's ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party,
said in an article that the United States is "using all means
available to control Iraq and to rob it of its wealth as a prelude
to impose control on world energy sources."
</P>
<P>
The daily said "Washington's card of inciting and encouraging
regional conflicts has already been burnt because the Iraqi
people are aware of the conspiracies being hatched against their
country."
</P>
<P>
"Interference in Iraq's internal affairs is a dangerous trap
set up by America to set the region ablaze at the expense of the
region's security," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Iraq's warning to others not to be taken away by
the American scheme stems from its keenness on the establishment
of a region where everybody's security and stability is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The daily concluded that Iraq's firm and independent political
approach as well as its "amazing perseverance have exposed
the 'ugly' face of America."
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. launched missile attacks on southern Iraqi
military targets in early September, Iraqi official media has
assailed repeatedly and vehemently American stance toward the
country and hailed its own capability to resist the
U.S. attacks.

ABU DHABI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain has made great
achievements in tourism, bringing about a total revenue of 328
million Bahraini dinars (873 million U.S. dollars) in one year,
while the number of tourists exceeds 2.2 million, according to

<HEADLINE> EC Asks Russia Not to Limit Vodka Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today expressed its regret that the Russian authorities have
decided to impose quota limits on imports of vodka and ethyl
alcohol from January 1st, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government took such steps while the consultations
on the issue of vodka imports have still not been finalized. The
consultations are taking place in the framework of the Interim
Agreement established between Russia and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this measure, Russian imports of these products
will be reduced considerably. Future EU exports of vodka are
expected to fall by 75 percent in 1997 in comparison with 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EC noted that Russian imports of foreign vodka and ethyl
alcohol in 1995 as well as in 1996 have not injured domestic
Russian production.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it said that the introduction of unilateral
safeguard measures by the Russian government cannot be justified,
adding that such measures are incompatible with both the letter
and the spirit of the Interim Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The commission asked Russia to continue the ongoing
consultations and to suspend the announcement of the measures
pending the outcome of the ongoing consultations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
here today to quell doubts on the solidarity
between Seoul and Washington in the aftermath of the
"infiltration" of a submarine from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) into South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released upon his arrival, Lord said: "I will be
reviewing recent developments to ensure the closest possible
policy coordination between Seoul and Washington."
</P>
<P>
"We have stated in clear, unequivocal terms the steadfastness
of the U.S. security commitment to the Republic of Korea," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Seoul, Lord will meet with South
Korean Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Board
Minister Kwon O-kie, Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung and Senior
Presidential Secretary for Foreign Affairs and National Security
Yoo Chong-ha on ways to tackle the submarine issue.
</P>
<P>
Lord is also expected to meet with National Assembly
Vice-Speaker Oh Se-eung and senior editors of local newspapers to
seek their understanding of Washington's policy toward Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has alleged that a group of armed DPRK people
"infiltrated" its Kangwon Province from a grounded submarine in
the East Sea on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, 11 DPRK people were found dead,
another 11 were killed by South Korean troops and one was captured
alive. Three are reportedly still "at large."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has stated that its submarine, while on a training
mission, drifted into South Korean waters after hitting a rock due
to engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
But Seoul claimed that the case was not an "inadvertent
incident that occurred during routine training" as Pyongyang said,
but a "carefully premediated act of provocation".
</P>
<P>
At a meeting between representatives of the United States
Forces Korea and the DPRK at the truce village of Panmunjom on
October 2, Pyongyang threatened to take retaliatory steps against
Seoul for the killing of its people who "landed ashore in South
Korea due to the engine trouble of the submarine."
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Seoul and Washington are at
odds over ways to tackle the submarine incident.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has warned about it may reconsider projects aimed at
improving inter-Korean ties, such as the funding of nuclear
reactors for the DPRK under a 1994 Geneva agreement reached
between Pyongyang and Washington and the suspension of the annual
joint military exercise between South Korean and U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
Washington fears that such measures by Seoul would hamper the
implementation of the Geneva agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Korea Peninsula Energy Development
Organization, a multinational consortium led by the U.S., South
Korea and Japan will provide two 1,000-megawatt light-water
nuclear reactors to the DPRK in return it freezing its nuclear
program.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration considers the Geneva agreement one of
its major diplomatic achievements of the past four years and does
not want it affected by the latest developments on the Korean
Peninsula, particularly with U.S. President Bill Clinton seeking
reelection in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> No Plan to Reshuffle Cabinet: Malaysian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today he does not intend to reshuffle his
present cabinet although several ministers were defeated in
today's ruling party United Malays National Organization (UMNO)
Supreme Council elections.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is UMNO president, said the results of the
elections did not necessarily mean the losers must be dropped and
the winners be given positions.
</P>
<P>
"Although this (the election results) in some ways will
influence our thinking, I have no plan to make any changes (in the
cabinet)," he told a news conference at the end of today's UMNO
General Assembly here.
</P>
<P>
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz failed
to retain her UMNO Women wing head post, losing in the contest to
Deputy Health Minister Zaharah Sulaiman, during women wing
election yesterday.
</P>
<P>
National Unity and Social Development Minister Paduka Zaleha
Ismail also lost in her bid for the Women wing number two post
yesterday. But she won a seat on the UMNO Supreme Council today.
</P>
<P>
In the election for UMNO Youth head held also yesterday, Rural
Development Minister Annuar Musa was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
In the vice-presidential election today, Minister of Youth and
Sports Muhyiddin Yassin failed to retain his post.
</P>
<P>
In the election of 25 ordinary members of the Supreme Council
today, among the ministers, deputy ministers who lost are Culture,
Arts and Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik, Deputy Works Minister
Railey Haji Jeffrey and Deputy Defense Minister Abdullah Fadzil
Che Wan.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "the position of cabinet ministers who lost will
not be affected because in the past there were also ministers who
lost."
</P>
<P>
He denied rumors that Rafidah had already tendered her
resignation as minister after losing to Zaharah. Rafidah did not
attend the Supreme Council meeting today as she had no position.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was happy with the choice made by the
delegates this time, he said: "I am prepared to work with anybody
who was chosen. As for me, what had been decided by the delegates
is fine by me."
</P>
<P>
UMNO is a dominant party in the ruling 13-member National Front
coalition and has more than 2.6 million members throughout the
country.

<HEADLINE> French Economy Sees Weakness in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The French economy performed
badly in the second quarter with all economic indicators below
first quarter levels.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP), which is used as a measure of
economic growth, fell by 0.4 percent, household consumption by 0.8
percent and purchasing power by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's manufacturing output dropped by 0.2
percent, business investment by 1.4 percent, exports by 2 percent
and imports by 0.8 percent, said the official National Economics
and Statistics Study Institute (INSEE) today.
</P>
<P>
INSEE said that the 0.8 percent fall in household consumption
had contributed greatly to the drop in GDP. But it noted that the
negative growth follows a strong rise of 2.4 percent in the first
quarter over the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The fall in purchasing power in the second quarter was caused
mainly by a 6.1 percent fall in car purchases, compared with a
rise of 18.3 percent in the first quarter, and a 2.3 percent fall
in the consumer electronics, against a 6.5 percent increase in the
first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish Premier's Libyan Visit Causes Government Crisis at Home (I) (by Zheng Jinfa) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan returned home winding up his seven-day African tour of
Egypt, Libya and Nigeria, but the very trip caused a government
crisis due to the remarks by Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi in
support of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) during
Erbakan's visit.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan came under fire at home for his Libyan visit, during
which Gaddafi made the statements against Turkey, while the prime
minister had to listen as he was at a joint press conference with
the Libyan leader in Tripoli Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the PKK, Gaddafi told reporters that a
"Kurdistan" should be established, adding: "I am talking about the
Kurdish nation. This nation should have its place under the
Middle Eastern sun. We are not happy in general about Turkey's
foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader also said: "Turkey has lost its will.
Turkey's future lies not in (the) NATO, U.S. bases and in
repressing the Kurds but in its nobility and its past."
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Erbakan's visit to Libya, Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller recalled Turkish
Ambassador to Libya Ates Balkan in protest against Gaddafi's
statements, which was viewed as an open support for the
anti-government PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old separatist war for
self-rule, which has claimed the lives of more than 21,000 people
including  PKK rebels, civilians and government troops in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said Wednesday upon his arrival at the Istanbul
Ataturk Airport, "I have come back to Turkey on the instruction
of the (foreign) ministry to have consultations" concerning
Gaddafi's words against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish opposition parties and other circles have been
strongly accusing Erbakan of paying this official visit to
Libya. The prime minister insists on establishing close ties with
the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
On August 10, Erbakan started his first foreign trip on nations
including neighboring Iran since he came to power, despite pressure
from the United Stated.
</P>
<P>
The Motherland Party (ANAP), the Democratic Left Party (DSP)
and the Republican People's Party (CHP) will table three
interpolations in the parliament against the coalition government
led by Erbakan, who is Chairman of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP).

<HEADLINE> Arafat Renews Warning Against Failure of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today warned again that failure of the Israeli-Palestinian
talks could trigger a new Intifada, or Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
Arafat issued the warning when he chaired a meeting of the
Palestinian Council at the West Bank town of Ramallah, north of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the first strong warning he has made
since Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed peace talks
early this week, after the bloodshed two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his disappointment with the lack of progress in the
talks, Arafat called on all Palestinians to get "prepared for all
possibilities."
</P>
<P>
During an interview with an Egyptian newspaper published
today, Arafat made the same warning, saying that the situation in
the Palestinian territories remained volatile and could explode
at any time.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pessimistic about the success of the
Israeli-Palestinian talks, adding that if a new Intifada broke
out, he could not possibly stop it.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told today's meeting
that no progress had been made after four days of talks with
Israel at the Erez checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the Israeli side had put forward a long
list of demands relating to changes in security
arrangements. However, he said the Palestinian delegation had
rejected any change to the interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been demanding for major changes in security
arrangements while implementing the signed agreements, especially
on the issue of Hebron redeployment which is the leading obstacle
in the talks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the joint Israeli-Palestinian steering committee
broke up into security and civil affairs subcommittees, after
talks on Hebron redeployment made little headway. The security
subcommittee focused specifically on the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
By breaking up the steering committee into smaller committees,
the two sides hoped to make progress on some issues, including
Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But Erekat said Wednesday that the Palestinian side would
resist any Israeli attempt to change the signed agreement on
Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Arafat had ordered no compromise on the
agreement, and Erekat claimed the Palestinians would seek
international arbitration if Israel continued blocking the talks
with its insistence on security changes.
</P>
<P>
Fears have increased again about another flare-up of violence
in the Palestinian territories if the current talks remain
deadlocked. The Israeli military has warned that the volatile
situation in the territories would lead to new bloodshed which
could end the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Immigration Policy Debates Hot in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Immigration and race have
recently become hot topics in Australia, involving more and more
people from the prime minister to people on the street.
</P>
<P>
About one month ago, Queensland independent MP Pauline Hanson,
in her maiden speech to parliament, launched an attack on
multi-culturalism and aboriginal welfare and called for an end to
immigration into Australia to prevent the country from "being
swamped by Asians."
</P>
<P>
Her view sparked anger from aboriginal ethnic and political
leaders, business and tourism groups, who said that the "nasty"
remarks publicly insulted Asian-Australians in the country.
</P>
<P>
Governor-General William Deane, in a clear reference to
Hanson's speech, said any suggestion that aborigines were
over-provided for by the government was "arrant nonsense."
</P>
<P>
He described Australia as multicultural but said that some
people were still subject to racial discrimination in the country.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer noted that Hanson's comments
could jeopardize Australia's trade interests.
</P>
<P>
In parliament, opposition leader Kim Beazley called on Prime
Minister John Howard to "state clearly and unequivocally that
Hanson's views on racial issues are hurtful to a great many
Australians and damaging to our interests in the Asian region and
do not reflect the kind of society that Australia is or wants to
be."
</P>
<P>
"It is both morally, economically and politically in
Australia's interests that we maintain an absolutely
non-discriminatory immigration policy," said Howard.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to directly criticize Hanson's view,
saying that "in my view there should be robust debate in this
country about the size of our immigration policy. People are
entitled to attack the present immigration levels without being
branded as bigots or racists."
</P>
<P>
As the debate goes on, more and more politicians expressed
their concern over possible consequences that the debate would
bring about.
</P>
<P>
They said people of Asian descent, origin or background, were
feeling threatened by some of the comments or the theme of the
discussion.
</P>
<P>
"Immigration is what people talk about in the pubs, over the
back fences -- if their kid can't get a job they want to know why
we are allowing anyone in as a immigrant," said a senior
government adviser.
</P>
<P>
That view was backed up by an Herald-AGB McNair poll, published
in the Sydney Morning Herald last Tuesday, which showed 48 percent
of respondents supporting Hanson's views.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the daily Australian today, with the
launch of the Australians Against Further Immigration campaign,
people began to put the blame on immigrants for pollution, traffic
jams, uncontrolled housing development, unemployment, crime,
hospital crisis and even the latest found tuberculosis outbreak.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Swiss Ties to Be Raised to New Level: CPPCC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) --- A senior Chinese leader said
here today that the current visit of President of the Swiss
Confederation Jean-Pascal Delamuraz is to raise Sino-Swiss
friendly relations and cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the
remark in his meeting with Delamuraz today.
</P>
<P>
Li, who visited Switzerland not long ago, said the two
countries enjoy very good relations despite their differences in
history, culture, social system and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
Such relations prove that the differences between countries can
be reduced through friendly cooperation. He added that the
frequent contacts between leaders of different countries can help
increase mutual understanding on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman noted that there is immense potential for
Sino-Swiss economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz said he agrees with Li on bilateral relations. He
said the Swiss government takes a positive attitude towards
developing relations with China and is willing to enhance the
cooperation with China in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland and China have their own advantages in certain
spheres from which the two countries can benefit so as to add new
elements to the existing relations within the framework of
cooperation, Delamuraz said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss leader said he has an impression that Chinese leaders
are fully confident of the country's future and that China is
capable of fulfill its economic development plans according to
schedule.
</P>
<P>
For investors, Delamuraz said, a stable social environment is
very important. It is because China has the environment of
absorbing foreign investment that Switzerland is willing to
participant in China's economic construction.

<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of mentally handicapped
people demonstrated in Paris today, calling on the government to
issue them work certificates promised by the late President
Francois Mitterand.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who marched from the headquarters of the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), accused Prime Minister Alain Juppe of failing to bring
into effect a 1994 presidential ordinance by the late President
Francois Mitterrand who agreed to let them find work.
</P>
<P>
"This certificate, for us, is not simply a piece of paper. It
is the recognition of the existence of quality psychiatric
treatment in France," said a spokesman for the demonstrators, who
have all undergone psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
The government issues work certificates for other handicapped
people who have undergone professional training, but refuses to
issue such certificates for the mentally handicapped, who are
given another special certificate for employment.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said that the stigmatization of their
certificate leads to discrimination against them in employment.

also come up to my studio very keen to see and very keen to buy,"
she said, adding that among the buyers, about 60 percent are
foreigners and the rest are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
At the first sight of these paintings, many Chinese were
surprised to see that a foreign girl can paint characters in
Chinese opera so well, while westerners were excited and tend to
buy their favorite as a souvenir for traveling to the east.
</P>
<P>
"I think I have just touched the surface of Chinese culture,"
she said, "and I know I should spend long time to increase my
knowledge about Chinese culture and I should study the Chinese
language."
</P>
<P>
She has been reading a lot of Chinese poetry, fairy tales,
legends, folk tales or stories by contemporary Chinese writers,
such as Raising the Red Lantern and the Opium Family by Us Tong,
she said.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that Caroline has never received
professional art training. When she was young she began to travel
around the world with her father, who is a British navy officer.
Gradually she had the idea of becoming a painter.
</P>
<P>
"When I first started my parents were furious," she said, "I
wanted to go to an art school but they refused to pay for it, so I
just went out to paint on the street and sold my works to
passers-by. But now my parents are very proud of me and think
their daughter is a famous painter in China."
</P>
<P>
She said she has had seven years of professional painting
experience, and she has become confident about her style and
ability, and now she wants to study in an art school, maybe an art
school in China.
</P>
<P>
She is preparing to paint her next series by going up the
backstage to see actors painting their face. "There are some
poetry in the way they put on their makeup," she said. "It's great
to see the transition between the person and the character."
</P>
<P>
The journey of the Monkey King from the East to the West is
another subject she wants to do, she said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Says Women at Higher Risk of Mental Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The pressures of marriage and
discrimination at work put women at a much greater risk of mental
and nervous disorders than men, the World Health Organization
(WHO) said today.
</P>
<P>
And it called for enhanced mental health care services,
especially at primary levels, to improve the mental health
situation of women.
</P>
<P>
The global public health body said that around 1.4 billion
people worldwide, mostly in developing countries, are affected at
some time in their lives by some kind of neuropsychiatric
illnesses, including mental, behavioral and substance abuse
disorders.
</P>
<P>
In addition, mental illness is now responsible for 15 percent
of the world's new cases of disease and injury.
</P>
<P>
Mental illness is also proving to have serious economic
consequences. Surveys have found that in the United States,
depression alone costs an average of about 44 billion U.S. dollars
per year.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that in urban Bahia, eastern Brazil, mental
disorders struck 21 percent of women, compared with only 8 percent
of men. In Britain, women account for 55 percent people diagnosed
as mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
The WHO also found that depression and anxiety are more
prevalent among women, whereas among men, substance abuse
disorders are more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
The organization reported an estimated 400 million people
suffering from anxiety disorders and 340 million with mood
disorders in the world, the majority of them being women.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, for every 10 men suffering major depression, there
are between 15 and 35 women in the same condition; and as regards
chronic depression, the ratio is between 17 and 48 women to 10
men, the global public health body said.
</P>
<P>
There is growing evidence linking the higher rate of depression
among women with marriage. Many housewives, having no other
social roles for identity and self-esteem and facing constant
routine, isolation and lack of income, are more vulnerable than
men to depression.
</P>
<P>
The situation is even worse for women with children and without
a stable partner or divorced. Studies show the risk increases 10
times for a woman without a stable partner who has three children
under the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, things are not much better for career
women, who have to face economic discrimination and job
inequality, as well as the combined pressures of conflicting home
and work responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Women with a stable partner and one or two children, who have a
part-time income-generating job, seem to be less exposed to
depression and anxiety disorders, said the WHO.
</P>
<P>
The organization also cited domestic violence as an important
factor affecting women's mental health. It was found that up to
50 percent of women have been physically abused by their partners
at some time in their lives.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Brings Large Equity to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The privatization program in
Pakistan has brought about 1.5 billion US dollars in equity over
the past two years, the official Associated Press of Pakistan said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Over a billion dollars of debt has also been passed on due to
the program," the report quoted Pakistani Minister for
Privatization Naveed Qamar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qamar said Pakistan had a fairly wide privatization program,
but presently the power sector took the central stage.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of privatizing both the thermal power
generation and the distribution side of the power sector," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan recognizes across the board consensus that foreign
investment is the one way out in which we can have a quick
economic growth and induction of the technology as well as
induction of capital in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have finished the first phase of privatization of the
industries and out of the 120 government controlled manufacturing
units, nearly a hundred have already been sold and some of the
others are in the process of being handed over, so that phase is
almost coming to a close," he said.
</P>
<P>
The next phase of the country's privatization program will
include public utilities, especifically, power, telecommunication,
and gas, he added.

<HEADLINE> Greece Signs Deal to Develop Sea-Sparrow Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek telecommunications and
information systems company INTRACOM has signed a
3.5-million-U.S.-dollar deal to further develop NATO's sea-sparrow
missile.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed between General Manager of INTRACOM
Costas Tsoukalidis and Managing Director of German firm RAMSYS
Volker Pauly.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press today, the program to develop and
produce the advanced sea-sparrow (ESSM) missile, budgeted at two
billion U.S. dollars, involves 10 NATO allies and is headed by
U.S. firm Hughes.
</P>
<P>
INTRACOM's role in the program will be to develop and produce
the missile's telemetric (WCT) system, in which the missile's
flight details are processed, stored and transmitted to the base.
</P>
<P>
Greece's participation in the ESSM program could minimizse the
country's purchasing cost for acquisition of the missile, reduce
hand-over time, give the local arms industry access to the
project, and allow for a greek say in the intervention and
revision of the program.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Visiting Austrian Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin met with
Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky today in Beijing's
Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and Austria should look to the 21st
century, handling their relations from the strategic heights and
making common efforts to set up a long-term, stable, and friendly
relations of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the Chancellor's first China trip in 1993, Jiang said,
they had a very good conversation, and that he believes that the
current visit, on the 25th anniversary of the opening of
diplomatic ties between the two countries, will contribute to the
overall development of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The past 25 years have witnessed steady progress in bilateral
relations, with continued expansion of economic, trade, cultural,
and other co-operation, Jiang said, adding that the frequent
contacts between the two countries' leaders have also helped
mutual understanding and trust, and guaranteed the healthy advance
of relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor said that Austria-China relations in the 25
years have had good results in economic and cultural exchanges,
and that he is happy that his current China trip has yielded new
results, and in the future, Austria wants to expand co-operation

<P>
Vranitzky conveyed Austrian President Klestil's regards to
President Jiang and Jiang asked the Chancellor to convey his
regards to President Klestil, who is now in hospital and to wish

<HEADLINE> Core of China's Environmental Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Economic instruments including
prices, taxes, and credit loans should be used more in
implementing environmental polices in China, representatives
argued at a workshop today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, focusing on the use of economic instruments in
environmental polices in China, was sponsored jointly by the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
China's State Bureau of Environmental Protection (SBEP).
</P>
<P>
The conventional environmental management policies in China are
based on direct regulations, established by the government under a
command-and-control approach. Economic instruments, such as the
pollution levy system, only play a supplementary role and are not
fully effective.
</P>
<P>
At today's workshop, Lu Xinyuan, an official from SBEP, said
that now it is urgent for China to accelerate the establishment of
environmental economic policies consistent with the market
mechanism in the moving towards a market economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, besides revising the existing
pollution levy system, the evaluation and establishment of an
environmental tax, the implementation of an ecological damage
compensation system, should also be conducted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he suggested that China fully adopt the principle
of payment for environmental protection, establish a National
Environmental Protection Fund, and adopt a "green" state credit
policy to improve the protection of environment.
</P>
<P>
OECD is the initiator of the use of economic instruments in
environmental policies worldwide, with its Polluter-Pays-Principle
applied in many counties for decades. At the workshop today
deputies from the organization expressed their hope to continue
their newly started cooperation with China, especially in
environmental fields.
</P>
<P>
During the last several years the Chinese government has showed
clearly, in such documents as China 21st Century Agenda and Ten
Measures On Environment and Development, that economic instruments
and market mechanism should be more widely used in environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
In Some Decisions on Environmental Protection, issued in
August by the State Council, the wider use of economic instruments
was considered to be one of the basic principles for the
formulation of future environmental policies.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite new uncertainties about the possible Russian
reaction, the Unted States is pushing ahead with its plan to bring
several former Soviet allies into NATO in 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- Bob Dole's criticism of teachers' unions may backfire if the
sentiment is accurate in Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark
County, which have often voted for the winning presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Vice President Al Gore and Republican nominee Jack Kemp
focused their 90-minute debate Wednesday night on the economy,
with Kemp insisting that wide-ranging tax cuts are needed to spur
growth and Gore arguing that the GOP plan is dangerous and
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
-- Canada's House of Commons retaliated Wednesday against
U.S. restrictions on investment in Cuba, approving a bill that
would let Canadian companies use the Canadian courts to fight any
sanctions levied against them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Burnings of black churches in the South are evidence of an
alarming rise in racial tensions in U.S. society, federal
civil-rights officials said. Officials of the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights, which held community forums on the church fires in
six southern states, said the inquiry has shown that the incidents
reflect a deeper racial problem.
</P>
<P>
-- Mideast negotiators began a fourth day of talks at the Erez

<HEADLINE> Underground Corsican Nationalist Group Calls for "Uprising" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- An underground Corsican
nationalist group, Fronte Ribellu, today called for an "uprising"
on the French-run Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Agence France Presse (AFP), entitled "the
Necessary Revolution," the group urged "all Corsican patriots to
come together to give the only possible response to the
aggressor: refusal and uprising."
</P>
<P>
The group also warned, "We will not hesitate for one second in
killing you in cold blood," adding that "dark days are coming" to
those who oppose nationalism.
</P>
<P>
The message, addressed to "informers, deputies, Corsican
collaborators and the French," was sent a few days after the
French government decided to crack down on Corsican nationalism
after the Corsican National Liberation Front, or Canal Historique
(FLNC), launched a bomb attack last Saturday on the City Hall in
Bordeaux, where Prime Minister Alain Juppe is mayor.
</P>
<P>
Fronte Ribellu, which was founded in 1995 and is close to the
FLNC, claimed responsibility for a number of bombings against the
French paramilitary police and state-owned companies in Corsica
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The group continued its message, "We will fight our hereditary
enemy, the French state, which has assassinated and deported our
children."
</P>
<P>
It also called on all Corsican nationalists to set up a unified
front to fight the French government.
</P>
<P>
"Is it possible that the years of fighting, of sacrifices,
result in an inter-Corsican confrontation? To those who call for
division, we say `enough,' because it is union that the Corsican
people need," the group said.

<HEADLINE> IIAS President Interviewed in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- David Brown is in China's
capital for the first time in 20 years, and, after viewing the
high-rises and cars crowding its streets, he said that "the change
has been really amazing."
</P>
<P>
Brown is president of the International Institute of
Administrative Sciences(IIAS). In an interview with Xinhua today,
he said that the changes are more than what meets the eye: "The
evolution of the country's public administration system has also
drawn attention from the world, as well as its economic
achievements."
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, to meet the needs of economic reform
and opening up, and especially to help establish a market economy,
China has made greater efforts to decentralize its power, reducing
government involvement in managerial affairs in enterprises,
dramatically downsizing its public administration, and introducing
a civil service system to promote efficiency and effectiveness,
Brown noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese administrative reform methods have
been carried out in trickle-down fashion, with clear substantial
goals at every stage.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese leadership has been very sensitive about each step
in the reform process, and they have succeeded," said the
Canadian, who has been a civil servant for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The transformation from a planned economy to a market one is a
major change, and China has drawn up a long-term plan for the next
15 years, and its administrative system reform will be long and
ardous, he said, noting that he is pleased to know that China has
an ambitious plan for administrative reforms in the future.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that one of the reasons IIAS chose Beijing as the
site of its general assembly was to fulfill the international
communities' desire to know more about China and its
administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
Many countries want their administrations to be as streamlined
as China's, so the experiences will no doubt benefit them,
according to the IIAS head, who said that the IIAS is willing to
help all its member countries improve their government mechanism,
of course including China, one of its largest member states.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes China's Institute of Administrative Sciences
will do its best to offer the technology and advice to the
government in its effort to build a better government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today urged
neighbors of Afghanistan to extend help to the formation of a
broad-based government in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"We should all devote our energies to bringing an end to the
conflict in Afghanistan and to the formation of a broad-based
government through dialogue," a spokesman of the Pakistani Foreign
Office told a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We don't see how a single ethnic, religious or any other group
can dominate in Afghanistan in the long-run," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about fears reportedly expressed at the
recent summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States on the
coming into power of Taliban in Kabul, the spokesman said that
"Pakistan understands the legitimate interests of all neighbors of
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has been consulting with Russia and Central
Asian states on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
"We ourselves see no reason for Afghanistan to confront or
endanger any member of the Commonwealth of Independent States."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called on the international community,
particularly major powers, to contribute to the reconstruction of
the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest situation in Afghanistan, he said
reports of fighting between Taliban soldiers and Dostum's fighters
were not confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian President to Give Up Administrative Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko, who has been locked in a bitter power struggle with
parliament, has said he is giving up his administrative power
while retaining his power as head of the state, Itar-Tass reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business meeting, the president said his
administrative powers will be handed over to the government.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the shadow government set up by the opposition
who have protested against his plans for a referendum on November
7 which would include voting on a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said the new constitution would put an end to the
"meaningless" domestic political row.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was elected the country's first post-Soviet
head of state two years ago following independence in 1991, has
been in conflict with the opposition for months.

<P>
Lukashenko has planned a referendum for November 7 asking the
people to approve a new constitution which would curtail the
powers of parliament and give him much wider powers, including
increasing the presidential mandate from five to seven years,
starting from after the referendum.
</P>
<P>
But the multi-party opposition has accused him of leading the
country towards a "dictatorship" and has tried to prevent him
holding the referendum. It has come up with its own referendum
scheduled for November 24 which would scrap the presidency
altogether and establishing a parliamentary form of government.

<HEADLINE> Underlying Inflation Rises in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's underlying rate of
inflation rose by 0.5 percent last month, giving an annual rate of
2.9 percent, up from 2.8 percent in August, the Office for
National Statistics (ONS) said today.
</P>
<P>
But headline inflation was unchanged at an annual 2.1 percent
in September, although on a month by month basis prices rose by
0.5 percent last month, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflation, which excludes the cost of home loan
repayments, rose due to huge increases in clothing and footwear
prices of 5.2 percent, the largest monthly rise since records
began in 1947, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
These increases though were offset to some extent by falls in
food prices.
</P>
<P>
Underlying inflation is used by the government when it sets
inflation targets. The Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has committed
himself to getting the underlying rate of inflation down to 2.5
percent before the general election which must be held by May next
year.

<HEADLINE> Iron Sprinkled to Seas May Reduce Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Sprinkling the Antarctic seas
with large quantities of iron could reduce global warming, a
report in the science journal Nature said today.
</P>
<P>
The "technofix" would work by triggering a huge growth in tiny
algae on the ocean surface. This would absorb carbon dioxide and
produce a gas that can protect the earth from heating up, the
journal said.
</P>
<P>
British and American scientists reported on an experiment known
as Ironex II, in which they traveled to the equatorial region of
the Pacific and sprinkled half a ton of iron on to a
72-square-kilometer patch of sea. After a day, the algae had
doubled in mass. Within a week, there was a 30-fold increase in
the size of the bloom.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the algae absorbed more carbon dioxide from the
air and produced dimethyl sulphide (DMS), the gas that causes the
smell of the sea. The DMS is oxidized by the air to form
particles in the atmosphere that encourage clouds to form. Clouds
shield the earth from the sun's radiation.
</P>
<P>
"On Monday the sea was bright blue," said Dr. Philip
Nightingale of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the report. "By
Friday it was green-brown." The big drawback with the experiment
was that the effect was only transient. The algae soon died and
decomposed, releasing all the carbon dioxide back into the air.
</P>
<P>
But the scientists believe that the effect would be more
lasting in other oceans, where vertical currents would whisk dead
algae downwards before they give up their carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
They plan to test their ideas on an expedition to the Southern
Ocean which surrounds the Antarctic. But the scientists are aware
that the side effects of tipping lots of iron into the ocean could
include the production of other gases which may affect species
higher up the food chain. It could also be an expensive venture.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Paint the Painted Face in Peking Opera (1) by Xu Xingtang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Peking Opera is something new
 to most foreigners, but not to Caroline Jones, a British girl who
 has been studying Peking Opera and painting characters in Peking
Opera stories over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Caroline, 25, came to Hong Kong five years ago and is now
living in Hok Tsui Village of Shek-O, a beautiful small peninsular
covered with green trees on the southeast end of Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw the painted faces in Peking Opera, I had a
really strange feeling inside. I was very excited and thought I
should paint that," said Caroline in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Caroline has seen and read different types of Chinese opera and
realized that Peking Opera is the most stylized and the most
elegant, and she started to work on it.
</P>
<P>
To have a good understanding of this traditional Chinese art,
she made a six-week extensive journey around China on her own from
 March to May in 1995. She went through Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region and the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan to see the rural
landscapes which are the settings of many Peking Opera
stories. She went on to Beijing to see Peking Opera and continued
her journey down the coast to Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
When traveling she collected information in the form of
sketches and photographs. "It was really a hard journey," she
said, "I had three books in my ruck-sack: Tales from Peking Opera,
Anthology of Chinese Literature and Lonely Planet Guide to China."
</P>
<P>
The result of this journey was her first series of oil and oil
pastel paintings of characters in Peking Opera, which proved to be
quite a success at a show held this summer in a gallery on the
famous Languifang Street, a favorite resort for foreigners living
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hung on the walls of her studio, which is also in Hok Tsui
Village, are all oil or oil pastel paintings of well-known Peking
Opera characters, including Bao Zheng, Yang Yuhuan, Cao Cao, Guan
Yu and the fairy Monkey King.

<HEADLINE> W. African Peacekeepers Venture Into Liberia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Columns of West African
Peacekeeping Forces, backed by tanks and amphibious vehicles,
left Liberia's capital Monrovia today for the hunger-stricken
western Liberia to disarm faction soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Radio Liberia, which was monitered here today, said the move
is another big venture for the peacekeepers, known as the ECOMOG,
to move into the interior of the war-torn country to clear way
for international relief aid operations.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not venture into the interior until ECOMOG confirmed
that the roads are safe and we can take food along," a spokesman
for the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) said in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone which shares a border with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The WFP spokesman said international aid agencies are ready to
take huge consignment of relief food supply to starving villages
which had been long cut off by intermittent factional fightings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the interior said thousands of local
people remain under-nourished with hundreds of children dying.
</P>
<P>
"All unofficial road blocks outside Monrovia will be removed
and fighters met along the way will be disarmed," announced ECOMOG
Field Commander, General Victor Malo.
</P>
<P>
"We shall do the removal again and again until we are sure nobody
put them back," said the Nigerian general.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that the ECOMOG ventured into the
interior to disarm the warring factions and create safe haven for
the civilians since the peacekeepers, formed by soldiers from
Nigeria, Guinea, Ghana and other West African states, were sent
to Liberia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to a revised peace accord signed by Liberia's
warring factions last August, all the Liberian factions fighters
would be disarmed before the general elections are held in May
1997.

<HEADLINE> New Method Found to Test Brittle Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A simple blood test that will
identify women at risk of osteoporosis, the brittle bone disease
that affects elderly people, has been developed by British
scientists, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
A team of genetics experts have found that osteoporosis is
strongly associated with an abnormality in the gene responsible
for bone production. Professor Stuart Ralston, an Aberdeen
consultant who led the team, said the blood test would be
available commercially within five years.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, announced in the scientific journal Nature
Genetics, allows millions of women at risk to be identified before
the disease takes hold. Treatment, including diet changes and
hormone replacement, can then be used to prevent occurrence of the
crippling condition.
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis is a painful and often deforming condition that
affects more than three million people in Britain. Although
particularly common in elderly women, one in 12 men is also
affected.
</P>
<P>
"Osteoporosis is a common disease which affects up to one third
of all women. Although several factors may contribute to
osteoporosis, this discovery highlights the importance of genetic
factors in causing the disease and provides a method by which we
can target women at risk more effectively," the journal quoted
Ralston as saying.
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows a four-year research program involving
300 patients carried out by doctors at Aberdeen and Guy's Hospital
in London.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC),
the executive body of the European Union, deplored Wednesday that
the women in Afghan controlled by the Talibans are being deprived
of their fundamental civil rights.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in Brussels, the EC maintained that such
deprivation is in violation of the U.N. charter and all the
relevant conventions, to which Afghanistan is a signatory, on
elimination of discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
It said that this is not an issue of religious or moral belief
and that the international community cannot stand idle while a
policy based in particular on massive gender discrimination is
being perpetrated by the Talibans.
</P>
<P>
The EC appealed to all governments and international
institutions to use any legitimate means of pressure to make sure
that the principles and rules set out in relevant international
conventions on the rights of women are being respected in the
country.

The plenum pointed out definitely that the guiding principle
for promoting socialist ethical and cultural progress is to take
Maxism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, as guidance, to uphold the
party's basic lines and principles and to promote science,
education, culture and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to arm people's minds with scientific
theory, guide them in correct public opinion, inspire them with
excellent literary works, and train socialist citizens who have
lofty ideals, moral integrity, a good education and a strong sense
of discipline.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to raise the whole nation's level in the
fields of moral standard, science and culture, and unite and
mobilize people of all ethnic groups to turn China into a
powerful, prosperous, democratic, civilized and modernized
socialist country.
</P>
<P>
The major target for the next 15 years is to let the whole
nation firmly foster the common ideal of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and have the faith in upholding the
party's basic lines without wavering.
</P>
<P>
Marked improvement of citizens' quality should be realized,
which mainly includes their moral concepts and sense of
self-cultivation, scientific and educational levels, and
democratic and legal sense.
</P>
<P>
Distinct improvement of the quality of people's cultural lives
should also be realized, which should be positive, healthy, rich
and varied, and serve the people.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to raise the level of urban and
rural civilization which is marked by an improvement of the social
atmosphere, public order and living environment, so as to create a
fine situation of coordinated promotion of material progress and
ethical and cultural progress nationwide.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, efforts should be made first to do work
well in the coming five years, especially to take the whole
situation into account and seriously solve major problems that
officials and people are generally concerned about during the
ongoing promotion of ethical and cultural progress.

The plenum emphasized that socialist ideology and ethics
embody, in a concentrated way, the nature and orientation of the
building of culture and ethics. We are now building and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the ultimate goal is to
realize communism, and socialist and communist ideology and ethics
should be conscientiously promoted throughout society. At the
same time, efforts should be made to combine the requirement for
the nature of the advanced with that for the nature of extensive
representation, and encourage and support all ideology and ethics
conducive to the country's re-unification, unity of various ethnic
groups, economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
In stepping up ideological building, it is essential to arm the
whole party in Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and
particularly in Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and educate cadres and people to foster
lofty ideals and correct outlooks on the world, life and
values. Education in patriotism must be carried out in a
penetrating and sustained manner and the national spirit of
self-respect, self-confidence and self-support should be fostered,
education in a hard working and pioneering spirit must be carried
out and concepts on building the country and all other
undertakings through hard work and thrift should be firmly
established.
</P>
<P>
In-depth education in social moral standards, professional
ethics and family virtues that takes service to the people as the
nucleus, collectivism as the principle and love for the
motherland, the people, labor, science and socialism as the basic
requirements should be conducted, to form in all aspects of
society the relationship among people that is characterized by
unity, mutual help, equality, friendly affection and common
progress.
</P>
<P>
Ideological and moral education must be enhanced among young
people, to help them foster lofty ideals and nurture fine
moral qualities, and legal education intensified to increase
people's awareness of democracy and the legal system as well as
their sense of rights and obligations, to form a social
atmosphere for upholding justice and encouraging benevolence
and combatting evil.

The cause of socialist culture should be developed actively to
meet the daily-increasing ethical and cultural needs of the
people, the plenum noted. The cause of culture must strike deep
root in the people's historical, creative activities, inherit and
carry forward the outstanding culture of the Chinese nation, and
revolutionary cultural tradition, and a positive attitude should
be taken in absorbing the excellent cultural attainments of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Literature and art should adhere to the direction of serving
the people and socialism, the principle of letting a hundred
flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend should be
implemented, and full scope should be given to the theme of our
times while advocating diversity. Press and publicity must follow
the principle of the Party spirit, persist in seeking truth from
tacts and in unity, stability and arousing people's enthusiasm,
mainly giving publicity in a positive way, and keeping firmly to
the correct guidance of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with the Chinese characteristics must
be taken as the theoretical basis for philosophy and social
science, and theory must be integrated with practice, in an effort
to serve the Party and the government, as well as the socialist
material and cultural development. To strengthen macro-control
of press and publications, positive efforts must be made to
cultivate and improve the cultural market, and equal importance
must be attached to both prosperity and management. To deepen the
reform of the cultural system and vitalize the cause of culture,
priority must be perseverely given to social effects, and every
effort should be made to achieve the best combination of social
effects and economic benefit.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of socialist ethical and cultural progress is the
cause of the masses of people, the plenum noted. To carry out the
activities of the masses of people for promoting ethical and
cultural progress will play a great role in changing prevailing
habits and customs, transforming society, and achieving the
organic combination of the socialist material and cultural
progress.

Efforts must be targeted at raising the quality of urban
residents and carrying out activities for creation of
civilized cities while developing activities for creation of
civilized villages and towns that aim to raise farmers'
quality and build a socialist countrysides, so that the farmers will
be able to live a comfortable life. With a sole purpose of

The key to the promotion of material progress rests with the
Party and so does the key to the development of ethical and
cultural progress, the plenum noted.
</P>
<P>
While having a correct understanding and handling of the
relationship between the material civilization and ethical and
cultural progress, Party committees at all levels should
consistently place equal emphasis on development of both material
and ethical, cultural progress, taking both of them as the unified
goal of the efforts, and planning, implementing and inspecting
them together. At no time should temporary economic growth be
scored at the expense of cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Input should be increased in the promotion of ethical and
cultural progress, and the prevailing problems concerning the
total input in the cause of media and culture to the low side, or
at the lower proportion, should be coped with effectively.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of highly-competent professionals in the fields of
mass media, cultural and ideological education, should be trained
in accordance with the requirements of being politically sound,
professionally competent and morally strong.
</P>
<P>
A good job should be done to improve the Party's style of work
and build a clean, honest government and education in Party spirit
and Party style carried out, with special attention being paid to
study, politics and moral ethics among the Party officials of
the county level and above.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party members must set an exemplary role in whole
society while the leading Party officials must play a model role
within the Party. Under the unified leadership of the Party
committees, ethical and cultural construction must penetrate
all aspects of the economic and social life, and all Party and
government departments and non-governmental organizations such as
trade unions, the Communist Youth League and women's federations
must pool efforts in carrying out the construction.
</P>
<P>
As an effort to strengthen coordination, the plenum decides
that the CPC Central Committee should set up a committee to guide
the promotion of ethical and cultural progress. All provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the State

<HEADLINE> Communique of Sixth Plenum of 14th CPC Central Committee  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plenum held that during the 18 years since the Third Plenum
of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee, China has experienced a
major historical turn, and great development of various
undertakings that has drawn worldwide attention. Such historic
achievements are inseparable from the re-establishment of
"emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts", as the
Party's ideological line and the re-understanding of the nature of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
They are also inseparable from the rise of creativity among the
masses with pioneering spirit, and the carrying forward of the
national spirit of self reliance. In the final analysis, they are
inseparable from the formation and development of Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the
Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism. Since the
fourth plenum of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has adhered to the
basic theories and lines of the Party, and promoted the ethical and
cultural progress in various aspects. The work has made positive
progress and achieved obvious results, playing an important role
in promoting reform, development, and stability. This mainstream
must be fully recognized while judging the current situation of
ethical and cultural advancement. Meanwhile, it should be clearly
seen that in the work of the leadership in some places, and
departments, the problem of neglect or being comparatively
casual in promoting ideological education and ethical and cultural
progress while being quite strong in promoting material progress,
has not yet been solved yet. There are still quite a few problems,
some quite serious, that exist in the cultural life in
society. Therefore, it is highly necessary to further enhance
awareness among all Party comrades of the importance and urgency
of promoting the socialist ethical and cultural progress. While
firmly keeping to the central task of economic construction and
promoting material progress, the ethical and cultural progress
should be given a higher status. More work should be done to
bring about a new situation for ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
The plenum pointed out that a socialist society is a society
with all-round development and all-round progress, and the
socialist modernization drive is an undertaking that coordinates
material progress and ethical and cultural progress. The ethical
and cultural progress the people are promoting is one that centers
on the economic construction, upholds the Four Cardinal Principles
and sticks to reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Such ethical and cultural progress, the inheritance and
development of fine traditions and the reflection of the spirit of
time, has its foot firmly planted in China, while facing the
world. Seeking ethical and cultural progress under the conditions
of developing a socialist market economy and opening up to the
outside world is an arduous historical task facing the Chinese
communists and the Chinese people. It has an impact on the full
realization of the country's magnificent trans-century blueprint,
as well as the thriving and prosperity of the socialist cause.

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian Prime Minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao today filed a bail application in the St. Kitts
forgery case in a Delhi court.
</P>
<P>
He also filed an application for exemption from personal
appearance in the court on October 14 for the same case.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court Wednesday granted Rao an anticipatory bail
till October 14.
</P>

Rao was arrested last night by the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) and was released immediately on bail.
</P>
<P>
Rao's counsel used various medical certificates to support the
bail plea.

The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate had earlier issued an order
summoning Rao to appear in person before the court and later
issued a non-bailable arrest warrant to him. The Supreme Court
exempted him from personal appearance before the court.

forged documents in an attempt to show that Ajeya Singh, son of
former Prime Minister V.P. Singh, maintained a secret account in
the First Trust Corporation in St. Kitts islands in West Indies
and deposited 21 million US dollars in it during 1986-87.

<HEADLINE> Sixth Plenum of 14th CPC Central Committee Held (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the 18 years since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC
Central Committee, China has experienced a major historical turn
and great development of various undertakings that has drawn the
world's attention, the plenum said, adding that such historic
achievements are inseparable from the re-establishment of
"emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts" as the
Party's ideological line and the re-recognition of the nature of
socialism. They are also inseparable from the promotion of
creativity among the masses of people with pioneering spirit, and
the carrying forward of the national spirit of self reliance.
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, they are inseparable from the formation
and development of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic line for the
primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Since the Fourth Plenum of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the
Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has
adhered to the basic theories and basic political line of the
Party and promoted ethical and cultural progress in various
aspects. Positive progress has been made and obvious results
abtained, thus playing an important role in promoting reform,
development and stability. This mainstream must be fully
recognized while judging the current situation of ethical and
cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it should be clearly seen that in the work of the
leadership in some places and departments, the problem of
neglecting ideological education and ethical and cultural progress
has not be solved. There are still quite a few problems, some
quite serious, which exist in the social and cultural
life. Therefore, it is highly essential to further enhance the
awareness among all Party members of the importance and urgency of
promoting socialist ethical and cultural progress. While firmly
keeping to the central task of economic development and promoting
material progress, ethical and cultural progress should be given a
higher, eminent status and more work done to bring about a new
situation for ethical and cultural progress.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Seeks Arrest Warrant for U.S. Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution
sought an arrest warrant on Thursday for an American soldier who
admitted having killed a South Korean woman last month.
</P>
<P>
Upon issuance of the warrant, the Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office planned to ask the U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters here that
the custody of its serviceman Eric Munnich Stephen be transferred
to South Korean judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for South Korea to request the transfer
of the custody of an American serviceman involved in a criminal
case before a verdict is given.
</P>
<P>
Stephen, 22, admitted to prosecutors on Wednesday that he
stabbed Lee Ki-soon, a 44-year-old South Korean prostitute, to
death in a brothel in Tongduchon, South Korea's Kyonggi Province.
</P>
<P>
Lee was found dead on September 7 from stab wounds near a
U.S. military base in Tongduchon.
</P>
<P>
According to the South Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement,
the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) shall give "sympathetic
consideration" to such a request.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains to be seen whether the USFK will accept the
request when it is filed.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Eighth U.S. Army reportedly expressed
reluctance to transfer Stephen because he has already been
confined to the army's prison.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, some 40 murders have been linked to the
U.S. military presence in South Korea, where 37,000 American
troops are stationed.

<HEADLINE> Korean County Strives for Biodiversity Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A plan for a massive paradise
where tigers, bears and deer can roam freely, has been approved by
a team of experts in China.
</P>
<P>
A Korean autonomous county in Northeast China's Changbai
Mountains region is to launch the massive project to regain its
bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
The proposed animal "kingdom" will be a safe haven for over 280
kinds of creatures.
</P>
<P>
The Changbai Korean Autonomous County, which is separated from
the People's Democratic Republic of Korea by the Yalu River, is
located in one of the few places which still have large areas of
primitive forest sheltering a multitude of wildlife in China.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with eight experts from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the China Research Institute of Forestry, Wang
Zhilong, Party secretary of the county committee, said that his
county has drafted a plan involving about 135 million yuan to halt
the deterioration of the natural environment, and allow more
animals and plants to return to Changbai, one of their traditional
homes.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that the county will apply to the Global
Environmental Fund (GEF) for aid of 6.7 million US dollars, while
itself finding the rest of the funding.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Changbai forests suffered the most devastating
destruction during more than a decade of Japanese occupation in
Northeast China, with large areas of trees felled and shipped to
Japan. He added that insufficient management and natural disasters
in the following years have seen shrinking forest coverage and
less wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the project includes reinforcing
anti-fire facilities, using worms as a ground ecology project, and
diseases forecasting and treatment, building irrigation canals and
enclosing woods and mountains.
</P>
<P>
"The county will set up a model reserve in an area of 34,225
hectares for the protection and breeding of wild life," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The reserve can also undertake research projects and receive
tourists."
</P>
<P>
The county, which has a forest coverage rate of over 80
percent, will build central heating facilities, provide more coal,
electricity and natural gas, so that residents can reduce the
burning of wood for fuel. It will also upgrade efficient use of
wood, so that the felling of trees can be reduced by about 15
percent by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The panel of experts approved the plan for the project, and
praised the county government's farsightedness in initiating the
gigantic project.

BEIRUT, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The monthly cost for a
five-person family in Lebanon are 1,335,661 Lebanese pounds (859
U.S. dollars), four times as much as the minimum salary level
defined by the government, Beirut's Ad-Diyar daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Christians-owned newspaper said that the figure was drawn
from a survey it made on 50 Lebanese families on the monthly
"normal and natural" expenditures for a family of husband and wife
and three children.
</P>
<P>
On foodstuffs, the family pays 480,850 Lebanese pounds (309
dollars), including the purchase of 12 kilograms of meats, 10
kilograms of cheeses, seven kilograms of milk, six kilograms of
oil, five kilograms of rice, five kilograms of sugar, 30 dozens
of Arab bread, as well as vegetables, fruits and other necessary
nutritious substances.
</P>
<P>
It costs the family 232,520 Lebanese pounds (149 dollars) to
pay for basic consuming goods, electricity, water and fuel, the
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey takes into account air conditioners the family uses
in summer and winter, while ignoring the expenses on gifts,
telephone, insurance and travel.
</P>
<P>
It also costs 235,625 Lebanese pounds (153 dollars) to pay for
clothes, 64,166 (41 dollars) for medical cares, 50,000 (32
dollars) for communications and 65,000 (42 dollars) for
children's pocket money.
</P>
<P>
The education of the three children in state-run schools costs
the family 2,490,000 Lebanese pounds (1601 dollars) a year, or
20,750 Lebanese pounds (133 dollars) a month, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The family has to pay more if it sends the children to
private schools, where the teaching conditions are better than
those in the government-run ones, the paper added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A 1,300-year-old clay fortress
that has been underwater for nearly 30 years in northwest China's
Gansu Province has been discovered intact.
</P>
<P>
The Yumen Pass in Anxi County, built during the Tang Dynasty
(618-907), was submerged after the Shuangta Reservoir was
constructed in 1958.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the ancient military structure was visible
during a certain period every year, when water in the reservoir
was released to irrigate nearby fields.
</P>
<P>
Local archaeologists studied the site during the period and
found that the fortress, which survived a thousand years of
weathering, was still in one piece.
</P>
<P>
At the fortress, the archaeologists found 155 m by 160 m city
walls, stone pillars, large bricks, and fragments of pottery.
</P>
<P>
The site has been used as a coordinate from which the positions
of a Tang imperial temple, three ancient roads, and 11 watchtowers
were determined, and remains were located according to historical
records.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the pass is proof of the high quality of
ancient clay structures.

<HEADLINE> Old Industrial Base Seeking Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China's largest
heavy-industry base expects to channel money from this regional
financial hub to make a face-lift of its hundreds of old
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning province in the northeast of China has recently
organized a high-profile delegation to Hong Kong, hoping to
attract funds in various forms to rejuvenate the old industrial
base.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 billion yuan (12.5 billion US dollars) is
needed during the Ninth Five-year Plan period (1996-2000) for
technological transformation of the four pillar industries --
petrol-chemistry, metallurgy, coal and machine-building, according
to Gao Guozhu, vice-governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
A small part of the money will be obtained as foreign loans. Up
to 2000, Liaoning plans to make use of 500 million US dollars in
foreign loans each year. The province expects to attract the
lion's share of the capital needed through various channels, like
direct investment, transfer of management right, lease, going
public overseas and setting up funds.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is one of the international financial center, where
global institutional investors gather to cash in the potential
development opportunities in China. The Vice-governor hoped that
Liaoning can raise funds here for its large-scale industrial and
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Anshan Steel and Iron Complex, one of China's largest steel
producers, is preparing for listing on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange, but first it must gain the approval of the China
securities watchdog. Gao said: "If Anshan can succeed in going
public in Hong Kong, it will blast a new way to enliven the old
state enterprises in Liaoning."
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has more than 1,200 large or medium-sized heavy
industrial enterprises and its industrial output accounts for one
tenth of the national total.

CANBERRA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
found new strength in local unemployment figures and rose on the
back of heightened expectations of an interest rate cut soon.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index jumped 12.8 points to 2323.5 points
today after it was pushed down by profit-taking selling yesterday.

<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures today
showing that the unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted
8.7 percent in September from 8.8 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The local financial market interpreted the figures as a sign of
a slowdown in the economy, which made it more likely for the
central bank to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 8.4 points higher at 1324.7
points, while the all resources index added 18.9 points to reach

KUALA LUMPUR, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian
Sociological Research Institute (MSRI) today handed over to the
Iranian Embassy here medicines for Kurdish refugees seeking
shelter at the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
The medicines worth 44,250 ringgit (about 17,700 U.S. dollars)
were donated by UPHA Corporation Malaysia, a local pharmaceutical
company, MRSI Chairman Alijah Gordon told reporters before handing
over the medicines to Iranian Ambassador Hossein Fereydoun here.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish refugees in the mountainous border area of Iran
have been receiving relief aid from Iran as U.N. assistance was
inadequate to meet the needs of this huge refugee population.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities have appealed to governments and
non-governmental organizations for medicines, particularly those
treating diarrhea, infections and breathing problems, health kits
for midwives, baby milk powder, foodstuffs, winter clothes and
shoes.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 160,000 people have fled their
homes in the Kurdish area of Iraq due to recent skirmishes there.

COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka Railways, which

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ Coalition Partners Remain Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A coalition among New
Zealand political parties, which will be on the next government,
has yet to be formed although the general election is merely two
days away.
</P>
<P>
Such a coalition will not take shape until the New Zealand
First party makes its choice: Whether it is to strike a deal with
the Labour Party or with the ruling National Party, two major
parties which have been rivals traditionally and held power
alternately.
</P>
<P>
Either party would need a coalition partner in order to govern
under a system of mixed member proportional representation newly
introduced to the general election this year.
</P>
<P>
A latest opinion poll shows a surge in support for Labour and
a slide for National. However, Labour has not mustered enough
support to change the previous post-election lineup.
</P>
<P>
A Labour-New Zealand First marriage with the support of the
other opposition party Alliance had been seen as the most likely
replacement for the present National government. The three parties
together were expected to get as many as 72 seats in the next
120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
National has always indicated that the three small parties of
United New Zealand, Christian Coalition and ACT NZ will be its
allies in the coalition. It has also said it can talk with anyone
on forming a government.
</P>
<P>
However, a Labour-New Zealand First coalition cannot be taken
for granted at present as a National-New Zealand First reunion
should be totally ruled out.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, who was once a
minister in the National government but was kicked out by Prime
Minister Jim Bolger, yesterday indicated that he would put aside
his dislike of Bolger to strike a post-election deal with
National.
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that his party would choose a coalition
partner that could accept the majority of its policies.
</P>
<P>
The statement has made it more difficult to predict the lineup
of the coalition, keeping analysts and politicians alike guessing
which ship Peters will jump onto.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First shares common ground with Labour in some
policies, mainly in the areas of health and education, while
differing on the Employment Contract Act, foreign investment and
the sale of the Forestry Corporation.
</P>
<P>
It can also work with National on most economic policies, but
the two parties cannot agree on foreign investment, asset sales
and social issues.
</P>
<P>
It could be well envisaged that the vote in the next parliament
would be based on a policy line rather than on the difference
between the government and opposition.
</P>
<P>
For example, Labour, Alliance and New Zealand First could vote
together on social issues like education and health, while
Alliance and New Zealand First might team up against National and
Labour on asset sales.
</P>
<P>
National and New Zealand First could stand together on the
controversial Employment Contract Act which both Labour and
Alliance want to repeal.
</P>
<P>
As the opinion poll shows that National would be in the
minority even with support from its minor partners, the party has
shown some near kindness to New Zealand First in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
But Peters remains adamant that he will not declare a
preference for Labour or National before the election day.
</P>
<P>
He said yesterday that the difficulty of working out a detailed
coalition agreement means that negotiations could take most of the
six weeks available after the election before the start of the new
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Investors Invited to Go into Tanzania's Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Investors have been
urged to venture into the shipping industry, an area which
Tanzania's efforts have been largely unsuccessful in setting up
its own shipping line.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international shipping forum here on Wednesday,
Minister for Communications and Transport William shipping said
except for the surviving Tanzania-Chinese Shipping Company,
Tanzania had failed to set up its shippig company.
</P>
<P>
"The government invites investors to take advantage of the
unexploited potential and start shipping companies, especially
for deep seas and lake trades," Kusila told participants of the
forum organized by Tanzania Central Freight Bureau (TCFB) to mark
their 14th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
He said such initiatives could even start with slot-charter
agreements with established shipping lines provided such schemes
were based on mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government would do everything possible
to create an enabling environment for prospective investors in
the sector which is equally lucrative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kusila called on the Tanzania Harbors Authority
(THA) to improve its services in order to compete effectively
with other neighboring ports.
</P>
<P>
"Transit traffic at the Dar es Salaam port has declined and
this trend needs to be checked by taking various measures to
improve the competitive position of the port.
</P>
<P>
"The attraction of a port depends on the pricing of its
services, quick turn-round of ships, quick cargo clearance from
the port, non-pilferage of cargo and the safety of the
environment," said Kusila who urged the THA to focus on the
factors for greater success of its marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
He also commended TCFB for registering a success in fulfilling
its mandate, mainly of regulating freight levels although the
organ faced resistance and resentment from ship owners, foreign
suppliers and local businessmen when intercepted.

<HEADLINE> More "Ideological Foods" Be Created for Children, Artists Propose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China's 300 million children
should be given more food for thought by the country's literary
and artistic circles.
</P>
<P>
They should work hard to provide more "ideological food" for
children, and to create a sound social environment for their
healthy growth, a symposium in Guiyang was told today.
</P>
<P>
The idea came from literary and artistic workers themselves at
the symposium, called to promote a National Program of Action for
the Development of Children in China in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the Children's Development
Center of China and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The proposal called on participants to the symposium to have a
better understanding of the situation of children in China.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was that being concerned about children is to
care for the future of the world, and the future of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said that to pay greater attention to the
development of children's undertakings is of strategic
significance for the rapid development of China in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
It noted that literary and artistic workers shoulder a very
important social responsibility for the healthy growth of more
than 300 million Chinese children.
</P>
<P>
The proposal called on all the country's literary and artistic
workers to improve their awareness of the survival, protection and
development of children, and create more and better literary and
artistic works for them.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, a batch of good literary and artistic works
will be published within a year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Aid Brings Better Life for Tibetans (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- International aid is playing an
active role in promoting economic and social progress in Tibet,
one of the most remote and rural areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its drive of reform and openness in 1978,
Tibet has received foreign aid worth 43.697 million US dollars
through 38 bilateral or multi-lateral aid programs.
</P>
<P>
Some programs added momentum to Tibet's economic growth and
improved the efficiency of its enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The first and second phase construction of Tibet's largest
geo-thermal power plant in Yangbajain was completed with the
financial support of the United Nations Development Program and
the Italian government, which totalled 12.17 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UN World Food Program took out 6.753 million US dollars to
raise food production in Tibet, while a German investment of 7.425
million US dollars turned the Lhasa Leather Factory, which had
suffered losses over a long period, into one of Tibet's most
successful enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In other projects, the UN Development Program aided Tibet in
planning local tourism development, the Belgian government
installed a modern telecommunications system with 5,000
program-controlled phones in Lhasa, and the German government
funded a number of small hydro-power projects across the region.
</P>
<P>
Education and public health have also drawn large sums of
foreign aid.

<HEADLINE> False Marriages on Rise in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of fictitious
marriages has been "incredibly increasing" in Israel due to the
fact that more than half of the 250,000 foreign workers are
illegally staying in the country, an official from the Interior
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post today quoted Batya Carmon, head of the visa
department of the ministry, as saying that there are now some
3,000 fictitious marriages a year in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Carmon said some 30 requests are received a day from
foreigners wanting to marry Israelis, and 30 percent of these are
false marriages.
</P>
<P>
The rate paid to women for accepting fictitious
marriages is 2,000 shekels (some 650 U.S. dollars), Carmon said,
although some women marry the workers as a favor.
</P>
<P>
Carmon said that in many cases the illegal workers, from
England, Ireland, New Zealand, and Eastern European and African
countries, had entered Israel several years before as tourists
when there was little awareness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
There is also a problem of workers who change their names
abroad, or marry abroad, or arrive in the Jewish state with false
documents and claim rights under the Law of Return, which
encourages Jewish immigrants back to Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carmon said that the foreign workers are aided by employment
agencies that deal with false documents and visas for tourists,
while the Israeli police are not acting on complaints that have
been filed.
</P>
<P>
The official warned against the possible consequences of the
growing number of foreign workers and fictitious marriages,
saying said they could lead to the race problems which are now
found sensitive in some European countries.

<P>
The UN Children's Fund spent 4.39 million US dollars to support
a dozen educational programs in Tibet, which have reduced the
proportion of unqualified teachers from 53.93 percent to 31.68
percent, and raised Tibetan children's schooling rate from 53.25
percent to 70.59 percent.
</P>
<P>
The first tuberculosis hospital in Tibet was built with a
Japanese donation of 9.524 million US dollars, while Italy
rendered 2.4 million US dollars to open a first-aid center in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Aid from New Zealand, Australia and Canada covered the expenses
of technical training for village charity workers from the vast
rural area of Tibet. Such training has helped cut the death rate
of Tibetan children, infants and women.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid also helped poor Tibetan people, especially those
from the rural areas, to achieve economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
After joining the educational program financed by the New
Zealand government, many poor women from Tingri County in
southwest Tibet have overcome illiteracy and acquired some
practical skills.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the illiteracy rate among the rural women
there has dropped from 61.88 percent to 50.68 percent, while their
average annual income rose from 280 yuan (nearly 35 US dollars) to
440 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Invites Assad to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has invited Syrian President Hafez Assad to
visit Israel and resume peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I invited President Assad previously to meet at Ba'abdeh
(Lebanon's Presidential palace), which I thought as an
appropriate place. I invite him today, if Ba'abdeh is not good, to
come to Jerusalem and discuss all the issues that are in
contention," Mordechai is quoted by The Jerusalem Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks Wednesday during a tour to Mount
Hermon on the Golan Heights where he inspected a large-scale
exercise carried out by Israeli armored troops. The Syrian army
was also carrying out maneuvers, in preparation for an exercise
starting next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai played down the recent tension between
Israel and Syria that was caused by Syrian troop movements near
the border and its test launching of Scud-C missiles.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Israel was watching closely the situation
with Syria and is prepared for any developments. He stressed that
there had been no change in the Syrian deployments in the past few
weeks, and reiterated that peace is in the best interest of both
sides.
</P>
<P>
"We have no interest whatsoever in heating up the region. On
the contrary, I once again call on President Assad and the Syrian
regime to find a way to return to the negotiating table and find
ways to advance and reach agreements which will serve all in the
region," Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked since early
this year and failed to resume after the May Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Israeli new government led by Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out
compromise on its self-claimed sovereignty over the Golan Heights
which it seized from Syria in 1967, while Syria insists on Israeli
full withdrawal from the strategic heights before making peace.
</P>
<P>
On the latest crisis in relations with Jordan, Mrodechai
called for calm and quiet diplomacy, while reiterating Israel's
commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent harsh comments made by Jordan's King
Hussein and attacks in Jordanian press against Netanyahu "are
unnecessary and don't serve anybody."
</P>
<P>
"The way is not to heat up with words or issue unnecessary
threats, but exactly the opposite - to calm down all those in the
region who are tense, both in words and deeds," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our path is that of peace, and of finding solutions, although
at the same time we are prepared for any possibilities. We don't
have any differences of opinion with Jordan and I call on King
Hussein to continue on the path he started," he added.
</P>
<P>
The lack of progress in the peace process and the recent
Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed have angered Jordan, the second Arab
country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel following
Egypt. King Hussein warned Israel that the hardline policies
adopted by the Netanyahu government could lead the region to
war.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan's Taliban Suffer First Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban religious
student militia have suffered their first defeat since taking
control of the capital of Kabul late last month, as one of the
provinces controlled by them was lost to their rival.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said today that Ahmad Shah Masood, military
commander of the ousted Afghan government, on Wednesday took back
Kapisa province and the strategic town of Gulbahar to the north of
Kabul from the Taliban, who captured the area eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
Forces under Masood launched a surprising two-pronged attack on
the province and the town. The Taliban suffered heavy casualties
during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban were reported to have been forced to
retreat from the strategic Darra-i-Salang near Gulbahar at the
mouth of Panjsher valley, Masood's hometown north of Kabul where
he once stayed after pulling out of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Fighting around Salang highway, the only way leading to the
north which is not controlled by the Taliban, continued and
Masood's army had reportedly made major gains.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the Taliban were seen retreating
from different fronts since the fall of Kabul on September 27.
</P>
<P>
However, a Taliban spokesman denied that the student militia
suffered any loss and said that only sporadic clashes occurred
during the day.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Consultations to form a
new cabinet in Kuwait following the recent legislative elections
will begin Saturday, according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah,

The Amir accepted the resignation of the old Kuwaiti Cabinet

last Tuesday in accordance with the constitution following the
parliamentary elections Monday when the Kuwait's eighth 50-member
National Assembly was elected.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the newly elected parliament to hold its first
session on October 20.
</P>

So far who would be ordered to form the new cabinet is still
not known although the crown prince might continue to hold the
rein of the government.
</P>
<P>
The sources indicated that if Sheikh Saad is again asked to
form the cabinet, he has already selected a number of the cabinet
members, especially for the so-called "sovereignty portfolios."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a number of new faces would be
incorporated into the coming cabinet just as the newly elected
parliament has emerged with half of its members being new.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the former speakers of the previous
parliaments Abdelaziz Hamed Al-Saqer, Ahmed Zaid Al-Sarhan and
Ahmed Abdelaziz Al-Saadoun, emphasised when meeting the Amir the
need to form a "homogeneous" government which should establish a
strong understanding with the parliament.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that majority in the new parliament are
"moderate faces and ready to cooperate with the government."
</P>
<P>
They also said that the next government should be able to
assume its executive authorities promptly and without hesitation,
adding that a strong government was urgently needed to restore
the full and balanced role of the executive authorities, part of
which was surrendered to the previous parliament.

<HEADLINE> New Education Goals Set Up in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A broader national policy on
technical education and vocational training has been formulated
by the Zambian government to address the requirements of the
labor market in the new economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The ''technical education, vocational and entrepreneurship
training (tevet)'' policy made public on Wednesday is to address
competence based on modular training which will be demand and
industry driven.
</P>
<P>
Tevet is designed to satisfy the new changes in the labor
market, including socio-economic concerns and resource based
opportunities in the economy.
</P>
<P>
In all aspects, tevet aims to balance the supply of skilled
labor with the demands in the economy so that in turn, it acts to
improve productivity and income generation.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy document, tevet has been formulated
because of failure by the government to generate employment
opportunities in view of the declining economy coupled with
complaints from employment sector that the quality of graduates
from many training institutions in Zambia were below expected
standards.
</P>
<P>
Unlike 20 years ago, more than 70 percent of active labor
force in Zambia is employed in the informal sector at present
while formal sector employment has experienced a drastic decline
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
With the economy becoming internationally integrated, Zambia's
industry will only survive if it produces quality goods and
services which need both qualified and competent manpower.
</P>
<P>
It is in this regard that in-house training or competent based
modular training becomes imperative for local industries to face
competition in international market through quality products and
services, according to the policy document.

<HEADLINE> Corrupt Practices Lead to Destruction: Malaysian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that corrupt practices which
start from a contest for posts in the ruling party UMNO could
destroy the party, the nation, race and religion.
</P>
<P>
He reminded members of the United Malays National Organization
(UMNO) of the impacts of corruption, saying a nation that accepts
bribery as its culture may never progress.
</P>
<P>
If corrupt candidates were selected to lead UMNO, all
government dealings will cease to function and all costs will
escalate, Mahathir, who is UMNO president, said when opening the
UMNO general assembly here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said no other means were more effective to destroy a
nation and race than to choose leaders who abuse their position
and were corrupt.
</P>
<P>
UMNO must be led by leaders who are of high caliber, with
quality, incorruptible and do not place their personal interests
above others, he said, adding UMNO leaders must be made up of
those committed to fighting for reforms and willing to make
sacrifices for the love of their nation, culture and religion.
</P>
<P>
UMNO, representing the interests of Malays who make up over 53
percent of the country's 19 million population, is a dominant
party in the ruling 13-member National Front coalition which has
ruled the country since its independence in 1957. The party's
membership stands at 2.6 million, making it one of the world's
biggest political parties.
</P>
<P>
This year's four-day UMNO general assembly, which started
yesterday with the Youth and Women wings holding their elections,
will see the party elect leaders for the remaining years of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO general assembly coincides with the party's 50th
anniversary and was being held at a time when members of the
breakaway Party Melayu Semangat 46 (Malay Spirit 46 Party) (known
as S46) return en masses into the UMNO fold following S46
dissolution four days ago.
</P>
<P>
The party today will elect three vice presidents and 25 members
in the Supreme Council, the party's highest policy-making body.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Further Develop Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Six years of successful
experiences have proved that China's securities market should be
expanded, a top securities official said recently in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the securities market should be further explored
and developed, and a healthy securities market will fit well into
China's socialist market economy and help to boost it," said Zhou
Zhengqing, chairman of the State Council Securities Committee.
</P>
<P>
Securities have shown to be effective fund-raising channels,
and are conducive to improving the management of enterprises by
pushing them into the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China's enterprises had raised a
total of 120 billion yuan in the stock market by the end of last
July.
</P>
<P>
From 1981 to 1995, China issued 480 billion yuan-worth of state
treasury bonds, significantly relieving the stringent state budget.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also urged that regulations on China's securities market
be strengthened and that speculations be curbed, saying the market
is still young and needs improvement.
</P>
<P>
"But all the problems will be solved with the socialist market
economy being fully established," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
China permitted securities to be traded in 1986, when it opened
the first securities trading center in Shanghai since the founding
of new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
In late 1990 the Shanghai Securities Exchange was founded and
in 1991 the Shenzhen bourse was set up.
</P>
<P>
The securities market received an actual boost in 1991, when
the Seventh National People's Congress, the nation's legislature,
called for steady development in the financial market and widened
fund-raising channels by encouraging a mature securities market.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Kemp Face Off in U.S. Vice-Presidential Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Republican vice-presidential candidate Jack Kemp differed
sharply over domestic policies during a debated on Wednesday night
in St. Petersburg, Florida.
</P>
<P>
During the prime-time 90-minute vice presidential debate, Kemp
attacked the government's economic policy, tax-cut plan and
support for affirmative action programs that favor minorities in
employment and education, while Gore defended the government's
policies.
</P>
<P>
"This economy is overtaxed, over-regulated," Kemp said while
promoting Republican presidential nominee Robert Dole's plan to
cut taxes 15 percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the economy was growing only 2.5 percent a year
under President Bill Clinton, Kemp said: "Bob Dole and I believe
we can do a lot better."
</P>
<P>
Gore called Dole's tax-cut plan a "risky tax scheme" that would
"blow a hole in the deficit and cause much deeper cuts in
Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment."
</P>
<P>
Kemp and Gore tried hard to reinforce respectively the
positions set forth by Clinton and Dole in their first debate on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Kemp said Clinton and Gore were practicing "demagoguery" in
trying to scare senior Americans by alleging that Dole's budget
plan would require devastating Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
Gore reaffirmed the government's commitment to protecting
health care programs for the elderly from budget cuts. "We will
save Medicare" in a second Clinton term, he said.
</P>
<P>
The candidates' debate on affirmative actions and abortion were
two issues that did not came up in the first debate between
Clinton and Dole Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Kemp criticized Clinton for vetoing legislation banning certain
late-term abortions, while Gore hit back by saying Kemp had voted
47 out of 47 times while in Congress to support restrictions on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
Defending his Democratic Party's support for affirmative action
programs, Gore accused Kemp of shifting positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kemp had criticized a California ballot
initiative rolling back affirmative action programs, but then
changed his position and spoken in favor of the measure after
being selected to share the ticket with Dole.
</P>
<P>
Gore advocated Clinton's plan for targeted tax cuts to help
low- and middle-class families pay for college, while Kemp said
government should not engage in "social engineering" by picking
winners and losers through its tax policy.
</P>
<P>
Kemp criticized Clinton and Gore for wanting the government to
have too heavy a hand in every area of domestic policy,
contrasting that with Dole's tax-cut push to make millions of
dollars in job-creating capital available.
</P>
<P>
The debate was carried by three major broadcast networks.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Kemp Debate on U.S. Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican and
Democratic vice presidential nominees are holding conflicting
views on current U.S. foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
As the nominee of the Republican party, Jack Kemp criticized
the U.S. foreign policy under the Bill Clinton administration for
"lack of direction" while Vice President Al Gore argued the policy
made the country "much stronger" today.
</P>
<P>
In their only vice presidential debate tonight in St.
Petersburg, Florida, the two nominees spent much of the 90-minute
debate on domestic issues including tax, welfare, education,
environment and employment.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Kemp said in many cases that the
U.S. "caused the problem in the first place." Talking about the
U.S. policy toward Haiti, Kemp said, "You cannot say, in our
opinion, that Haiti is a great success."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S. should not have acted unilaterally
when it decided to bomb Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the view taken by Kemp, Gore defended the current
U.S. foreign policy by saying that the U.S. had played the role of
leadership in restoring democracy in Haiti and peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraq issue, the vice president said that sometimes, the
U.S. has to act unilaterally for its national interest.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there was a momentum toward reconciliation in
Northern Ireland with U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
On defense policy, Kemp repeated Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole's opinion that the Clinton administration's
cutting defense spending harms the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that a Republican tax-cut policy would weaken the
country's defense as well as welfare, education and environment.

OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin today announced that the federal deficit target for 1998-99
will be 9 billion Canadian dollars (6.6 billion U.S. dollars), or
1 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Martin revealed the new goal in his annual fiscal and economic

that the federal deficit for 1995-96 came in 4.1 billion dollars
lower than predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is on target to meet or better this
year's target of 24.3 billion dollars or 3 percent of GDP, and 17
billion or 2 percent of GDP in 1997-98, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
If these targets are achieved, a stage will be set for a
balanced budget around the turn of the century, he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks in India Prefer Gilts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks in India are
deferring advances to cash-starved corporations and are instead
parking their funds in the gilts market, bank sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks like Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong and
shanghai bank, Anz Grindlays Bank and Deutsche bank are buying
government securities in the debt market, hoping for a cash
reserve ratio (CRR) cut.
</P>
<P>
Some of these foreign banks are taking a position in the debt
market as they expect the prices of securities to go up following
the CRR cut that the market expects from the central bank. "The
prices of gilts will go up if there is a reduction in the CRR, so
we are taking positions," a dealer in a foreign bank said, adding
that the banks are also deferring their lending to corporations as
they can book profits on securities.
</P>
<P>
Nationalized banks have become sellers in the debt market as
they are disposing of their securities to these foreign banks. The
wholesale debt market is witnessing a spurt in securities trading.
As a result of hectic trading indulged by foreign banks, mainly in
the short term securities, the prices of the two and three year
securities are going up very day.

<HEADLINE> 115-Member Family Applies for World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Four members of the same
family in Shanghai who had never met before attending a family
gathering in April have learned they may be part of the world's
largest family.
</P>
<P>
The Xue household, which now has 40 families and 115 family
members, has applied for a Guinness World record as the largest
family. Their application was made through the Shanghai branch of
the Guinness World Record Book, headquartered in London.
</P>
<P>
The oldest member of this four-generation clan living in
China's most populated city is 92-year-old Xue Fengqi. The
youngest is his great-granddaughter, who is two.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1920s, Xue married Fan Mingzhen, now 88. They have
ten daughters and two sons.
</P>
<P>
Three months before Xue's youngest son was born in 1952, Xue's
eldest daughter had a child. She now had eight children.
</P>
<P>
Nine days ago, a female army officer married Xue's grandson,
who is the 115th family member.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the relatives live in Yangpu District, some
met for the first time at a family gathering on April 25, when the
entire group came together for a family photo.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chun, another of Xue's grandsons, who is a taxi driver,
drove a passenger to the workers' activity center where Yang was
scheduled to attend the family photo session that day.
</P>
<P>
When they reached their destination, Yang discovered that his
fare was his cousin's husband.
</P>
<P>
During a chat with friends, Xue's son realized that his family
might be eligible for setting a world record. The Xue's have been
verified as the largest family in Shanghai. Their status with
Guinness is pending.

in Hong Kong and New York in 1993. Its yearly post-tax profit grew
by 96.4 percent, 71.6 percent and 42.4 percent, respectively, in
the years between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Shanghai Petrochemical reported
a sales profit rate of 17 percent, compared with an average rate
of 4.5 to seven percent for international competitors. The
company's net asset-income ratio was 7.19 percent, as against
3.7-4.6 percent for world competitors, and its per-share earnings
rate was 12.1 percent, compared with five-to-seven percent for the
world average.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai Petrochemical is short of capital and the bank loan
will certainly breathe fresh air into the company," an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said that Shanghai Petrochemical has
entered a critical period of growth and its ethylene production
capacity is expected to reach one million tons during the current
Ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in India Remains Cyclical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian capital market
will continue to witness a cyclical trend for investments by
foreign institutional investors (FII) over a 12-month period,
according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India here
today.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative investments by FII now stand at 6.79 billion US
dollars and the figure of 122.8 million dollars for FII
investments in September this year is identical to the net FII
investments recorded in September, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, sharp drops have been noticed, which
are usually followed by a complete reversal in trends, with a
sharp rise.
</P>
<P>
"The FII investments have never been uniform. What has been
witnessed in recent months is not unusual," a market regulator
said.
</P>
<P>
The markets have witnessed sharp swings with the net FII
investments dipping from 302.4 million dollars in July, 1996 to 81
million in August and then rising to 122.8 million in September.
</P>
<P>
Several factors like the fear of a slow-down of the economy,
the growing political uncertainty and the delay in key decisions
relating to the disinvestment plan for public sector undertakings
have affected the market sentiments, FII sources said.

KATHMANDU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Thai Airways flight was
canceled Wednesday after surviving a major mishap during take-off
from the Tribhuvan international airport in this capital city of
Nepal, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The TG-312 flight met an accident in the afternoon during
take-off when a group of vultures struck the airbus 300-600 jet,
the Kathmandu post daily reported.
</P>

The Thai jet, carrying 228 passengers and crew members, was
lightly damaged during the accident. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
Airlines officials said the jet's engine fan blades were
damaged and the area above the pilot's cockpit window was stained

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Withdraw From Pooneryn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
have strategically withdrawn from Pooneryn, one of the three
gateways to the northern Jaffna Peninsula, military sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said about 2,000 troops, who were stationed there
together with armor, artillery and support elements, were pulled
out Wednesday as it was no longer necessary for them to stay there
in view of the present ground situation in the north following the
rout of the Tamil rebels from the Jaffna Peninsula and Kilinochchi
Town.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the troops controlled most of the Jaffna
Peninsula, but new naval facilities are able to detect big
movements across the Jaffna lagoon.
</P>
<P>
Pooneryn was overrun by the rebels in November 1991, when 605
army personnel were killed and about 1,000 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Later the government troops withdrew from most parts of the
peninsula, leaving it in the hands of the rebels who have been
fighting for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Pooneryn was recaptured by the government troops in November
1993.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Create More Jobs for Laid offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China's private sector has
created more jobs for laid off employees of stagnant state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted an official of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) as saying that in
1995 alone, the private sector nation-wide hired 1.5 million
displaced workers from state-owned enterprises and collectively
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China's private companies have hired 56 million people, six
percent of the nation's employed workers, since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lin, deputy chief of SAIC's department for individual and
private enterprises, said that Liaoning Province, a major
industrial center of state-owned enterprises in northeast China,
has provided a total of 800,000 jobs in private firms for
displaced workers in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Five development areas have been established in Shenyang, the
provincial capital, to attract private companies willing to hire
the laid offs.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's leading industrial city, more than 85,000
displaced state-owned enterprises workers created their own
businesses or were employed by private companies in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
China had 25.28 million self-employed workers and 654,500
private companies at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sang Lin said the private sector has become an indispensable
supplement to the public-owned economy, working in tandem with the
reform of state-owned enterprises.

<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- In a mess of a busy soccer day,
Estonia failed to show up for its home game against Scotland on
Wednesday in the World Cup European Group four qualifier.
</P>
<P>
FIFA officials, the sport's world governing body, initially
ruled three points for Scotland by forfeit, but reversed its
decision after strong protests from the hosts.
</P>
<P>
Thus, a decision is expected to be made on October 20 by the
FIFA organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The mess was resulted from a sudden change of timing for the
kick-off after complaint of lighting was raised by the Scottish
squad.
</P>
<P>
Five hours prior to the start of the supposed night game,
concerned officials decided to move ahead the qualifier to
daylight, leaving the hosts in no way to hurry up its squad in
time.
</P>
<P>
When Scottish players marched in Tallinn, Estonia, at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, Estonian players were nowhere, and the referee
blew the whistle to stop the game seconds later.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cuts Budget Due to Revenue Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided
to trim its 984-billion-baht (39.36 billion US dollar) budget for
the fiscal year 1997 by 2.4 percent to 959 billion baht (38.36
billion dollars) because it will fall short of its revenue
collection target.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated revenue shortfall was attributed to the
economic slowdown which has prompted the government to readjust
the budget, according to caretaker finance minister Bodi
Chunnananda.
</P>
<P>
Despite the budget cut, Bodi said his ministry would adhere to
the balanced budget policy without seeking loans to fill it up.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's fiscal 1997 began on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters on Wednesday that the country's next year's
growth rate was expected to be about 7 percent, lower than the
Bank of Thailand's prediction of this year's growth of 7.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, the central bank projected the
growth rate to be at 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget cut goes against the policy of the Banharn
Silpa-archa government which, during its 14 months in office,
leaned towards increasing the expenditure budget.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Launches New Planes to Rival With Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Airbus Consortium
announced today it will launch next year two derivatives of the
medium- and long-range jet airliner A340 that can compete with the
Boeing 747 series.
</P>
<P>
It will accelerate studies on A340-600 and A340-500, the Airbus
industry said.
</P>
<P>
The consortium predicted that about 3,600 airliners with 250 to
400 seats will be needed worldwide in the future, and the company
hopes to attain 50 percent of the market share through developing
new types of airliners.
</P>
<P>
To match the Boeing 747-200, the upcoming A340-600, 10.7 meters
longer than A340, can carry 376 passengers and is capable of
flying 13,700 kilometers without refuelling.
</P>
<P>
With a cruise distance of 15,400 kilometers, the A340-500 is
3.2 meters longer than A340 and can transport 316 passengers,
which enables it to rival with the Boeing 777-300.
</P>
<P>
The existing A340, with four jet engines and a cruise distance
of 13,505 kilometers, can carry only 295 passengers. Yet the
Boeing 747 jumbo, with a much longer nonstop mileage, can carry as
many as 400 passengers.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Official Rules Out Closed Trading Bloc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Dato Ajit Singh,
secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), said here that the group's greater economic integration
would not lead to the creation of a closed trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
In this age of strong economic competition, member states are
conscious of the need to continuously expand their economic
activities, Singh told a seminar on "Latin America and the
Caribbean: Economic Outlook and Opportunities" on Wednesday,
official sources at the seminar said today.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the ASEAN may have no alternative but to move beyond
closer economic cooperation toward greater economic integration,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured the participants that such an integration
would not evolve into a "Fortress ASEAN" or a closed trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
"What is certain at this stage is that even as the ASEAN moves
closer together, it remains committed to the principle of open
regionalism," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN is ready to form cross linkages with other regional
trading arrangements in order to facilitate trade and reduce
non-tariff barriers," the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1967, the ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam and is
expected to admit the three remaining countries in Southeast Asia
-- Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar -- within the next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Dark clouds were cast over the
sky of the Czech Republic as three air accidents occurred on
Tuesday, causing four deaths.
</P>
<P>
Bad weather is the major killer on the day dubbed as "black
Tuesday", as continuous rain and dense fog afflicted the country
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The most serious accident happened on Tuesday morning in a
northern town of the country when a plane suddenly caught fire
while taking off.
</P>
<P>
Three Germans on board died immediately and another passenger,
who was seriously injured, was helicoptered to a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
On the same morning, a 58-year-old pilot became the victim of
another tragedy as his helicopter crashed in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon of this miserable day, a Polish plane had to
make a forced landing in northern part of the country. Lucky
enough were the four crew members, who were only slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the country has seen 14 air mishaps within
its territory, which caused eight deaths in all.

<HEADLINE> Sandinists Promise Welfare to Army Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sandinista National
Liberation Front (FSLN) today wrote an election check to army
veterans and war victims, promising more welfare to them if it
wins the October 20 election.
</P>
<P>
In an agreement signed today between the FSLN and war veterans,
the FSLN promised that it will set up an institution to help them
return to civilian life and even to work at administrative and
management posts.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is described by FSLN presidential
candidate Daniel Ortega as "far reaching", also included medical
treatment for retired servicemen and war victims and their family
members, assistance and technical training for developing and
promoting their business enterprises and a revision of the
pensions for war victims.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to veterans and relatives of the war dead, Ortega
said his party will continue the peace process that has been under
way since the signing of the Esquipulas Accords which ended a
decade-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We who know about the suffering and pain (of the war), are the
ones who most cherish peace," said the Sandinista leader.
</P>
<P>
The former president accused his major campaign rival, the
Liberal Alliance, of "walking around with speeches of war, revenge
and instability" "because they are the ones who are criticizing
our peace agreement".
</P>
<P>
"People are tired of war, what people want is work, to support
themselves with an honest job and that is what we want to achieve
with the government of everybody," he said.

<HEADLINE> American Defense Ministers End Meeting in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BARILOCHE, ARGENTINA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The second
conference of American defence ministers ended here today with a
call for respecting the sovereignty of every country, the
international law and the U.N. Charter while strengthening
military cooperation and protecting regional security.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a document known as the "Declaration
of San Carlos de Bariloche", which was issued at the end of the
three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
However the document did not mention the U.S. proposal on the
establishment of a unified air control system for the American
continent and a training center for the civilian workers in the
armed forces of the American countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the conference said that defence ministers
from Latin America did not show much interest in the U.S. proposal
because they feared the proposal would be in conflict with their
national interests. Defense Secretary William Perry left for home
on Tuesday night without attending today's closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that the best way for maintaining regional
peace and security is to build mutual trust and strengthen defense
cooperation among the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
It said that the willingness to enhance defense cooperation
among the American countries will help solve the outstanding
disputes and give an impetus to bilateral and multilateral
cooperation in other fields.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on all nations on the American continent
to involve themselves more in peacekeeping operations in
accordance with the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
In another document titled as "Conclusions of the Working
Groups", the defense ministers from 34 American countries agreed
on information exchange, cooperation in professional and
educational activities, joint military exercises and meetings of
civilian and defense policy makers from countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Defense Minister Josrge Dominguez in his closing
speech urged his American counterparts to cooperate more closely
in fighting terrorism, drug trafficking, discrimination and
poverty.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Bulgaria to Continue Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria should continue with its
proposed strict and effective measures for economic reform, says
Pitar Stek, the newly elected executive chairman of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The measures include closing down unprofitable state-run
enterprises, privatizing some state companies and stabilizing the
country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian crisis was one of confidence and had reached rock
bottom, Stek said here after meeting the nation's prime minister,
Zhan Videnov, today.
</P>
<P>
If Bulgaria could fully implement its drafted economic
policies, the country was likely to get more financial aid, Stek
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank, in the past few years, has focused its discussions
with Bulgaria on how to settle issues relating to lumbering
state-run enterprises, which, reportedly, had kept on receiving
massive financial subsidies from the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria was getting technical assistances from the World Bank
and would receive support from international financial
organizations before the end of this year, the chairman said.

<HEADLINE> City Wall Of Chinese Capital To Be Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The only section of Beijing's
city wall remaining from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) has been
saved from destruction and is scheduled for repairs.
</P>
<P>
The city's urban planning, cultural artifacts protection, and
construction departments are working out plans for the the
renovation project.
</P>
<P>
The 500-meter wall is located near the corner of Dongbianmen
and is connected with the Ancient Observatory and is an important
piece of evidence of changes in the city wall.
</P>
<P>
Last month, when a Beijing resident wrote a letter to the press
saying that the remaining section of the wall was going to be
demolished to make way for a highrise, it provoked strong protests
from the city's residents, and architecture and cultural artifacts
experts called on the government to save the wall at any price.
</P>
<P>
"The most concrete and symbolic expression of the city's
history is its palace and city wall. Even one brick has historical
meaning. The city wall has very important historical and cultural
meaning, and should be protected and utilized," said Professor Hou
Renzhi, chairman of the city's artifact and historic site
protection committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kaiji, an 84-year-old architect, said that, "Most of the
ancient city wall is now in suburban areas, but this one is
located in the downtown, so it is more valuable."
</P>
<P>
Shan Jixiang, director of the Beijing Cultural Relics Bureau,
said that the municipal government has decided to fully protect
the city wall, making it a cultural site, and had allocated a
special fund of 300,000 yuan (37,000 US dollars) to renovate the
city wall in 1995, but hadn't begun the renovation work because of
the narrow streets around the area.
</P>
<P>
Some old and rundown dwellings around the area have been
demolished to provide better access for the renovation.

HAVANA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuban anti-drug forces have
seized nearly 100 kilograms of drugs and detained 40 drug dealers
in Havana's Jose Marti International Airport during the period
from January to September.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, including cocaine, marijuana, hashish and heroin,
were mostly bound for Europe, the "Granma" newspaper quoted
authorities as saying, today.
</P>
<P>
The confiscations and detentions were attributed to the efforts
and collaboration of the Cuban Customs and Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one operations were carried out this year against
international drug trafficking, 2.5 tons of drugs confiscated, and
63 foreigners and 10 Cubans detained.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports Face Fiercer Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice exporters have been
told to conserve original markets while exploring new ones, as
increased rice production worldwide would affect Thai rice
exports.
</P>
<P>
World rice production this year is put at 375.7 million tons, a
1.2 percent rise from last year's 371.5 million tons, according to
Sompol Kiatphaibool, secretary of Thailand's Committee of Rice
Policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the world rice trade volume is expected to drop to
19.3 million tons compared to 19.7 million tons from the last
crop, according to Sompol.
</P>
<P>
Thailand expects to produce about 21.36 million tons of rice
from the 1996/97 crop, a slight drop from 22.01 million tons in
the previous crop.
</P>
<P>
Thai rice exports would be around 4.5-5 million tons next year,
close to the amount in the year ending this October.
</P>
<P>
Major concern surrounds low grade rice markets where there is
fierce competition from India and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is assisting exporters by introducing a
kind of drying machines to improve the quality of rice and boost
export competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Latin America to Form Trading Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Latin American
countries reached an agreement Wednesday on the establishment of
trading houses in their respective countries as part of the effort
to increase trade and reduce dependence on a third party.
</P>
<P>
Through the Latin American and Indonesian trading houses
(LAMINDO), Indonesia could become a gateway for export products
from Latin American countries to the Southeast Asian region, said
Rudy J. Pesik, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry's committee for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
A number of LAMINDO trading houses would also be established in
some Latin American countries in the first quarter of 1997, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a result, the intention of Chile and Mexico to
act as a gateway for Indonesian export products could become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Indonesia lagged behind other ASEAN
member countries which had long made a trade breakthrough in some
Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's opportunity to enter the Latin American market is
quite big and wide-open, but so far Indonesian products have been
sold in Latin America through a third party, Pesik said.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between Indonesia and Latin America and the
Caribbean stood at 1.56 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, compared
with 1.073 billion dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the trading houses was signed after a two-day
seminar on "Latin America and the Caribbean: Economic Outlook and
Opportunities" held here on October 8 and 9.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Destroys Huge Heroin Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombia today
destroyed the biggest heroin processing complex yet found in the
country, anti-drug police said.
</P>
<P>
Four laboratories were destroyed and processing chemicals
seized together with 8.5 kilograms of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Deputy police chief Luis Enrique Montenegro said: "This was the
biggest complex for heroin production that we have ever discovered
in Colombia."
</P>
<P>
At least seven people were arrested and police fought for eight
hours in the remote mountain region before seizing the complex.
</P>
<P>
A report published by the United States Drug Enforcement
Administration said Colombia had squeezed past Asia as the main
supplier of high-purity heroin to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that Colombia also supplied about 80
percent of the world's cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week three cocaine laboratories were found and
destroyed in the eastern Colombian province of Guaviare.

<HEADLINE> Fifteen World Cup Qualifiers Battled in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Wednesday was a busy day when 15
World Cup qualifiers were played in Europe, including a match that
Scotland scored three points even without touching the ball.
</P>
<P>
Sports minnows Estonia failed to show up for the Group four
match in Tallinn, Estonia, as the kick-off was brought forward
nearly three hours due to floodlighting in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Scotland became the lucky winner as Estonia claimed they
could not field in the team in time, neither to have TV schedules
altered.
</P>
<P>
The world soccer's governing body FIFA is expected to rule on
the case on November 7.
</P>
<P>
In other hot matches, European champions Germany routed Armenia
5-1 in Group nine in Yerevan despite the absence of seven injuried
players.
</P>
<P>
In its opener, Germany netted the goals through Thomas Haessler
who scored twice in 20th and 39th minutes, with the other three
from Juergen Klinsmann in the 26th, Fredi Bobic in the 69th and
Stefan Kuntz in the 80th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Karapet Mikaelyan netted a consolation for the home side
minutes before the end of the competition.
</P>
<P>
After its loss to Ukraine on Saturday, Portugal improved its
group standing to second with a 3-0 win in Albania.
</P>
<P>
And the Czech Republic, runners-up in European championship in
June, played a Group six scoreless draw against Spain in Prague.
</P>
<P>
England rallied to beat Poland 2-1 through two first half goals
from Alan Shearer, standing atop in Group two on goal difference
against Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italy also made two straight wins with its 1-0 victory over
Georgia in Perugia through Fabrizio Ravanelli in the 42nd minute.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Cup qualifiers witnessed two main upsets on
the day when Israel played a 1-1 home game against Russia in Group
five and Austria won an away game 1-0 against Sweden in Stockholm
in Group four.
</P>
<P>
Denmark beat Greece 2-1 in Copenhagen, but the Greeks kept its
top spot in Group one on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
With 25 minutes into the game, Denmark was awarded the lead
with an own goal from Theodoros Zagorakis.
</P>
<P>
Brian Laudrup secured the winner in the 50th minute after
Georgios Donis put in the equaliser in the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
Kjetil Rekdal of Norway was the individual phenomenon of the
day by scoring a hat-trick in seven minutes, awarding his team a
3-0 win over Hungary in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Ireland also recorded a 3-0 win over Macedonia, while France,
hosts of the World Cup, won over Turkey 4-0 in Paris.

<HEADLINE> IOC Plans Tougher Rules to Check Commercialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- There would be tougher rules
meted out to keep commercialism from degrading the Olympics,
International Olympic Committee (IOC) chiefs said in Lausanne,
Switzerland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta was heavily criticised for commercial excesses. Some
said the large number of city-backed private vendors allowed to
clog the city centre had made the Games look like a huge flea
market.
</P>
<P>
IOC officials said they were worried that some products could
damage the image of the Games and there would be tougher rules in
the future.
</P>
<P>
IOC vice-president Dick Pound said, by recent experience
learned from Atlanta, IOC will take a look at the host city
contract to deal with the ability of a host city to ambush the
Olympic organising committee.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has a number of official sponsors and rules about how
the Olympics Games can be used in advertising. Pound said the IOC
would not give the Games to cities in the future unless it agreed
with their commercial plans.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Prime Minister Awarded WHO Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) announced today that Prime Minister of Pakistan Mohtarma
Benazir Bhutto has been awarded the highest distinction of WHO --
the Health-for-All Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto was awarded the medal in recognition of her outstanding
contribution to health achievements in Pakistan, notably her
successful efforts to integrate health in the overall development
process.
</P>
<P>
Such integration is an essential element of the health for all
strategy, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
In making the decision on the award, WHO's Director-General
Hiroshi Nakajima stressed that Bhutto had made determined efforts
to ensure that the health sector was accorded top priority within
the overall plan for the socioeconomic development of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan's social action program, the equivalent of eight
billion U.S. dollars has been committed for the 1993-1998 period
to develop the social sector with emphasis on health promotion,
family planning and environmental sanitation.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, no less than 100,000 women health workers will be
trained under Bhutto's initiative to improve the provision of
primary health care in rural Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has also actively supported the annual
National Immunization Day and HIV/AIDS prevention and control
activities. Moreover, she has been instrumental in revitalizing
the country's tuberculosis control program and in establishing a
coordinated Population Planning and Safe Motherhood Program,
involving all relevant governmental agencies.

<HEADLINE> Rockslide Kills Four in Chilean Copper Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Four miners were killed by a
rockslide at a Chilean copper mine today, the third fatal mining
accident of the week in the country, according to mining officials.
</P>
<P>
The four victims were doing routine work around a conveyor belt
when they were buried by tons of earth and boulders.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of all the four workers have been recovered after
being trapped for hours, the spokesman of the El Abra copper mine
said.
</P>
<P>
The mine, a joint venture between Chile's state copper firm
Codelco and U.S. mining company Cyprus Amax Minerals, started
production in August with an aim to become one of the country's
largest mines with an annual output of 225,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The accident stopped production at the mine in that the
rockslide had affected the function of the 11-kilometer-long
conveyor belt which is the mine's lifeline, linking the opencut
mine to the crusher plant.
</P>
<P>
In the other two mining accidents of the week, a miner tumbled
down an 18-meter pit on Sunday at Codelco's El Teniente mine while
another miner died two days later after he was hit in the head by
a swinging steel door at Codelco's Andina mine.

<HEADLINE> Avramovic Quits Leadership in Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Dragoslav Avramovic, who headed
the list in the Yugoslav opposition coalition Together for
upcoming parliamentary elections, quit the running for elections,
coalition election headquarters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic, the former Yugoslav National Bank Governor who was
sacked last May for his radical economic reform, has notified the
coalition of four Serbian political parties he was withdrawing due
to a sudden deterioration of his health, the opposition election
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old economist, who saved the almost-collapsed
Yugoslav economy in early 1994, had been elected to lead the
opposition coalitions formed by four parties of different
political orientations -- Serbian Renewal Movement, Democratic
Party, Democratic Party of Serbia and Civic Alliance. He said late
last month he was offered the post of prime minister if the
coalition wins the elections on November 3.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic was sacked by the government as the national bank
governor last May for his radical economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic's doctors said recently he is suffering from high
blood pressure, which seriously hinders his regular dialysis.
</P>
<P>
The coalition Together said it would pursue its pre-election
campaign in accordance with its adopted program which gives
priority to economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Church Arson Reflects Racial Problem: Federal Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The burnings of black
churches in the South since last year reflect an alarming rise in
racial tensions in American society, federal civil rights
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which held
community forums on the church fires in six southern states, said
the inquiry has shown that the string of arsons reflects a deeper
racial problem.
</P>
<P>
"Racial tensions are a major problem in the states in which the
burnings took place," Mary Frances Berry, the commission's
chairwoman, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"The church burnings are reflective of increased racial
tensions in America," said Bobby Doctor, the commission's southern
regional director.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights commission officials said they are sending letters
to the governors and legislators in the six states requesting
meetings to discuss race relations.
</P>
<P>
Berry said public officials in most of the affected states have
been "less than forthcoming."
</P>
<P>
Berry acknowledged the findings by law enforcement officials
that churches with mostly white congregations also have been
burned and that only about 20 percent of the black church arsons
now solved appeared to be racially motivated. She said the fact
that a disproportionate number of black churches was involved
gives cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Justice Department and local law enforcement
officials have found no evidence that the white church arsons were
racially motivated, she said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 churches with predominantly black congregations,
mainly in Southern states, have been burned since January 1995.
Federal law enforcement officials also have investigated a number
of suspicious fires that consumed other houses of worship and
churches with majority white congregations during the same time
span. Altogether, more than 250 church fires have been
investigated.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav, Cypriot FMS Meet on Bilateral Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic held talks here Wednesday with visiting Cypriot
Foreign Minister Alekos Mihaelidis over bilateral ties and
comprehensive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Following talks, the two ministers signed a three-year program
on cooperation in the field of education and culture, which
provides conditions for more intensified contacts and exchange in
that field.
</P>
<P>
They also signed a protocol on cooperation between the two
ministries of foreign affairs for the exchange of views on a
regular basis on international issues of mutual interest,
Milutinovic told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We had an in-depth exchange of views on a broad range of
issues, placing particular attention on the further promotion of
bilateral relations and strengthening of comprehensive
cooperation," Milutinovic said after the meeting with his Cypriot
counterpart who arrived here Tuesday night for a three-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to intensify political contacts and dialogue at
all levels, including the highest one. Meanwhile, we have also
assessed that there are significant possibilities for the
promotion of economic, scientific, technical, cultural,
educational and sports cooperation between us."
</P>
<P>
"Minister Mihaelidis has informed us in detail on the current
development of the Cypriot problem and the ways to resolve it. We
have reiterated that Yugoslavia fully supports the preservation of
independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty and unity of the
republic of Cyprus," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Minister Mihaelidis, meanwhile, said relations were excellent
between the two countries which were co-founders of the Movement
of Non-aligned Countries and were bound by close friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister said the talks held and the agreements
signed during his visit to Belgrade had both a symbolic and
substantive significance.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreements signed in Belgrade were a basis
for the further strengthening of cooperation between the two
countries in all domains, economic, political, educational and
cultural.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, President of Yugoslavia's Serbian Republic
Slobodan Milosevic received the visiting Cypriot minister and
expressed satisfaction with the smooth development of relations
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Should Profit More from China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Belgian exporters should profit
more from the opportunities offered by the Chinese market, a
Belgian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and
Foreign Trade, Philippe Maystadt, made the remark at a luncheon
hosted Wednesday in Brussels by the Belgian-Chinese Economic and
Commercial Council.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that China
is only ranked 20th among Belgium's customers and represents 0.6
percent of its world export.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's balance of trade with China has shown a deficit for
the past several years. In 1995, its exports amounted to around 30
billion Belgian francs (some one billion U.S. dollars) and the
imports were hovering around 40 billion Belgian francs (some 1.33
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Maystadt, the Belgian exports to China are
dropping every year. There was a fall of 2.8 percent in 1995,
which he considered as an evolution that, according to the first
estimates, has not redressed itself in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "That is why a specific action is needed to hold on
to, and even multiply, our market shares in China." He added that
they must diversify their export offer on this "privileged"
market.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's exports to China are concentrated on electrical
machinery and equipment, chemical products, plastics and base
metal.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Belgian government has recently published
an Asia-policy document, according to guidelines of which both the
Department of Foreign Trade and the Foreign Trade Office should
focus their main attention on the emerging Asian growth markets.
</P>
<P>
"With this in mind," the deputy prime minister said, "I have
decided to grant China an envelope for State-to-State loans." He
added that these would be used to support Belgian export projects
which contribute to the development of China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, over four billion Belgian francs (about 133 million
dollars) in State loans have been granted to China, which is close
to 18 percent of all available funds. This has contributed to the
setting-up of successful joint ventures on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt also said that Belgium supports China's early
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
However, he added that China needs time to come up with a
"solid and balanced" down payment in order to obtain WTO
membership -- a down payment with specific commitment to improved
market access, intellectual property rights, public procurement
and the liberalization of trade monopolies.

<HEADLINE> British PM Reiterates His Policy on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bournemouth, England, October 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister John Major today reiterated his "wait-and-see" Europe
policy at the last Tory Party Conference before election by
saying it was essential to Britain's interests.
</P>
<P>
However, leading Euro-sceptics within the party made obvious
attempt at the conference to persuade the Prime Minister to rule
Britain out of the European Single Currency.
</P>
<P>
They believe there is a majority in the Party for what they see
as the electorally popular move of ruling Britain out of monetary
union.
</P>
<P>
Their demand, widely supported by rank-and-file activists at
the conference, produced dramatic evidence of its popularity.
There were more than 600 delegates attended fringe meetings
organized by Euro-sceptics.
</P>
<P>
In defiance of the pressure from Euro-sceptics, Major said in a
question and answer session for delegates "This is an issue that
if it were to go wrong would crack wide open the European Union."
</P>
<P>
"If it cracked it would impact on this country as well... so we
need to have our voice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Having anticipated that the single currency would be a tough
subject at the conference's agenda, the Prime Minister warned on
the eve of the gathering that it would be "silly" to have rows
over Europe at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"There's no point in pushing. We are in the negotiations and we
are staying in the negotiations, and I just hope colleagues will
accept that," he hoped.
</P>
<P>
Major said he was not prepared to sacrifice his "wait-and-see"
policy on a single currency for electoral advantage, as
Euro-sceptics opposed to a single currency and more European
integration have demanded.
</P>
<P>
Tory officials believed the question and answer session played
to Major's strengths, portraying him as an ordinary man.
</P>
<P>
They were keen to emphasis that none of the questions was
vetted in advance. "This is the Prime Minister playing to his
strengths," one official said.

<HEADLINE> UN Financial Crisis Still Precarious, Connor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- In spite of an unexpected
U.S. payment by the end of 1996, the U.N. financial crisis remains
precarious, Under-Secretary-General for Administration and
Management Joseph E. Connor said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Connor said that due to the
passage of the U.S. 1996 national budget, the United Nations will
get from the United States 100 million U.S. dollars more than
prior forecast at the end of December.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the United Nations received from U.S. 150
million U.S. dollars for peacekeeping operations last month.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects a welcome reduction, a sum of 165 million U.S.
dollars, from the position at the end of August, but it remains
far high for the financial health and viability of the
organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that by the end of the year, there would still
be a 103 million U.S. dollars deficit in the combined General Fund
-- the regular budget, the working capital fund and the special
fund. Of the total amount due on 30 September, 74 percent is owed
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the peace-keeping accounts, he said that there would be a
795 million U.S. dollars positive balance. But the United Nations
still owes 1.44 billion U.S. dollars to 81 countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States owes the world organization a little bit over
1.4 billion U.S. dollars, of which 948,910,000 U.S. dollars for
peacekeeping operations.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Accuses IRA of Betraying Ulster Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
has accused the Irish Republican Army (IRA) of betraying the
on-going Northern Ireland peace process, according to press
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Irish Parliament in Dublin today, Bruton said
that Monday's bomb attacks at a British Army base in Lisburn,
Northern Ireland has completed a "terrible triangle" of IRA
violence after bombings in London and Manchester.
</P>
<P>
"The Lisburn bombing is a cynical betrayal by the IRA of the
peace process. The IRA has completed a terrible triangle," Bruton
said.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the classic tactics of the National Socialists and
Fascists during the 1920s and 1930s," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IRA claimed responsibility for the Lisburn bombing on
Tuesday with a statement calling on the British government to
allow its political wing Sinn Fein to take part in the multi-party
talks without the precondition of disarming or calling a new
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister John Major has reportedly
ruled the Sinn Fein out of the multi-party peace talks on the
future of the Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the annual Tory party
conference on Tuesday, Major said that the IRA's actions were
"incompatible with democratic negotiations."
</P>
<P>
It was the first IRA attack in Northern Ireland for more than
two years and 31 people were injured in the double car bomb
explosions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy to Push Birth of Bosnian Political Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for European Affairs John Kornblum is departing far Bosnia
Wednesday evening to promote the establishment of Bosnia's state
institutions and make them move, U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said today.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing at the State Department, Burns said that
Kornblum was to meet the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian
government leadership to discuss the state institutions.
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be a meeting of the presidency. There needs to
be efforts to appoint a council of ministers for this government
by the end of the month," Burns said. "And Assistant Secretary
Kornblum is going out to push this process," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was a very sorry performance last weekend when
the Bosnian Serbs failed to show up in Sarajevo for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs did not send representatives to the inaugural session
of Bosnia-Herzegovina's house of representatives last Saturday for
security reasons. But Serb Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha said
on Monday the Serb authority was for the parliament of
Bosnia-Herzegovina to convene as soon as a suitable venue was
found.
</P>
<P>
Burns said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic called Kornblum
on Sunday evening that he would try to use his influence to make
sure that the Bosnian Serbs participated fully in the creation of
the new institutions and in the meetings and ceremonies meant to
create the new Bosnian state.
</P>
<P>
Burns also said that before Kornblum's arrival in Bosnia, he
will travel to London to participate in the Contact Group meeting
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The major issue is the work that we have to do to help in
building cohesion in the construction of these new national
institutions and in getting the political direction -- getting the
politicians to move in the right direction," Burns said.
