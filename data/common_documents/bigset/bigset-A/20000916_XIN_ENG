<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
Speaker Saadoun Hamadi on Saturday held talks with visiting
Japanese parliament member Ferma Kuma on means of promoting
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Hamadi reviewed the current bilateral
relations and briefed the former Japanese defense minister about
the miserable situation of Iraq which has been under United Nations
sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations and it is time to lift
the sanctions," he was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency
(INA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kuma expressed his understanding of Iraq's
situation as well as his sympathy with the plight of the Iraqi
people, who have been hardest hit by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He promised to explain to the Japanese government about the
harsh consequences of the sanctions after he goes back to Japan,
the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Few Japanese officials have visited Iraq in recent years.
However, bilateral trade relations have been developing steadily.
</P>
<P>
Japan, an ally of the United States which champions the
sanctions, has always been an important trade partner for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah told a business
seminar held on Saturday that his ministry has planned to import as
many as 5,000 Japanese Toyota cars in the near future.

<HEADLINE> First Arab Summit on Woman to Be Held in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are scheduled to
hold the first summit on November 18 to discuss women's role in the
Arab society, an official of the Arab League said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which will run for three days, is aimed at shedding
light on Arab women's role in addressing challenges to the Arab
countries in the new era, Azza al Ateifi, director of the Woman
Department of the Arab League told Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding such a summit also has resulted from the
fact that women have the responsibility to take part in building
Arab society to achieve a sustained social and economic
development, al Ateifi added.
</P>
<P>
It is also to highlight the leading role played by the mass
media in facing up to challenges of globalization, communications
revolution and the media's impact on woman and Arab identity and
culture, the official of the pan-Arab forum said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to be held under the auspices of Suzanne Mubarak,
wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and the league's
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, al Ateifi said.

"The products that will be on display are part of a list of 41
products exempted from the sanctions on Iraq. These are food

<HEADLINE> Electromagnetic Waves Could Have Downed EgyptAir Plane: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Transport
and Civil Aviation Ibrahim el-Demiri said on Saturday that he did
not rule out the possibility that EgyptAir Flight 990 was downed
last year by electromagnetic interference.
</P>
<P>
Electromagnetic waves could have confused the computer of the
Boeing 767, leading to the crash of the plane, el-Demiri said.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic off the United
States coast shortly after taking off from New York airport on
October 31, killing all 217 people on board. Egyptian and U.S.
investigators released a factual report last month without giving
the cause of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, who was commenting on a report in the New
York Review of Books magazine, said, however, the theory was
speculative, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. magazine's report said that electromagnetic
interferences by military radars in the area, over which the
EgyptAir plane was flying, could have caused the sudden shutdown of
its computerized auto pilot, the elevators and engines.
</P>
<P>
El-Demiri said Egypt is still demanding the U.S. to release
additional information on the plane's elevators, which controls the
nose up or down, and to publish radar images, which the U.S.
withheld for reasons of classified military data and might give
clues to the tragic incident.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Satisfied With Bombing Investigations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
expressed satisfaction at the pace and progress of police
investigations into last Monday's grenade attack at the opposition
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) offices in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary George Charamba said in a
statement on Saturday that sufficient progress has been made to
enable Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo to give the nation,
through the parliament, an update on the matter next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The government wishes to make it known that any acts involving
arms of war attract the full force of law and an unstinted
response from the security arms of state which stand joined by
constitutional and natural moral compulsion to get to the bottom
of such grave offenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has dismissed with absolute contempt
claims by some self-interested political quarters, including the
British government, that the police acted unlawfully and in
defiance of a High Court Order in their pursuit of available leads
on the crime.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations have been conducted on the basis of a
lawful search warrant and never breached any order from an court,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the British government is showing its colonial instinct
by meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign country and
being found heavily on the side of the unjust and the unlawful.
</P>
<P>
According to Charamba, the MDC made an urgent application to
the High Court challenging the legality of the search warrant
which the police used, and the High Court granted a provisional
consent order following agreement between the MDC lawyers and the
Attorney General's Office to argue the matter on the merits when
it comes up for hearing.
</P>
<P>
"This consent order was granted long after 16:00 o'clock (local
time) on Friday, which is when the police stopped the search on
their own accord," he explained.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Scarcity Hits Nigeria's Commercial Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Fuel scarcity arising from the
on-going strike by oil workers has hit Nigeria's commercial
capital Lagos with vehicles waiting in a long queue at petrol
stations around the city in hope of securing some of the dwindling
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which began on Tuesday following the failure to
reach an agreement over the increase of payment between oil
workers and oil companies, expanded when tanker drivers abandoned
their vehicles at fuel depots, which made the situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that oil workers were demanding a 25 percent
increase of payment to bring them into line with the minimum wage
agreed for civil service staff, but they were rejected by the oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
The running out of petrol in Lagos, the largest city in the
country with an estimated population of more than 10 million, is
beginning to bite with motorists seen on the streets carrying
containers looking for petrol.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest oil-producing country in Africa with a
daily output of more than 2 million barrels, depends upon
importation of petroleum products for domestic consumption.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Marks International Ozone Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the U.
N. Environment Program (UNEP) Saturday marked the International
Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, calling on
governments, industries, non-governmental organizations and
individual citizens to remain vigilant against the ozone-depleting
substances.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have an opportunity to focus global attention and
action on the conservation of the ozone layer, " said U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his message released here by the
UNEP on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I applaud this year's theme for International Ozone Day, 'Save
Our Sky: Protect Yourself; Protect the Ozone Layer'," he said. "It
is a reminder that the future of our planet as well as humankind
is in our hands."
</P>
<P>
Annan was speaking shortly after satellites confirmed that the
current ozone "hole" over the Antarctic is the largest ever
recorded. The hole now measures 28.3 million square kilometers,
over 1 million square kilometers larger than the previous record
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Attention must now shift from the industrialized countries,
which have led the way in lowering chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)
output, to developing countries, which must phase out CFC
emissions by 2010, the deadline agreed under the Montreal Protocol,
" Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He said "only continued compliance with the Protocol by both
developed and developing nations will ensure a complete recovery
of the ozone layer."
</P>
<P>
The thinning of the ozone layer threatens human skin, eyes and
immune systems, damages plants and animals and poses unknown
hazards to the planet's climate.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer met in China and adopted
the Beijing Declaration, reiterating their commitment to
protecting the ozone layer. They also adopted critical decisions
ensuring further financial support to help developing countries
phase out CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
"The partnership between developed countries and developing
countries must remain strong and effective so that the momentum
achieved to date will continue throughout the developing-country
phase-out that started last year," said UNEP Executive Director
Klaus Toepfer.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Frustrated passengers
continued to head home Saturday as one of the three cruise ships
seized for unpaid bills Thursday remained ashore at Canada's
Atlantic port city of Halifax.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of passengers are being flown home to the United
States under a management with U.S. investment bank Donaldson
Lufkin and Jenrette, a party involved in the dispute leading to
the arrests of the luxury ships.
</P>
<P>
One of the cruise ships, the Sea Breeze, is still under arrest
while the other two ships, the Rembrandt and the Big Red Boat II,
left Halifax early Friday, according to Canadian media.
</P>
<P>
The ships owned by Florida-based Premier Cruise Lines were
seized following a federal court order requested by several
companies, including three from Canada.
</P>
<P>
Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said the investment bank decided
to take action after receiving the word that other creditors were
planning to do the same.
</P>
<P>
The New York investment bank is the primary lender of Premier
Cruise Lines, which was reported to lose 20 million U.S. dollars
last year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sees Two Important Aspects in Effective Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said Saturday
that sanctions must be properly targeted and implemented in order
to be effective.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Ismail Cem, minister of foreign affairs
of Turkey, said one of the tools at the disposal of the United
Nations to respond to countries that violate international peace
and stability is sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, sanctions have become a prominent tool of the
United Nations collective efforts, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Effectiveness of sanctions, as we see it, has two important
aspects," the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"The first has to do with whether the sanctions applied to a
given country or area serve their intended purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This, in return, brings into question whether the sanctions
are properly targeted and whether there is universal compliance,"
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The second aspect concerns the proper implementation of
sanctions. They are invoked on the premise that the decisions
taken by the United Nations will be respected, and that all will
share the ensuing burden," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the collateral effects of the sanctions on third
states, and especially the uneven burden they place on countries
neighboring the target state, are issues that must be addressed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we also should see to it that the adverse effects of
sanctions on innocent people, especially on children, women and
the elderly, are minimized," he added.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Urges Representative, Effective U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic
said Saturday that the United Nations must carry out internal
reform, primarily of the Security Council, so as to reflect the
reality of today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Jan Kavan, minister of foreign affairs
of the Czech Republic, said only a truly representative and
effective Security Council will be able to overcome its current
impotence, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"If no remedy is found now, after the Millennium Summit, the U.
N. risks loss of credibility, and it will greatly reduce its
influence on many processes which are now shaping the world," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The role of the Security Council is irreplaceable, and its
decision-making process should respond not only to a change in the
nature of today's crises, but also to the necessary
comprehensiveness of their solutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The deliberations on the Security Council reform are still
short of bringing fruits, being effectively paralyzed by
particular interests of several states," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The new millennium has to see a new, enlarged and more
representative Security Council soon, preferably with five
additional permanent seats both for developed and developing
countries, and few more nonpermanent seats," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all member states to strengthen their efforts in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Change Law to Combat Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- With the recent signing of the
police cooperation memorandum between Greece and the United States,
Greece said Saturday that it would change its law in order to
fight the increasingly terrorism and organized crime in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Greece's daily Ethnos newspaper Saturday,
Greek Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis said the
country's Appeals Court would in future accept and hear the
terrorist cases with no jury, and at the same time, the Greek
government would adopt a witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
Chrysochoidis said that a new division to combat organized
crime would be created with departments in the capital city of
Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that specially trained guards would also be
posted nationwide.
</P>
<P>
For years, the United States has not been satisfied with the
progress made by Greece in dealing with terrorism, especially the
terrorist acts that targeted American interests in Greece.
</P>
<P>
To show its political will to handle terrorism and end the
climate of distrust that has existed between the two countries on
terrorism issues, Greece signed earlier this month in Washington
the police cooperation memorandum with the United States.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Chief Hails OPEC Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Arab oil expert
on Saturday spoke highly of the role the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plays in maintaining stable
oil markets and prices.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Aziz Al-Turki, secretary general of the Organization of
Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), said the coordination
role of OPEC has been growing in ensuring just oil prices and
stable oil markets.
</P>
<P>
The decision of Oman, Mexico and Norway to coordinate with OPEC
to adjust prices was a clear recognition of its role in maintaining
stable markets, said Al-Turki in remarks to Kuwait News Agency on
the occasion of the 40th anniversary of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
OPEC was established in September 1960, and it now has 11
members around the world.
</P>
<P>
Al-Turki said that regular meetings between OPEC and
international energy agencies to exchange opinions and information
are also a constructive factor in the field of cooperation between
producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC chief noted that the fluctuation in oil prices makes
coordination about oil production and exporting an important
matter.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members are working for the interest of OPEC and non-OPEC
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC official denied contradiction exists between the role
of OPEC and OAPEC.
</P>
<P>
OPEC countries, he said, coordinate oil production to ensure
stable prices in oil markets, while OAPEC, which was created in
1968, is mainly designed to support oil industry in member states.
</P>
<P>
Transportation, building and maintenance of oil tankers,
investment in oil projects, providing services for oil production
are among OAPEC activities, Al-Turki added.

URUMQI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) poverty relief project in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous

representative Kerstin Leitner said here today.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP official made the remarks at the end of her tour of
four towns under the aid of the project, located at the southern
end of the Taklimakan Desert.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 people from 6,350 families in the Hotan and Moyu
counties benefited from the project that received 11.6 million
yuan in loans from the UNDP and 5.7 million yuan from local
governments.
</P>

According to official statistics, these people had an average
annual income of 847 yuan in 1999, compared to 420 yuan in 1996
when the project was launched.

<P>
More than 980 families built new houses during this period.

Beneficiaries were first trained in farming, handicraft and
other areas before they were granted small loans, to ensure the
success of the project.
</P>
<P>
Ninety nine percent of the beneficiaries repaid the loans,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
"The UNDP Xinjiang project has set a good example for poverty
relief efforts in other areas," said Leitner.

ANKARA -- Turkey is considering all sorts of measures, including
a shift of office hours, in a desperate effort to save energy.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer told
reporters Friday that the coming winter would be the most
troublesome winter in many years. Last winter, Turkey experienced
frequent power and heating outages due to a shortfall in all supply
of the natural gas that runs power plants.
</P>
<P>
The government decided last week to immediately increase
electricity imports and the ministry has started talks with Georgia
and Bulgaria about importing more electricity from the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has made efforts to promote "headscarf tourism"
and the number of hotels catering to "those who prefer to live
covered lives" are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Interest in "headscarf tourism" took off five years ago after
Kaprice Hotel in Alanya in the southern Antalya province, began to
offer amenities for covered women, who who do not wish to expose
any part of themselves to men for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
Alanya Tourist Hoteliers' and Managers' Association Chairman
Huseyin Hacikadiroglu said that headscarf tourism was not harming
the regular tourist sector.
</P>
<P>
There are four new resorts open in Alanya, a Mediterranean
tourist city, catering to headscarf tourism and three of them are
five-star hotels comprising a total of 3,450 beds.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Tourism Ministry is bidding for public
relations and promotion agencies to introduce and market Turkey in
eight markets in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will promote Turkey in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria,
Moldova, former Yugoslavian republics, Latvia, Lithuania, South
Africa, Latin America, China and China's Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will receive the bids until October 16, 2000.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Ministry of Trade lifted the ban observed since
l982 on cow and beef imports from South Africa on cattle plague
fears.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry said the ban was cleared out at
the recommendations of a technical team that included experts from
the ministries of agriculture, water and trade in cooperation with
Saudi embassy in South Africa who visited Johannesburg and verified
the measures adopted to ensure the safety of meat imports from the
African country.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states had their
4,386 factories in l990 increased to 7,300 in l999 while the
investments of those firms soared 150 percent to 83 billion U.S.
dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Industrial Investment Organization said in a release that
GCC states adopted a number of programs designed to further develop
and promote its exports.
</P>
<P>
The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.

DHAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Krishi Bank (
Agriculture Bank) continued to disburse loan among slum dwellers
under the government's "Ghare Fera Karmasuchi" (Home Return
Program).
</P>
<P>
The bank at a ceremony here Saturday disbursed loans amounting
to 66 thousand U.S. dollars among 190 slum families as part of its
8th phase of the home return program.
</P>
<P>
The latest phase would facilitate 1,000 slum families to go
back to their village and earn livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, 10,450 people of 1,746 families were rehabilitated
from the city slums with a loan of 0.57 million dollars since May
1999.
</P>
<P>
"It's a humanitarian project" as part of the government's
welfare program for the poor, Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria
told the function.
</P>
<P>
The slum dwellers came to Dhaka to earn their livelihood, but
experienced miserable life in the slums within a very short period
of time, he said, adding that "we're not sending back all the slum
dwellers...only those who are interested but cannot do so for want
of money."
</P>
<P>
Kibria listed the government's welfare programs and said this
government is the first to introduce allowance for the poor
elderly people and widows.
</P>
<P>
"We've implemented all our election commitments, at least to
some extent, and are trying to implement those fully," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Party Denies Recruiting Youths for Military Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) Saturday denied that it is recruiting
youths for military training in an unspecified European country.
</P>
<P>
MDC Spokesman Learnmore Jongwe dismissed the allegation as
absolutely rubbish, saying: "We can never think of training
anyone for military purposes."
</P>
<P>
This is to "discredit MDC ahead of the 2002 presidential
elections", he said.
</P>
<P>
Jongwe said he was confident that his party would win the 2002
presidential election and had, therefore, no reason to engage in a
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
There was a widespread speculation that the police were raiding
offices of the MDC to gather information pertaining to the alleged
recruitment of youths for military training.
</P>
<P>
About 150 young people from the MDC Saturday held a
demonstration to ask the police for returning documents and
computer information confiscated from its offices on Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> International Workshop on Ozone Layer Protection Ends in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- An international workshop
designed to help China formulate a strategy to train local
officials on ozone layer protection ended in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the two-day workshop were
representatives from several United Nations (UN) organizations,
including the World Bank, the UN Environment Program, and
environmental officials from the United States, Australia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The American, Australian and Japanese officials made
presentations on their experiences in phasing out ozone depleting
substances (ODS) and related products as mandated by international
conventions to protect the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, vice director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration of China, said China needs international
cooperation in its efforts to protect ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
China is required by international conventions to cut its
production and consumption of ODS to half the level of 1999, by
January 1, 2005, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
China and other developing countries are expected to completely
phase out the use and production of ODS by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer shields humans and other living things from
harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Production and
consumption of ODS in the past few decades has caused substantial
damage to the ozone layer.

<HEADLINE> 14 Lagoons in Iran Dry up Because of Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen strategic lagoons in
Iran have dried up as a result of the severe drought that has hit
most parts of the country, an official announced here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"With these lagoons having dried up, a vast area of plant and
wildlife environment near the lagoons have been endangered," said
Hussein Serajzadeh, head of the country's lagoons protection plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that five of the lagoons are located in the northern
province of Mazandaran, which borders the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Lack of rainfall, mismanagement and waste in the use of water
resources are among the most important factors blamed for the
drying up of the lagoons, the official was quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Serajzadeh further noted that some lagoons are polluted and
threatened by soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Iran, suffering from a second consecutive summer of drought, has
had very meager rainfalls this year, and, compounded by extreme dry
weather conditions, its reserves in water reservoirs are at their
lowest in 30 years, experts say.
</P>
<P>
This year's drought, described by a United Nations assessment
report as the "worst" that has hit Iran in 30 years, has resulted
in severe damage to the country's agriculture and livestock.
</P>
<P>
Some 800,000 animals, according to the U.N. report released two
weeks ago, have already died and more than 60 percent of the rural
population may be forced to move to cities because of the lack of
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The report further pointed out that wildlife habitats are
disappearing and that aquatic life in natural ecosystems has been
seriously threatened.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane to Arrive in Iraq Next Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Russian plane will make a
direct flight from Moscow to the Iraqi capital Baghdad on September
23 to pave the way for the resumption of civil flights between the
two countries, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The INA quoted a spokesman for Russia's Vinokova Airline as
saying that some "prominent figures," as well as a delegation
representing the Russian-Iraqi Friendship Society, will arrive
aboard the plane and hold talks with the Iraqi side about resuming
regular civil flights between Moscow and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The plane will land at the newly-reopened Saddam International
Airport, in a show of support to Iraq's defiance of the United
Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin made the decision to fly
passenger planes to Iraq after his meeting with visiting Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz in July, and an Iraqi delegation
is expected to visit Moscow later this month to make the final
preparations for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia is making contacts with relevant countries to
grant permission for Russian planes to fly to Iraq through their
airspaces.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a key ally of Iraq, has been calling for an early
removal of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
One day after the Saddam International Airport was reopened on
August 18, a Russian plane landed at the airport "on a humanitarian
mission" to the sanction-stricken country. This was the first
direct flight from Moscow to Baghdad since the end of the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Russian Deputy Minister of Civil Defense and
Emergency Situations Ruslan Tsalikov, head of the visiting Russian
delegation, told reporters that his country did not ask for
permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee, but just "notified"
it.
</P>
<P>
There has been disagreement over how the U.N. sanctions apply to
passenger flights. Until recently, the practice has been that all
those wishing to fly to Iraq must inform the U.N. Sanctions
Committee in advance.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, disagreement over whether the authorization
is actually necessary. The United States and Britain say that it
is, while Russia and France say it is not.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Iraq rejects any interpretation of the U.N.
sanctions as implying an air embargo.

<HEADLINE> 86 kg Heroin, 1.3 Ton Hashish Seized in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics
Force (ANF) staff Saturday seized 86 kg heroin and 1.3 tons of
hashish in their biggest haul of the year after arresting a five-
member gang, official said.
</P>
<P>
"The narcotics smugglers have confessed that they wanted to
send the consignment to Holland," ANF Chief of Punjab Province
Riazullah Chib told a press conference in Lahore, the provincial
capital, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Chib said that the ANF had got a tip-off about the movement of
the car carrying consignment to Lahore and intercepted it. The car
contained 61 kg heroin concealed in the its cavities.
</P>
<P>
On the pointation of the car driver, two pick-ups and a truck
were spotted on Islamabad-Lahore road after passing Gujranwala,
some 70 kilometers north of Lahore, and the remaining quantity of
narcotics was recovered.
</P>
<P>
All the vehicles were from Peshawar, capital of Northwest
Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan, a major poppy production
country. Five people in the vehicles were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Responding to another query, Chib said that 100 percent of
heroin was smuggled into Pakistan from Afghanistan as the Pak-
Afghan border was very porous.
</P>
<P>
He said that ANF had been very strict in case of the flights
bound for Bangkok, Abu Dhabi and Duai.

<HEADLINE> 2.8 Billion People Live in Poverty: WB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- About 2.8 billion people,
almost half the world's population, are living on less than two U.
S. dollars a day, and of these people 1.2 billion living on less
than one dollar a day, according to a World Bank report available
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In high-income countries, fewer than one child in 100 dies
before reaching 5 years old, while in the poorest countries, the
number is five times higher, shows the World Development Report
2000-2001 "Attacking Poverty".
</P>
<P>
It reveals that in well-off countries, fewer than 5 percent of
children under the age of 5 are malnourished, while in poorer
countries as many as 50 percent of the children suffer from eating
too little food.
</P>
<P>
"This destitution persists even though human conditions have
improved more in the past century than in the rest of history,"
the report says, adding: "Global wealth, global connections and
technological capabilities have never been greater."
</P>
<P>
But the distribution of these gains is extraordinarily unequal,
says the report. The average income in the richest 20 countries is
37 times the average in the poorest 20, a gap that has doubled in
the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The report urges developing country governments at all levels,
donor countries, international agencies, non-government-
organizations, civil society and local communities to expand
economic opportunity for the poor, strengthen their abilities and
reduce their vulnerability to sickness, unemployment and natural
disasters.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Refutes Report on Excluding Mugabe From Investment Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Foreign Affairs,
Information and Broadcasting Ministry on Friday refuted a report
which alleged that Namibian President Sam Nujoma had excluded his
Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe from an upcoming regional
investment summit, the Namibian Press Agency has reported.
</P>
<P>
The story was false, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The story quoted an unnamed Namibian presidential aide as
saying Mugabe had been excluded from next month's regional
investment summit "for the sake of not scaring away potential
investors".
</P>
<P>
The annual Southern Africa Investment Summit is to take place
in Windhoek from October 9 to 11.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the story was misleading and had caused
serious diplomatic embarrassment to the Nujoma's office and the
Namibian government.
</P>
<P>
The article, which appeared in newspapers in Southern Africa,
had left "a bad taste" in the mouths of the Namibian government
and the organizers of the Southern African Trade and Investment
Summit, the International Herald Tribunal, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said: "It should be obvious to anyone that
President Sam Nujoma, as leader of the host country and chairman
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), would not
exclude any Southern African leader from an event organized to
benefit the region as a whole."

WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The 2000 Olympic Games opened Friday night in Sydney with
the politics of healing on parade. Australia's indigenous
Aborigines were honored in an emotional pageant. Newly independent
states debuted in the alphabetical order of nations. And athletes
from North and South Korea -- countries long joined in mutual
hostility -- marched hand-in-hand behind a single "unification"
flag.
</P>
<P>
-- The big run-up in world oil prices is taking a toll on the U.
S. economy in terms of slower growth and somewhat higher inflation,
but consumer confidence hasn't suffered and neither economists nor
government policymakers see any sign that the bigger oil bill will
tip the nation into a recession.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton met at the White House on Friday with
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Then Vice President Al
Gore took over as host and urged the adoption of the nuclear test
ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton said Friday that he did not believe Wen Ho
Lee was singled out for prosecution because he was Chinese-
American, but said he planned to talk to the attorney general
about concerns that the Los Alamos nuclear scientist was not
treated properly by prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Seven Chechen Rebels Killed in Russian Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops continued air
strikes Friday against rebels in the Chechnya Republic despite
poor weather conditions and seven militants were killed while
dozens were injured, Russian media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, federal Su-25 fighters have flown six
sorties in bad weather. An An-30 reconnaissance plane made two
raids on rebel formations and Mi-24, Mi-8, and Mi-26 armed
helicopters have also conducted about 30 missions in the south
Chechnya's Argun and Vedeno Gorges, Interfax cited the Russian
staff in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Federal mobile reconnaissance units spotted three groups of
militants and demanded artillery strikes against the bandits,
killing seven rebels and injuring many others. At least three
rebel strongholds and a cache of arms were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal land forces defused seven land mines on
roads and detained 29 people suspected of siding with the rebel
bands.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian staff as saying
that foreign mercenaries in Chechnya are planning to quit the
republic, because they are beginning to realize their operations
are dangerous and pointless.
</P>
<P>
Arab mercenaries harboring in the area of the Vedeno Gorge are
trying to cross borders into Georgia and Azerbaijan in small
groups, and then return to their native countries, said the
military.
</P>
<P>
However, ringleaders of Chechen rebels intend to hire new
mercenaries from neighboring Dagestan Republic, Karachayevo-
Cherkessia and Adygei regions to continue subversive operations,
the staff said.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior CPC official today

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Needed to Protect Ozone Layer: UNEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Further global and national
action is needed to protect the ozone layer, which is currently in
its most depleted and vulnerable state, a United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Tierney, network manager of a UNEP ozone protection
program, said the ozone layer over the Antarctic has steadily
weakened since measurements started in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Tierney made the remarks at a ceremony in Beijing, in which
eight Chinese firms pledged they will cease to produce, use,
import and export ozone depleting substances (ODS) and related
products in response to a UNEP appeal for this year's
International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises, including Shanghai Volkswagen Auto Co., Ltd.,
also vowed to promote ozone-friendly technologies and practices to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Tierney said, "the area of the Antarctic ozone hole
reached 26 million square kilometers, more than two and a half the
area of China, and covered some populated areas of the Southern
hemisphere."
</P>
<P>
"In 1999, the average size of the ozone hole was 22 million
square kilometers over the Antarctic. Similarly in the Arctic, we
have seen the ozone layer over the North Pole depleted by up to 30
percent, while ozone losses over Europe and other high latitudes
vary between 5 percent and 30 percent", said the official.
</P>
<P>
"To be clear, the ozone layer is currently in its most depleted
and vulnerable state and is not expected to return to normal until
after 2050. Even then, full recovery will not be possible unless
the Montreal Protocol and its amendments are fully implemented, "
he noted.
</P>
<P>
China has banned the use of the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) in
auto air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Tierney called on all the countries over the world to honor
their commitment to related protocol on the protection of the
ozone layer and their amendments.
</P>
<P>
Quick action is also underway to stop the export of second-hand
ODS-based refrigeration equipment to developing countries, said
the official.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Keen to Strengthen Trade Ties With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has benefited from
developing trade ties with Iraq and hopes to see the expansion of
this relationship, a visiting Malaysian minister said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Paduka Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian minister of international trade
and industry, said at the Malaysia-Iraq Business Seminar that
during the past seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
Malaysia has exported goods worth over 320 million U.S. dollars to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia has indeed benefited from the oil-for-food program,"
she said, adding that Iraq was Malaysia's 12th largest trade
partner in West Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister, heading a 70-member business delegation,
arrived in Iraq on Thursday to explore the opportunity of expanding
bilateral trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The visit has already paid dividends and a contract worth 22
million dollars was signed to export Malaysian sewing machines to
sanctions-stricken Iraq, which incurred the U.N. sanctions for its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Aziz complained that the ongoing U.N. sanctions have limited
further expansion of trade ties between the two countries, and "
Malaysia will continue to support the cause for lifting the
sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The two countries leadership also conducted frequent exchange of
visits. Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar visited Iraq in
1997, becoming the first high-ranking foreign official to visit
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Albar visited Iraq again last June and held talks with Iraqi
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz and other senior ministers. Ramadan and Aziz visited Malaysia
last year and this year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi
Salah extended his warm welcome to the Malaysian delegation and
expressed belief that the visit "will definitely strengthen the
relationship between Iraq and Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has given priority to developing trade and economic
relations with Malaysia, which he termed as a "friendly" country.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Urged not to Engage in Peso Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' Central Bank
Governor Rafael Buenaventura called on the public to refrain from
engaging in speculative trading that would only harm the peso's
position in the market.
</P>
<P>
The country's macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong despite
the recent double whammy of an oil price hike and the softening
peso, Buenaventura said on government radio over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at a 32-month-low of 45.69 pesos against a U.S.
dollar on Wednesday. It closed at 45.59 pesos to the dollar on
Friday following central bank's intervention in the market in the
past couple of days. The peso has depreciated 11 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the peso's fall to the rising prices of
petroleum products, indications that the growth target may not met,
plus the abduction of three more Malaysians by the Abu Sayyaf
group.
</P>
<P>
"Our people should remain calm. The economy continues to do
well. The kidnappings have sent wrong signals but our exports are
very strong and our overseas Filipino workers continue to remit
money here," Buenaventura said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Filipino workers, estimated at 7 million, usually
remit home around 7 billion dollars every year, a major source of
the country's foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Buenaventura said the economy would continue to post
positive growth especially with the coming Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
He said business will also pick up, as traders start to import
merchandise in time for the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully it will be an improvement. Usually this is the time
people import. Business has come back. Part of the increased
demand for dollars is due to the surge in imports. September is
the time people buy merchandise they will sell in December. The
pressure is on purchases, imports subside in October to December,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The economy, measured through the Gross Domestic Product,
posted a better-than-expected growth of 3.9 percent during the
first half of this year, compared with a 2.2 percent for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports for the first half of this year reached 166.
6 billion pesos (about 3.7 billion dollars), with semiconductors
and electronic microcircuits remaining as the country's top export
winners.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the Philippines exported 34.74 billion pesos
(about 772 million dollars) worth of semiconductors and
microcircuits, an increase of 21.1 percent over the same period
last year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Broader Approach to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Poverty reduction will
require a more comprehensive approach that directly addresses the
needs of poor people in three important areas of opportunity,
empowerment, and security, said the latest World Bank annual
report available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The World Development Report 2000-2001 "Attacking Poverty"
recommends that governments of the developing countries at all
levels, donor countries, international agencies, non-government-
organizations, civil society and local communities should be
mobilized behind three priority areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Opportunity: Expanding economic opportunity for poor people
by stimulating economic growth, making markets work better for
poor people, and working for their inclusion, particularly by
building up their assets such as land and education.
</P>
<P>
-- Empowerment: Strengthening the ability of poor people to
shape decisions that affect their lives and removing
discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity and social status.
</P>
<P>
-- Security: Reducing poor people's vulnerability to sickness,
economic shocks, crop failure, unemployment, natural disasters and
violence, and helping them cope with when such misfortunes occur.
</P>
<P>
"Advances in these areas are complementary. Each is important
in its own right, and each enhances the others," Director Nora
Lustig, who is in charge of the report, was quoted as saying by a
World Bank press release on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lustig said that these priorities can allow the poor to have
greater independence and security in their day-to-day lives.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this framework will be helpful to countries in
developing their own poverty-reduction strategies according to
their own circumstances, and there is no universal blueprint," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon "Saomai" struck South
Korea for seven hours on Saturday, killing four people and
flooding some 6,000 hectares of paddy fields.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon, which was the 14th to hit South Korea this year,
inflicted major damages in North and South Kyongsang provinces in
the southeastern part of the country, South Korean Anti-Disaster
Headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sections of numerous roads were submerged or
collapsed, while the operation of 149 passenger ships on 102 sea
routes were canceled due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The nation is estimated to have suffered losses of 20 billion
won (some 18 million U.S. dollars) due to the typhoon, according
to the anti-disaster headquarters.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, a 39,000-ton Indonesian freighter carrying
39 crewmen was stranded by Saomai while anchored in waters near
southern Pusan.
</P>
<P>
The seamen were all rescued by maritime police, but some 270
tons of oil escaped from a broken tank. It is expected that
pollution from the oil spill will cause a multitude of
environmental problems.

SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Romanian weightlifters will be
allowed to remain at the Sydney Olympic Games despite that they

</P>
<P>
Romania's Olympic team deputy chief Cucu Predescu said Saturday:
"the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) notified us that
Romanian weightlifters will be banned from international

Party, the country's political system and the socialist cause, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zeng, the supervision of government officials
should be stepped up in several levels, namely, self-supervision
by officials, supervision by their superiors, the masses, the
auditing and organization departments, as well as cross-
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the organization departments of provinces,
ministries and the armed forces attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Pledge to Contribute to Ozone Layer Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Eight Chinese firms pledged
today they will cease to produce, use, import and export any ozone
depleting substances (ODS) and related products in response to a
United Nations appeal to protect the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
On the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone
Layer today, the enterprises, including Shanghai Volkswagen Auto
Co., Ltd., vowed to promote ozone-friendly technologies and
practices to other companies.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the enterprises signed the agreement at a
ceremony observed by officials from the State Environmental
Protection Administration of China, the World Bank, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) as well as environmental officials from the Untied
States, Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Twelve other industrial firms are planning to phase out the use
and production of the ODS, including the Haier Group Co., China's
leading household electronics producer, who also launched an
initiative calling on other Chinese enterprises to commit
themselves to the move.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by UNEP to raise the awareness of
industrial enterprises to protect the ozone layer, which shields
mankind and other living things on Earth from harmful ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
The production and consumption of ODS in the past several
decades have caused substantial damage to the ozone layer, as each
of the ozone layer holes over the Antarctic and Arctic has
exceeded 20 million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the signing ceremony was Geoffey Tierney,
an official with UNEP, who spoke highly of China's progress in
cutting ODS production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
"China has not only reached the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)
production and consumption freeze targets in 1999, but has also
exceeded the control schedules mandated in the Montreal Protocol
by, for example, reducing its halon consumption and production
below the required levels," he said.

<HEADLINE> EDS: Updates with developments in Basilan, reaction Philippine Military Bombs Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Abu Sayyaf rebels from the
southern province of Sulu who eluded a naval blockade and air
strike by the military Sunday morning are reportedly trying to
seek refuge in neighboring Basilan province.
</P>
<P>
An encounter between suspected Abu Sayyaf rebels and army
troops erupted in Basilan province shortly before 1:00 p.m.
Saturday, the ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an army commander as saying that two suspected rebels
were killed in the encounter in Tipo Tipo town, Basilan, and
government troops are now in pursuit of the extremist group.
</P>
<P>
The military Saturday launched a pre-dawn assault against Abu
Sayyaf rebels on the island of Jolo, Sulu, to rescue 19 hostages--
one American, two French journalists, three Malaysians and 16
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf kidnapped 21 hostages from Malaysia's resort
island of Sipadan on April 23 and later brought them to Jolo. The
rebels have so far released 20 of them, but at the same time taken
more hostages.
</P>
<P>
The latest hostage-taking occurred last Sunday when Abu Sayyaf
rebels seized three Malaysians from another Malaysian resort
island, island Pandanan off Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Fight-bombers and helicopter gunships are used in the
operations on Jolo, which are still on going.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there are no reports on casualties or on the fate of
the 19 hostages. The military is said to have staged a news
blackout.
</P>
<P>
Saying "enough is enough," Philippine President Joseph Estrada
announced Saturday afternoon that he ordered the military
operations.
</P>
<P>
The president said he ordered military operations with the
conviction that an overwhelming majority of the people of the
country support a military solution.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the military operations, Malaysia expressed its
concern over the safety of the three Malaysians kidnapped by the
Abu Sayyaf, according to the ABS-CBN.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
reportedly said it is the Philippines' prerogative to mount a
military rescue bid for hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"I am only concerned for the safety of the three Malaysians who
have been abducted by the Abu Sayyaf," said Badawi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France said it disagrees with the Philippine
government's decision to attack the Abu Sayyaf rebels and would
hold Manila responsible for two French hostages should anything
happen to them, the ABS-CBN said, quoting a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
A statement from French President Jacques Chirac's office said
he had been trying unsuccessfully to reach President Estrada, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has denied any involvement in the operations.
U.S Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon was quoted by Reuters
as saying "We are not participating in this in anyway."
</P>
<P>
Bacon, who travelled with Defense Secretary William Cohen on a
trip to Manila Friday, said his country did not try to intervene
in Manila's decision to attack the Abu Sayyaf's jungle lair in
Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Security has tightened in Zamboanga city, some 150 kilometers
northeast of Jolo, and in Basilan as well as in Jolo as the Abu
Sayyaf had threatened earlier to launch counter-attacks if the
military would launch assaults against them.

<HEADLINE> Day-1 Roundup: Nine World Records Highlight Millennium Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Although South Korea's women
triple archers shattered the first world record at the Sydney
Olympics, the swimmers stunned the world with astonishing splashes,
setting five records for a total of nine world marks to commence
the first-day competitions of the Millennium Olympic Games here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ian Thorpe first broke his own 400m freestyle record
in the evening before anchoring the hosts to crush another mark in
the men's 4x100m freestyle relay to outpace chief rivals the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
"They say the Americans have a great team unit, but I think we
have proved we are just as tough. We bring out the best in each
other," said 18-year-old Thorpe after getting two gold medals with
two world records.
</P>
<P>
Swimmers from the hosts, the United States and Ukraine smashed
five records along their way to the podium in the four finals of
the day, as Michael Klim timed 48.18 in the first lap for
Australia to beat the old mark of 48.21 set by Russian Alexander
Popov, in the 4x100m relay.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't feeling all that fresh," said Thorpe after winning
the 400m freestyle, "I was trying to get further and further ahead
so if anyone challenged me I still had enough to win. I wasn't
going to let anyone beat me at that stage."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe clocked 3:40.59 to better his own mark of 3:41.33 in the
400m freestyle, and outpaced Gary Hall of the United States in the
final lap with another world record of 3:13.67 in the 4x100m
freestyle relay, which bettered the old mark of 3:15.11 set by the
Americans five years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
However, the first swimming world record was broken by Yana
Klochkova of Ukraine in the women's 400m individual medley as she
clocked in 4:33.59 to better the timing of 4:34.79 set by China's
Chen Yan in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Klochkova, European champion and world short-course titlist,
said after her victory that "I can not believe it yet. I was not
expecting it to be this fast. I had a dream before, I was watching
myself from the outside and I was winning."
</P>
<P>
Swimming superpowers the United States, despite its relay loss
in the last seconds, also broke a world record in the women's 4x
100m freestyle relay, by clocking in 3:36.61 against the old mark
of 3:37.91 set by China in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, South Korean women archers should receive enough
salutes as they broke the first and their own world record of the
combined team event in the individual ranking round as the Korean
triple of Kim Nam-Soon, Kim Soon-Nyung and Yun Mi-jin scored 1994
points, beating the previous mark by 10 points set up at the
Atlanta Olympics four years ago.
</P>
<P>
And it was Nancy Johnson of the United States who won the first
gold medal of the Games with 497.7 points in the women's 10 air
rifle final Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The other three world marks were broken by Turkish legendary
strongman Halil Mutlu who broke his own three marks to take the
first weightlifting gold medal in the men's 56kg category.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive star, who has been unbeaten since 1995, snatched
138kg and jerked 167.5kg, winning the gold medal with a total of
305kg, beating all three previous marks of 137.5, 166.5 and 302,
set respectively in the Athens World Championships and the
European Championships in Sofia last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the women's triathlon final eventually evolved into a
disturbing ending for the hosts as Brigitte McMahon of Switzerland
stole the title from the world's top three Australians who once
dreamed of a clean sweep.
</P>
<P>
McMahon clocked two hours and 40 seconds, beating the pre-
competition favorite Michellie Jones of Australia, currently
ranked number one in the world, to a disappointing second in 2:00.
42.
</P>
<P>
"It's what I have practised when out on the track," said
McMahon, "I pictured myself winning against Michellie and today I
found myself in that position and said 'right, I'm just going to
do it.'"
</P>
<P>
The last finals of the day awarded all two judo titles to Japan
as its judokas justified their world-calibre prowess in Ippon.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia Saturday ended the U.
S. domination of the men's 4x100m freestyle relay in Olympic
swimming as they shattered two world records in one race.
</P>
<P>
The Americans had never lost 4x100 freestyle since the event
was introduced to the Tokyo Olympic Games 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Ian Thorpe, who earlier had won the 400m
individual freestyle with a world record swim, anchored Australia
to a world mark of three minutes, 13.67 seconds after Michael Klim
completed the first leg with a 100m world record.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't going for the record. I was just trying to get the
team off to a good start," Klim said. "We proved that Aussie mates
are Aussie mates. We made history."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe said: "I had a real honor to bring us home, an honor and
legacy of Australian swimming. We've built up this day as a very
special day."
</P>

<P>
Yang made the remarks after Wu Wenxiong won a bronze in the
men's 56kg category with a total of 287.5kg.
</P>
<P>
"We're comparatively weak in the 56kg because Halil Mutlu of
Turkey has dominated the division for a long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yang added that both Wu and Zhang Xiangxiang, fourth finisher
in the event, had won more than expected. "They never lifted 287.5
kg in their training. They both lifted their best results."
</P>
<P>
Zhang lifted the same weight as Wu but had to surrender the
bronze to his teammate because of heavier body weight.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that China could win a gold or silver in the men's 62
kg class on Sunday. World champion Le Maosheng will represent
China to compete in the category.
</P>
<P>
"Le enjoys some advantages in the 62kg," Yang said. "But he
could meet tough challenge from Turkey's legend Naim Suleymanoglu,
who has been widely regarded as the greatest weightlifter in
history."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai auctioned over 100
pieces of Kuan Yao Porcelain today at prices over 11 million yuan
(approximately 1.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
There were 123 pieces for the auction, with almost 100 of the
pieces being provided by Aisingiorro Qimeng, a descendant of
Emperor Daoguang of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) born in 1968.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time such a large number of Kuan Yao Porcelain
pieces were on auction in China, as the porcelain was rarely
handed down from ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Kuan Yao Porcelain was specially made for the use of emperors
of Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties. Authorities including Yang
Xin, vice curator of the Palace Museum, identified that the
porcelain pieces were all authentic.
</P>
<P>
A pair of tea cups with lids, the only one of its kind existed
in the world, were sold for 1.01 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Part of the proceeds from the auction will be donated to a
welfare program aimed at orphans sponsored by China Charity
Federation.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Ready to Confront Any Iraqi Threat: Defense Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti armed forces are
ready to confront any threat and deter any aggression from its
former occupier Iraq, a source in the Defense Ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language daily Al-Anba published Saturday quoted the
source as saying that land, sea and air forces are ready to
confront any urgent circumstances, noting that such readiness is
being exercised since the Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and occupied the much smaller
neighbor for seven months until the U.S.-led Western alliance drove
it out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The source said that "any threat by the Iraqi regime will be
facing a response by the military forces."
</P>
<P>
The remarks of the Kuwaiti defense source came after Iraqi Oil
Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil
by drilling oil wells in a desert border zone.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the Kuwaiti drilling in the joint zone was depleting
Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
Rashid, who is also an Iraqi armed forces general, even
threatened that Baghdad "will take suitable measures to guarantee
its oil wealth."
</P>
<P>
In response to the Iraqi allegations, senior Kuwaiti officials
have in the past two days blamed Iraq of trying to trigger a new
regional war.

PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Basque
militant group ETA, Ignacio Gracia Arregui, was arrested Friday
evening by French security force in southwest France, a media
report said Saturday.

<P>
Arregui, also known as "Inaki de Renteria", was arrested when
he was with his wife in an apartment in the village of Bidart in
the French Basque country.

attacks against the Spanish authorities.
</P>
<P>
ETA has killed 12 people in terrorist attacks since the end of
its truce with Madrid last December.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1955 in Renteria, Spanish Basque country, Arregui is
the highest leader of ETA and leader of its military wing since
1992, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He was believed to be the mastermind of the abortive
assassination plot in 1995 against King Juan Carlos in the island
of Palma de Majorque.

<HEADLINE> Thorpe: We Have Proved We Are Just As Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- As all four world records were
outdated in the first-day swimming competitions, Ian Thorpe of
Australia became an undisputed hero as he broke his own 400m
freestyle record before pacing the hosts to crush another mark in
the men's 4x100m freestyle relay at the Olympic Games here
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
"They say the Americans have a great team unit, but I think we
have proved we are just as tough. We bring out the best in each
other," said 18-year-old Thorpe after getting two gold medals with
two world records.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't feeling all that fresh, so I knew I had to work on
it to get as far ahead as I could," said Thorpe after winning the
400m freestyle, "I was trying to get further and further ahead so
if anyone challenged me I still had enough to win. I wasn't going
to let anyone beat me at that stage."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, 18, clocked 3:40.59 to better his own mark of 3:41.33
in the men's 400m freestyle title, and outpaced Gary Hall of the
United States in the final lap to award Australia another gold
medal with another world record of 3:13.67 in the men's 4x100m
freestyle relay, which bettered the old mark of 3:15.11 set by the
Americans five years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Chris Fydler, member of the winning relay team, said that "to
be honest, I never knew if I would get this level before I retired,
so I am pretty happy."
</P>
<P>
Michael Klim, who swam the first lap for the hosts, swam to a
world record of 48.18 to beat the old mark of 48.21 set by
Alexander Popov, pacing the way for Thorpe in the fourth and final
leg.
</P>
<P>
However, the first swimming world record was broken by Yana
Klochkova of Ukraine in the women's 400m individual medley as she
clocked in 4:33.59 to better the timing of 4:34.79 set by China's
Chen Yan in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Klochkova, also the European long-course champion and world and
European short-course champion, said after the competition that
she wasn't expecting the world record. The world record was just
her dream.
</P>
<P>
"I can not believe it yet,"she said, "I was not expecting it to
be this fast. I had a dream before, I was watching myself from the
outside and I was winning."
</P>
<P>
Being a swimming superpower, the Americans also broke a world
record in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay, by clocking in 3:36.
61 against the old mark of 3:37.91 set by China in September 1994.

<HEADLINE> Mutlu Wins Men's 56kg Weightlifting Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's legend Halil Mutlu on
Saturday won the first weightlifting gold medal in the 27th
Olympic Games from the men's 56kg category as he broke his own
three world records.
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, who has been unbeaten since 1995, snatched 138kg and
jerked 167.5kg, winning the gold medal with a total of 305.0kg and
beating all three world records of snatch, jerk and total.
</P>
<P>
The previous snatch world mark of 137.5 was set by the
diminutive star in the 1999 Athens World Championships while the
world jerk record of 166.5kg was established in the European
Championships last April in Sofia. The total world record of 302kg
was also set at last year's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"It's good feeling for myself and my country, and it's a huge
sucess to break the world records."
</P>
<P>
Ivan Ivanov of Bulgaria finished second with a total of 292.5kg
(snatch 130kg, jerk 162.5kg) and Wu Wenxiong of China took the
bronze with 287.5kg (snatch 125kg, Jerk 162.5kg).
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who jumped to stardom as early as late 1980s, said: "I
am the happiest man in the world. It was fantastic to finish
second and I feel like I have succeeded."
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, who won a gold medal from the 54kg in the Atlanta
Olympic Games in 1996, dominated the 56kg division since 1994. In
1995, Zhang Xiangxiang of China beat him on body weight.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish scored his most overwhelming victory in the 1999
World Championships when he beat silver medal winner by 20kg.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wu, 17, and Zhang, 19, lifted the same weight but Wu
won the bronze due to the advantage of light body weight.
</P>
<P>
"I twisted my right arm in the third snatch attempt, or it must
be easier in the jerk," said Wu, who was a fifth finisher in last
year's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm still young. I believe I will win the gold medal in
the next Olympics."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns U.S. Over "Armenian Genocide" Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has warned of marred U.
S.-Turkish relations if a bill that recognizes the so-called "
Armenian genocide" was cleared in the U.S. congress.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources said that Turkey has been continuing
its efforts to prevent the bill from being passed in the U.S.
Congress, Turkish Daily News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that "Turkish President Ahmet Necdet
Sezer and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem previously expressed Turkey's
concerns to their U.S. counterparts about the bill. We believe that
the U.S. administration will do what they can to block the bill."
</P>
<P>
Armenia claimed that Turkey had committed massive killings of
Armenians in April, 1915, while the country was under Ottoman
rule, pressing for an international condemnation bill against
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey denied the so-called "Armenian genocide," quoting the
number of alleged genocide victims exceeding that of the Ottoman
Empire's entire Armenian population.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has not recognized diplomatically Armenia, a newly
independent neighboring country in Caucasus following the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
It demands Christian Armenia solve its territory dispute with
Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan peacefully and end its Armenian
genocide campaign against Turkey all over the world.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Armenian lobbying groups in the United States
have intensified their campaign to get the bill passed by the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
If the bill approved, it would mandate that U.S. diplomats and
public officials be educated about the so-called Armenian genocide.
</P>
<P>
"Armenia should set aside its hostility towards Turkey and adopt
a more common sense, practical attitude. In other words, this kind
of attempt can only damage Ankara-Yerevan relations in the long
run," the same diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress started a debate on the bill over
recognizing the so-called Armenian genocide on Thursday. It is
expected to be voted next Wednesday in the House International
Relations Subcommittee on International Organizations and Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the debate, Turkey's Ambassador in Washington Baki
Ilkin had said that if the bill passed in the U.S. Congress,
Turkish-
American relations "would be damaged" and efforts to work for peace
between Turkey and Armenia would be steered towards almost certain
failure.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that "Turkey knows its history very well and
doesn't need lessons from anybody else. The so-called Armenian
genocide never occurred in history. Such attempts to push the bill
through can only cast a shadow on the Turkish-American strategic
partnership."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S administration, on the Turkey's side, has
been struggling to block the bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
Marc Grossman, former U.S. ambassador to Turkey, gave a speech
to the subcommittee on Thursday's debate and stressed that
passage of the bill could harm important U.S. interests in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that "President Clinton told Turkish President Sezer in
their meetings in New York that he opposes the resolution because
he believes it would be counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
As members of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Turkey
and the U.S. have developed close bilateral political and military
ties throughout the Cold War, the U.S.-led Gulf War and Kosovo
operation last year.
</P>
<P>
Also, Turkey plays a critical role in the U.S.-promoted Baku-
Ceyhan oil pipeline project, which aims to transfer rich Caspian
oil resources to the Western markets and curb the expansion of
influence of Russia and Iran across the Central Asia and Caucasus.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Concerned About Three Abducted Citizens' Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Saturday expressed concern for the
safety of three abducted Malaysians following a Philippine army
strike against a rebel group in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned for the safety of the three Malaysians who
were abducted by the group there," Abdullah, also Home Minister,
told reporters at a Home Ministry Family Day event here.
</P>
<P>
Three Malaysians were abducted from a dive resort on Pandanan
island off Sabah, East Malaysia, on September 10 by an armed group
and taken by boat to Jolo island in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Philippine troops, bombers and helicopter gunships reportedly
launched assaults on the rebel bases at dawn Saturday to try to
free the three Malaysians and 16 other hostages.
</P>
<P>
The latest Pandanan island incident was the second in five
months in the Sabah waters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on April 23, a total of 21 people (nine Malaysians and
12 foreigners) were kidnapped from the dive resort of Sipadan
island by the group and taken by boat to Jolo. Among them, except
for one Philippine national, the rest have been released in
batches.
</P>
<P>
Following the incidents, Malaysia has beefed up security on
islands in the Sabah waters with the military deploying a
battalion-strong complement besides patrol vessels and aircraft to
Sabah's east coast.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister confirmed Friday that the government
had ordered security forces to shoot armed intruders in the
country's waters who are suspected of planning to carry out
kidnappings, robberies and other acts.

<HEADLINE> Road Crash Kills Six People in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and 14
others seriously injured on Friday morning in a road crash
involving a mini-bus and a lorry along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 11:00 a.m. along the stretch near the
Athi River junction, some 30 kilometers in southeast of Kenya's
capital Nairobi, when the right front tyre of the sand-loaded
lorry burst and the lorry veered off towards the mini-bus and
rammed into it.
</P>
<P>
A woman, her two children and three male adults died on the
spot as the mini-bus they were traveling rolled several times off
the road. While the injured were sent to the nearby Machakos
District Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Machakos District Commissioner Hussein Dado cautioned drivers
against speeding and appealed to them to mind the welfare of their
passengers and other road users.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, last Saturday, an accident occurred
almost at the same stretch as a saloon car rammed into a lorry,
killing a man and three females on the spot.

but conceded that it was impossible to ban them in the Internet
age.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Games of the 27th Olympiad opened in Sydney on Friday by
giving the most dramatic twist yet to the latest Olympic tradition:
that the opening ceremony should produce a piece of theater far
more spectacular than anything a mere few thousand athletes are
ever likely to produce.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Telecommunications and AT&AMP;T, one of the United
States' largest telecommunications groups, are in talks about
merging two of their biggest businesses. Negotiations center on
combining the business services divisions of both companies into a
stand-alone unit, along with a separate merger of their respective
wireless businesses.
</P>

The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Just as Britain started to refuel after days of shortages,
the price of crude oil increased again Friday, leading to deep
concern that further petrol price rises could be imminent.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The Olympic oath, the pledge made by all athletes to a free
and fair Games, has been altered for the first time in 80 years to
reflect the scourge of drugs in sport. The "athlete's oath", now
includes a public commitment not to sully the Olympic ideal by
taking performance-enhancing substances.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Ian Thorpe swam to a world
record to claim the men's 400m freestyle title at the Olympic
Games here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe bettered his record of 3:41.33 to touch home first in 3:
40.59, beating Massimiliano Rosolino of Italy to second in 3:43.40
and Klete Keller of the United States to third in 3:47.00.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't feeling all that fresh, so I knew I had to work on it
to get as far ahead as I could," said Thorpe, 18, who led all the
way towards the victory, "I was trying to get further and further
ahead so if anyone challenged me I still had enough to win. I
wasn't going to let anyone beat me at that stage."
</P>
<P>
On the support he received, Thorpe said that "the response had
just been amazing. I haven't had a great preparation. I broke my
ankle, snapped the bone in half, and had the drugs controversy."
</P>
<P>
"It was great with my home team, my home crowd. Thank you
Sydney, thank you Australia, thank you everyone."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Rosolino said that "I really had a lot of fun, I
wasn't even thinking about sport. I looked around only twice."
</P>
<P>
"I trained well, I feel I could do any race at the moment. I
was making a lot of mistakes but I've improved in just the last
couple of days."
</P>
<P>
Keller said on his winning the bronze medal that "I'm more
happy than surprised. I wanted to get a medal."
</P>
<P>
"I felt tired before both my races because I was walking around
the village a lot."

SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- As all four world records were
outdated in the first-day swimming competitions, Ian Thorpe of
Australia became an undisputed hero as he broke his own 400m
freestyle record before pacing the hosts to crush another mark in
the men's 4x100m freestyle relay at the Olympic Games here
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't feeling all that fresh, so I knew I had to work on it
to get as far ahead as I could," said 18-year-old Thorpe after
winning the 400m freestyle, "I was trying to get further and
further ahead so if anyone challenged me I still had enough to win.
I wasn't going to let anyone beat me at that stage."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, 18, clocked 3:40.59 to better his own mark of 3:41.33
in the men's 400m freestyle title, and outpaced Gary Hall of the
United States in the final lap to award Australia another gold
medal with another world record of 3:13.67 in the men's 4x100m
freestyle relay, which bettered the old mark of 3:15.11 set by the
Americans five years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Michael Klim, who swam the first lap for the hosts, swam to a
world record of 48.18 to beat the old mark of 48.21 set by
Alexander Popov, pacing the way for Thorpe in the fourth and final
leg.
</P>
<P>
However, the first swimming world record was broken by Yana
Klochkova of Ukraine in the women's 400m individual medley as she
clocked in 4:33.59 to better the timing of 4:34.79 set by China's
Chen Yan in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Klochkova, also the European long-course champion and world and
European short-course champion, said after the competition that
she wasn't expecting the world record. The world record was just
her dream.
</P>
<P>
"I can not believe it yet,"she said, "I was not expecting it to
be this fast. I had a dream before, I was watching myself from the
outside and I was winning."
</P>
<P>
Being a swimming superpower, the Americans also broke a world
record in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay, by clocking in 3:36.
61 against the old mark of 3:37.91 set by China in September 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police Friday again
stormed all three offices of opposition Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC) here and seized the party's documents and computer
data suspected to be linked to Monday's grenade explosion at the
party's Fife Avenue headquarters, The Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The raid, the second of its kind in two days, took place at a
time when the police intensified investigations into the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Armed policemen forced open the glass and aluminium doors of a
MDC support center before taking documents and copying computer
hard drives. Minister of Home Affairs John Nkomo said he would
issue a statement on the police raids in Parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Similar raids by police were reported at the MDC offices along
Fife Avenue, the target of Monday night's hand grenade attack, and
the party's Sunningdale offices.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the police action, Police Spokesman Chief
Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said: "We are not commenting on
this issue... not now, not ever."
</P>
<P>
As police maintained their presence outside the opposition
party's support center in the morning, MDC youths were also
holding a vigil at the offices, having spent the night at the
center to ensure that no one would unlawfully gain entry into the
building.
</P>
<P>
The MDC, which is the country's largest opposition party with a
total of 57 seats in the parliament, said the searches violated
its rights as a political party.

</P>
<P>
The South African Minister for Transport and Communications

recently introduced its maiden flights to Jiddah, Saudi Arabic,
and Muscat, Oman.

Last week, the airline's Managing Director Richard Nyagah said
his company was set to increase its fleet by purchasing five
Boeings and leasing another five Boeings, which are scheduled to
be delivered between July 2001 and January 2003.
</P>
<P>

MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A boy was killed and two his
buddies wounded by an explosion of an artillery shell in a
settlement of the Russian republic Dagestan on Friday, the Itar-
Tass news agency said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The youngsters found the shell in a road ditch on the outskirts
of the settlement of Babayurt and the blast occurred while they
were trying to move the cannonball, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The shell was left there by a Russian military unit which was
stationed in this area during August-September, 1999, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second fatal incident caused by an explosion of an
artillery shell left since last year's Russian military operation
against Chechen rebels in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, a similar incident took place in the
settlement of Chanko of the Botlikh region of the republic,

<HEADLINE> Russia Tests New Submarine Instead of "Kursk" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia is testing a new
nuclear submarine "Gepard" (Cheetah) with most advanced
technologies on board for the Northern Fleet, which lost a nuclear-
powered sub Kursk sinking in the Barents Sea during a naval
exercise in August, Russian media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The tests are being conducted at the defense shipyard Raisa
Elimelah in the north Russian port-city of Severodvinsk bordering
the White Sea. The sub has been submitted for an examination to
the Inspectorate for Nuclear Security of the Defense Ministry, the
Itar-Tass news agency cited a spokeswoman for the ship building
enterprise as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gepard is a multi-purpose submarine of a third generation. The
submarines of this class are the least-noise-producing ones of all
Russian-made boats. It has a displacement of up to 12,770 tons, a
maximum speed of 35 knots and a dive depth of 600 meters, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The sub is to be turned over to the fleet this year, but the
ship maker is still short of 130 million rubles (about 4.6 million
U.S. dollars) to finish the construction of the vessel, she said.

The spokeswoman of the Elysee presidential palace, Catherine
Colonna, said that Chirac has tried in vain to contact his
Philippine counterpart Joseph Estrada early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Chirac then asked the French ambassador in Manilla to express
France's disapproval of the operation which could endanger the
life of the hostages, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The action also was contrary to an agreement reached by Chirac
and Estrada when they met last week in New York during the U.N.
Millennium Summit, she said.
</P>
<P>
Two French television journalists, one American, three
Malaysians and 16 Philippines have been held hostage in the island
of Jolo in the southern Philippines by the Muslim rebel group of
Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"The security of (journalists) Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and
Roland Madura is the absolute priority of France which considers
that the responsibility of the Philippines is clearly engaged in
this regard," said the spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Fishermen Call on Being Ocean Friendly (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Today is Saturday. Yet it is
the first workday for Chinese fishermen as a three-month fishing
ban in East Sea and Yellow Sea of China came to an end.
</P>
<P>
One more thing that Lin Yongfa bore in mind today when he went
out for fishing on the sea is a proposal: to be ocean-friendly is
to be human-friendly.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago Lin and 19 other fishermen from Xiangshan
County in east China's Zhejiang Province went to port cities of
Dalian, Weihai, Qingdao, Shantou, Xiamen, and Zhoushan at their
own expenses.
</P>
<P>
Not for exchanging fishing experiences, Lin and his team called
on fishermen to be ocean-friendly throughout their journey. They
even collected signatures of 17,000 fishermen from the north to
the south along the Chinese seashore.
</P>
<P>
"I have fished more than 7,000 tons of fish during the first
half of my life," said Lin, "I'll spend the rest of my life in
freeing fries into and see and protecting fish."
</P>
<P>
Lin was chosen as a representative of fishermen attending an
activity of freeing large yellow croakers fries organized lately
by Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Lin could still remember how he fished some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We worked day and night," he recalled, "we have netted so many
large yellow croakers that we hardly had place to store them."
</P>
<P>
Some fish were dried and some salted for storage. Such kind of
excessive fishing, however, led to almost extinction of the fish
in East China today.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Province Hosts Cross-Strait Economic, Trade Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 entrepreneurs from
Taiwan attended a week-long gathering from today on in Hainan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan business people were scheduled to inspect the
investment environment of Hainan and take part in negotiations for
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has provided over 150 projects worth of 20 billion yuan
for its Taiwan guests. Nearly 200 companies and enterprises from
other provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions also
participated in the week-long event.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that such people-to-people activity of
economic, trade and cultural exchanges was held across the Taiwan
Strait. The event was designed to promote cross-Strait cooperation,
especially cooperation between the two largest islands in China:
Hainan and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 1,214 enterprises have registered in
Hainan Province with a total investment of 1.3 billion U.S.
dollars from Taiwan. Hainan receives some 150,000 visitors from
Taiwan annually.

<P>
Fishermen in different areas all tried high-powered fishing
boats to net as much fish as they could, said officials with local
fishing administrative department. Fishes rarely have
opportunities to multiply.
</P>
<P>
What makes things worse is that the ocean has been taken as a
huge dumping place as wasted water and pollutant were let flow
into the ocean. Red tide was a result of pollution and reminded
people of their offspring's future.
</P>
<P>
"We would not only break the rice bowl of ourselves but also
that of our children if the bad situation continues," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Xiangshan County owns the largest non-governmental fishing team
in China -- fishermen in the county have more than 3,000 fishing
boats.
</P>
<P>
China introduced summer fishing ban in 1995 to protect fishing
resources and marine life. The ban was extended to be three months
at the suggestion of fishermen in Xiangshan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, none of Xiangshan fishermen has ever
broken the ban by going out for fishing on the sea. Some of them
voluntarily served as guards of oceanic resources. They abandoned
some fishing tools that could kill fries. Some fishermen gave up
fishing ahead of the national fishing ban. Some freed fries into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
"If all fishermen take actions now at our proposal, I'm
confident that if we are friendly to the ocean, we'll be excited
to welcome back an ocean of vital force in the near future," Lin
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Increases Quota Of Indian Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
finally decided to release a total of 3,500 tons of textile
products for export by India during the current financial year,
according to an official press release available here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move will help India shore up its foreign exchange earnings
from textile exports by an additional amount of about three
billion rupees (approximately 66 million U.S. dollars) in the year.
</P>
<P>
The release of exceptional flexibility, decided by EU at a
meeting in Brussels last Wednesday, was made possible due to the
concerted efforts by India over the past year, the release said.
</P>
<P>
India's exports include five million pieces of T-shirts, one
million pieces of jerseys and pullovers, two million pieces of
trousers and shorts, and 3.3 million pieces of ladies dresses as
well as substantial quantities of yarn and fabric.
</P>
<P>
India and EU reached an agreement last June on tariff bindings
notified by India to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding
a memorandum of understanding on textiles signed between New Delhi
and EU in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Textiles Minister Kashi Ram Rana said that the successful
settlement of tariff binding issue with EU would also result in
release of balance 4,500 tons of exceptional flexibility this year
and automatic release of 8,000 tons of these flexibility during
the remaining years till 2004, or till the end of the textile
quota regime.
</P>
<P>
The total quantity of exceptional flexibility available to
India is 8,000 tons annually worth around seven billion rupees (
about 152 million dollars), the release said.
</P>
<P>
India's ready-made garment exports during April to August this
year saw an increase of 12.09 percent in value and 9.29 percent in
quantity over the same period last year, official figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The exports to the United States involved a total quantity of
124.4 million pieces valued at 844.2 million dollars, showing an
increase of 12.38 percent in quantity and 33.49 percent in value.
</P>
<P>
To EU countries, 250.6 million pieces of garments valued at 716.
7 million were exported, representing an increase of 13.34 percent
in quantity and 6.91 percent in value.
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of the export growth during the first five
months of the current financial year which began on April 1, the
achievement was only 36.47 percent of the target of 6.5 billion
dollars set for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> EDS: Updates With President's Statement Philippine Military Bombs Abu Sayyaf-Held Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced Saturday afternoon that he ordered a pre-dawn
military assault against Abu Sayyaf rebels on the southern island
of Jolo, Sulu province, to rescue hostages held by them.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Estrada said, "Last night, In my capacity as
Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, I ordered that rescue
operations be conducted to free the 19 hostages held by the
terrorist Abu Sayyaf in various parts of Sulu."
</P>
<P>
These military operations were launched at 1 a.m. Saturday, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Abu Sayyaf rebels took to its kidnapping
activities again and seized three Malaysians from a Malaysian
resort to Jolo, putting the Philippine government in a more
embarrassing position.
</P>
<P>
They are now holding one American, two French journalists,
three newly captured Malaysians and 13 Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Military planes reportedly started bombing areas held by the
Abu Sayyaf early Saturday, and residents in Jolo town could see
warplanes flying overhead and hear the sound of bombing of Abu
Sayyaf's jungle lairs some 20 kilometers away from Jolo town.
</P>
<P>
The military operations are still going on with army
contingents continuing to pour in, the ABS-CBN TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he made this "difficult decision" to authorize the
military operations, aware of the grave risks that the hostages
and government soldiers would face.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, it has become clear that I must act and act
decisively," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has exhausted all efforts towards a
negotiated settlement of the hostage crisis for nearly five months
now, but the efforts are being "scoffed" by the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
"These criminals intend not only to continue taking hostages
but to hold our entire country hostage in a never-ending cycle of
kidnappings. They mistake our patience and tolerance for weakness,
or willingness to see our laws blatantly violated and our people
humiliated," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf kidnapped 21 hostages from Malaysia's resort
island of Sipadan on April 23 and later brought them to Jolo. The
rebels have so far released 20 of them, but at the same time taken
more hostages.
</P>
<P>
The continued kidnappings have shown to the world that "these
rebels hiding behind the cloak of religious fundamentalism are but
plain terrorists and bandits out to embarrass our government and
our armed forces," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"This situation cannot last one minute longer. Enough is enough,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president said he ordered military operations with the
conviction that an overwhelming majority of the people of the
country support a military solution.
</P>
<P>
Transportation has been cut off to Sulu province since Friday
and communications with Jolo cut off since six o'clock Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said Saturday
that his negotiating team has been de-commissioned to give way to
the military operations.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has threatened earlier to attack cities and
towns in the south if the government launches military operations
against it.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Get Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) is making arrangements for Kenya to obtain debt relief
by the end of the year, IMF senior resident representative Festus
Osunsade has disclosed here.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers Saturday quoted Osunsade as saying arrangements were
underway for Kenya within the framework of the Paris Club,
hopefully before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Osunsade said the IMF was viewing Kenya as one
of its key partners and would continue to work closely in support
of appropriate efforts to promote improved economic well-being for
the people of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
initiative, the IMF had reduced the debt burdens of 10 countries
over the past year and was aiming for another 10 by the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
Osunsade noted the move to reduce the debt burden of poor
countries represented significant progress in freeing resources
for poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The IMF statement was released just ahead of the IMF and World
Bank annual meeting to be held in Prague, the capital of Czech
Republic, next week.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo will leave for Prague this

SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Two of the United States'
strongest contenders for athletics gold medals at the Sydney
Olympic Games have more than a passing interest in weather
conditions when the track program begins at Stadium Australia.
</P>
<P>
Gold medallist in the 110m hurdles at Atlanta, Allen Johnson is
fighting to overcome a hamstring "tweak" which forced him to pull
up in race in Japan a fortnight ago and is worried the cool
conditions may slow his recovery.
</P>
<P>
"As I started to push hard in the race, I could feel the injury.
The competitor in me said keep going, but then I said 'Hey, the
Olympics are only two weeks away," he told a press conference
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"As a precaution I pulled up, and that created a bit of
negativity from some people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he was concerned the cooler conditions of Sydney
in September would lead to a tightening of his hamstring.
</P>
<P>
"The injury has affected my preparation, but we'll be
concentrating on warming up properly. I will have some soreness,
but I have the physio with me and we'll work it out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reigning pole vault world champion Stacey Dragila of the United
States said recent training on the Gold Coast in Queensland had
shown her the importance of being prepared for windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The wind shifted from a nice tail wind to a head wind, but I
stayed focused. I selected a shorter pole and got through. Pole
selection in windy conditions is very important," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dragila predicted the Olympic's inaugural women's pole vault
competition would be very exciting. She said Australia's Emma
George had not had a good season so far, but the Australians could
never be written off.

SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Russia
took the lead in the men's team qualifying event of the Sydney
Olympics Gymnastics competition with 230.133 points in this
afternoon's session.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine temporarily held the second place on 229.656 points,

<P>
Russia's dual Olympic champion Alexei Nemov had a superb day,
leading provisionally in the all-around with 58.361 points, and
other three apparatus, the hommel horse, floor and parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
Nemov also grabbed the highest individual point by now. The
defending world floor champion performed a perfect routine in his
specialty and convinced the judges to show a 9.800.
</P>
<P>
American Blaine Wilson shared the feat with Nemov by scoring a
9.800 in the vault.  Men's team gold favourite China will take
the stage tonight.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Former 5,000 Olympic champion
Dieter Baumann of Germany, who is making last efforts to take part
in the Sydney Olympic Games, on Saturday was heard by an
arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Bauman has been tested positive for banned
substances but he was later cleared by the German federation of
doping charges.
</P>
<P>
Track and field's world governing body, IAAF, sent the case to
an arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
A ruling is not expected before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Baumann, the 1992 champion over 5,000 meters in Barcelona,
tested positive for the steroid nandrolone last year.
</P>
<P>
He was suspended by the German federation while it studied the
case and was cleared earlier this summer. The federation's legal
panel ruled there had been irregularities in the collection,
storage and transport of his urine samples.
</P>
<P>
Baumann has insisted he was innocent, saying he had been the
target of an elaborate plot to discredit him. Traces of the banned
steroid were found in his toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
The runner left his team's practice camp in Brisbane to appear
before the arbitration panel.

<HEADLINE> Men's Shot Put Favorite Aims to Cap off A Great Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Adam Nelson of the United
States leads the world with the 22.12 meters at the US trials and
he is favorite for the gold medal here in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He boasted a personal best of 20.64 meters in 1999 and the
hightlight of his year was second place in the World Universiade.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, his teammate C.J. Hunter has had a less than dream
run, trying to overcome a knee injury. The defending world
champion only had one win on the Golden League circuit, that
coming in the early season absence of his heir apparent Nelson in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
Hunter tasted defeats in Brussels, Oslo, Zurich and also at the
US trials. He had an arthroscope on his left knee on September 3,
leading to his withdrawal from the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Yuriy Bilonong is considered the major threat to
Nelson, being ever the consistent performer with his glide
technique. He has repeatedly placed second to Nelson in Europe.
He did spring an upset in Monaco, where he beat Nelson ultimately
robbing the American of a share of the Golden League jackpot,
awarded to winners of five meets on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
While not quite up to the standard of his teammates, Andrew
Bloom of the United States has come credentials. He beat Nelson
at the World Universiade and showed at the US trials that he is a
clutch performer under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in sixth going into the last round, he unfurled a
personal best effort of 21.61 meters to secure his place in the
team.
</P>
<P>
An able replacement for the striken Hunter is Olympic silver
medalist and 1995 and 1997 world champion John Godina.
</P>
<P>
Others of the big men who will make their presence felt will be
Miroslav Menc of the Czech Republic, Burger Lambrechts of South
Africa and world silver medalist Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany.

<HEADLINE> Men's Marathon to Miss World's Best of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The men's marathon is lacking
Khalid Khannouchi of the United States, holder of the world's best
time of 2:05.02, who was unable to get US citizenship before the
US Olympic marathon trials.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, there will be a strong field contesting the event
in the Sydney Olympic Games with back-to-back world champion Abel
Anton of Spain in Athens and Seville in 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Anton was placed fifth at the Seoul marathon
in a time of 2:12.49, but is keen for victory in Sydney. Anton
said he would work with fellow contryman Martin Fiz in an attempt
to win Spain's first ever Olympic Games marathon.
</P>
<P>
"In Sydney, one of us has to win and one of us to lose but up
to 35 to 40 kilometers, we'll working together and helping each
other," Anton said earlir this year.
</P>
<P>
Antoni Pinto of Portugal is in excellent form, having won this
year's London marathon in 2:06.36, and would have to be considered
one of the firm favourites for the Sydney Games. In six visits to
London, he has not finished outside the top three.
</P>
<P>
The depth and quality of Kenyan marathon running was never more
evident than when the Kenyan Amateur Athletics Association decided
to change their marathon team after the coaches believed Moses
Tanui, Elijah Lagat and Japhet Kosgei "were not training to the
required standards".
</P>
<P>
They were replaced with Eric Wainana, Kennedy Cheruiyot and
Ondoro Osoro. Sadly for Osoro, he was shot in the neck by
carjackers in July and Boston marathon winner Elijah Lagat was
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Lagat, who only took up running on a doctor's advice to lose
weight, narrowly defeated Ethiopia's Gezahenge Abera in Boston.
It came down to a sprint finish, with both athletes given the same
time of 2:09.47. Abera, one of the youngesters in the field at
only 22, will be anxious to seek revenge in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Takayuki Inubushi of Japan who finished second at the 1999
Berlin marathon in 2:06.57 has one of the fastest personal bests
in the field. He also has experience on the Olympic Games course,
having run the Host City marathon in April, and is in good shape
after finishing fourth in this year's Tokyo marathon in 2:08.16
this year.
</P>
<P>
Australia's favorite son Steve Moneghetti will line up for his
fourth Olympic Games. Troubled by injuries over recent years, he
has not been in peak shape, but he is a powerful hill runner and
win a hometown advantage and the ability to lift in hte major
championships, he could be a strong medal contender.
</P>
<P>
Josia Thugwane of South Africa became the first black Olympic
champion when he won the gold medal in Atlanta in 2:12.26. He
travelled to Australia early this year to peruse the Olympic
marathon course, an indication of just how seriously he is taking
his Olympic Games preparation.
</P>
<P>
Another contender could be Lee Bong-Ju of South Korea, who took
the silver medal in Atlanta and showed his current form with
second in Tokyo in 2:07.20 earlier this year.

Chile won their first match in the Olympic men's soccer
tournament 4-1 against Morocco. Zamorano scored a hat-trick in
the match.
</P>
<P>
Spain also had an easy victory of 3-0 over South Korea. They
led 3-0 by half time but failed to add any more in the second half.
</P>

"We wanted to protect the result, because we have a lot of

<HEADLINE> Edwards is Britain's Hope for Athletics Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Jonathan Edwards is Britain's
main hope for athletics gold at the Sydney Olympic Games and he
looks set to prove he is the greatest triple jumper ever.
</P>
<P>
The world record holder of 18.29 meters and Atlanta silver
medallist leads the rankings for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games
with 17.62 meters.
</P>
<P>
If Edwards hits top form, the gold could be out of reach of his
main challengers, who include world champion Charles Friedek of
Germany, Rostislav Dimitrov of Bulgaria and Italy's Fabrizio
Donato and Paolo Camossi.
</P>
<P>
Donato, 24, improved from a pre-season best of 16.73 meters to
17.60m in June to be second on the world list going into his first
major championships. His experienced countryman Camossi, who
finished fifth at the world championships in Seville, Spain last
year, has season best of 17.45 meters, when he finished behind
Donato at the same meet in Milan.
</P>
<P>
Friedek is not a well known world champion, with his quest for
Olympic gold being overshadowed by Edwards. His season best of 17.
41 meters in June demonstrates Edwards will need to work hard for
the Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
Dimitrov is compiling a fine competitive record - he took the
bronze medal at the 1998 European Championships and silver medals
at the 1999 World Championships and 2000 European Indoor
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders include Denis Kapustin of Russia, who has won
European gold and silver, and the Cubans Michael Calvo, Yoel
Garcia, Yoelvis Quesada, although Quesada has not recently shown
the form which brought him Olympic bronze in 1996 and World
Championships gold in 1997.

<HEADLINE> European May Dominate Men's Hammer at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Strongmen from eastern
European countries have dominated the men's hammer event in recent
Olympic Games, and in Sydney they are producing seven of the top
10-ranked throwers.
</P>
<P>
Competition is very close and it could turn out to be a battle
between the experienced veterans and the young emerging titans.
</P>
<P>
The veterans include 10-times Hungarian champion Tibor Gecsek,
Vasiliy Sidorenko of Russia and Igor Astapkovich of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Astapkovich is the silver medallist from Barcelona in 1992. He
also has three other World Championship silvers in 1991, 1993 and
1995 respectively. With his best throw measuring 82.58 meters, a
gold medal looks within his reach.
</P>
<P>
Sidorenko may be the most consistent of the throwers, having
tossed over 80m every year from 1985-1998, apart from 1996; he
fell 5cm short in 1999. His season's best is 81.75m, short of his
personal best of 82.54m.
</P>
<P>
Gecsek is participating in his third Olympics, having missed
Atlanta due to a drug suspension in 1995. His recent best is 81.92
m.
</P>
<P>
Two Frenchmen, Gilles Dupray and Christopher Epalle, are also
outside chances. Epalle won the World Cup event in 2000 and has a
season's best of 81.79m.
</P>
<P>
Heading the charge of youth is Ukraine's Vladyslav Piskunov,
whose technique involves spinning fives times. He was momentarily
a World Junior Champion at 16 before being disqualified due to a
drugs offence. He came third at the 1999 World Championships in
Seville with a throw of 79.03m.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders include the 1998 World junior champion Olli-
Pekka Karjalainen of Finland, Poland's Szymon Ziolkowski and
Japan's Koji Murofushi, all of whom have been throwing
consistently in the 79-80m range this season.
</P>
<P>
Other athletes to watch include Atlanta Olympics gold medallist
Balazs Kiss of Hungary, whose form this season is not as good as
in 1999, Atlanta's silver medallist Lance Deal of the United
States and Germany's world champion Karsten Kobs, whose seasonal
bests are 79.22m, 80.35m and 80.21m respectively.

<HEADLINE> Stonger U.S. Stance on Drugs for Salt Lake City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hailing "a new era", White
House Drug Policy director Barry McCaffrey announced on Saturday
the U.S. government would provide 1.3 million US dollars towards
programs to catch drug cheats at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said the funding "reflects the government-wide
commitment of the US to protecting the integrity of sports and the
safety of athletes, young and old, amateur and elite."
</P>
<P>
Praising Australia's anti-doping leadership, he told a media
conference: "The Sydney Games have ushered in a new era for the
Olympics, an ear where victories are the product of hard work,
dedication and natural talent, not pharmacolgoy. We owe it to the
athletes to build on the successes of Sydney and raise the bar
still higher."
</P>
<P>
Young athletes must be shown that both performance-enhancing
drugs and smoking were incompatible with sport.
</P>
<P>
Appearing with McCaffrey were secretary of US Department of
Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, and the Assistant to
President for Cabinet Affairs, Thurgood Marshall, two of the three
co-chairs of the new White House Task Force on Drugs and Sports.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey confirmed that 20 "elevated samples" had been
detected in 2,045 tests conducted to date by the world-wide Anti-
Doping Agency, with the results referred to various international
federations.
</P>
<P>
He was pleased with progress to date, but said the campaign
must be pursued with urgency, because first-grade athletes felt
threatened by drug-users.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yifu was beaten in the
finals to the second place at the men's 10m air pistol of the
Sydney Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite satisfied," said the 40-year-old Chinese, a winner
at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and silver medalist in Atlanta
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Franck Dumoulin set his second Olympic record for the
day on his way to gold, with Wang took the silver and Igor
Basinsky of Belarus the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Dumoulin broke the Olympic finals record by 4.1 points, held by
Wang, with a total score of 688.9 points.
</P>
<P>
On winning the gold medal, Dumoulin said "it's hard to describe,
I feel like I've been in a boxing match and I've won with a knock-
out punch."
</P>
<P>
"I realised I had finally won in the final round when I looked
at the scoreboard," he said, "Only when I reached the final, I
realised that I had a chance."
</P>
<P>
Dumoulin and Wang both equalled the Olympic qualifying record
on Saturday morning, but the Frenchman held off Wang, eventually
triumphing by two points.
</P>
<P>
Both Wang and Dumoulin battled closely for the gold, swapping
places several times throughout the final, the turning point
coming on the eighth shot, where Dumoulin shot a 10.8 to Wang's 9.

</P>
<P>
Bronze medalist Basinsky and fourth placed Mikhail Nestrouev of

<HEADLINE> Men's 800m Showdown Looms Between Big Three in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The men's 800m of the Sydney
Olympic Games is shaping as an enthralling showdown between world
record holder Wilson Kipketer of Denmark, leading 2000 Golden
League performer Djabir Said Guerni of Algeria and 2000 world
leader Andre Bucher of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer, a three-time world champion, has had a low-key
preparation for Sydney, finishing third in his only Golden League
apperance this season, in Brussels last month behind Said Guerin
and Bucher.
</P>
<P>
However his championships and his world record make him the man
to beat at his first Olympics as the Kenyan-born runner did not
satisfy the nationality requirement in 1996, and he also boasts
seven of the top ten alltime performances over 800m.
</P>
<P>
Said Guerni, a bronze medalist at the 1999 World Championships,
has been impressive in Europe this summer with four victories,
including an impressive one minute 43.25 seconds in Brussels last
month.
</P>
<P>
Bucher has run the season's fastest time of 1:43.12 in Zurich,
and is likely to be near the lead at the 600m.
</P>
<P>
Other leading contenders include 1996 Olympic and 1999 World
Championship silver medalist Hezekiel Sepeng of South Africa,
Kenya's 1996 world junior champion japheth Kimutai and the teenage
European indoor champion with a devastating finishing kick Yuriy
Borzakovskiy of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The men's 800m has been dominated by the United States, with
eight Olympic champions, and Britain since 1896. However, neither
country has won it since 1980.
</P>
<P>
A world record has been run only five times in an Olympic men's
800m final, the last occassion being in 1976 by Cuban Alberto
Juantorena.
</P>
<P>
Only three athletes have won the Olympic men's 800m more than
once, namely Britain's Douglas Lowe in 1924 and 1928, American Mal
Whitfield in 1948 and 1952, and New Zealander Peter Snell in 1960
and 1964.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Doubell's win in Mexico City in 1968 was the most recent
by a male Australian athlete in any track event.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Basketball star Magic
Johnson dedicated a new HIV clinic in Northern California's
Oakland Friday, wishing "healthy, productive and long lives" to
local residents with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Named in his honor, the clinic will be operated by the AIDS
Healthcare Foundation (AHF), largest HIV/AIDS medical provider in
the United States serving over 4,000 patients at eight outpatient
locations in California.
</P>
<P>
AHF said in a statement that Johnson's name means hope and life
for a community devastated by AIDS. In November 1998, Alameda
County declared a state emergency in response to the
disproportionate number of HIV infections among African Americans
in and around Oakland.
</P>
<P>
The clinic provides HIV medical care to all patients regardless
of ability to pay. Speaking at the opening of the clinic, Johnson,
who long ago publicly revealed his own HIV positive status, urged
others to "tell your friends this clinic is tailor made to the
individual."
</P>
<P>
Noting that a majority of new HIV infections occur among racial
minorities, the former Los Angeles Laker said that "we don't think
AIDS applies to us." He said he hopes word would spread about the
importance of HIV testing, prevention and treatment options.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- On the first day of the Syndey
Olympic Games, the Japanese, Cuban and former Russian judoka are
ready to dominate today's lightweight bouts.
</P>
<P>
In the men's under 60kg, Tadahiro Nomura of Japan is one of the
favorites to grab the gold. The technically schooled Japanese
world champion in 1997, is ready to revenge Japan's loss at the
World Championships in Birmingham, England last year.
</P>
<P>
In England, Manolo Poulot of Cuba won the gold, but he has to
work hard to defend his world leading status. In the first round,
the judoka will meet Evgeny Stanev of Russia. The former Russian
competitors have good chances to win medals.
</P>
<P>
Nestor Khergiani of Georgia and Natik Bagirov of Belarus, both
last year's bronze medalists at the World Championships in
Birmingham, England, will be outsiders for the Olympic title, as
well as European champion Elchin Ismayilov of Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
In the women's minus 48kg division, Japan's four times world
champion Ryoko Tamura is in line to add Olympic gold to her record
in the under 48-kg category in the Exhibition Hall in the Sydney
2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Tamura won silver at the Barcelona Olympics but in Atlanta, the
24-year-old dislocated her finger, costing her the Olympic title.
</P>
<P>
Tamura's biggest challenge could be Cuban lightweight star
Amarilys Savon, last year's runner-up in the World Championships
in Birmingham, England. Savon has won four of the six A-
tournaments in which she competed this year.
</P>
<P>
Outsiders are Sarah Nichilo-Rosso of France, who was last
year's European champion and came third in Birmingham. Korean
lightweight Park Sung-Ja could surprise, together with the
talented Ann Simons of Belgium and Anna-Maria Gradante of Germany,
the bronze medalist at the last World Championships.

<HEADLINE> Project Launched to Turn Corn Fiber into Higher Valued Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The National Corn Growers
Association (NCGA) of the United States Friday announced a new two-
year research project, one of several designed to expand corn
markets and aimed at creating a commercial manufacturing process
that turns corn fiber into higher valued products.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to result in chemical feedstocks such
as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol for antifreeze and fuel
such as ethanol, said NCGA.
</P>
<P>
The investment of 2.5 million U.S. dollars would come from the
U.S. Department of Energy, the NCGA and Archer Daniels Midland (
ADM), one of the world's largest processors of oilseeds, corn and
wheat.
</P>
<P>
The only major outlet for disposal of corn fiber or bran, an
abundant by-product of the wet milling industry with the least
value among all components of the corn crop, is low-priced animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADM, making higher value products from corn
has been the driver for the development of the corn processing
industry. The company said that cooperation among the federal
government, the NCGA and industry is needed to change the U.S.
reliance on non-renewable resources to a reliance on renewable
feedstocks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy has a goal of having renewable
resources provide 10 percent of the consumer chemical feedstock
market by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The NCGA said that if plants were the feedstock for 10 percent
of the chemical market today, U.S. farm income would be more than
5 billion dollars higher.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the increased use of renewable resources in
chemical feedstocks would decrease oil imports, reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and create new industries in the U.S., a country
which produced 9.4 billion bushels or nearly 240 million tons of
corn last year.

<HEADLINE> Fathimath, Youngest Athlete at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- At just 13 years old, swimmer
Fariha Fathimath of Maldives is the youngest competitor at the
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Born on March 10, 1987, Fathimath qualifies for the minimum
Olympic age criteria which requires that an athlete must turn 14
years old by the end of the Olympic Games calendar year.
</P>
<P>
When Fathimath enters the water in heat one of the 50m
freestyle, she will be the first swimmer ever to represent her
country. Her goal is to break her own national record of 34.66
seconds.
</P>
<P>
"It's my record and I can break it. I want to swim 32 seconds.
Last week I did a 33 in training and I know I can slash another
second off," she said.
</P>
<P>
Competing in her first major international competition,
Fathimath doesn't feel any additional pressure to perform. "I'm
not nervous at all. I'm very proud and so excited that so many
people are interested in me. To represent my country is a big
thrill."
</P>
<P>
In Maldives, there no 50m pools. Accustomed to unheated 25m
pools, the tiny Fathimath says she is overwhelmed by the complex
and the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Fathimath said there is only one disadvantage of being the
youngest athlete:"Because I'm young, I'm very small and I want to
get bigger and better."
</P>
<P>
One of four athletes competing for the Maldives, Fathimath
maintains her preparation in Sydney under the guidance of former
Australian national coach Rohan Taylor. Upon learning that
Maldives could not afford to send a coach or manager for Fathimath,
he offered his assistance.
</P>
<P>
"I give her structured sessions and minor stroke corrections. I
don't want to do anything too drastic at this stage of her
preparation," said Taylor. "Correcting her dive will hopefully
make a significant difference to her race time. Speedo has also
given her a fastskin suit to enhance her performance."
</P>
<P>
Fathimath says she is well-recognized in her homeland. "I'm the
best all-round swimmer and everywhere I go, people love me," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The swimmer Fathimath most admires is Alexander Popov. She has
yet to spot him on the pool deck, but hopes to get an autograph
before heading home.
</P>
<P>
She loves her time in Sydney, but admits she misses her mother.
"The first thing I'll do when I finish my race is call her."
</P>
<P>
Fathimath hopes to compete in four more Olympic Games and
eventually win the first medal for her homeland.

<HEADLINE> To do or Die for Norway and Nigeria in Women's Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- For Norway and Nigeria,
Sunday's Olympics women's football match is a do or die event.
</P>
<P>
It's the last chance for each team, both of whom were beaten in
the opening round of Group F in the Sydney Olympic Games
competitions.
</P>
<P>
The winners form the match can live in the hope of going to the
third and final round while the losers can pack to go home.
</P>
<P>
And all indications are that it will be Nigerian team officials
who will be checking the airline schedules.
</P>
<P>
Despite brave predictions that they were capable of repeating
the gold medal success of their men's team at Atlanta, the
Nigerians came off very much second best against China, when only
a late penalty scored by Perpetua Nkwocha, put them on the score
sheet in a 3-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
Strong and athletic, Nigeria can be naive at times, and they
certainly did not have a player to match Chinese captain Sun Wen,
who scored two goals against them, despite playing at half pace
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hoegmo said his team had played
badly in the 2-0 loss to the United States and promised more power
in the Nigerian game. He was also concerned at a growing tendency
for his side to concede early goals, and conceded that Nigeria's
only hope in Sunday's contest could be to go all-out to strike
first.
</P>
<P>
But with goalkeeper Bente Nordby, one of the few Norwegian
players to come out of the game with any credit, her side needs
only to tighten its concentration in midfield to make life very
difficult for the Nigerian forwards.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador, Paris Club Agree on Debt Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador and its Paris Club
creditors, after three days of intense negotiations, Friday
reached an agreement on the rescheduling of part of the Ecuadorian
debt, according to press reports reaching here from Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club announced in a news release the agreement with
the Ecuadorian government to consolidate more than 880 million U.S.
dollars in arrears and maturities till April of 2001, which
implies an expansion of the terms of reimbursement of the debt.
</P>
<P>
The club said that the rescheduling of the debt will contribute
significantly to Ecuador's efforts of reform and adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Together with the offer of exchange of Brady bonds and euro-
debt bonds, the rescheduling "covers completely the Ecuadorian
need of financing for this year," it said.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the reimbursement of the credits to the public
assistance will be made on a period of 20 years, with a grace of
10 years, at a preferential rate of interest; the reimbursement of
the those granted by the Paris Club in commercial terms will be 18
years, with a three years' grace, at "market appropriate rates."
</P>
<P>
In addition, "in a voluntary and bilateral way, every one of
the creditors can implement operations of debt conversion into
projects of environment protection or assistance in investments or
any other forms of conversion."
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after the first revision of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Ecuador, whose gross
domestic product has plunged from 20 billion U.S. dollars to 12
billion due to two years of political chaos and economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The creditor governments also clinched "an agreement in
principle" to study a new rescheduling of Ecuador's credits coming
to maturity after April 30, 2001."

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Price Drops to 30.32 Dollars Per Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The average price of oil for
export in Venezuela stood at 30.32 U.S. dollars per barrel in the
week of September 11-15, dropping by 1.28 dollars compared with
September 4-8, the Mines and Energy Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said in a report that the average price of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) crudes basket for the same

reached 33.54 dollars per barrel -- 1.51 and 3.23 dollars less
than the prices of last week, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The average price for September was 30.92 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members agreed last Sunday to raise production by 800,000

output this year.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have been hanging far over the OPEC reference price
band of 22-28 U.S. dollars this year, raising concerns both in oil
producing and consuming countries around the world.

<HEADLINE> MaMahon Outpaces Jones for Women's Triathlon Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Brigitte McMahon of Switerland
stunned the hosts by taking the women's triathlon title at the
Syndey Olympic Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As Australia fielded in top three entries in the world for the
event, McMahon clocked two hours and 40 seconds to take the top
honour, beating the pre-competition favorite Michellie Jones of
Australia, currently ranked number one in the world, to a
disappointing second in 2:00.42. Another Swiss Magali Messmer
finished third.
</P>
<P>
Competing with the Sydney Opera House as the backdrop, the
triathlon - a 1,500m swim, a 40km cycle ride and a 10km run - is
making its debut in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
When the run began both Jones and McMahon were in a group of
five athletes who broke away from the other leaders and on the
last lap they engaged in a thrilling duel with the Australian
perched ominously on the shoulder of McMahon.
</P>
<P>
"It's what I have practised when out on the track," said
McMahon, "I pictured myself winning against Michellie and today I
found myself in that position and said 'right, I'm just going to
do it.'"
</P>
<P>
McMahon held off local favorite Jones, breaking away in the
final 200m to win by two seconds to deny the host nation a gold
medal that many thought had been a formality.
</P>
<P>
On the last lap McMahon led Jones all the way but the
Australian could not find the strength to pass her and the Swiss
athlete produced her winning surge within sight of the finishing
line.
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy with my swim I was a tailender there," said
Jones, "I stayed calm and had a great transition onto the bike."
</P>
<P>
"On the run, it got tough with about three to go, and it was
tough."
</P>
<P>
"I'm really disappointed but when you think about it, a silver
medal ain't bad," said Jones, "I'm going to try another four years
and be around for the next Olympics."

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Regulations for "Economy Houses" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting regulations
for the construction and sale of economy houses, which with low
prices and good quality, are in demand on the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
New regulations will specify the income range within which home
buyers are allowed to buy these houses. Related purchasing
procedures and re-selling methods will also be included.
</P>
<P>
China introduced economy houses in 1998 as a way to stimulate
purchasing by the majority of residents in a sluggish real estate
market.
</P>
<P>
Prices for economy houses are much lower than commercial houses
as the government provides subsidies and favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
However, at present, China has no specific regulations on the
re-selling of such houses. "The sales price of economy houses will
not be one-hundred-percent determined by market demand like
commercial houses", said an official from the Ministry of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
He urged domestic real estate developers to ensure the quality
of economy houses and avoid constructing more houses than
necessary.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Blast Probe Aimed at Military Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said the investigation into Wednesday's blast at
the Jakarta Stock Exchange building now was aimed at elements
within the Indonesian Military (TNI).
</P>
<P>
Marzuki claimed that only the military had the resources to
carry out the bombing. "Only they have the training to do that,"
Antara news agency Saturday quoted Marzuki as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has instructed Indonesian military
Commander Adm. Widodo A.S. to assist police in investigating the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki noted that based on the type of equipment used in the
bombing it was clear which parties should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
"So really the area or place in which the answer should be
searched for can already be narrowed down," he said, adding, "
There is a view (the investigation should be ) directed toward the
TNI."
</P>
<P>
The 34-story Jakarta Stock Exchange building was rocked by a
powerful explosion on Wednesday which left 15 people dead and
dozens of others injured.
</P>
<P>
A police forensics team has said the blast was caused by a bomb
containing more than one kilogram of TNT. The blast left a 60-
centimeter hole on the second level of the building's basement
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Another one-square-meter hole was found on the first floor of
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said that if evidence was found linking TNI elements to
the bombing and the investigation was then halted, then there was
something wrong within the TNI.
</P>
<P>
"If there is something wrong within the ranks of the military,
then the reforms will cease," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Police said at least nine people had been questioned in
connection to the incident, adding that the questioning focused on
gathering information about the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's blast was the fourth which took place in Jakarta,
capital of Indonesia, in the past three months, but police
investigation has not yet produced any results concerning any of
them.
</P>
<P>
However, many observers here held that the bombings were
conducted by the followers of former President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Wahid ordered the arrest of the youngest
son of Soeharto, Hutomo Mandala Putra, in relation to Wednesday's
bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said there was plenty of evidence against Hutomo over the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We will see whether this order is carried out or not," noted
the president.
</P>
<P>
However, the president's order was thrown into doubt by senior
police officers only a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
"Before we arrest anyone, we need enough evidence," said
national police spokesman Brig. Gen. Dadang Garniga.

SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Brigitte McMahon of
Switzerland defeated pre-tournament favorite Australians to win
the gold medal in the women's triathlon of the Sydney Olympic
Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Competing with the Sydney Opera House as the backdrop, McMahon
was clocked two hours and 40 seconds for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Michellie Jones took silver at 2:00.42 while Magali
Messmer, also of Switzerland, won the bronze medal at 2:01.08.
</P>
<P>
The triathlon - a 1500m swim, a 40km cycle ride and a 10km run -
is making its debut in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
When the run began both Jones and McMahon were in a group of
five athletes who broke away from the other leaders and on the
last lap they engaged in a thrilling duel with the Australian
perched ominously on the shoulder of McMahon.
</P>
<P>
But McMahon held off local favorite Jones, breaking away in the
final 200m to win by two seconds to deny the host nation a gold
medal that many thought had been a formality.
</P>
<P>
On the last lap McMahon led Jones all the way but the
Australian could not
find the strength to pass her and the Swiss athlete produced her
winning surge within sight of the finishing line.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China is joining hands with
the World Bank to develop a project of the energy-saving industry.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will use funds and technology from the World
Bank and Global Environment Fund, is aimed at introducing a new
way of financing energy-saving projects in China, and
demonstrating and popularizing their effects, today's China Daily
reports.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to help establish a new energy-saving
market-oriented mechanism, improving the efficiency of greenhouse
gases and protecting the global environment, according to sources
with the State Economic and Trade Commission which reached a
consensus with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under such a program, a variety of Energy Management Companies
(EMC) that use expenses they save from energy-efficient projects
to pay for the cost of new projects, are expected to boom
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
The EMC model is designed to provide various services to enable
enterprises to adopt energy-saving technologies and corresponding
management.
</P>
<P>
China has, since 1996, set up three joint-stock EMCs for energy-
saving projects in Beijing, Liaoning and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
To date, EMCs have succeeded in bringing 107 energy-saving
projects into effect in the fields of boilers, electrical
engineering and heating power-supplies for real-estate, with some
160 million yuan (about 19.3 million U.S. dollars) of investment.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Reservoir Area, a Geological Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A protracted field survey
shows that the Three Gorges reservoir area in Chongqing is full of
rare natural geological treasures.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir area records all major events in the world
geological history and amassed rich geological landscape, said Cui
Zhengquan, chief engineer of the Yangtze River Water Resources
Committee.
</P>
<P>
A 2.3-billion-year-old metamorphic rock system discovered at
the Three Gorges reservoir area is believed to be the earliest
rock system on earth. The folded rock stratum, which can be seen
everywhere in the reservoir area, records all tectonic movements
of the globe since its formation, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have also found in Fengjie County the largest
hopper structure and the longest suture line in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts of various sectors are calling for the
establishment of a geological museum at the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
With the water level rising at the reservoir area, the number
of archeological teams engaged in rescue excavation at the
reservoir area has increased to 55. They are working at 61 ruins
with a total area of 80,000 square meters. Over the past three
years, archeologists have unearthed more than 10,000 pieces of
cultural relics from the area.

<HEADLINE> Improving Urban Rail Transportation in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will begin
construction of its first light railway this month, a key measure
taken by the Chinese capital to ease already burdened ground
transportation and to promote economic development of the
Zhongguancun area, known as China's "Silicon Valley".
</P>
<P>
The light railway will allow residents living in the northern
suburbs of Beijing to travel with greater convenience as the new
line will be connected with the subway loop in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Cost of the 40.5-km light railway is estimated to reach 5.864
billion yuan (about 708 million U.S. dollars). The first phase of
project is scheduled to be completed by 2001, and the second phase
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Beijing first tried city rail transportation in 1965. A subway
linking western Beijing's Pingguoyuan with Beijing Railway Station
commenced operation in 1969. It was the first subway in China.
</P>
<P>
Construction began on the loop line in 1971 and it was put into
operation in 1984. The straight line starting from Pingguoyuan was
extended to Bawangfen in the east and the extended line was put
into use in June this year.
</P>
<P>
About 500 million passengers, or over 15 percent of all people
taking public transportation in Beijing, use the subway annually.
</P>
<P>
Beijing plans to start building a subway linking its southern
suburbs with its northern suburbs this year.
</P>
<P>
The urban rail transportation in Beijing is planned to consist
of 13 artery lines and two lateral lines with a total length of
408 kilometers. Half of Beijing's public passenger traffic are
expected to travel by rail when this is completed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks 4.8 Billion U.S. Dollars in CGI Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is seeking around 4.
8 billion U.S. dollars in loans from its traditional international
donors grouped under the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) to
help finance the budget deficit in 2001, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
That total will include the undisbursed portion of 4.7 billion
dollars loans pledged by CGI to Indonesia for this year,The
Jakarta Post Saturday quoted Coordinating Minister for Economy
Affairs Rizal Ramli as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Jakarta representatives of the CGI members
Friday, Rizal said Indonesia's economy is recovering, as shown by
higher-than-expected GDP growth, but still faces a number of
problems, including a weak rupiah and creeping inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said that although no specific figure was discussed, the
donors seemed to be "supportive" of the government's economic
reform programs, including a plan to develop small- and medium-
size enterprises and infrastructure in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"In general, the meeting was very productive and almost all
participants showed strong support for Indonesia's economic
recovery process," he added.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming CGI meeting will be held in Tokyo on October 17.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 2000 state budget is forecast to have a deficit of
some 53 trillion rupiah (6.24 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government will use the CGI loan, in addition to proceeds
from the privatization program and from the sale of assets under
the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, to finance the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
"The donors have expressed their support to ensure that the CGI
meeting will be successful," Rizal said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the donor representatives had
expressed some concerns, including those over the recent killing
of U.N. humanitarian workers in Atambua, West Timor.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Claims Success in Bull Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists said
Friday that they have successfully cloned a male calf from the
country's world-known Starbuck Holstein bull.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first bull to be cloned in Canada," said Roch
Landriault, spokesman for the researchers in Quebec province.
</P>
<P>
The cloned calf, named Starbuck II, was born on September 7 as
a result of partnership among the provincial Artificial
Insemination Center, the University of Montreal and Alliance
Boviteq.
</P>
<P>
The calf "possesses all of Starbuck's characteristics without
any of them having been modified during the process," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The original Starbuck had sired more than 200,000 cows and
bulls in more than 70 countries before he died at the age of 20 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Canadian scientists took some cells from the bull just one
month prior to his death.

<HEADLINE> Baumann Attends Hearing, but May not be Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Dieter Baumann of Germany
attended a hearing Saturday at the arbitration panel of the world
governing athletics body IAAF which is to decide whether he can
compete at the Sydney Olympics, but it remained a doubt whether he
will be able to address the panel.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration panel will decide whether the 1992 5,000-meters
Olympic champion Baumann is guilty of doping abuse after testing
positive twice for the steroid nandrolone at random tests last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
Baumann was cleared in Germany after convincing prosecutors and
the domestic athletics body DLV that he was the victim of a
conspiracy. He said his toothpaste had been spiked.
</P>
<P>
But the IAAF has the final say and the IAAF council in July
referred the case to its arbitration panel for a final ruling. If
found guilty of substance abuse, he faces a two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
Baumann flew to Sydney for the second time in 48 hours from his
Olympic training camp near Brisbane late Friday to join German
athletics officials on the third day of deliberations at the three-
strong IAAF panel led by Lin Kok Loh of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
So far the panel has refused to hear him and is only talking to
the DLV officials.

</P>
<P>
It was the first time Samaranch had departed the Olympic Games
before it had ended in his 20-year tenure as the president of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Should everything's going on right, he will back to Syndey
next week, and Dick Pound of Canada, the first and senior IOC vice
president, will carry out his duties in his absence," He said.
</P>
<P>
Maria Teresa Salisachs-Rowe, wife of Samaranch, is believed to
have cancer.
</P>

At the opening ceremony, Samaranch sat beside triple Olympic

SHENYANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 500,000 people have
paid visits to the September 18 Museum here, which records Japan's
invasion of China in the 1930s, since September 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The museum is located in Shenyang, capital city of northeast

</P>
<P>
On September 18, 1931, Japanese troops in northeastern China
began attacking the Chinese army and then occupied Heilongjiang,
Jilin and Liaoning provinces in northeast China. That day is
regarded as a day of humiliation among Chinese.

<P>
The museum was built and renovated on the original site of
September 18 Event. It has eight halls with historical documents,
photos and other materials on display. Visitors can use the

SYDNEY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- United States drug czar Barry
McCaffrey praised the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) for its
courageous action to combat doping in sports, the Chinese sports
delegation said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with COC vice-president Li Furong on Friday,
McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
congratulated to the COC for its bold action in support of a drug
free Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said: "By removing athletes and coaches from your Olympics
roster your nation has signaled its commitment to standing up to
this serious problem we all share."
</P>
<P>
"Over the past year the international community has made
significant progress in addressing doping in sports. The
establishment of the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) and the
initiation of 'out of competition' tests are very encouraging
signs. The government's support of WADA has been critical to the
great strides we have made," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to strengthen the cooperation with the COC in the
fight against doping.

<HEADLINE> Oman Urges Lifting of Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Oman Saturday urged
the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq, saying that they
doubtlessly have done great harm to the people of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulah,
minister of foreign affairs of Oman, said that despite all the
serious international and regional efforts to alleviate the
suffering of the Iraqi people, the general situation in the
country continues to deteriorate as a result of the economic
embargo imposed for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the regime of sanctions was intended as a
political mechanism to guarantee that governments implement their
commitments in accordance with U.N. resolutions, this mechanism
has now become a weapon that has harmed the basic rights of people
and society, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"This no doubt contradicts the letter and spirit of the
International Declaration of Human Rights. We call on the United
Nations Security Council to adopt new policies and effective
mechanisms that will relieve the suffering imposed on states such
as Iraq, Libya and Sudan," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council, with its responsibilities defined by the
Charter of the United Nations, should without doubt play a
positive and unifying role, to maintain security and stability,
under international circumstances, which the aim to develop a new
vision for economic globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanisms available to the Security Council with regard
to Iraq are no longer positive tools," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. inspectors have exerted substantial efforts to eliminate
weapons of mass destruction, and indeed destroyed known Iraqi
weapons. This could be sufficient to review once again how to end
this tragedy, and to establish new mechanisms to enable the
Security Council to continue monitoring Iraq's implementation of
relevant U.N. resolutions, alongside the lifting of economic
sanctions," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe it is justified to punish a population on
simply fear and suspicion. The Security Council should protect the
Iraqi people from the deterioration of the human environment," he
added.

<HEADLINE> IOC President Samaranch's Wife Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Maria Teresa Salisachs, wife
of International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio
Samaranch, died at the age of 68 Saturday in Barcelona in the
northeast of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Salisachs died at 15:30 local time when she was surrounded by
her children and close relatives, while her husband was traveling
in a private flight from Sydney, where he took part Friday in the
Olympic Games inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch maintained himself informed all the time about his
wife's health and had left Australia at the advise of the doctors,
who alerted the IOC president about the seriousness of Maria
Teresa's health status.
</P>
<P>
She was believed to have been suffering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
The IOC chief had earlier left Sydney to fly to her bedside -
the first time he had departed a Summer Games before it had ended
in his 20-year tenure as head of the world's biggest sports
organization.
</P>
<P>
Salisachs, known as "Bibis," had been sick for several months
although her health deteriorated in the last days.
</P>
<P>
Maria Teresa Salisachs was born in Barcelona on December 26,
1931.

<HEADLINE> Laos Urges Crucial U.N. Role in Building New Int'l Trade system </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Laos Saturday urged
the United Nations to play a crucial role in building a new
international trade system so that the developing countries can
fully benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Somsavat Lengsavad, deputy prime
minister and minister for foreign affairs of Laos, said that
globalization has unevenly imposed an impact on the development of
every country due to different degrees of development in each
nation.
</P>
<P>
While some developing economies are making use of these
increasing opportunities, a large number of developing countries
continue to be marginalized and thereby not in a position to
benefit from this process, the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the developing world continue to face
problems of access to markets, capital and technology, and many
are obliged to undertake painful structural reforms not in
conformity with their realities, causing undesirable negative
impact that impedes their integration into the world economy, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, there is a need to build a favorable
environment that would enable the developing countries to compete
in the world trading system and fully benefit from globalization,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the deputy prime minister urged the United
Nations to play a crucial role to make this happen.

<HEADLINE> Gore Leads Bush in New Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore has an advantage over his
Republican rival George W. Bush among likely voters, according to
new national and state polls released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Newsweek poll showed that Vice President Gore led Texas
Governor Bush 54 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 853 registered voters was taken on September 14-15.
Gore led Bush by nine points in a Newsweek poll conducted one week
ago.
</P>
<P>
A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll also gave Gore a 48-42 advantage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state polls showed that Gore opened significant
leads over Bush in three industrial states, Michigan, Illinois and
Pennsylvania and erased Bush's advantage in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Gore led Bush by 8 percentage points in Michigan, 45-37, and
was ahead by 15 points in Illinois, 48-33, according to the polls
by EPIC-MRA of Lansing, Michigan. He had an 18-point edge in
Pennsylvania, 51-33, among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
The surveys showed that the two candidates were virtually even
in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Pollster Ed Sarpolus of EPIC-MRA, who conducted the surveys,
said that Gore has gained momentum among the likely voters since
the national conventions of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The four state polls were taken on September 6-13. In Michigan'
s poll of 600 likely voters, there was an error margin of 4
percentage points. The polls in Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania
each covered 400 likely voters and had error margins of 5
percentage points.

<P>
The meeting, the highest portion of the conference, is attended

Opening the meeting, Canadian Minister for International
Cooperation Maria Minna announced that retired Canadian general
Romeo Dallaire is appointed special adviser to the Canadian
government on war-affected children.
</P>
<P>
Dallaire, who headed a United Nations mission to Rwanda in 1994,

massacre happened in the tiny central-east African nation.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister also pledged that the Canadian government
will increase its commitment to the UNICEF's education fund for
African children to 5 billion Canadian dollars (about 3.4 billion

<HEADLINE> FMs of China, Cuba Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan and his Cuban counterpart, Felipe Perez Roque, held a
round of official talks at the Cuban Foreign Ministry Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived in the island Saturday, told the press that
both sides exchanged opinions about issues of common concern and
reached an ample consensus on bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister expressed his high regard for the
notable results obtained by Cuba in the defense of national
dignity and state sovereignty, as well as in the reactivation of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Perez Roque expressed in his turn the gratitude of the Cuban
government to the Chinese government for the solidarity and
support received during the difficult years Cuba has gone through.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban foreign minister said that his government attaches
great importance to the role played by China in the international
scenario, as a country that represents the aspirations and rights
of the peoples of the Third World.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers signed after the talks an agreement of
academic cooperation between the Higher Institute of International
Relations of Cuba, and the Diplomatic Institute of China. They
also signed an accord of economic cooperation through which
Beijing donated Havana almost 2 million U.S. dollars for the
purchase of medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister, who visits the island for the
first time, will meet with the highest Cuban authorities and will
tour several sites of interest.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiaxuan will leave Havana Monday for Mexico City, the
second leg of his Latin America tour, which also includes Brazil
and Chile.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urges Improvement of International Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Angola Saturday said
the persistence of a climate of insecurity and instability in a
number of regions of the world cannot be attributed solely to
internal causes and it also stems from a weakness in the
international security system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Joao Bernardo De Miranda, minister for
external relations of Angola, said a reflection of this is the
deficiencies that still exist, for example, in the early warning
system and in the peacekeeping operations mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
They have not always corresponded to the desired objectives,
either because the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not sent in
a timely manner, or because at times, they are not provided with
adequate human, material and financial resources, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
At times, it is due to the ambiguity in the mission mandate
itself, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"We recognized that the effectiveness of actions in the area of
peace and international security does not depend only on United
Nations activities. It is necessary that there be renewed
commitment on the part of each and every state," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our understanding that the adoption of measures at the
national, regional and international levels should be made part of
this commitment in order to eliminate the sources of financing for
local wars," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the particular case of the African continent, the continent
most affected by the scourge of war, the illicit trade in diamonds
has been the primary source of support for wars incited by some
rebel groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another serious issue affecting international security is the
circulation and transfer of small arms that flow to areas of
conflict by way of rebel groups, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The lack of international legal instruments capable of
controlling transactions of these arms is stimulating the creation
of actual arms markets, which is leading to an increased number of
conflicts and making their solution even more difficult, he said.
</P>
<P>
This scenario is repeating itself in the world, especially in
the African continent, and for this reason, a solution is urgently
required, he stressed.

580 kilos of cocaine and detained the three occupants of a fast
boat transporting the drug in Atlantic Ocean waters, the Navy said
in a communique Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Navy bulletin said that the drug was seized near the
Caramilla island in the north of the San Andres and Providencia
archipelago in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The drug, seized on its way to the United States, has a
commercial value of some 18 million U.S. dollars, according to the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian police seized a number of postal cards alluding
the "Day of Love and Friendship," that were loaded with 94 kilos
of cocaine consigned to Europe in the El Dorado International
Airport in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
Airport police commander Fredy Wilson Novoa said that the drug
was ready to be sent in a flight to Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The cards could have gone unnoticed because they did not show
any aspect of adulteration that could make them suspicious,
according to the Caracol radio network.
